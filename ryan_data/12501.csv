"I was expecting something bigger than this when I ordered it.  This sharpener is a great, compact size that will fit in a backpack.  It measures 4"" by 2.75"" by 1.675"".  It will operate on 4 AA batteries or by USB cable.  The instructions say to do one or the other, to not use batteries while using the sharpener plugged in.The sharpener is strong enough to sharpen my husband's new colored pencil set.  This sharpener puts a very fine tip on the pencil if you want it to.  You can watch the sharpener as it cuts bits off your pencils.  Instructions say to empty it often so as not to jam up the sharpener.  The sharpener comes with an extra sharpener blade stored in the battery compartment.  It also comes with a tiny screwdriver for changing out the blades.  Don't lose the screwdriver would be my advice because the screw is very tiny.We have yet to wear out the batteries, but it is a motor, so it will use quite a bit of power to grind away at the pencils.  It's basically a standard manual pencil sharpener on a motor.  I don't know if it will overheat like some electric pencil sharpeners, my husband used it a good amount and had no problem with it overheating.This is a decent, portable, battery-operated pencil sharpener that works well as intended.*I received this electric pencil sharpener at no cost during a promotional period in exchange for this honest and unbiased review.  All opinions are my own and I am never paid.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22YH19E7O8OEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OWIFXM#wasThisHelpful","R22YH19E7O8OEB","A3FJB3JT9602QS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FJB3JT9602QS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This door stopper came this week and we've had a chance to try it out.We have a door that is farther off the ground than most.  We have struggled to find a door stopper that would work with such a high bottom.  All the ones we've tried are not high enough to make contact with the door bottom and therefore do not work.This door stopper will work with doors up to 2"" off the floor.  It is rubber and makes a good stopper.  It holds the door open well.I have given this stopper 4 stars because I like the design.  However, the black rubber is not non-marring and could make black marks on the floor if you're not careful.  It is not a problem here because the door will be open all the time, but on light colored floors it might be a problem.  I would expect these to be made from non-marring rubber.  But they are great for garage pedestrian doors and industrial locations.*I received this door stopper at no cost during a promotional period in exchange for this honest and unbiased review.

"What will they think of next?  A laptop cooler that actually cools the laptop.  Not a  pad with fans, but a strong fan that pulls the hot air out of the laptop as fast as it can make it.My husband uses a laptop on the back patio all summer long.  It gets up to 100 our there.  He needed something that would actually cool the laptop and not just blow air on the bottom of it.  He had a similar cooler, but the way it attached was not stable and he fought with it all the time.  He simply could not keep it on the laptop.  Well, with this USTEK cooler, the way it attaches works great and goes on and off with ease.The cooler is flat black.  It is no too big, at 3"" by 2.75"" by 1.25"" thick.  It comes with a ""muffler"" that really helps keep the sound down.  Although, on the highest setting, the whirring of the motor is very apparent.  But the muffler cuts the sound in half.It's very apparent by the hot air that exits the cooler muffler that the hot air is being removed quickly from the inside of the computer.  It works well and is easy to use and take on and off the laptop.  This makes it great in my husband's mind, he commented on that several times when we talked about the cooler.  He said the muffler works well and the design for attaching it to the laptop is very good.*I received this laptop cooler at a discount during a promotional period in exchange for this honest and unbiased review.

"We have a gas stove and it always seems to heat the handles of the pots and pans up more than when we had electric.  I've burned myself more times than I care to admit on the hot handles.This silicone pot and pan handle cover is a neat idea.  It has a slit in it and you just slip it over the pot handle and don't burn yourself.  It's a ""sleeve"" but has a slit, so you can accommodate different sized handles.  It offers good grip as well.  Ours is green like shown in the picture and has a texture on the outside.I have given this pot handle cover 4 stars because I like the idea and it works on some pans.  But it doesn't work with 90% of my cookware due to not accommodating the larger diameter handles.*I received this pot handle cover at no cost during a promotional period in exchange for this honest and unbiased review.

"We received this Bluetooth headset this week and we've had a chance to try it and form an opinion.This headset is fairly tiny at 2.25"" long and 5/8"" at its widest point.  It is silver and light metallic blue.  There are 3 buttons, Power, Vol Up and Vol Down.  It charges via an included USB to USB Micro charging cable.  First charge took very little time.  The light is red until fully charged and then it turns blue.Pairing this headset was very easy.  I just initiated the pairing process and located this headset and connected.  It connects automatically after initial pairing.The headset sounds good.  I was able to hear my caller and they could hear me.  One caller commented how much better I sounded than normal.  The microphone is good, but does pick up some background sounds like birds and machines.  One caller asked what I was doing when I was getting ice for my drink while talking to her.  But other than that, no one complained and I know my mother would have complained if it was noisy.This headset sounds good and is unique looking.

"This set of 72 colored pencils will be put to good use.  My husband goes through colored pencils like they are water.  He's constantly sketching and drawing.  My last few greeting cards were designed by him using colored pencils.My husband has absconded with this set of pencils and reports that they draw and color smoothly.  He has been doodling and drawing with them today and said it is great to have all the color choices in one easy to use set.  The pencils come in their own carry case.  All you need is a pencil sharpener and some paper.  My husband is going to try them in an Adult coloring book that I got him recently.  That's a coloring book with complex designs or drawings that supposedly take the skill of an adult to color.  All the colors available will make it really fun for him, I'm sure.This is a really nice set of colored pencils in their own carry case.  With so many colors, finding the right one might be challenging.  But the end result will be rewarding.

"This set of Christmas lights arrived over the weekend and we have had a chance to try them out and see them in action.The lights are fairly large, at 3.5"" tall and about 0.75"" thick.  The ornament lights are made of plastic and they are quite textured, which adds to the lighting effect of these lights.  They are almost like a cluster of jewels when the light shines through the plastic.  There are two each of 5 different ornaments; heart, bell, snowman, star, and stocking.  All the ornament lights are red and white (clear) and shine fairly brightly even in daylight.  In dim lighting they are bright and festive.Because these operate using 3 AA batteries, you can use them anywhere.  You're not limited by a power cable.  I plan to use these in a Christmas centerpiece this year and I can hide the battery pack in the red and white silk flowers I will use.  Since the lights are all LEDs, the batteries should last a long time.  These lights are either on or off.  There is no flashing, just on.  That's fine with me because I don't need a flashing centerpiece.I have given these ornament lights 5 stars because I like them.  They are cute and work pretty well.*I received this set of Christmas lights at no cost during a promotional period in exchange for this honest and unbiased review.

"I love reviewing medical needs equipment because I feel it does a service to the community.  I test items that cost quite a bit so no one has to get a lemon.  Oftentimes, the people that find themselves in need of equipment like this shower chair are on a fixed income and really can't afford to get something that doesn't work.  This chair is far from a lemon.  In fact, it's a peach.The chair comes in several pieces and must be put together.  There are picture instructions that help along the way.  Basically, you use bolts with wings on them to put the legs on.  Once you have installed the legs, you can install the back arms and then the back.  Then place the adjustable legs onto the leg parts.  In all, there are 9 bolts to install and the chair is ready for use.The chair is very sturdy but very lightweight.  Almost anyone will be able to move it around because it is so light.  It is good for a person up to 300 pounds.  I would say it is at least that sturdy.  The aluminum legs are strong and the plastic seat and back are also very sturdy.  The seat has several holes to allow water to drain.  Both the seat and back have a textured pattern in the plastic.  The seat also has a handle on each side and there is a handle for moving the chair on the chair back.This is a very comfortable shower chair that works well and is lightweight enough for most people to be able to move it.  It takes up as little room in the tub or shower as possible.  It will fit in a standard sized tub.  But it is more for a shower.*I received this shower chair at no cost in exchange for this honest and unbiased review.

"This hat came today and I've had a chance to try it out.  This is a neat hat that protects me from the sun from all directions.  I plan to wear it gardening.  I don't trust sunscreen to protect me from the sun.  I will continue to use it under the hat, but I don't trust it with my skin showing.I wear long sleeves and pants while gardening to protect me from whatever.  Now I have protection for my head, face and neck.  I don't know what SPF factor the fabric provides, but it is better than no protection at all.  The weave of the fabric is tight and appears to block at least a good portion of the sun.  The mask is great.  It has mesh where your nose and mouth are, so you won't fog up your glasses while wearing it.  That's a common complaint in our house, that masks fog up our glasses.  This one is easy to wear because it doesn't fog up my glasses.The whole hat package, the hat, the neck covering and the mask, is made well.  The stitches are good and the hat appears very sturdy.  Mind came folded over, but was easily reshaped upon removing it from the bag.  The brim looked great after some reshaping.  The hat has NZTK embroidered across the front.  I don't know what that means, must be the brand name.My husband can wear the whole get-up while he mows the yard next summer.  Mowing is about over here and the sun is not nearly as strong as it was in July and August.

"This review is for the Eudolah tank dress in red.  There are several products being offered in this one ad, so I just wanted to clarify what I ordered and what I got.I ordered the red tank dress.  I got a red tank dress that is going to be great with leggings.  I don't have the confidence to wear it out anywhere.  For one, my bum would be showing most of the time as the dress is fairly short.  Think of it as a long tank top and wear it accordingly.  Unless you're the daring type, then wear it as a dress.  Woo hoo!  Hotsy, Totsy!I had a young friend model the dress for the picture.  I wish I looked as good in it as a dress as she does.  But it does make a great tank that almost covers my bum.The dress is well made and stretches quite a bit, one way.  It stretches across but not up and down.  It will contour to your curves and be a really sexy top. The back is a cross between a T-back and a keyhole top.  It shows your shoulder blades.  I will wear this top with a T-Shirt underneath and over leggings.  I think I can make some cute outfits with it.This is a well-made dress/tank top that is form fitting and pretty sexy.  Four stars for quality.

"We've had a chance to try all of these jams.  We got Strawberry-Rhubarb, Boysenberry, and Marion Berry.  Strawberry-rhubarb is our favorite because the strawberry seeds are small and don't hurt our teeth.  The other two flavors have quite a few seeds that hurt our teeth.  All of the flavors taste excellent and the texture, aside from the seeds, is very good.  The jams all spread easily and evenly on toast.The jams come in a nice gift box.  Each jar is wrapped in bubble wrap to protect it inside the heavy gift box.  The lids are sealed well and have a paper seal that keeps the lids from turning anyway.  So none is going to come open in the package.  These are packaged well.If you like jams that contain seeds, these will make you really happy.

"This umbilical hernia belt arrived this past week and we've had a chance to try it out and form an opinion.  It is our opinion that it is well-made and works as intended.My husband had stomach surgery to remove a damaged spleen.  They did the surgery laprascopically but had to remove the spleen through an incision in the belly button.  As it healed, it became apparent that some muscle was not in the right place and there is a slight opening in the muscle that is sometimes painful for him.  This umbilical hernia belt has a belly button piece that pushes on the right place to bring my husband some relief.Dear Hubby wore this belt all weekend.  He commented several times at how good it made him feel to have the pressure on his navel.  Besides being of comfort to his belly, the belt actually makes him sit up straighter which helps his posture.  You get two uses from one belt.The belt is well-made.  The hook and loop closure works very well and is secure.  There is a large strip of the hooks and the whole body of the belt is made of the loops fabric.  We got XS/M size for my husband who has a 33"" waist and it is perfectly sized for him.We're happy with this umbilical hernia support belt and my husband has found great relief in wearing it.

"This Aukey Bluetooth speaker arrived this past week and we've had a chance to try it and form an opinion.  It is our opinion that this is a very good speaker that plays loud and sounds good.This speaker is 7.75"" by 2.5"" by 2.25"" deep.  It is covered in a black, silicone shell that protects it from drops.  We tried dropping from counter height onto a tile floor and there was no damage whatsoever.  It is a very sturdy package.  There is a large loop on one end and the speaker comes with a small carbiner hook from which to hook it.The top of the speaker has 3 buttons, Phone, Play/Pause, and Volume up/down/next track.  On the back you'll find a dedicated power slider switch.  As well, there are Line IN and Line OUT jacks and the USB charging port.The speaker sounds really good.  I was surprised at all the sound, the bass was great and did not wash out the mids and highs.  It really sounded great.  I listened to several genre of music and an audio book and everything sounded very good through this speaker.  I connected easily to my phone with the Bluetooth.  Just turn on the speaker, start pairing on your device, and look for the Aukey speaker to show up and pair.  It will connect automatically after the initial pairing.  It was very easy to pair.But, besides Bluetooth, you can connect via 3.5mm cable to any device with a 3.5mm headphone output even if it doesn't have Bluetooth.  The AUX out jack allows you to connect another speaker for double speaker sound.This is a very cool speaker that works well and sounds good.  It has become my everyday speaker for work.

"If you play music, you may often need to use a music stand. Many times you have to use a music stand in less than desirable lighting. Such as in near darkness. It's tough to see the notes with no light.That's where this really cool music stand light comes in handy. It clips onto any surface with a special clamp that is very secure anywhere you clip it. The clip opens to about 1.25"" so you can clip onto wooden music stands as easily as a metal stand. The lights are multi-directional and can be adjusted however works best for you. The way the lights are designed, they just put light where you want it without giving off a lot of other light. So you can use the lights anywhere you need extra light.The lights will operate 3 ways. With 3 AAA batteries, a USB cable or a USB to AC/DC power adapter. There are two brightness levels. The switch for each of the two lights is on the light head on the top.

"The Luseta Argan Oil Shampoo & Conditioner Set comes in a size of 16.9 oz (500 ml) each. The shampoo and conditioner both have a nice flowery  scent, and both have a milk white, gel-like consistency. The flowery scent is delicious and very pleasant. It's just enough for you to notice it when using it, and the scent rinses off nicely. I especially like the clean sensation on the scalp and smooth feeling on the hair after shampooing and conditioning. It just makes the daily routine much more enjoyable.The shampoo lathers well and I did not need to use much to wash my long hair. I feel the conditioner does a good job nourishing and hydrating my hair. It helps to soften the straw like rough texture of my hair. I enjoy mostly the weightless and clean feel on my scalp and hair.

" 1:41 MinsThis expanding hose arrived this past week and we have had a chance to test it over the weekend.The hose is about 25' long when you pull it out of the package.  It hardly weighs anything.  It is covered with  jacket, probably nylon.  Both ends have very nice brass fittings.  The business end has a brass fitting with on/off valve.  I found that valve was stuck closed when I first attempted to turn the hose on.  It just needed a bit more turning and Whoosh!  I was sprayed up the sleeve with water!  Lesson?  Operate the valve a couple of times before you fill the hose with water.The hose went on the hose bib with no problems.  I stretched out the hose to its full length and I turned on the water and the hose began to expand.  It is really neat to watch it expand.  It gets up to the 75' length very quickly.  You can put a spray nozzle on it and it will spray and still keep its length.Once you turn off the water supply and open the end of the hose to let the pressure out, the hose goes back to 25' long again.  It's really cool how well it works.  Once the water pressure is off, you can coil up the hose on the ground or a hose hanger.  Just remember to bring it in during the winter freeze months.This is a really cool hose that really works as expected.  No more need for a 75' rubber hose with hose reel.  Just a light hanger on the side of the house and you're good to go.*I received this expanding hose at no cost during a promotional period in exchange for this honest and unbiased review.

"This tactical survival knife arrived this past week and my husband has had a chance to check it out and form an opinion.  It's our opinion that this is a decent knife for use in many situations.First of all, it has a seat belt cutter and a window breaking point.  It's heavy enough to be up to the task of breaking a window, even under water.  It's a substantial knife package.  The other items of mention are the mini-flashlight and the magnesium fire starting tool.  We were impressed with the amount of light that the mini-flashlight gives off.  The fire starter sparked with no problem using the serrated part of the blade.  We could not get it to spark using the corner edge of the back of the blade, it wasn't sharp enough.The actual blade is very decent.  It's half smooth edge and half serrated.  The serrated edge is really sharp as is the smooth edge.  It's easy to flip out the blade using the thumb, one-handed.This is a decent survival knife package.  It also comes with a nylon carrying pouch that has a belt loop for belt wear.*I received this knife at a discount during a promotional period in exchange for this honest and unbiased review.

"This handy little light may gross you out. Let me explain.  This light will expose urine and other bodily fluids wherever they might be.  On a hotel bed, in your bathroom, around the house looking for pet stains.  You know, you smell that odor that is unmistakable but you can't find the location.  Now you can find the location and clean it up.  Cleaning up the mess can help to prevent further going in that spot by your pet.  Once you clean it up with a good pet stain remover, you can let it dry and check again with the light to make sure you got it all.This light takes 3 AAA batteries.  I used a store brand of alkaline batteries and they worked well.  You put the batteries into a cradle and slide the cradle into the light housing.  Then you screw the waterproof cap onto the light.The light is easy to use, you don't need any special glasses to make it work.  A dimly lit room does help though.  You will have trouble using it if the room is too bright.  But it just has to be dimly lit, not dark for it to work well.  You can use it inside during daylight hours.We are pleased with the build and operation of this UV light.  It is also fun to look at my husband's glass collection, some of his pieces glow with this light.  Take it with you when antique hunting to find special glass that glows.  It certainly finds urine in places you didn't realize there would be that much.  Like around the toilet if you have men or boys in the house.  Yuck!  Not for the squeamish.  I got ours all cleaned up though.  With the light it's easy to see where to concentrate the cleaning.*I received this UV pet urine finder light at no cost during a promotional period in exchange for this honest and unbiased review.

"Published in January of 2008 by Macmillan AudioRead by John Bedford LLoydDuration: 11 hours, 58 minutesUnabridgedThe first C.J. Box book to make it to publication that did not feature Joe Pickett, Blue Heaven is set in north Idaho. The story can easily be classified as a modern version of a classic western story.The story starts with a highly respected local rancher, a lifelong resident of the area, who is in danger of losing his beloved ranch to the bank. Newcomers, including an especially large number of retired police officers from Los Angeles, are moving in and local realtors want to take advantage of his financial troubles and turn his ranch into a series of McMansions with mini ranches so that the new residents can play at being cowboy.Meanwhile, two kids get mad at their mom and decide to take her boyfriend's expensive fishing equipment out for a fishing trip that he promised to take him on but ""forgot"" about. Before they even get to their fishing hole they stumble across a group of older men in a campground who surround a member of their group and shoot him with pistols. The kids run and are pursued but are not caught.From this point the book becomes a race against time - will the children get caught before enough police and volunteers flood the area and find them? But, if they are found, can their rescuers actually be trusted?Of course, the stories of the children and the rancher do intersect and when they do a lot of deeper themes come to play such as old ways versus new ways, city vs. rural and commitment to family and justice.This is a good story, but needlessly over-complicated and overly-populated. There are a couple of dozen characters, many of them taking a stint as the lead for at least a chapter or two. It is fairly difficult to juggle that many characters when you are reading the book and it is even more challenging to do so when you are listening to it as an audiobook.Luckily, the book was read by John Bedford Lloyd, a talented reader who was able to create a number of accents and cadences that were distinct enough that I was able to keep up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V3BFU7GMOS6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012FK1QA#wasThisHelpful","R3V3BFU7GMOS6A","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Micro USB cables. 5 years ago I had just one cable - it charged my 2nd generation Kindle. Now, I am charging all sorts of stuff all over the place with them. They have gone from a curiosity to a necessity.Sadly, the ones provided by the manufacturers to charge Bluetooth headsets or portable speakers are often very flimsy and in my household we have had a half dozen or more fail in the last two or three months. Plus, the cords provided by the manufacturers are not very long and sometimes they don't even allow you to transfer data to your phone or tablet - they just charge and then they die an early death.These 5 1 meter / 3 foot long cords by Pvendor are an excellent choice to replace your dead cords. They are not only long enough to let you use your device while it is plugged in (try to have a passenger use her smart phone to consult Google maps in the car while it is charging on one of those little cords!) but they also transfer data. The bright colors and the thread wrapping are a fun plus. I have also noticed that the micro USB head makes a very snug and very secure fit into my phones and tablet - you don't have to worry about it bouncing loose as you are driving.They come in 5 different colors: green, blue, pink, orange and grey/silver.Note: I received a free set of these cords so that I could evaluate them in order to write a review. For the last month I have used them in two different cars, two different indoor chargers and on one desktop computer and have been very happy with them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VLPOLB7RQ3IL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012R2MUTW#wasThisHelpful","R3VLPOLB7RQ3IL","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I am writing this review I am listening to Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor being played on a pipe organ. I know that most people would use hard rock music to test the bass, but I have found that this song tells you all that you need to know. The version I was listening to was played on a massive pipe organ and if you have never sat next to a very large pipe organ you have no idea of the depth of the bass and the strength it sends out across the sanctuary.The extraordinary bass of the Voix Enhanced Bass Ear Buds conveys that overwhelming bass amazingly well. My head feels like I am listening to it live - the song just permeates by entire range of hearing and, no, I am not listening to it with the sound all jacked up (just sort of jacked up because this is a great version of this song).So, here's what you get with these earbuds:-a metal carrying case not unlike an Altoids case but without the hinged lid.-three sets of earbud tips to customize your fit.-An amazing set of metal (not plastic) ear buds for the price.-Instructions with clear illustrations.-Plus, almost as a bonus these ear buds can also be used to talk on your smart phone. Just plug them in and talk away. I used the phone controls on my phone and I was told that I sounded great - just like I was using my phone normally.I rate these earbuds 5 stars out of 5.Note: I received a set of these ear buds in order that I may evaluate them and give an honest review. Honestly, these things will rock your musical world and won't empty your wallet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FZYJC9780S2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XVT4DLO#wasThisHelpful","R2FZYJC9780S2X","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of Justinian's Flea: Plague, Empire and the Birth of Europe promises so much - the last great Roman Emperor (or first Byzantine Emperor, if you prefer), the Bubonic Plague, how the plague helped create the series of nation-states that have made up Europe for centuries. Throw in the Silk Road and how Europe was able to get its own silk worms, Justinian's multi-faceted wife Theodora, Belisarius and a discussion of how the Bubonic plague may have paved the way for Islam by weakening a resurgent Roman Empire under Justinian and you should have an amazing book - one that fills a void in most history books - the void left where ""ancient"" history ends and medieval/Dark Ages history begins.But, this book will not fill that void except for the most dauntless of readers. Justinian is not dealt with in any organized fashion after the first few chapters - he becomes an office rather than a person. Belisarius is described in one campaign after another but you never get a feel for him. The wordy writing style gets in the way of any chance to have the story told. All historians need to remember that they are telling a story - telling it in one's best dissertation-speak does not necessarily tell it well and certainly makes it less interesting for most readers.What Rosen does do well - too well - is tell the story of the Bubonic Plague. For page after page the reader is told about the animals that are the best hosts for the plague, how fleas spread it, what kind of fleas are best to spread it, how fleas bodies work and how they spread the plague when they bite, what kind of fleas like what kind of animals best, how far fleas can jump, how fleas carry the plague in their little flea bellies, and on and on about fleas. There is also an extensive description on the physiology of the plague ""bug"" itself, including its flagella that it uses to move around. I could tell more but I skimmed a lot of it out of frustration.Ironically, when the discussion turns to the effects of the plague, such as how it affected the burgeoning Roman re-birth under Justinian and may have enabled Islam to get a secure foothold in Byzantine territory a few years later, Rosen verbose writing style dries up, as if there were a limit to the number of pages he could write.So, like I said in the title, this could have really been so much more.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2380Z0BQHIYGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670038555#wasThisHelpful","R2380Z0BQHIYGY","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As D.C. Comics gears up for their big Batman vs. Superman release next year it is interesting to look at how these two iconic characters ever ended up meeting, working together and then become trusted allies.I grew up in the era when Superfriends and the Justice League were Saturday morning mainstays. Unfortunately, these were horrible days for the Batman franchise. Batman was reduced to being a sidekick of Superman with his only saving grace being that he was the only sidekick with a sidekick (Robin). The first Micheal Keaton Batman movie brought a dark side to the character that had probably never been seen on screen.Batman has trust issues. He is secretive and he is often the only force for justice in a city that perverts the law to do the work of evil men. He must work in secrecy and hide in the shadows. This audiobook captures that side of Batman perfectly.The spirit of Superman was captured well in the old TV show and in the Christopher Reeve movies. Those movies had plenty of issues but I have not heard of anyone that does not think the Reeve nailed the character of Superman perfectly. But, for some reason, modern movie makers have had a hard time understanding this iconic character. It's not hard. He is the ultimate Boy Scout and he is internally motivated to be that way. He is the guy that does the right thing all of the time. He is powerful because of his genetics. He is good because of his upbringing by his adopted parents. This audiobook understands Superman and captures his personality perfectly.But, what happens when the Gee Whiz! Aw, Shucks farm boy meets the man who wears a scary costume and  works out of the shadows?If you like your Superhero tales told in the classic form (I do - I am something of a comics Fundamentalist), you will thoroughly enjoy a story in which nothing new is told but it the story is still very entertaining. There are no out-of-left-field plot twists (like Alfred is really Bruce's dad! or Lex Luthor used to date Lois Lane!) - this is the same old story but told really well. Perry White yells all of the time, Lois Lane is too curious for her own good, Alfred the butler is efficient and mysterious, Gordon is the only honest cop in Gotham City and Lex Luthor has a diabolical plan that could shake up the entire world.And it's just about as perfect as it could be.My daughter and I listened to this audiobook as we commuted back and forth to school for a couple of weeks. When it was all done and she pulled the last CD from the CD player she said, ""That was awesome! That was amazing! That was amazingly awesome!""The story is set in the 1950s and Lex Luthor trying stealing Wayne Enterprises military technology so that he can dominate the Cold War military buildup. Clark Kent has been sent to Nevada to look into a secret military base called Area 51. Rumors of alien visitors have made him quite curious. And, both Batman and Superman are getting curious about each other as their stories are starting to spread - Superman, the hero with a smile and a kind word. Batman, the vigilante in the dark.If you are not familiar with GraphicAudio you should be. Their tag line is ""A Movie In Your Mind"" for good reason. They make each production like an old-fashioned radio show with sound effects. This production had 26 different voice actors - some with big parts, some with tiny parts. It keeps the story lively and it is much easier to picture Superman ripping open the roof of an airplane hanger when you hear the metal tearing at the same time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25S4AIHC5Q05B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1599509660#wasThisHelpful","R25S4AIHC5Q05B","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We are all told to drink more water. But, if you buy a case of bottled water from the store you are not only wasting money but you are filling a lot of garbage bags with empty bottles.If you use a re-usable plastic bottle you have the specter of BPA and those very tough ""shatterproof"" hard plastic bottles are actually freakishly easy to crack. Plus, if you leave something in it too long that goes bad (like milk) the plastic can absorb the smell and it always smells bad.Metal water bottles are hard to break, but they sure can dent. More importantly, it is hard to guarantee that a metal bottle is completely clean because you cannot see through the metal to check.The water bottle and two replace end pieces.Glass bottles don't absorb the bad smells if something goes bad inside and you can see if they are clean. But, they are so easy to break.The Glasstic water bottle solves this problem by having a plastic sleeve surround a 16 ounce glass bottle, secured by two screwed on ends. The sleeve serves as a bit of a shock absorber in case you drop the water bottle. But, more importantly, this sleeve should easily contain any pieces of glass.  When it is time to wash out the water bottle, just unscrew the lid and the bottom of the bottle and wash out the glass.The manufacturer says that it will replace the bottle for free once in the first year in the case of breakage.All parts are top-shelf dishwasher safe.Note: I received a free water bottle for testing purposes so that I could write an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IJXAL1GDDRKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EIK4WJS#wasThisHelpful","R1IJXAL1GDDRKF","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Charles C. W. Cooke is a writer for National Review and as such he has been in the center of a storm as the political Right works through a new generation of thought on a variety of issues. In some issues, the political Right is united, such as on the concept of Limited Government and keeping taxes as low as possible.Generally speaking, Libertarians bond more readily with the Right than the Left, which is why Ron Paul identified as a Libertarian for years yet caucused with the Republicans in the Congress and ran for president as a Republican. The dislike of the Nanny State on many issues pushes them together as temporary allies on many issues.But, on other issues such as the War on Drugs and Gay Marriage the Right is split and split deeply. Cooke is attempting to nudge the Republicans a little more to the Libertarian point of view on things so that these temporary alliances between the Libertarians and Conservatives can become more permanent.This can be difficult, though. The Libertarians tend to view traditional Conservative views as hypocritical - too willing to promote some intrusive acts by the government while decrying an intrusive government. Conservatives tend to view the Libertarian position as naive and too willing to walk away from any sort of compromise because compromise is in and of itself unacceptable. Or, as Cooke puts it on page 32, ""...convinced that logic-on-paper can answer all the important questions about the human experience, dismissive of history and cultural norms, possessed of a purifying instinct, and all to ready to pull down institutions that they fail to recognize are vital to the integrity of the society in which they operate.""So, the two sides clash ""...when the question is 'What should we do' rather than 'what should we oppose?' "" (p.33)So, that is the crux of the book. The two sides have deep divisions but large areas of agreement about where government should not act. It is a well-written, quick read. I come at things from the Conservative with Libertarian leanings camp (like Cooke) so I readily see what he is advocating. My Libertarian relatives are not likely to compromise on any issues, even in the name of making real advances on issues that they hold dear. For them, it is an all-or-nothing proposition (which I get - they hold all of their ideals dearly) but that just is not the way that politics works. Play the game and move towards what you really want. Don't play the game and get none of what you really want but stay ideologically pure.At least this can be a place to start the discussion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W5YF7OI2K5NO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804139725#wasThisHelpful","R1W5YF7OI2K5NO","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The iDeaUSA Wireless Bluetooth 4.0 Headphones, Sweatproof Running Earbuds come with a little bag to put everything in, a micro-USB cord to plug into a charger or a computer, three sets of ear bud tips and three sets of different-sized ear stabilizers so you can customize how they fit. Even though those ear stabilizers look horribly uncomfortable, they really are quite comfortable and very stable once you get them all screwed in (and I do mean screwed in - you think it has to be in all the way and then you twist a little bit more and then it all fits perfect!).The instruction book has plenty of good graphics but the text is pretty small so you have to squint a little to read it. The English is clearly written and easy to understand - much better than what is normally found in instruction booklets for electronics.The iDeaUSA Wireless Bluetooth 4.0 Headphones, Sweatproof Running Earbuds syncs very easily with my Samsung Galaxy 3 and my Chromebook. The phone quickly and easily re-pairs with a device once you have paired with it - it is surprisingly quick.The sound is very good. The bass is good but not great. It is not the best stereo sound I have ever heard - but this is not a top end head set that can set you back hundreds of dollars, either. Considering the price and the convenience of Bluetooth it is a pretty good deal.This set of Bluetooth earphones has excellent range.

"This is Anglink's version of an old classic - the Bluetooth earpiece. This unit, however, does modify the classic Bluetooth earpiece design - and not necessarily for the better.This single ear bluetooth headset is gold-colored (the instruction book shows three colors but Amazon only features two colors - black and golden) and sports two ear stabilizers for what should be a very good fit.Unfortunately, because of the over-the-ear stabilizer I could not actually get the device into my ear all of the way.

"Published in in 2009 by MacMillan AudioRead by William Dufris, Callista Gingrich and Eric CongerDuration: 12 hours, 23 minutesUnabridgedTo Try Men's Souls is a powerful piece of historical fiction that focuses on three men in the American army at its lowest point in the Revolutionary War - right before the famed surprise attack on the Hessians at Trenton. The story follows three men - one is a New Jersey private with family on both sides of the war, the other two are George Washington and Thomas Paine.The book is fairly complicated in its structure with lots of flashbacks and intertwining story lines. Through George Washington the reader learns the long sad story of the shrinking American Army's numerous retreats throughout the summer and fall of 1776 and how Washington gambled it all on a surprise raid to raise American morale.Thomas Paine's character was a bit more complicated. These are the months just after the success of his tract Common Sense that argued for independence. Now, in the light of all of these defeats, men keep asking him to write another Common Sense - another tract that will galvanize American sentiment. Eventually, he does come up with The Crisis, another tract that perfectly catches the feeling of the remnants of the American army. It inspires and cajoles. It is published just two days before Washington's army begins to move on Trenton. It's famous opening lines are: ""THESE are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.""The third character, the New Jersey private, stands in as a kind of every man. His family is split, but he is sure that he is right. But, despite his being sure, he is comforted by the powerful words of Thomas Paine, delivered at just the right moment.Washington Crossing the Delaware by Emanuel Leutze (1816-1868).Yes, the painting is full of inaccuracies, but it is iconic.This book could have easily slipped into being hokey but it does not. Instead, I found myself with a renewed respect for the soldiers of the Revolutionary War and for Washington's ability to just not lose. He did not win a lot, but he also managed not to entirely lose either. He somehow managed to elude defeat or capture and keep on fighting.The reading by William Dufris was quite good. He was joined by Callista Gingrich who read the few parts spoken by a woman. She was fairly weak as a narrator - she did not sound like she was trying to interact with the other characters as she read her isolated parts. They probably just put her in the sound booth and had her read her parts with little regard to what was said before and after her reading in the story - and it showed. Conger read the text of The Crisis found at the end of the book. There is also an interview with Gingrich and Forstchen at the end of the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16MXERIF5K0LE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002TNABIW#wasThisHelpful","R16MXERIF5K0LE","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In a book that feels like the beginning of the end to the long, productive career of LAPD Detective Harry Bosch, Bosch and his new partner work on two different cold cases. One case is unique in that the murder victim just died but the shot that killed him was fired years before - the injury finally overwhelmed him.The second case is personal to Bosch's new partner, Lucia ""Lucy"" Soto. As a child, she was in a day care that was operated in the basement of an apartment building when someone set fire to the garbage in another part of the basement with a Molotov cocktail sort of device. The resulting fire killed a number of the children and their teacher. Since Soto has such a personal stake in this case she should preclude herself from it - but Bosch works it so that they can re-open the case as part of another case.While the cases were interesting, the interplay between Bosch and Soto really got my attention. Clearly, Bosch has found a detective that shares his level of commitment and he is happy to coach her - he offers critiques when needed and praise when deserved and she works hard to figure out what he does that makes him such a good detective.Everything points to Bosch moving on to greener pastures. This is the 19th Harry Bosch book (depending on how you choose to number them) and he is approaching forced retirement. He reminisces about old cases (he has a point to them so he is not just telling stories just to tell them), he leaves it to his partner to use the technology stuff, including internet searches. He does the old school stuff, like looking at newspaper clippings and picking locks with paper clips. Together they make a powerful team and Bosch seems to delight in telling people that they pair old detectives with the most talented newest ones so that they can learn. I am a teacher and I recognize the relationship as being the same that I have had with student teachers - mentor and mentee.I enjoyed this book thoroughly even though Bosch seems to be moving out to make room for Soto, especially with the surprise ending.The audiobook was read by Titus Welliver who plays Harry Bosch in Amazon's adaptation of the series for streaming video. I have heard Welliver do several Robert B. Parker audiobooks - he was not bad with those but he is much better with this book. That is not surprising though - Connelly's books always do well as audiobooks. They read like they were designed to be read aloud.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BUW54ALBOZ3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455524190#wasThisHelpful","R2BUW54ALBOZ3P","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two physicists are working in a secret lab in a massive space station that literally encircles a planet. Their secret project is kept hidden from everyone - even the power to run it is taken siphoned away from dozens of other locations on the space station. Down below, a unique planet is being studied. In the lab, a a stable wormhole is being perfected. As the wormhole stabilizes, the TARDIS arrives right in the middle of it all. The Doctor (Matt Smith's Doctor) doesn't know where they are at first and he certainly doesn't know why he is there. Once they start to figure things out they discover that things are weirder than they even imagined...Frances Barber was picked to read this audiobook. The producers tried to tie a little Doctor Who authenticity to the book by picking a Doctor Who alum to read the book. Barber played Madame Kovarian - the Eye Patch Woman who kidnapped Amy Pond's baby. This is a very memorable character and perhaps it would have been better if this character had been in the story because Barber just does not have the rhythms of any of the regular characters. For example, her Amy Pond sounds hesitant and scared. When Amy Pond gets scared, she gets loud and mad, not hesitant. Her portrayal of the Doctor does not have Matt Smith's rapid-fire delivery.The plot reads like a middle-of-the-road Doctor Who story (not too good, not too bad) but the performance of the reading just wore on me and made it seem slow. About an hour into the story I checked to see if this was a 2 CD set and was very pleased to see that I had misremembered the number of CDs and this story was nearly over.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31KZR9LBUZFG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AMANJPQ#wasThisHelpful","R31KZR9LBUZFG8","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Installment #13 in the Joe Pickett series left us wondering what Joe would do with himself and how the series could continue. Joe had just quit his job as a Wyoming game warden due to his absolute disgust with a case of government abusing its power and causing an innocent man to be pushed beyond his breaking point.But, what would Joe Pickett do if he wasn't a game warden? As a practical matter, how would the series even continue? It's not like Joe Pickett and Nate Romanowski could open up a private detective service in rural Wyoming.So, Joe is back to what he was doing a few books ago - he has been restored as a game warden again but he is working for the governor as a ""troubleshooter."" He is the governor's one man personal police force, but the governor hasn't called on him for anything...until now.The governor wants him to discretely look into a mysterious out-of-state man who has moved into north-eastern Wyoming, bought up huge chunks of land and has made himself the most important man in that part of the state. He owns the most land, pays the most taxes, owns the most businesses, has the most employees and basically lives like a medieval lord in that he is above the law.On top of that, there are persistent rumors that this man runs a very high-end hit man operation. The targets are always people who arguably deserved it (like a Bernie Madoff, for example) but murder is still murder. Rumor has it that his professional killers stay at his mansion and Joe recognizes one of these hit men in a blurry photo - Nate Romanowski.It took a while for this book to get into its main plot line. However, that does not mean that it was wasted time, it was just more carefully laid out. Once Joe makes it out to the Black Hills of Wyoming the story is absolutely riveting. Joe's unerring ability to find trouble pushes the story along as he starts to dig.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NGCDEXCCQVTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425272826#wasThisHelpful","R1NGCDEXCCQVTO","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have been buying 3/4 insoles to deal with foot pain than you already know that there are different kinds of insoles: the hard type (great arch support) , the soft pillowy type (sooo soft on tired feet)  and the combination type (arch support with pockets of softness).This insole is the soft type. It is very, very comfortable and helps cut down on the beating that feet can get during the day. They offer very little in terms of additional arch support.I liked them a lot but they did have to be readjusted at least once during the day. In my shoes they had a tendency to slide forward. But, they are very comfortable and that's an acceptable trade-off for me.Note: I received a free set of these insoles so that I could write an informed, honest review.

"In many ways, the fight over whether Kansas would be a slave state or a free state was the first fighting of the Civil War.In a shortsighted move, the Congress of the United States decided to let the Kansas Territory decide for itself if it wanted to be a slave or a free state. It was shortsighted because it put off a festering political problem and let it be decided in a far away territory with little thought to what would happen in that territory. Immediately, this became a real-life struggle, the physical embodiment of the arguments taking place across the country about slavery and its future. Slave states rightly determined that they needed to bring Kansas in as a slave state and they immediately sent financial backing to support pro-slavery settlers and pro-slavery men from neighboring Missouri who would cross the border and illegally vote in the election.Abolitionists sent settlers, financial aid and weapons to counter. Soon enough, neighbor was fighting neighbor (John Brown of the infamous Harper's Ferry raid got his start here by killing a number of his pro-slavery neighbors with broadswords) and a series of tainted elections were held. Multiple governments claimed to be in charge of the state, multiple federal investigations resulted in nothing but contradictory conclusions, depending on the political affiliations of the investigators.This book starts in Missouri, very close to the border with Kansas. Blanche is a slave working for the local newspaper owner. The town is in an uproar due to its proximity to Kansas. Men are planning to illegally vote one side or another, arms are being sent across the border and ugly fights and arguments are breaking out everywhere.Blanche is not happy being a slave but figures that he has got things all figured out and will eventually be free due to his careful manipulation of the slave system. He can read, is free to work on the side for extra cash and is confident that he is superior to any field hand slave.Blanche's plan is simple - he will work for the cash to pay for his freedom or he will simply outlive his master who has promised him that he placed instructions in his will to free him when he dies. But, when his master dies during a fight Blanche finds out that his master may not have done as he promised. When he breaks into his master's widow's house to look for a copy of the will he discovers that she has burned it and she intends to keep him as a slave forever.Blanche runs at the first good opportunity and heads straight into chaos of Bleeding Kansas followed by slave catchers and encouraged by members of the Underground Railroad. Maybe he can make it if he can determine who is really a friend, who is really a foe.This is a solid piece of historical fiction. Blanche and most of the characters are composites based on real people. The author's research shows and he is able to give a real feel for the chaos of the times and the precarious life of a slave. The descriptions of Blanche's flight and of the people he meets in Kansas are well done. The only real problem that I had with the book is that Blanche has so many of these interesting episodes and brushes with danger and the same slave catcher over and over again that this middle-aged reader began to doubt that any one person could have so many close calls and still have any hope of escaping. But, I am considerably older than the intended audience and I doubt kids would think twice about it. I took off a star because of it, though.I imagine that the author found so many great tales of close calls involving runaway slaves while doing his research that he could not bear to cut any of them so he worked them all into Blanche's escape story. I can certainly understand that sentiment.As a history teacher, I would certainly recommend this book as a great supplement in a history class.Note: I was sent an advance review copy of this book at no charge so that I could write an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22RQ79ZX55OK3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0986115800#wasThisHelpful","R22RQ79ZX55OK3","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Audiobook Edition Published in 2009 by Tantor AudioPublished in hardback in 2006.Read by John Allen NelsonDuration: 11 hours, 13 minutesUnabridgedThe massacre at Fort Pillow truly stands out in a bloody Civil War in which hundreds of thousands of men and women died. Even though the American Civil War had so many casualties, the war itself was remarkable in that the two sides were often quite civil with one another off of the battlefield. There are numerous stories of local truces to trade coffee for tobacco and the like. My favorite is the story of Confederate and Union pickets (perimeter guards) who co-built a cabin in stages during the winter and agreed to share it in shifts as the day went along. Prisoners of War were generally cared for (there were exceptions, but they stick out as exceptions), the enemy wounded were treated by the doctors (the care was bad, but the best that was available), and so on.The battle at Fort Pillow in April of 1864, though, stands out as something different. It was much more like the Missouri Bushwhacker and Kansas Jayhawker fighting. It was more than just Union vs. Confederate. It had a personal side to it that resulted in a massacre.The positive side to this book is that Turtledove has clearly done an exceptional amount of research. He presents Nathan Bedford Forrest as a complicated man. An uneducated man who outsmarts most West Pointers he fights against and outshines most of his experienced and educated peers. He truly was one of the most talented officers of the war. But, he was also a slave trader and certainly could not approve of Black soldiers fighting against white men.Fort Pillow was garrisoned with white and black soldiers. The U.S. Colored Troops were roughly half of the soldiers, the balance were white soldiers, mostly  from Tennessee. Even though Tennessee was a Confederate state, these white soldiers had sat out of the war and then volunteered for the Union army when they could or had deserted the Confederate army to join the Union. Tennessee supplied 100,000 men to the Confederate cause, but it also supplied 50,000 Union soldiers. A lot of Forrest's men were from Tennessee and they looked at Tennessee men who became Union soldiers as traitors or worse. Forrest's men also believed that these Union soldiers had attacked pro-Confederate families, including unsanctioned raping and looting. Turtledove hints that even though these attacks were unsanctioned, they may very well have been unofficially approved of by the Union leadership at Fort Pillow. Clearly, the fighting in Tennessee was more than just about secession or slavery - it had a personal dimension as well.The U.S. Colored Troops had their own problems. The Confederate government had pledged to enslave any black soldiers that they captured, on the premise that they were all escaped slaves.Forrest and his men launched a surprise, raid-style attack on Fort Pillow in an effort to pick up more arms and other supplies and in a non-stop effort to harass Yankee soldiers wherever they could be found.Fort Pillow was poorly designed and its officers did little to improve its viability. For example, fields of fire were not cleared around the fort, little thought had gone into what would happen if the defenders got in close (the artillery could not hit them due to the limited ability of the cannons to fire downward).After some hard fighting it became obvious to Forrest that he would eventually take the fort and he asked for a truce to discuss surrender terms. The original commander of the fort had been killed and his replacement refused to surrender, even though Forrest promised to not enslave the U.S. Colored Troops and that they would not seek reprisal against the white soldiers from Tennessee. He also threatened that if his men were forced to take the fort by force he could not ensure that he could stop them from committing these sorts of atrocities. And, it turns out, Forrest was right...Turtledove does so much right in this book. It is well-researched. He makes characters out of people in multiple levels of both armies so that he can give a very thorough view of the battle. He does not get bogged down in the technical details of each weapon, but his description of how to operate a Civil War cannon was detailed and extremely interesting.What does he do wrong?- He is repetitive. It is great that he gives multiple perspectives, but he gives long, long multiple perspectives on the same topic.-He has an annoying habit of having the omniscient narrator tell the reader something and then have the characters note the same thing, think about the thing that they noted, tell another character about that thing and then they discuss whether or not to tell other people about it. Any single one of these devices would have been sufficient. Even worse, sometimes a soldier on the other side of the battle notices the same thing and the entire process is repeated.-There is a long, rather boring chase of a single Union officer after the battle. He sneaks away from the fort, tries to get to Union lines, gets captured and eventually is executed. Way too long and no real pay off at the end.In sum, the book is too repetitive. The good parts of the book are simply overwhelmed by the tedium of the slow parts. Easily 25% of the book could have been thrown out or condensed. Probably more.The reader, John Allen Nelson, did some good work in his reading. He did not have enough unique voices to make each character stand out. But, he was great at adding emotion and drama to the story. He often yelled as he read about the men charging Fort Pillow or becoming wounded.But, no matter how well read this book was, the story was damaged by an author that does not seem to believe that his readers can follow along unless they are constantly told the same facts over and over again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROMI8FTDRPHFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400161398#wasThisHelpful","ROMI8FTDRPHFK","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Maybe this idea as been around for a while and I just haven't seen it. But, if this is a new idea, it is so simple yet so clever at the same time you would think that it would have been invented long before now.Here's the deal. Most people go to the beach and they lay their towels out on the sand, go play in the water, come back and rub a sandy towel all over their wet body. Plus, the towel is rarely big enough for a grown person to lay on anyway.This parasheet blanket (made out of nylon, like a parachute) is designed to go straight down to the ground first and then you put the towel (and everything else) on top of it. It is 7 feet and 6 and 1/2 feet wide. And, if that isn't big enough, you can snap several of them together in a row.The blanket has little pouches in each corner to put sand in to serve as anchors and, if that is not strong enough, you can even use the corner loops and put stakes down.When you are done, shake the sand or dirt free , fold it up, stick it in the little bag, clip it to your backpack and you are gone.I rate this blanket 5 stars out of 5.Note: I reviewed a free sample in order to evaluate it so that I could write an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A2PR1RLGXRYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X12UC8O#wasThisHelpful","R1A2PR1RLGXRYS","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: This is a review of Unsavory Delicacies and The Demeter CodeNormally, I don't review two books at the same time. But, the author of this series sent me both books together, explaining that they are closely tied. From what I have read in other reviews, Unsavory Delicacies (really, it is a 30 page collection of short stories) served as sort of a bridge between books 1 and 3.Personally, I think you should just jump into book three, The Demeter Code. I felt no better informed about what was going on at the beginning of Book 3 than I would have if hadn't read 2.So, if you just jump into Book 3 be prepared for a little confusion, much like at the beginning of the first Mission Impossible movie. In fact, this book reminded me quite a bit of that series due its fast-pace, dramatic action scenes and the emphasis on working as a team and trusting the team over everything else.The real action starts out with an American operation in Europe going bad, resulting in the death of a contact and a big-time international arms dealer. Once the team sorts through everything they decide that they have to investigate further, even if their bosses are telling them to pull back. From that point on the book is an almost non-stop thrill ride to all sorts of exotic locales like Russia, Afghanistan, D.C., East Asia and Bloomington, Indiana.Yes, the whole story comes together in Bloomington, Indiana, home of Indiana University where the author went to college. I also attended Indiana University long before this author did and have lived within an a two hour drive of it almost all of my life.  I was pleased to note that not only does the story gel in Indiana, his use of Indiana geography made sense (there are two big story lines that take place there) and he gives a solid description of area around Bloomington.The evil plan hatched by our bad guys is a good one. It takes a lot of digging to come up with the answer. This could have been a boring story but it is not. It is a complicated story, but I found that if I was confused it was best just to plow on ahead and, sure enough, the confusion was resolved a few pages later.The action sequences are top-notch and there are plenty of them.Bottom line: If you like Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible movies, you'll like this book.Note: I received a free digital copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I rate this book 4 stars out of 5.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13WDGZVHPKP92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LIGBJO6#wasThisHelpful","R13WDGZVHPKP92","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you have ever wanted to take a group selfie or just wanted to get you and a whole lot of the background in a selfie, a selfie stick is the thing you want. This particular selfie stick stretches out to 33 inches (almost 36 inches if you count the phone clamp) - that doesn't sound like much but it can really add a lot to your picture. There are selfie sticks that extend longer but not many are as easy to fold up and store away as this one.The set up is easy. Your phone locks into a sturdy spring-loaded clamp on the end of the stick. Large devices such as a tablet will not fit into this clamp.The camera can swivel left and right and up and down and so you can pick the best angle and then tighten everything down. The extension works like an old-fashioned radio or TV antenna and it is very sturdy.This selfie stick folds up into a very tidy package. While I was on a recent trip I was able to fold it up and stick it in my pocket and carry it around comfortably. At one point I forgot it was in the front pocket of my shorts and thought I had left it behind in a gift shop!This stick comes in two colors: Sky blue and black.On a newer Apple phone the white cord plugs into the earphone plug and makes the camera snap pictures. Now you can take pictures with a button in the handle of the selfie stick. Aim it at yourself or maybe turn on the video and get some cool video footage of a concert (no heads in the way!).But, if you have an Android or another operating system you will have trouble. The manufacturer promises in the instructions (written on the side of the box) that it will work with Samsung Galaxy 4 and above after it downloads an app. I have a Galaxy 3 so I just used the 5 second delay feature and held the stick up and took my picture.

"This scale comes in a very nice black semi-hard sided foam-lined case with two 20 gram weights that are designed to calibrate the scale. It requires 4 AAA batteries, which are included. The case even includes a space to carry AAA batteries so that you can remove them from the scale for storage. This would protect the scale just in case one of the batteries would start to leak. The case also includes a set a tweezers (and a place to store them). There is a set of instructions in an expandable mesh pocket in the top of the case.The scale is very easy to operate but I did have a hard time getting it to measure 20 grams as 20.000 grams. I kept getting a weight of 20.002 and 20.004 grams which, in the scheme of things is pretty darn close, but it is still slightly off. It started off a little farther than that but I kept on re-calibrating the tare weight and eventually it got that close. It could be that the weights themselves are off by that little bit - I wouldn't know because I don't have any other scale that will weigh as precise as this one.It has a flip-down cover to protect the item that is being weighed.The scale measures in grams, ounces, carats, troy ounces, pennyweight and grains.I rate this scale 4 stars out of 5. It is weighing off that little bit - very, very close but no cigar. If you can live with being off that little bit, this whole package is very nice. The scale feels solid, the case is impressive. It all looks like it was designed for somebody that knows what they are doing.Note: I received a free scale from Smart Weigh so that I could look at it and try it out in order to write an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TXMYTZ75A15R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011J88S8M#wasThisHelpful","R1TXMYTZ75A15R","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are very interesting decorative lights. First of all, they are indoor/outdoor so they are very versatile. They are LED lights so they are unlikely to create a fire hazard with the heat a traditional bulb can create. They are not in a traditional Christmas light design so they can be used for any sort of party. But, they could certainly be used as Christmas lights - either on the tree or outside.This string of lights is 16 feet long with 50 different bulbs. Each bulb is just a bit smaller than the end of an adult's index finger. When you first plug the set in it starts out a light blue color but soon each bulb starts to change color. Sometimes it looks like there is a pattern, sometimes the bulbs change randomly. The colors are blue, white, purple, red, green and yellow. You cannot set the lights to a certain pattern - they just do what they want to do. It doesn't bother me any but some people like to control such things.The light set has a plug at the end of it so you can string together multiple sets. The set uses just 20 watts of power.I rate this light set 5 stars out of 5. I love the randomness of the light pattern.Note: I received a free set of bulbs so that I could make an honest review of the light set. I will be using them this Christmas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SC4DSEJ0WTMR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010FLT8R4#wasThisHelpful","R2SC4DSEJ0WTMR","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So, you want to rock out with a little style? Regular speakers are for boring people and you want something that stands out?This speaker just may do it for you then.Modeled after the Land Rover Evoque crossover SUV, this little speaker is also a true toy car. It's wheels do roll and it is sharp looking.When you charge it, this car's rear lights turn on. When you play it, the front and rear lights go on.The speaker can be played with a 3.5 mm line-in or using the Aux in plug (an over-sized mini-USB). The speaker is powered by rechargeable batteries that can easily be removed and replaced when they start to fail. The speaker can be played while it is charging but I found that it makes a slight hissing sound when you do.The speaker comes with the 3.5 mm line-in cord and a separate cord to charge the battery.This little speaker does make quite a bit of noise for its size. It would be great for a home office, not so great to rock out a frat party.The speaker measures about 7.5 inches long, about 3.5 inches wide and about 3 inches tall. It comes in three colors: red, black and gold.The speaker has an built-in FM radio but I could not get it to change stations.I rate this speaker 4 stars out of 5.

"When I got this memo board I was hoping to use it in my high school classroom. Actually, I was hoping to use it just outside my high school classroom.

"Usually I go for speakers that are designed to do the job but not stick out. But, this speaker just grabbed me. Is there any guy that resist a shiny red sports car. This car is the GT by Citroen, a car literally designed for a video game and then brought to the road as a concept car.This speaker feels like a remote control car when it is picked up. All four wheels roll easily - it will roll off of the table if it is not perfectly level. It measures approximately 10.5 inches long, 5 inches wide and 3 inches tall. When it is playing, the tail lights light up and the headlights blink blue (about two seconds on, two seconds off).But, how does it work?This speaker is more than loud enough for a home office space, but it will not shake the walls. Currently, I am listening to it and I found that I had to turn it down - it gets loud enough that I have a hard time writing and listening. If you move the car around, it makes the bass sound more prominent or less prominent. This is not due to electronics, but the simple physics of audio. I found if you tilt the car up on something (like the driver's side wheels on the ground, the passenger side wheels up on a book), which you could easily do in setting it up as a display item on a shelf, it sounds best.It comes with a replaceable rechargeable battery. The instructions are all one a half-sheet of paper. I used them to get started and then started experimenting. The car is pretty intuitive to operate.When you turn it on the car makes a roaring engine sound then there is a voice that speaks to you in Chinese. But, the back window of the car is a digital screen and it says, ""HI"" in English. Hit the ""M"" button and you pick the mode you are in: Bluetooth, FM radio or Line-in. The screen identifies them as ""blue"", the current FM station's numbers you are on (it does remember where you left it, which is a positive) and ""Line"". As you switch modes the Chinese man comes back and says something. Hit the power button once and it puases (or ""PAUS"" as the screen calls it), hold it down and it says ""OFF"" and powers down.The Bluetooth hooks up easily.If you are listening to your speaker plugged in to or Bluetoothed to your phone you can use the car as a speaker phone. I asked people how I sounded over the speaker phone (or my ""car phone"" as I took to calling it) and I was told that I sounded just like normal. I used my phone to answer and call - I hate to use the buttons on a device that is hooked up to my cell phone because while I am looking at the Bluetooth device trying to remember what to do the phone stops ringing.This speaker comes in three different colors: red, yellow and blue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JQJVFGTNI4WQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQ05GAO#wasThisHelpful","R2JQJVFGTNI4WQ","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Familyhood is Paul Reiser's follow-up to 1994's Couplehood, and 1997's Babyhood. Reiser is best-known for his television show Mad About You.If you have children you will certainly understand the big gap between the publication of Babyhood and Familyhood - life with children consumes your time. And, Paul is more than just happy about that fact, he is thrilled with it.When he wrote this book he his two sons were ten and fifteen years old. I just read it and my two duaghters are nine and fifteen years old. So much of this book rang true to me, especially his discussion on page 24 about how hard it is to just sit down and have time to talk with his wife. He writes, ""This may seem to be a might meager aspiration - to simply talk to the person with whom you have committed to share your life - but I assure you it is not. It is, in fact, almost impossible.""How true that is.Reiser talks about his own family as a kid and what he tries to do differently (he is very kind to his parents, he just would do some things differently) but most of the book is about how happy he is to have had his life overturned by becoming a dad and how much he loves his kids. Yes, it is kind of sappy, but Reiser celebrates that in this book and I can truly appreciate a man who just loves being a dad.If you are not a parent, you will probably not get much out of this book, if you are you will recognize so many of your experiences in this quick, light read.I look forward to his book about being a grandparent which I am sure he will write about 15 years from now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24X86652UVHE7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401324320#wasThisHelpful","R24X86652UVHE7","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, before I talk about anything else, I want to state the obvious - this is a good-looking bathroom scale. The old days of having a metal scale with a rolling dial are probably long gone.Of course, what makes this scale so good-looking is that it is made out of tempered glass. This is a tough glass, comparable to what you would find in cook wear. This scale can take weights up to 330 pounds. The booklet that comes with the scale notes that you should avoid weights above that on the scale, not because of danger of the glass breaking but because it can mess up the electronics underneath.The scale has a backlit display (about one inch tall) that is easy to read while you are standing on the scale. The scale is 12.5 inches by 12.57 inches - almost a perfect square.The scale can be adjusted by the push of a button to display weight in pounds, kilograms or in stones (it was news to me that anybody weighed anything in ""stones"" anymore).A real positive is that this scale uses 4 AAA batteries (it comes with a set of 4) rather than watch batteries. A lot of scales use watch batteries and even if those watch batteries last longer than AAA batteries, most people have easy access to AAA batteries so they are much easier to replace. The scale tells you when the batteries need to be replaced.The scale turns on automatically when something is placed on it. If it is activated and then whatever activated it is quickly removed it will turn off in 5 seconds to save power. I mention this because our dog loves to explore the bathroom and steps on the scale multiple times during the day. If you are standing on the scale and just stare at the results in disbelief it will turn itself off in 10 seconds.The instruction book is very easy to read. It has instructions in English, Spanish, French, Italian and German.Note: I received a scale from a vendor for testing purposes in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN1A5N4YGGZX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFRZVQI#wasThisHelpful","RN1A5N4YGGZX3","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Mpow Swift Bluetooth 4.0 Wireless Sweatproof Stereo Earbuds come with a USB cord to plug into a charger or a computer, six sets of ear bud tips and three sets of different-sized ear stabilizers so you can customize how they fit. Even though those ear stabilizers look horribly uncomfortable, they really are quite comfortable and very stable once you get them all screwed in (and I do mean screwed in - you think it has to be in all the way and then you twist a little bit more and then it all fits perfect!).The instruction book has no graphics and the text is pretty small so you have to squint a little to read it. The English is clearly written and easy to understand, although it is obvious that it was not written by a native speaker of English.What came in the package: The headset, a fairly long USB charger cord to plug into a computer, 6 sets of ""ear anchors"", 3 sets of earbud tips and the instruction booklet.The Mpow Swift Bluetooth 4.0 Wireless Sweatproof Stereo Earbuds syncs very easily with my Samsung Galaxy 3 and my Chromebook. The phone quickly and easily re-pairs with a device once you have paired with it - it is surprisingly quick.The sound is very good. It is not the best stereo sound I have ever heard - but this is not a top end head set that can set you back hundreds of dollars, either. Considering the price and the convenience of Bluetooth it is a good deal.This set of Bluetooth earphones has excellent range. I had no problem going 20-25 feet from my phone with no skipping out.The device comes with an excellent built-in phone.  I did not use the headset's phone features (the buttons on the headset). When I use Bluetooth to talk on my phone I always use the phone itself rather than the headset features to interact (meaning I answer using the phone and hang up using the phone, etc.) because I just find it easier than blindly pushing buttons.They come in three colors schemes: fluorescent green/black, blue/black and seafoam green/white.Note: I received a free sample of this set of ear buds in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRCXS0EG3J2OP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUDX250#wasThisHelpful","RRCXS0EG3J2OP","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Vision of Fire is a mix of political thriller with sci-fi and a heavy dose of the occult thrown in as well. The book starts out with top-level negotiations taking place at the United Nations between India and Pakistan over the disputed region of Kashmir. Both countries are nuclear powers and both countries are sending troops to the border. An Indian ambassador is trusted by both sides and he is trying to broker a peace between them before a nuclear war starts.But, after dropping off his daughter Maanik at her school mysterious assassins make an unsuccessful attempt on his life. He reassures his daughter that he is fine and proceeds to the negotiating table. But, his daughter starts to have some sort of break down and starts clawing at her arms.  She is rushed home and heavily sedated because she is hurting herself.The translator for the ambassador has a close friend who is a child psychologist named Caitlin O'Hara who also works at the United Nations. He calls O'Hara in because he knows that she is discrete. She immediately drops the medication and tries to calm the girl with hypnosis. It seems successful at first but the symptoms start coming back with more and more intensity. To make matters worse, other cases that are similar start to pop up in young people around the world...Meanwhile, a secret group of explorers based in New York City  is assembling an exotic collection of treasures from antiquities - and this latest piece is doing some very strange things...Okay - this sounds like it could be a very good book, doesn't it?Sadly, I was very disappointed on multiple levels.This book just drags and drags as the child psychologist struggles with Maanik and her symptoms. Even worse, as O'Hara starts to grasp that there is a paranormal side to this case the paranormal stuff is so loosely connected and presented in such a sporadic manner that it was just boring. I grew tired of trying to make a connection as I listened and I felt like it was something to be endured rather than something to be enjoyed.When I finally get to the end I realize that most of this book was not needed to prepare the reader for part two of the series. In movie terms, it was like watching Star Wars Episode 1 - only about five minutes of the movie is really needed to prepare you for Episode 2. The rest is just extra stuff and you had to watch Jar Jar Binks for most of the movie!The book was read by Gillian Anderson. I really like her in the X-Files - she is my favorite character on the show. But, this is the second time I have heard her read an audiobook and I can honestly attest to this - I am not a fan. It took me a while to figure out who she was reminding me of as I listened and then it hit me - she sound like Madeline Kahn singing ""I'm Tired"" in Blazing Saddles. Anderson is so weary-sounding, her voice is so flat that it sounds like she was going to fall asleep as she was reading her own book!So, I cannot recommend this book. It is not entirely without merits. The premise is interesting, the interaction between O'Hara and the translator was rewarding. But, I will not be moving on to part two.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAZPOPHJBNIMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442372931#wasThisHelpful","RAZPOPHJBNIMN","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Putzel has written a sort of unit history of C Troop 2/17th Cavalry 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam, also known as the Condors. The tales of combat in Vietnam and Laos are exceedingly well-told, riveting and harrowing. They tell of bravery, loyalty and loss and gave me a picture of a part of the war that I really knew very little about before.But, as good as those stories are, the real strength of the story is the story about what comes after the war. The title, The Price They Paid, is more than just story of who was injured and who died in the war. Certainly, they paid the highest price. But, the men who were injured, the men who lost their friends, even the men who went through unscathed - those men who survived to go home also paid a price and that is what I found most compelling.The book focuses Jim Newman, a  man who started as a private in the army, worked his way to becoming an officer. In Vietnam he led his men in the Air Cavalry (helicopters, if you are not familiar with it) with daring skill. He was an officer who knew what it was like to be an enlisted man. He loved to fly helicopters and he was good at it. He didn't waste his men's lives but he knew when to take risks and his men admired him. He was on a career path to become a general before he self-destructed after the war. From a distance, he seemed successful, but he was deeply troubled in his personal life with multiple divorces, estranged children and even a charge of bigamy - none of it is explained.Putzel writes about others who served with Newman. Some have lingering physical ailments. Some have new ailments such as cancer, thought to be from exposure to Agent Orange. Many of them have PTSD to some extent - some have paranoia, some anger at a government that would not live up to its promises and some just never really got their lives on any sort of track after the war. It was all part of The Price They Paid.I rate this book 5 stars out of 5.Note: I received a review copy of this book from a publicist so that I could write an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X71B2N2ROCGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0986132101#wasThisHelpful","R1X71B2N2ROCGZ","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cell phones, as a group, are not compatible with water. But, so many people do things around the water that it is just not feasible to never take the phone near water.This waterproof pouch is a great solution to these problems:1) You can see through it so you can check to see who's calling while you are out fishing and screen that call from your spouse telling you it's time to come back in and have lunch with your brother-in-law!2) You can actually interact with your smartphone through the plastic - touch buttons, etc. so you can keep on texting while you are in the shower!3) It is truly waterproof. I put a tissue in mine and stuck it in the sink (held down by a bottle) for more than 3 hours and it was perfectly dry - so yes, you can go tubin' and still check your e-mail!4) The plastic is clear so you can watch online kitten videos all night long and Bluetooth the sound out to a nearby speaker while you are soaking in the hot tub with that special someone!5) It has a detachable lanyard just in case you like to take selfie videos of while you are water-skiing! Wrap it around your wrist a few times and you can get the perfect video of you wiping out and still not lose your phone!Seriously, though, it works great. Plus, you can store other stuff in there as well - watches, hearing aids, a Fit Bit or anything else you just don't want to get wet, muddy, dirty, filled with sand or whatever.Note: I received a free sample for testing purposes. I took it all over Florida on a trip (theme parks, the beach, etc.) and I like it a lot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR56VGWYEX25I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZVXXB2#wasThisHelpful","RR56VGWYEX25I","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this backpack-style daypack to take to Disney World on our summer vacation. But, once I tried it on I realized that it was just too small for me - it felt like I was wearing a little kid's backpack. But, I have a nine-year-old and I let her use it and it fit her perfectly (there is a bigger version that is a little more than 1/3 larger available for $5 more). She carried the little essentials at Disney World - a small umbrella, a map and, of course, a little notebook to get autographs from all of the Disney Princesses and sometimes a water bottle.This daypack can fold up into a small pouch for easy storage in a car or wherever. When you unfold it, the pouch is in the backpack and serves as an internal pocket. This backpack is water-resistant but not waterproof. While we were at Epcot we were caught in a thunderstorm and the backpack protected what was inside.This would not be a heavy-duty backpack like kids would use for school and they do not claim to be. But, this was great on our trip. My daughter had no complaints, except that the straps hurt when she overloaded it, which is to be expected.The daypack comes in 7 different colors (black, blue, green, orange, gray, purple and red) and two different sizes (20 L and 35 L).Note: I received a free daypack in for testing purposes in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15IM9GGFGM8H9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z8RAU3W#wasThisHelpful","R15IM9GGFGM8H9","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Small, convenient umbrellas come in all sorts of sizes and weights. This umbrella is built to be as lightweight as possible. We took it to the four Disney World kingdoms with us over the course of a week because the weather reports forecast rain every afternoon. My nine-year-old carried a small, lightweight backpack and we tucked this inside of the backpack for her precisely because this umbrella is so lightweight. While we were at Epcot we got nailed by a very strong thunderstorm and this umbrella performed quite well for her.When I say that this umbrella is lightweight, I mean that it weighs less than any umbrella that I have ever used. It is not intended to be an everyday umbrella so if you live in London or Seattle this would not be your best option. I carry it in my car and would not hesitate to toss it in a backpack if I were going out and rain was likely.The umbrella comes with an odd case that I like like the longer I have it. Many umbrellas have a sleeve that you slide on it to protect it. But, if you use the umbrella and then slide the sleeve on it the sleeve gets all wet and it's hard to put the umbrella away because everything around it gets wet. This case feels like it is made out of the carpet that you find in automobile trunks. After the rains at Epcot we just shook off the umbrella and stuck it back in the case and nothing got wet in her backpack.This umbrella is pricey when compared to other small travel umbrellas but, rest assured, it does work and is ultra-lightweight. The umbrella comes in two colors: pink and black. The umbrella comes with a purely decorative, whimsical cloth flower sewn to it. I cut the flower off with a knife. I am not that whimsical.Note: I received a free umbrella in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29EIP66LN77MA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UT0U1OQ#wasThisHelpful","R29EIP66LN77MA","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is BestFire's version of an old classic - the Bluetooth earpiece. This unit features the classic Bluetooth earpiece design - no extending microphones or any wires going to your ear.This set has a different twist. It has a extra earpiece on a wire that you can plug into the micro-USB port that you use to charge the device and suddenly you have a stereo headset.The sound is very clear and it stayed connected more than 20 feet away from my phone in my house. The sound is not bad at all, especially considering that the real reason to get this set is to have a Bluetooth phone - the music is just a nice bonus.I did not use the headset's phone buttons. When I use Bluetooth to talk on my phone I always use the phone rather than the headset features to interact (meaning I answer using the phone and hang up using the phone, etc.) because I just find it easier than blindly pushing buttons.The earpiece comes with two different-sized optional over-the-ear hooks. It also comes with a lot of other stuff that I cannot identify. There is a soft plastic piece that I think is some sort of in-car storage container that you hang from the air vent of the car and there is also a lanyard. I have no idea what to attach the lanyard to.As an added bonus, the instructions claim that this headset can translate Chinese to English and English to Chinese (seriously). I did not bother to test that feature since I don't speak Chinese or know anyone that does.The instruction book was clearly written by someone who does not speak English as their first language - but is perfectly understandable.Note: I received an earpiece for evaluation purposes in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3418JICBQ9QNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFLBQAC#wasThisHelpful","R3418JICBQ9QNV","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The SoundPEATS Q2 Stereo Bluetooth Earbuds come with a USB cord to plug into a charger or a computer, three sets of ear bud tips so you can customize how they fit.These earbuds never really did comfortable on my head - usually you just have get them all screwed in (and I do mean screwed in - you think it has to be in all the way and then you twist a little bit more and then it all fits perfect!) but these never really did that with me. Even worse, the device just doesn't fit my admittedly large head (I have literally torn the stitches out of a one-size-fits-all hat in a store). It was so tight that they never really got into my ears correctly when I tried to put both earbuds in at the same time.The instruction book has great graphics and the text is a decent size.

"Marvel Press has released a series of junior novelizations of their Avenger and Avenger-related movies. The term ""Phase One"" in the title means that this is a pre-Avengers book that serves to introduce an Avenger. The publisher recommends them for ages 8-12 but my wife and I listened along with the kids in the car and we enjoyed it as well.The book follows the movie very closely, detailing how Steve Rogers tried to join the army multiple times during World War II but was always refused because he was too small and too sickly. Finally, he is noticed by a team of scientists and given the opportunity he has always wanted - he can join the army.But, there's a catch.He will have to be part of a group of men who are competing to see who can qualify to be part of an experiment to create a ""Super Soldier"" based on research already being done by a secret group in Nazi Germany called Hydra...This is the place to start this series. In this book, the groundwork for the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe is laid out. If you are an avid comics reader, then you probably already know that the movies and the TV shows deviate from some of the established comic book story lines. We meet the Stark family, Agent Carter (the namesake of an ABC television series), learn a little about the Infinity Stones and quite a bit about Hydra.Tom Taylorson's narration is quite good. He makes the story seem dramatic without being overly dramatic. My family enjoyed it as we drove along on a family vacation which is quite the compliment since I am the only one of the four of us that has actually seen the movie that this audiobook is based on,  Captain America: The First Avenger.I rate this audiobook 5 stars out of 5 with the understanding that this is a 5 star rating for an audiobook that is kid friendly.Note: I was sent a copy of this audiobook by the publisher through Audiobook Jukebox's Solid Gold Reviewer Program in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29PXUR9ZI9TSN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X0THXRQ#wasThisHelpful","R29PXUR9ZI9TSN","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Published by Random House Audio in 2008Read by Titus WelliverDuration: 4 hours, 40 minutesUnabridgedAt the end of Appaloosa, the first book in this series, Hitch and Cole have parted ways. Hitch ends up in the town of Resolution, a mining/lumbering town with some small unsuccessful ranches/farms scattered around.Hitch is hired by the owner of a local hotel/saloon to keep the peace inside the saloon. Soon enough, Cole shows up. He is on the outs with his girlfriend again. She has issues - she just has to throw herself at the most powerful man in the room and Cole had finally had enough of it and killed a man she was with. For Cole, this is devastating. He has always followed the law, even if it is arbitrary law that he has written himself. Killing this man broke the law and Cole is now a man who cannot follow his own code. So, Cole just hangs out with Hitch and ponders the meaning of laws and rules and the Social Contract for half of the book.In the meantime, Hitch is offered the chance to switch sides in a range war that is just beginning to start. It will be the miners vs. the lumberjacks vs. the ranchers/farmers vs. the hotel/saloon owners and Hitch has to decide where he is going and Cole has to work his way through his issues before the lead starts to fly...There are a few common themes that run through most westerns - the stranger(s) that come into town to rescue the heart-of-gold widow with a ranch (like Tom Selleck's Crossfire Trail) and the stranger(s) that come into town to stop the local bad guys (like in The Magnificent Seven ). Parker, if nothing else, was a master of taking the established format of a genre and then tweaking it - the familiar then becomes something different, but still feels like the same old comfortable story.In this story, the strangers are Hitch and Cole. As the story progresses, Parker mixes the story of the the woman who needs to be rescued with the story of the town being rescued from the local bad guys, with a twist, of course.The title, Resolution, is interesting because as the book goes along Cole resolves his issues. He reads and discusses John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau and hits on the idea that laws come out of the social contract between the person in power and the people who are under those laws. Basically, Cole cheats the idea a bit to ease his existential crisis and allow him to be Cole again. Parker sure loved all of this deep psychological stuff. I find it amusing to have professional gunslingers sitting on the front steps of a saloon discussing the theory of the Social Contract.The audiobook is read by the actor Titus Welliver. I like Welliver's work and his voice is smooth and mellow - just about perfect for Hitch, who tells the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AWXFGLLIJY8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FVJICY#wasThisHelpful","R3AWXFGLLIJY8A","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have ever wanted to take a group selfie or just wanted to get you and a whole lot of the background in a selfie, a selfie stick is the thing you want. This particular selfie stick stretches out to 32 inches - that doesn't sound like much but it can really add a lot to your picture.Most selfie sticks are basically a one-legged tripod, including having that screw-on top so that you can attach a camera to it instead of a cell phone. If you want to use your cell phone you need to screw on a clamp that holds your phone. Personally, I don't know of anyone that uses a digital camera with a selfie stick and this selfie stick dispenses with that option completely. It replaces it with a fold-down head that is much easier to set up than your typical selfie stick. When folded down, this is a much more compact little package than your typical selfie stick. This has become the selfie stick that I take on trips and to family gatherings.The camera can swivel up and down so you can pick the best angle and then tighten everything down. The extension works like an old-fashioned radio or TV antenna and it is very sturdy.This selfie stick is 32 inches long. The other selfie sticks that I have played around with are 40 inches long but they have not felt as sturdy as this one. The Bluetooth pairs easily so you can take multiple pictures. Of course, if you forget to charge the selfie stick you can still use it by setting your phone's camera on a timer and pose before it takes the picture.

"During the long, hot, bloody summer of 1864 the Union Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia found themselves in a long series of battles. General Ulysses S. Grant changed the situation on the front by changing the strategy of the Army of the Potomac and the way it dealt with the Army of Northern Virginia. Rather than fighting a battle, withdrawing from one another, regrouping and then seeking out the enemy again Grant just kept his army in constant contact with Lee. His plan was simple - he knew that the Union forces had a lot more soldiers and a near limitless supply of ammunition and food, at least when compared to Lee's army. The math was simple - Grant could afford to lose more of everything so long as he was depleting Lee at the same time.Eventually, this settled down into a siege around Richmond and its suburb, Petersburg. Petersburg was a train hub and a vital link in the supply chain that fed the Confederate capital and its army. Both armies dug a maze of trenches, much like the ones used in World War I.The problem was, although Grant was slowly squeezing Lee's army to death, it was not quick enough. The Presidential election of 1864 was quickly coming and war weariness had settled in - this change in strategy was causing so many more Union deaths and casualties. It was feared that Lincoln would not win and his opponent, McClellan would win. McClellan's platform promised a quick end to the war and would most likely end in recognition of the Confederacy as a separate country - the war would be lost.At this point some Union soldiers who were coal miners before the war had an idea. Why not dig a tunnel under the Confederate lines, fill it full of gunpowder and then blow it up like a giant bomb? It would literally blow a whole in their lines and a group of Union soldiers could rush in and take Petersburg and cause Richmond and Lee's army to fall. They take it to their general, the tarnished Ambrose Burnside and he loves it and he convinces his superiors to let it proceed.It seems simple enough, but with the Army of the Potomac, nothing is ever so simple...This book is presented as a tragedy from its beginning where the reader gets an up close view of the Battle of Cold Harbor on June 3 - the worst day of a two week long battle. There were 7,000 Union casualties in a single hour due to foolish orders to charge Confederate breastworks (compare that to D-Day in World War II - there were 9,000 Allied casualties all day). After that hour, the Union troops simply refused to charge. They would do enough to make it look they tried and then they would return to their positions.The reader is introduced to a newspaper artist and a group of African American soldiers (U.S. Colored Troops or USCT) from Indiana who are volunteers and want to fight and prove their equality to the white soldiers but are stuck digging graves at Arlington Cemetery. When they get their chance to go to Petersburg, they are so proud and so full of enthusiasm - the reader knows what is waiting for them and knows that it will not end well.The USCT soldiers are trained to lead the attack after the tunnel will be exploded. They drill for weeks and their white officers are confident that they will do well for three reasons: they are trained well, they are green and don't know the horrors of a frontal assault and they have something to prove as Black men and as some of the first Black soldiers to be involved in a major battle.But, orders come and the day before the attack, the USCT soldiers are ordered to be held in reserve and experienced soldiers are rotated up to lead the charge. And, once the plan starts to change it all falls apart. Petty rivalries take precedence, weak leaders turn to drink, weak generals can't decide what to do and the men charge into one of the most hellish scenes of the war.Gingrich and Forstchen make the fighting in and around the crater come alive - the horror, the carnage and the chaos are interspersed with heart stopping acts of courage honor and pathetic moments of treachery and stupidity. As I read this book I knew it was not going to end well. The book is like a Greek tragedy - you can see that no one is going to be left untouched but it just continues to unroll itself right in front of you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF7G6IWWFY19X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312607105#wasThisHelpful","RF7G6IWWFY19X","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Published in 2008.This collection of short stories (and one letter and one rambling, but enjoyable, speech) focuses on war and the folly of war. Many of the stories deal with World War II and prisoners of war, a theme echoed in Slaughterhouse-Five.The book begins with an entertaining introduction by Mark Vonnegut, Kurt's son followed by an astonishingly flippant letter from Kurt to his family telling them that he had been a prisoner of war since the Battle of the Bulge but now he was liberated and headed back to Indiana. The letter is actually reproduced as a picture so you can see it how he typed it on the stationary that he typed it. The letter is followed by the last speech he ever wrote, appropriately delivered in his hometown of Indianapolis by his son after Kurt Vonnegut's death.The short stories are up and down, as all short stories collections are. But, Vonnegut's gift for creating interesting characters shines through most of them and I found myself invested in most of them in a very short time. Most have funny moments tossed in the middle of a great tragedy. Many feature prisoners of war, which is understandable considering Vonnegut's own experiences in World War II.The book itself is a beautiful hardback made with the highest quality slick paper. Between the short stories there are drawings and quips from Vonnegut.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22TWN7RQZB6HP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425226891#wasThisHelpful","R22TWN7RQZB6HP","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am currently listening to the SoundPEATS Universal Q800 Bluetooth headset. I have reviewed a number of Bluetooth headsets in the last few months and this one has one big thing going for it - its design.The problem with Bluetooth headsets is what do you do with the things when you are out and about but you are not actually listening to them and you still want them handy? You could dangle them around your neck, but they could slip off and get lost. If you put them away, they're not very handy.The SoundPEATS Universal Q800 uses this collar-like device that is very lightweight. They are so lightweight that it is easy to forget that you are wearing them. If you are not using the ear buds, just attach them to the collar with the built-in magnets and the they are tucked out of the way.The SoundPEATS Universal Q800 has excellent range. I had no problem going 20-25 feet from my phone with no skipping out.  It synced very easily with my Samsung Galaxy 3 right away (usually the first time is the trickiest time) - so quickly that I thought there was a problem because my phone skipped some of it's normal searching - they found each other and synced up right away.The sound is very good. It is loud, but not loud enough to block out the normal everyday sounds of life but not loud enough to bother the people sitting beside you. It is not the best stereo sound I have ever heard - but this is not a top end head set that can set you back hundreds of dollars, either.It comes with two sets of replacement earbuds, a mini-USB charger cord and a replacement anchor that holds to wire to the collar.The device comes with an excellent built-in phone and my wife said it sounded very clear when I used it.  I did not use the headset's phone features. When I use Bluetooth to talk on my phone I always use the phone rather than the headset features to interact (meaning I answer using the phone and hang up using the phone, etc.) because I just find it easier than blindly pushing buttons. When someone calls when you are paired to the SoundPEATS Universal Q800 one of the tips of the collar vibrates (it feels like a bug is trying to land on your neck - it gets your attention) just in case you are wearing the collar but do not have the earpieces in. It does the same thing when you wander out of range. When you go back into range it tells you that you are re-connected.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GXLBFQJBC0W8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z56JVI6#wasThisHelpful","R3GXLBFQJBC0W8","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The traditional Bluetooth headset is that in one ear set that people use to talk on the phone. But, almost all Bluetooth stereo sets have a phone feature as well. But, what if you want to talk on the phone and drive your car at the same time with one of those stereo headphones? If you put both speakers in your ears you really can't hear what's going on when you drive, but if you just leave one headphone in then the other one is dangling around.This most distinguishing feature is that the connecting cable between the two is detachable so that you can use one of the earphones and use it as a single earpiece. Re-connect the cable and you have stereo headphone set. Note: because of this feature, both earpieces have to be charged separately but the set comes with a dual plugged USB charger cord to get that done.The attached ear hooks swivel and are actually very comfortable. On the whole, this set feels well-built.The music quality is pretty typical of what you get in a Bluetooth set.

"These clips are unbelievably simple and effective. At first glance they are just really big laundry pins. But, their size and the their design means that they are very strong. Most laundry pins would have a hard time holding wet beach towels to the line, but not these.We keep them around in the bathroom when they are not on beach patrol. The other day our bathroom rug got soaked by a faulty shower head and we used these clips to pin the rug to the inside of the shower door so that the water drained into the shower.Note: I was sent a free sample of these towel clips in exchange for an honest review.

"I was sent two of these over the door hangers for free in exchange for an honest review - a brown/bronze one and a white one.In general, these are lightweight hangers. You could hang a child's jacket or even a small child's coat from it. You could hang belts or ties or small purses from it without a problem.They fit over the door comfortably.The white hanger came with problems:1. There were multiple places where the welds were done sloppily and not snipped off. They were very sharp and I ended up being stabbed by them multiple times (I bled once) until I finally got a tool to snip them off.2. There are five hooks and three of them have big pieces of paint chipped off of them.3. The hanger was not completely painted white - there was an area that just got a dusting of paint.The brown/bronze one did not have problems with the welds but it did come with the paint chipped off of one of the hooks. Too bad because it is very sharp-looking.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XZ15Y0P2OP8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O7CQQA0#wasThisHelpful","R2XZ15Y0P2OP8S","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used and reviewed plenty of Bluetooth earbuds. Some come in fancy packages (these do not). Some come with fancy plastic casings (these do not). Some come with fancy flat wires (these do not). Some are very expensive (these are not). These are the most basic Bluetooth earbuds I have seen - and they work!Everything about these earbuds is basic - and there is a place for that. If you are working in an environment that is hostile to tech (wet, very dusty, whatever) your earbuds will fail no matter how expensive they are. At $13.99, these are practically disposable. If you have a middle schooler, this might be a good place to start since they tend to lose stuff easily. Or, if you are like me, I work in a high school where I have seen lots of tech stuff get stolen over the years (phones, wired earbuds, wireless mice, wired mice, projectors, and more) than you don't want to bring a $200 set of Bluetooth earbuds.But, it's not like these are a bad set of earbuds. They work more than 20 feet away from my phone, the sound is not amazing, but it is every bit as good as most of the earphones and earbuds as I have had in my life. They sound good with audiobooks, too.These earbuds pair a little harder than some and a little easier than other earbuds that I have used. Usually it takes two tries to get them to pair.The ear clips are an issue. If you are going to be doing a lot of moving around you will probably have to use these ear clips. They are made of clear plastic and latch onto the earbuds and then slide over the ear. But, if you have fairly large ears, like me, you may find them to be uncomfortable after a few minutes. If you are not moving around a lot, this will not be an issue.The phone feature on this headset is tremendous. Whey I use Bluetooth to talk on my phone I always use the phone rather than the headset features to interact (meaning I answer using the phone and hang up using the phone, etc.) because I just find it easier than blindly pushing buttons. But, the sound quality for both the call in and the call out is excellent - much better than on most of the headsets I have tested.The earbuds come in four different color combinations: black/white, white/white, blue/white and pink/white.So, to sum up, these are not fancy. They are not an audiophiles dream. But, they are affordable and they do the job.Note: I was sent a free copy of these earbuds for review purposes. in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UBM76RU0YRNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OA01RF8#wasThisHelpful","R3UBM76RU0YRNY","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before we go any further, I must tell you that I am a public school teacher that is pretty similar to the one featured in I'd Like to Apologize to Every Teacher I Have Ever Had. I have been teaching for 25 years.What looks like a publicity stunt by an out-of-work actor trying to jump start a career is really a sincere attempt to get a taste of what being a real teacher is all about. Danza starts the book explaining that he was at a low point in his career, having just had his TV talk show cancelled, but he had seriously considered being a teacher when he was younger and had used his platform on his TV talk show to promote teachers and provide ""School Room Makeovers"" and that had re-kindled his interest.So, he was talking about this idea he had of becoming a teacher and someone told him that it would be a good idea for a reality show. Personally, I never heard of the show until I had heard of the book. I still have not watched the show, although I plan on it. I wanted to get Danza's unfiltered perspective first.After a little haggling, they finally find a school willing to let Danza teach one class every day under the supervision of a seasoned teacher. I assume that the kids were similarly vetted but the way it plays out it seems like he's got a pretty average group of kids in his class.Danza is only permitted to teach one class a day. To his credit, he arrives on time and stays throughout the day just like every other teacher. He helps coach, he helps with a talent show, he helps with crowd control in the morning and to catch the stragglers who wander into school at all sorts of times.Danza is very sincere at his efforts to be a good teacher. As a teacher, I can tell you that having just one class would be great (less papers to grade, more time to lesson plan, you won't be as tired at the end of the day), but it is a disadvantage as well. I once heard another teacher describe teaching as ""performance art"" and I think that he is right. When you only teach one class it is liking having to film a scene with just one take and no practice and no warm-up. Last year, I taught 4 sections of Spanish 3. The first one was always the worst, by far. He had no chance to revise what he did, even if it is revision ""on the fly"".Sometimes, Danza's celebrity status opens doors for him, like when he takes the class on a field trip to New York City, but, in the end, if Danza only used his celebrity to get him somewhere in class he would not get far - the kids are too young to have seen his movies and TV shows and after a while he just stops being a celebrity and has to be a teacher. His celebrity-sized wallet is a help from time-to-time (I hate to be crass, but sometimes lack of money for the classroom is an issue).When the show suddenly quits filming halfway through the school year Danza has a decision to make - does he finish the year or does he just go on to the next gig? He finishes the year and it sounds like that second semester is the one that turns him from a true rookie to a teacher.If you have never been inside a large public school as an adult this book gives you some flavor of what it is like. Danza also intelligently discusses issues like charter schools, teachers unions and the like in the book - not from the perspective of a politician or a commentator but from the perspective of someone who has been in the classroom and knows that there is no silver bullet. Being a teacher is different than you think, even if you think you know what it is since you sat in the classroom and watched a lot of teachers teach.Danza does hit on the parent angle a lot and, as a parent and a teacher, I cannot disagree. On page 175 he notes: ""One reason it's hard for both teachers and students is that there's so little parental backup. Which is not to say that the parents are always missing in action. Sometimes they're present to a fault."" Absentee parents and helicopter parents are equally the bane to a successful student.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24OLM54B8YMOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007UH4HSW#wasThisHelpful","R24OLM54B8YMOK","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

With this device you simply plug it into the cigarette lighter, connect your Bluetooth device to the BrightPlay Car HD and plug it into your aux in port and Bam! you've turned your car into a Bluetooth device.Now, you may be thinking that if you have a portable device and you have a ""line-in"" aux line to your car's stereo than you are probably good without this device because you can just use your phone to change songs, pause the music, answer the phone, etc. That is very true, except that this device has a button that skips all of that logging in/swiping to get into your phone (which can be dangerous while you are driving). Hit the button and you change songs.

"In essence, the Brightech Ambience G40 Globe String Lights set is like a Christmas light set, but with bigger bulbs than most Christmas light sets have.  The idea is too string them up like you might see at an outdoor cafe and supply a decent amount of outdoor light so that people can feel comfortable and sit and relax. These would be perfect for a gazebo, above a deck, in the metal framework of an awning or spread out among the lower branches of tree.These are designed for outdoor use but there are limitations. The first warning in the instructions says: ""Avoid contact with water."" So, these are not for permanent outdoor display. It also notes that you should not use more than 3 light sets strung together at one time. There are 25 bulbs, each spaced about one foot from each other.Despite all of the warnings, this is a a great light set. The lights do set a nice mood.The only drawback is the packaging. This set is packed very securely - it does not want to come out of the packaging and it takes a lot of work to get it free from the packaging - you have to remove every bulb and free the base and then re-install the bulb.Note: I received a light set for free in order to evaluate it to create an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDMF093946EGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JK4Z2M8#wasThisHelpful","RDMF093946EGH","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Make sure that the solar panel is not in a location where it gets exposed to light during the night - if it does the lights may flicker or not even work at all.The paperwork makes it very clear that the battery will have to be replaced after a year of use.

"As a rule, I am not a fan of the bigger over the head type of headphones. Although the sound is always awesome, eventually the weight of the headphones themselves becomes an issue or they phones themselves start to hurt my ears and the top of my head.. Not the inside of my ears - the outside part, where the headphones are sitting and rubbing. I don't know if it's because they pinch too tight (I have a large head) or what but they start to hurt.The SoundPEATS A1 solves two of the three problems. It is very lightweight and it does not hurt my ears but they do hurt the top of my head unless I position them just right. On the other hand, my daughter has worn them on her head for hours and not complained.But, do they work well?Absolutely. This is a fine set of headphones.The Bluetooth pairs easily with my Samsung Galaxy 3 and my Chromebook.The headphones do not get super loud. I know that some people like to have their headphones so loud that everyone can still hear their music. These headphones will not do that. But, they are loud enough to block out everyone else and immerse you into your own personal world of sound.The set includes a telephone feature so you can answer the phone while wearing them without having to undo all of the Bluetooth connections. The phone is merely so-so.The SoundPEATS A1 comes with an optional wired feature. If you have a wire with two male ends you can plug the headphones into a non-Bluetooth device.

"As I am writing this review I am listening to Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor being played on a pipe organ. I know that most people would use hard rock music to test the bass, but I have already done that and I was impressed. The version I was listening to was played on a massive pipe organ and if you have never sat next to a very large pipe organ you have no idea of the depth of the bass and the strength it sends out across the sanctuary.The extraordinary bass of the Audiosharp AS1130 conveys that overwhelming bass amazingly well. My head feels like I am listening to it live - the speakers vibrate my skull (and, no, I am not listening to it with the sound all jacked up). The bass just goes that deep and that strong.So, here's what you get with these earbuds:-a small leather carrying case.-four sets of earbud tips to customize your fit.-a CD to break in your headphones (I confess that I did not use it - my computer has no CD player).-An amazing set of headphones.

Even though those ear stabilizers look horribly uncomfortable, they really are quite comfortable and very stable once you get them all screwed in (and I do mean screwed in - you think it has to be in all the way and then you twist a little bit more and then it all fits perfect!).The instruction book has great graphics but the text is pretty small so you have to squint a little to read it.

"I admit, I could see no use for these things. The distributor offered me a free pair in exchange for an honest review and I said, ""Sure."" But, what I was thinking was, ""Yeah, right!""So, here is what you get:1. a nice hard-sided glasses case with a clip so you can attach it to a backpack (in case you are hiking to computer camp?)2. amber tinted plastic frames with plastic lenses. The lenses are very slightly tinted yellow which makes them like the old ""blue blocker"" lenses or ""shooter's glasses"", but just not as tinted.3. the glasses are comfortable and stylish in a geeky sort of way.Do they work?Well, yes and no.Here is what I discovered:My laptop is by a window that gets a lot of sunlight. During the day the screen has to be turned up fairly bright just to counteract all of the natural light. But, in the evening there is just the interior lighting and the screen is really more bright than it needs to be. I have adjusted this by just hitting the button on my keyboard that makes the screen less bright. But, the colors and the contrast don't ""POP"" like normal. Everything is much more subdued.But, when you look at the screen when it is turned low while wearing these glasses the ""POP"" comes back. The contrast looks normal.So, what does this mean?The glasses do very little to reduce glare - they are just barely tinted, after all. But, what they do is they allow you to turn the brightness down on the computer and still enjoy what you are looking at and the simple act of turning down the brightness on your computer screen does reduce the glare.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CC2NZGMZ9DYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FVT927C#wasThisHelpful","R1CC2NZGMZ9DYH","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Published in 2012 by Post Hypnotic PressOriginally published in 1991Read by Lisa BuntingDuration: 6 hours, 33 minutesUnabridgedGail Bowen's Joanne Kilbourn character carries on into her second book. Life has changed for her - she has moved her family to Saskatoon in Saskatchewan to be close to her daughter in college and to teach at the same university.The local art center was called the Mendel (I say was because it has since been slated to close and move to a new location with a new name) and a childhood friend of Joanne Kilbourne who has since become a controversial artist has an exhibit at the Mendel. The artist, named Sally Love, and Kilbourn used to be very close but after the suicide of Love's father when they were 13 years old Sally Love moved away.Kilbourn and Love renew their friendship. Sally Love's exhibition has brought a number of protesters out because of her art. She has a lot of art with overt sexual themes, including a 200 square foot fresco on the wall over 100 penises (and a few vaginas) - paintings of the genitalia of all of her lovers over her lifetime permanently painted to the wall.As a Kilbourn and Love navigate the protesters and her fans, Love decides to sell a private all-women's art gallery that an emotionally ultra-needy friend has managed for her for years. This unhinges the friend.Suddenly everything starts to unravel as arson, multiple murders and more ruin Saskatoon's Christmas and New Years...I did not enjoy this audiobook. It was not the fault of the reader, Lisa Bunting, who did a fantastic job with a variety of people's voices. She exhibited tremendous emotional range with her reading.The text itself is the problem. Sally Love came off as an arrogant self-absorbed character and Kilbourn seems the same as she accepts Love without criticism, even as she makes cruel comments about other characters, makes plans to remove her daughter from her ex-husband (the only home she's ever known) and even sits and talks about masturbation at the breakfast table in front of Kilbourn's school-aged son before he heads off to school. In fact, Kilbourn's own internal compass is so messed up that I despaired of using her opinions as any kind of barometer to judge any other character and try to figure out who did what to whom?To make matters worse, the pacing in this book is terrible. The ""murder an the Mendel"" that the title proclaims does not happen until halfway through the book. Bowen excels at long, rich descriptions of scenes but not at moving a plot along.This is my third review of a Gail Bowen book or short story and this is my last.

"In the previous book in the Joe Pickett series, In Plain Sight, Joe lost his job as a Wyoming game warden. In this book Joe gets his job back, sort of. Governor Rulon, a man who delights in doing things that irritate bureaucracies, has offered him a chance to work as a Game Warden ""without portfolio"" (as they might say in diplomatic circles). Joe is an independent agent, working for the Governor but the Governor wants plausible deniability for everything Joe does.The Governor offers this to Joe because of a situation that developed in Yellowstone National Park. A local attorney went into a part of the park that is in Idaho, shot four campers and then turned himself in. The campers all worked for Zephyr, a private contractor that runs the hotels, the gift shops and does the maintenance around the park. But, due to a loophole in the law he was not able to be tried for anything. Due to federal law and his right to a trial by jury the attorney was simply not able to be brought to trial and he walked away.The Governor sends Joe in to see if the Park Rangers and the FBI have done a thorough job of investigating. Specifically, he wants to know why the attorney killed the campers - his claim that they made fun of him and he took their guns away from them and shot them just does not sound plausible.The Governor makes it clear that he is not sending Joe because Joe is some sort of genius investigator. Instead, he knows that Joe has a way of blundering around a case until something shakes loose.So, armed with a new badge, a new truck and unofficially accompanied by his fugitive friend Nate Romanowski, Joe heads off to Yellowstone and discovers that there is way more to this case than anyone has told the press...****Free Fire is much more gritty and brutal than most of the books in the series. There are lots of descriptions of the beauty and wonder of Yellowstone and I would imagine if you have not been you would find yourself a little overwhelmed by the descriptions. If anything, C.J. Box has restrained himself in his descriptions of one of the most amazing places on the planet. The sheer size of the park becomes an issue. It reminded me of the Chee/Leaphorn books where long rides in the truck become a routine part of the story.For fear of spoilers I will not describe any more of the mystery, but I will say that the science of the park and the strange community that has developed around it make this a unique and fascinating book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A3IROENP39PO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004IE9QOA#wasThisHelpful","R1A3IROENP39PO","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a room-filling speaker, the kind of speaker that rocks out a large space, this is not your speaker. But, if space is a premium, for whatever reason,  and you are in the market for a very small speaker that makes a comparatively large amount of noise this may be your speaker.This little cube measures about 1.6 inches on each side, comes with a little carabiner so that you can clip it to a backpack and listen as you hike. It also comes with a mini-USB cable to charge it.The manufacturer claims it is waterproof (and show pictures of it in water). I will take their word for it. Four sides are covered with a rubberized material. The hole to charge the speaker has a little rubberized door that I have a hard time sealing shut (although my daughter does not - there must be a trick that I do not understand).This speaker comes in four colors: black, blue, pink and camo. Mine is camo and sometimes the pattern makes the buttons a little hard to see. Not impossible, but tricky.The same goes with pairing with my Samsung Galaxy 3. It does pair, but not as fast as other devices do. It usually takes more than one try and can take several.For the money, there are bigger speakers out there but if you travel a lot and just want a little music in the tent or the hotel room than this may be worth the loss of some volume for gain in space in your suitcase.I rate this speaker 4 stars out of 5. I took off a point for the issues with seeing the buttons and pairing with my phone.Note: I received a speaker in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RFV2R8IO67MK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XRK3OFS#wasThisHelpful","R2RFV2R8IO67MK","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The concept of a multiple USB wall charger is great for travelers since it is certainly hard to find enough outlets to plug in chargers for GPS systems, phones, kindles, travel batteries and Bluetooth headsets in a hotel room, especially if you are sharing your room.But, if you are like me than you are quickly discovering that your house and your office were not built to charge up all of the rechargeable devices that you have accumulated over the last couple of years. There just are not enough outlets in convenient places to charge up everything. The multi-port charger has quickly become an indispensable part of my daily tech life.The Aduro PowerUP charger is an attractive well-built device. I have 3 other multi-port chargers and they all lay on the desk on their sides. This one, however, is designed to stand up which does two things: it saves desktop space and it makes it easier to access the charger (the top USB ports anyway). The plug is removable so that it can be easily stored away for travel.The Aduro PowerUP comes in three different color schemes:1) black body with a grey face (pictured);2) white body with a grey face;3) black body with a blue face.I really have only one complaint about this device.  It has 6 ports with the middle two designed for the iPad and the iPhone. Those devices require more power to properly charge and those two slots are the only two that provide enough power to charge them at the normal pace. The other four slots will be slow or may not even be able to completely charge them. The other three chargers that I own all have chip technology that allows the device to determine the type of device that has been plugged in and then provide the correct amount of current. This one requires the user to make that determination and users who are not careful or well-informed may not get their devices charged properly.For that reason, I feel that I can only give this charger 4 stars out of 5.Note: I received a free Aduro PowerUP so that I could evaluate it in order to write an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R303FFS4XP5HEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VIOF4W6#wasThisHelpful","R303FFS4XP5HEZ","A1GARI2JT6EAWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GARI2JT6EAWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This scale can take weights up to 330 pounds. The booklet that comes with the scale notes that you should avoid weights above that on the scale, not because of the glass but because it can mess up the electronics underneath.The scale has a backlit display (about one inch tall) that is easy to read while you are standing on the scale.The scale can be adjusted by the push of a button to display weight in pounds, kilograms or in stones (it was news to me that anybody used ""stones"" anymore).The only negative is that this scale uses what most people would call ""watch batteries"" rather than AA or AAA batteries. Even if the watch batteries last longer than AAA batteries, most people have easy access to AAA batteries so they are much easier to replace.I rate this scale 4 out of 5 stars.

"TESTING THE BOSS is the sixth installment in Mallory Crowes contemporary, adult BILLIONAIRES IN THE CITY romantic, suspense series. This is CEO billionaire Luke Devereaux, and FBI agent Evelyn Prices storyline. Although TESTING THE BOSS can be read as a stand alone I would recommend reading the series in order as the threats and plots against the family continue to build throughout each storyline. Each of the storylines is interconnected with the characters crossing over between installments.Told from dual third person perspectives (Luke and Evelyn) TESTING THE BOSS is a revealing storyline that begins to expose the people behind the threats against the Devereaux family.  The group known as the Thirteen Stars, a white-collar criminal ring, has been trying to get Luke Devereaux on their side. With the assistance of the FBI, and the undercover presence of Evelyn Price, Luke tries to ferret out information about the high powered businesses and the people involved. What ensues is the collapse of the undercover operation and several attempts on Luke and Evelyns lives as someone is always one step ahead of Luke and Evelyns plans. Evelyn has her suspicions; Luke is oblivious but hints at a possible suspect; this reader was spot on with the guilty party(s) involved.The initial relationship between Luke and Evelyn is caustic and bitter, but the sexual tension runs high throughout the story. Evelyn is an FBI agent who wants nothing to do with privileged rich boys with too much time on their hands who want to play cops and robbers. Already recovering from a gunshot wound, Evelyn finds herself in New York babysitting Luke Devereaux while he tries to infiltrate the Thirteen Stars. Luke, on the other hand, takes an immediate liking to the acerbic FBI agent, and tries to break through Evelyns barriers and walled heart. The $ex scenes are intimate and passionate, although our heroine believes she has crossed the line between her job and her heart.The secondary characters include several of the previous storyline couples and characters: Emma Devareaux and Jace Lance: Michael Devereaux and Lori Briggs; and Lukes assistant Cali who keeps her finger on the pulse of everything in Lukes personal and business life.The world building continues to focus on the threats against the Devereaux family and their billion dollar enterprise DevX that provides cyber protection software to some of the largest defense contractors in the USA. The group known as the Thirteen Stars continues to pursue the Devereaux family and with Lukes storyline some of the missing information as to the who, what and why is slowly revealed. This particular ARC of the series began in book four  (Trusting the Boss).  TESTING THE BOSS ends on a bit of a cliffhanger.Mallory Crowes BILLIONAIRES IN THE CITY is a series focusing on white-collar crime, intrigue and high stakes revenge. There are moments of mystery and suspense, wrapped in a building romance between two people whose lives have crossed paths time and again.  The premise is entertaining, and full of twist and turns with plenty of drama, betrayal and emotion; the characters are likeable and well developed- strong willed and independent thinkers; the romance is a build up to a profession of love. Mallory Crowes BILLIONAIRES IN THE CITY is a high stakes, who-dun-it, where revenge is the ultimate sin.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13DSF0XTYK8VX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LQOWAM#wasThisHelpful","R13DSF0XTYK8VX","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.25 stars--PERFECTLY IMPERFECT is the latest stand alone novel by Harper Sloan.Told from dual first person points of view (Willow and Kane) PERFECTLY IMPERFECT is an emotional and heartbreaking storyline that will resonate with many readers who have issues of low self-esteem and negative body image. Our heroine Willow Tate is not perfect but she is perfect in the eyes of Hollywood heartthrob Kane Masters. Willow comes from a dysfunctional family wherein she has become the brunt of her stepfather, half sisters and ex-husbands brutal and emotionally humiliating verbal assaults. An accidental meeting, not once but twice, with the sexy actor/director Kane Masters throws Willows world upside down when he offers her everything that he is, and all that she could want.PERFECTLY IMPERFECT is a Cinderella-esque fairytale storyline about a woman who is barely surviving in a world of faux and plastic perfection as she works for her stepfathers modeling agency. Willows self-esteem and body image is so low that all of the negativity in her life has become a self-fulfilling prophecy wherein she becomes a target for all that is wrong in the world. The devastating death of her mother; her step-fathers hatred and half sisters vitriol attacks; a husband who despises the very air from which she breathes; and Willows subsequent emotional eating disorder have left our heroine on the verge of a divorce, and the brink of a personal breakdown.  Enter Kane Masters, the man whose own perfect image hides a secret that if revealed would destroy his career and that of someone else. Kane is a man whose need for Willow defies explanation- from the first time he saw her, Kane has become a man possessed in the hopes of something more.Willow is every woman who has ever hated herself; hated her looks, hated her body; hated the thought of facing another day surrounded by the perfection of every day life.  In the beginning, our heroine is a doormat for her familys attacks; she is a punching bag for their verbal and emotional abuse such that at times the attacks were overwhelming and unbelievable. Willow is at her lowest, and her self-deprecating insecurity knows no limits as it pertains to her own personal value and low self-worth as she traverses a world of black and white, with no color or expectations of future success. It will take the love of a man to show Willow that her true value does not come from the acceptance of other people, but from the acceptance of herself.PERFECTLY IMPERFECTs straddles a fine line with its veiled message to women everywhere. Although beauty is in the eye of the beholder, what does it say when a woman must find her own self worth from the acceptance and attention of a beautiful man.  PERFECTLY IMPERFECT is a story of fiction meant to entertain, and I doubt that the author meant anything other than to tell a story about overcoming issues of self-esteem to be accepted and loved by others and ones self, but the fact that Willows slow climb out of the abyss is a direct result of unconditional love from the perfect man is definitely a fairytale for the 21st century.  The premise is engaging, emotional and intense; the characters are colorful and heartbreaking; the romance is a slow build to a happily ever after.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MCS3P6BEOBRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1518893414#wasThisHelpful","R1MCS3P6BEOBRV","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE IDEA OF YOU is the fourth full length installment in Darcy Burkes contemporary adult Ribbon Ridge romance series focusing on the Archer family sextuplets (Evan, Sara, Alex, Tori, Kyle & Liam) of Ribbon Ridge and their younger brother Hayden. The Archer family owns several successful breweries and pubs, and most of the siblings currently play a role in the daily business operations at the request of Alex Archer, who took his own life after suffering years of physical and emotional disabilities.  The Archers are a close knit family but due to the inherent and potential issues with multiple births-and in this case 6 babies at once-the now adult sextuplets are not without some emotional, mental and physical problems including OCD, Aspergers syndrome, SPD (Sensory Processing Disorder), chronic lung disease, addiction and depression. This is IT specialist Evan Archer, and actress Alaina Pierces storyline. The series should be read in order as each timeline follows on the events of the previous book.Told from alternating third person points of view THE IDEA OF YOU follows academy award winning actress Alaina Pierce as she escapes the Hollywood paparazzi and a major scandal, for the peace and solitude of Ribbon Ridge. Alaina, on the advice of friend and producer Sean Hennessey (When Love Happens #3) heads to the quiet town of Ribbon Ridge to take stock of her personal life and what it is she wants for the future. Alainas arrival at the Archer homestead finds our heroine falling for the shy, quiet and withdrawn Evan Archer-a man whose emotional and mental fragility takes the guise of Aspergers syndrome.  Asperger syndrome (AS) is an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), one of a distinct group of complex neurodevelopment disorders characterized by social impairment, communication difficulties, and restrictive, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior. (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/asperger/detail_asperger.htm).  What ensues is a building relationship between Alaina  a woman who thrives on the stage and in the spotlight; and Evan a man who becomes overwhelmed in social and crowded situations. The $ex scenes are intimate, seductive and hot.Addressing Aspergers Syndrome, Darcy Burke touches upon Evans sensory overload-the noise, the crowds, his inability to read social cues, as well as his issues with touch.  THE IDEA OF YOU looks at the struggles of one couple as they navigate the potential minefield of a personal and sexual relationship. It is never easy entering into a new relationship, but for someone like Evan, the experience can set off a whole new level of difficulties and negative behavior.THE IDEA OF YOU is an interesting and entertaining storyline about family; the characters are real; the romance is seductive; the happily ever after, although not unexpected, felt a little rushed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V1BO1Q2QWOVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z9DP6D4#wasThisHelpful","R2V1BO1Q2QWOVQ","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4.25 stars--PIA DOES HOLLYWOOD is the November 2015 novella in Thea Harrisons adult, ELDER RACES paranormal, romance series. This is the continuing story of Dragos Cuelebre, Lord of the Wyr, and his mate Pia Cuelebre. PIA DOES HOLLYWOOD  is the second installment in Theas three story novella series focusing on the Cuelebre family-Dragos, Pia and Liam. I would recommend reading this particular novella series in order for cohesion and history,  although some background about the original series is beneficial for overall enjoyment.Told from dual third person perspectives (Dragos and Pia) PIA DOES HOLLYWOOD follows Pia as she must endure a week long diplomatic visit with the Queen of the Light Fae, Tatiana. Not wanting to leave his mate vulnerable, Dragos heads to California, to keep an eye out for his beautiful mate. But all does not go according to plan, when Dragos finds himself the victim of an assault and the resulting side affects find our ancient leader losing a little bit of himself to the dark side. What ensues are Pias attempts to save her husband, while the Light Fae struggle with the attack against their own kind.PIA DOES HOLLYWOOD is an erotic romance storyline that focuses on family, relationships, and the highly, sexual nature of Dragos and Pias love. Dragos is the Lord of the Wyr, and with it comes great responsibility but none more so than the protection of his family.  The premise is entertaining with a little bit of mystery and suspense; the characters are familiar, colorful and animated; the romance is provocative and steamy. PIA DOES HOLLYWOOD reveals a little bit about the future; whats in store for the Cuelebre family and the Lord of the Wyr will have any parent cringing in anticipation.Thea Harrison continues to tease our imagination with her amazing series of the ELDER RACES.

"3.5 stars---DARK ALPHAS CLAIM is the first installment in Donna Grants Reapers adult, paranormal/fantasy romance series. The REAPERS is a spin off from Donnas DARK KINGS series which is a spinoff from Donnas DARK WARRIOR series which in turn is a spin off from Donnas DARK SWORD series- all set in the Highlands of Scotland. You do not have to have read any of the previous series to understand the premise but there is a slight cross over with the half-Fae/Warrior Phelan and his Druid wife from the Dark Warriors series; a mention of the Dragon Kings; and several connections to Rhi and her protector . This is Reaper Baylon, and half Fae Jordyns storyline.Told from several third person perspectives DARK ALPHAS CLAIM introduces the Reapers-a group of Dark and Light Fae, selected by Death, to do her bidding. The Reapers are not harbingers of death, but are tasked with destroying the Light and Dark Fae who have crossed a line from which there is no return.  When a message from Death orders the termination of all half Fae humans,  the Reapers set about in search of those targeted for death. But none of the Reapers are able to carry out the order, and soon discover that the order does not come the person in charge. What ensues is an instant lust to love relationship between Baylon and Jordyn when Baylon is unable to kill the woman with whom he was falling in love- a relationship forbidden by Death-no Reaper is allowed to enter into a relationship or fall in love.The background of DARK ALPHAS CLAIM and thusly the Reapers Series is similar to Donnas Dark Kings series. In the case of the REAPERS, one of their own fell in love, and with it came the knowledge of the forbidden, and in doing so, lost the woman with whom he had wanted to spend eternity. And similarly to the Dark Kings, betrayal and vengeance are the focus of the series when someone long thought gone returns from the past to avenge the death of his mate and his own sentence to the beyond. And saying this, the conflict is all too familiar, as is the need for revenge.DARK ALPHAS CLAIM is a quick read; not quite a full-length storyline that gives the reader some of the background and history of the inception of the Reapers, and their connections to the Light and Dark Fae. The Dark Fae are growing in numbers, power, and a need for revenge; they have declared war and the Reapers, the Dark Kings, the Warriors and the Light Fae have been targeted for extinction. Some of the events in DARK ALPHAS CLAIM run parallel to the events in PASSION IGNITES (Dark Kings #7).DARK ALPHAS CLAIM is an entertaining read but one that felt all too familiar from the author.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21AOSAAZE0UA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0122S019C#wasThisHelpful","R21AOSAAZE0UA9","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 stars--MIND GAMES  is the second installment in Laura K. Curtiss contemporary, adult HARP SECURITY romantic suspense series focusing on the elite security team at HARP Security. This is security specialist Eric Sorensen, and scientist/researcher Dr. Jane Evanss storyline. MIND GAMES can be read as a stand alone without any difficulty.Told from dual third person perspectives (Eric and Jane) MIND GAMES focuses on the hunt for the people trying to kidnap Dr. Jane Evans. As the deadline approaches to reveal the latest drug for schizophrenia and mental disorders, threats and kidnapping attempts against Jane, as the lead researcher on Project Calm, begin to escalate. Enter Eric Sorensen-HARP security specialist-and a former acquaintance and college mate of Jane Evans. What ensues is a storyline that finds Jane abducted, imprisoned and forced to work on a designer drug for the Mexican cartels.The romance aspect of the storyline finds Jane as the aggressor. She is a woman who wants something from Eric, but Eric isnt open to a one-night stand, and his job places everyone he loves in danger. The $ex scenes are limited without the use of graphic sexual imagery but I thought something was missing between Eric and Jane: perhaps it was the fact that our couple were separated for a good portion of the storyline.MIND GAMES is a storyline with a very large ensemble cast of secondary and supporting characters including several of Erics fellow security specialists-all former military personnel-as well as HARP Security owner Nash Harper. We are also introduced to a number of Janes fellow researchers, including Dani-a young, twenty five year old woman who has gone missing in the days preceding Janes abduction; and Clive Handler-the man in charge of Project Calm. The requisite evil comes in many, many forms as Jane finds herself in the middle of the Mexican jungle running from drug lords, guerilla super-soldiers, and a human trafficking ring.The world building focuses on several plot lines wherein our heroine attempts to uncover the truth, run for her life, and save the lives of several other victims of the Mexican cartels.  A good portion of the storyline finds Eric and his comrades searching for Jane; and Jane stalling for time hoping for someone to come to her rescue. Janes questioning of the guards finds our heroine retrieving insider information that may come in handy to take down the people involved. There is a bit of a twist with the reveal but it wasnt difficult to deduce the person behind the attempts on Janes life.MIND GAMES is an action-packed story of suspense with a little science fiction via the development of a super soldier through drugs and hypnotherapy. The premise is entertaining and intriguing, if somewhat over the top; the characters are numerous, colorful and animated; the romance is a slow build to a happily ever after. I will add that I miss Mac Brody from book one ECHOES-there was a definite negative vibe between Nash and Mac, and I was hoping for some information or resolution to their tepid relationship.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IQBD4WP1TIPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPNRAE8#wasThisHelpful","R1IQBD4WP1TIPY","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.75 stars---DARE TO SEDUCE is the eight installment and latest novella in Carly Phillips contemporary adult DARE TO LOVE erotic romance series focusing on the Dare cousins and siblings. This is Lucy Dare one of the New York Dare cousins, and professional chef and restaurateur Max Savages storyline. DARE TO SEDUCE can be read as a stand alone without any difficulty. We were first introduced to the Dare cousins in Dare To Surrender (Dare to Love #3)-the July 2014 installment in the multi-authored 1001 Dark Nights novella series- and Dare to Submit (Dare to Love #4).Told from dual third person perspectives (Lucy and Max) DARE TO SEDUCE is a friends to lovers/second chance storyline that focuses on the building relationship between Lucy and Max. Max has always loved Lucy, but growing up neighbors and best friends with Lucys brothers there was always an understood hands-off policy between Lucy and Max. But years passed, lives changed, losses and other relationships carried forward until present day where Lucy and Max found themselves together at Decklan Dares engagement party to Amanda Collins (Dare to Love #4), wherein Lucys current boyfriend found himself on the outside looking in when Max and Lucy rekindled their long fought urges and need for one another. What ensues is the building relationship between Lucy and Max, and Lucys need to push Max away at every available opportunity.DARE TO SEDUCE is an erotic storyline; a tale about two people who have loved one another but never took a chance on a happily ever after. Lucy had already lost too many people in her life, and wasnt willing to risk her heart for fear of losing the only man she has ever loved. Max is a man whose childhood left our hero longing for a relationship with a woman he could love but Lucy kept Max at arms length as their relationship began to grow. Saying that, I felt the love between Lucy and Max was more one-sided Lucys inability to let go of the past pushed everyone (including family and friends) to the periphery of her relationship needs. The $ex scenes are erotic and intense. Max likes to dominate both in and out of the bedroom.The secondary and supporting characters include Lucys brothers and their respective mates:  Gabe and Isabelle; Decklan and Amanda. We are also introduced to Maxs new business partner and executive chef Sebastian Del Toro; as well as Maxs parents who want to rekindle their relationship with their only son.DARE TO SEDUCE is a quick and enjoyable read that takes the reader into the world of the other Dare family: the cousins to the original Dare to Love series family; and the Dares who are members of an elite BDSM club and the Club Eden hotel and nightclub chain. The premise is entertaining; the characters have a history together therefore the build up to love is quick but not necessarily easy; the happily ever after fast forwards the storyline one year wherein Lucy and Max are in need of an extended vacation and some time away. Carly Phillips DARE TO LOVE series is a delight-no matter which side of the family youre on !!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DPMN27TVM22F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=194228876X#wasThisHelpful","R2DPMN27TVM22F","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.25 stars--NOTE: If you have not read book one BLOW there may be some spoilers in my review.REVIEW:  CRUSH is the second installment in Kim Karrs contemporary, adult Tainted Love romantic, suspense duology focusing on attorney Logan McPherson, the woman he loves Elle Sterling, and the Boston Irish Mob. Their continuing story begins immediately after the events of book one.  Elles sister Lizzy is still missing, and Lizzys husband Michael looks guiltier as the days go by. To ensure the safety of her niece Clementine, Elle continues to stay in contact with her brother-in-law Michael-placing herself in the direct line of fire.Told from alternating first person points of view (Elle and Logan) CRUSH focuses on the Boston Irish Mob; the potential for a drug war between controlling factions; and the possible re-emergence of a long forgotten Irish cartel. Threats against Elles life, and Michaels confrontational attitude have Logan opening up an investigation of his own only to uncover a more dangerous, darker threat to everyone that he loves. To protect Elle from the madness that is his life, Logan will walk away from the only woman he has ever loved. A life for a life never felt more ominous or more of a threat.Logan is an alpha male; a protective lover whose guilt eats away at his heart and soul. Elle is a strong, female heroine who at times pushed a few buttons as it pertained to her own safety. Together, our couple struggles to rise above the murky waters of betrayal and revenge, family solidarity, and the Boston Irish Mob.CRUSH is a roller coaster of emotions; an action packed story of suspense and intrigue where passions meets resistance; where vengeance is a promise; where the sins of the past all but destroy the present and the future. The challenges and threats come in various incarnations-some the embodiment of Satan himself. The $ex scenes are intense, provocative and romantic-there is no denying the sexual chemistry between our leading couple. Kim Karr has another hit!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WRPSKDSZMXZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014EBIZMA#wasThisHelpful","R2WRPSKDSZMXZ6","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.25 stars--- I DO is the third  (and final?) installment in A.J. Pines contemporary, new adult IF ONLY erotic, romance series focusing on a group of friends. I DO looks at twenty four hours in the life of seven friends on the eve of Duncan and Elainas wedding in Elainas home country of Greece. When Scotsman Duncan sends a cryptic message to Elaina apologizing for not getting on the plane, his friends go in search of the wayward groom while the ladies remain behind wondering where everything went wrong. I DO can be read as a stand alone without too much difficulty; any important information is revealed where necessary but I will add that there is quite a bit of backstory and history between the friends that is important to the storyline. I will admit I have not read the first two installments and felt I was missing something-a prior connection to the characters- throughout the story.Told from seven third person perspectives (all 7 friends) I DO is an ensemble storyline that focuses on the relationships, history, emotional happiness and heartbreak between seven friends whose own relationships with one another are beginning to implode.  On the eve of Duncan and Elainas wedding, emotions run high as friendships and relationships run a fine line between hatred and love; Elaina believes Duncan is a runaway groom: Jordans prior relationship with Griffin keeps Noah wondering if Jordan made the right choice; Maggie makes a decision about her future with Griffin; and Miles is looking for something more when a Greek chef with American roots sets about to seduce our only single male. I will add that although the storyline has seven points of view, and four different but converging relationship paths, there is never any confusion to the who, what or why.I DO is an entertaining storyline with realistic friendships and relationships-not everything is hearts and flowers; mistakes have been made; lines have been crossed. These friends have issues with one another- too much history to be forgotten; too many broken promises and broken hearts. The premise is engaging and at times I began to wonder if there would ever be a happily ever after for any of our couples as the drama of everyday life seemed, at times, to be overwhelming.  The characters are passionate, emotional and real but all have an untoward propensity for casting a negative aura over their past, present and future situations ; the happily ever afters are intimate and revealing. The epilogue fast forwards the series one year wherein we get up close and personal in each couples lives.A.J. Pine invites the reader into an emotional storyline about seven friends whose connections, friendships, relationships and loves, intertwine and weave a path of memories and happily ever afters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UBTVQOT62R6Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015MPPDMM#wasThisHelpful","R3UBTVQOT62R6Z","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"PASSION IGNITES is the seventh full length installment in Donna Grants adult DARK KINGS fantasy/paranormal romance series focusing on the Dragon Kings and the women they love. The DARK KINGS is a spinoff from Donna Grants  DARK WARRIOR series which in turn is a spin off from Donnas DARK SWORD series- all set in the Highlands of Scotland.  This is Claret dragon king Thorn, and American masseuse Lexi. PASSION IGNITES can be read as a stand alone but for cohesion and backstory I recommend reading the series in order especially the latter books as there is an on-going build up towards war.Told from several third person perspectives PASSION IGNITES focuses on the coming war between the Dark Kings, the Warriors, the Light Fae, and their mutual enemy the Dark Fae. The Dark Fae and their King Taraeth, along with Ulrik the Silver King and his uncle Mikkel have declared war on the Dragon Kings by exposing the existence of the supernatural species to the world, and with it comes the possible demise of the human population.  The last wars between man and the world of the paranormal saw a great loss of life on all sides-but Ulrik wants revenge against King Constantine of the Dragon Kings; Mikkel wants to become King of the Silvers, and the Dark Fae want to rule Scotland and the rest of the world.Lexi is an American tourist in Scotland whose best friend Christine was murdered by the red eyes. The red eyes are the Dark Fae, and Lexi has remained in Scotland to hunt the people responsible for Christines murder. But unbeknownst to Lexi, she is being stalked-not only by the ones she calls the red eyes but also by two of the Dragon Kings-Thorn and Darius. Each evening Thorn and Darius patrol the streets of Edinburgh killing the very thing that is stalking Lexi-the Dark Fae. What ensues is a building relationship between Thorn and the American woman who would one day become his mate but Thorn isnt about to expose Lexi to Constantine, or the memories of his past. Thorn will have Lexis memories erased sending her back to America and away from his heart.PASSIONG IGNITES has a large ensemble cast of characters including many of the Warriors, Druids, Dragons Kings, and  the Light and Dark Fae. The Light Fae royal guardian Rhiannon (Rhi) continues to play a pivotal role throughout the series as she straddles the line between Dark and Light.  If you are familiar with the series, Rhi was once in love with a Dark King who all but destroyed her heart and her soul. Donna Grant continues to leave a trail of hints and clues as to Rhis former lover-a Dragon King whose relationship with Rhi is only known to a few.  There is also the building relationship between Rhi and the Dark Fae male known as Balladyn-once a Light Fae who is now ensconced totally in the Dark.  Balladyn has been in love with Rhi for thousands of years, and with it comes the ultimate betrayal when Rhi found herself tortured and imprisoned by the man hoping to turn Rhi to the Dark side. As the war begins to escalate the Dark Faes numbers increase exponentially, and with it the risk to the human population multiplies. The unsolved murders in Scotland have people on alert, but the Faes ability to seduce their prey, find the humans oblivious to their own demise.Donna Grants DARK KINGS series is a flight into the fantastic; her characters are colorful, engaging, impassioned and intense. You will be seduced into the world of the Dragon Kings, the Fae and the mystical Warriors who have vowed to protect the world against the Dark and the Silver. And speaking of Silver, Ulriks  personality continues to reveal a softer side to the once mighty Silver King-perhaps there is a chance of redemption for a man who lost everything to a human woman that sparked with wars between the supernatural races.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CHZW3PBJ3GN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250071941#wasThisHelpful","R3CHZW3PBJ3GN1","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 stars--HARD BEAT is the seventh installment in K.Brombergs contemporary, adult Driven erotic, romance series. This is war correspondent Tanner Thomas, and photojournalist Beaux BJ Croslyns storyline. HARD BEAT can be read as a stand alone without any difficulty. Tanner Thomas is Rylee Thomas-Donavans brother-the heroine in K.Brombergs original Driven Trilogy.Told from first person point of view (Tanner Thomas) HARD BEAT follows Tanner as he returns to the Middle East following the death of his previous partner (and photographer) and best friend Stella. Stella was killed while on assignment with Tanner, and Tanner is having a difficult time accepting what was and what has to be. Enter Beaux Croslyn-Tanners new photographer and partner-and a woman with too many secrets that she is not willing to share.  We learn very little about our leading heroine, and her secrets are the catalyst that sets into motion Tanners downward spiral.The relationship between Tanner and Beaux begins acrimoniously-Tanner wants nothing to do with his new photographer- a woman who represents everything he lost-but a woman whose secrets, and late night solo excursions find our hero fearing for the death of another woman with whom he has fallen in love. The banter is angry, aggressive and confrontational, and sets the tone for much of their combative relationship.  The $ex scenes are seductive and provocative. I will add that I applaud K. Brombergs shift away from the sexually graphic and over-the-top language between our leading couple as found in her earlier storylines. There comes a time when certain words dont belong in a romance storyline.The secondary characters include Rylee and Colton Donavan-although most of the interaction is through phone conversations but we do get some one on one time between the characters. We are also introduced to Tanners boss Rafe, and a few of his fellow war correspondents and news reporters in the Middle East.There are several twists and turns throughout the storyline especially near the end when everything goes to h*ll for our storyline hero. The world building focuses on the element of danger, suspense, destruction and potential threats to everyones lives-it is a storyline set in the war-torn Middle East where life is as fragile as a piece of glass.HARD BEAT has moments of heartbreak and tears; emotional breakdowns and tragic loss. The premise is a roller coaster of unanswered questions and hidden agendas; the characters are charismatic and real; but in the end, there is a happily ever after for two people whose paths ventured off in different directions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NKXG43UJ8U5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI02BRY#wasThisHelpful","R2NKXG43UJ8U5K","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

What ensues is the search for the people responsible, and a building relationship between Karen and Tucker.EDGE OF DANGER is an action packed, fast paced, lust to love storyline that focuses on power, greed, money and betrayal. While Tucker and his men remain hidden, Karen must play go-between in order to help ferret out the person(s) responsible for the attacks and the death of Max Southers. While in seclusion Tucker and Karens relationship will become personal, and in the end, could very well be used against Tucker if something were to happen to their kidnapped victim.  The $ex scenes are romantic, erotic and intense. Tucker is a man who knows how to please the woman with whom he is falling in love.The relationship between Tucker and Karen is a quick enemies to friends to lovers storyline-a storyline that takes our couple from strangers to lovers in a matter of hours to days.

The requisite evil has many faces, and a number of connections within the various agencies and the political elite.EDGE OF DANGER is a story with suspense, mystery, action and romance.

"3.75 stars--  BURN IT UP is the third installment in Cara McKennas contemporary, adult DESERT DOGS erotic, romantic suspense series focusing in the town of Fortuity, Nevada, and a group of motorcycle riding friends who call themselves the Desert Dogs. This is bar owner Casey Grossier, and new mom Abilene Prices storyline.  BURN IT UP and the Desert Dogs series is NOT a series about a motorcycle club, but a series about a family of brothers and their friends who like to ride.SOME BACKGROUND: Eclipse Resorts and Casinos has made many enemies in the sleepy, small town of Fortuity, Nevada as they forge ahead with plans to build and open a new casino.  Most of the townsfolk have some issues with the company, and with it will comes threats of a personal nature.Told from third person point of view BURN IT UP follows the building relationship between Casey Grossier, and his employee Abilene Price. Abilene is a new mom; a single mother who has worked for Casey for close to a year, and with it comes feelings and emotions between the couple as Casey finds himself playing house with the woman and her child. Casey has grown to love the baby since she was born, but knows that to get involved with his employee could open a new can of problems. When Abilene discovers her ex, and the babys father, is about to be released from jail, Casey brings together his brother Vince, Miah Church, Raina Harper and Duncan Welch to form a protective circle around the woman with whom he is falling in love.The relationship between Casey and Abilene begins as employer and employee, eventually turning to friendship than lovers. But Casey and Abilene both have dark and dangerous pasts, and it is those secrets that they keep from one another that will force Abilene to look at Casey in a completely different light. The $ex scenes are exploratory and seductive but ultimately a little boring.The secondary and supporting characters include all of the previous storyline couples as well as Don and Christine Church, and Abilenes ex boyfriend James Ware.  The characters are raw, real and not without some skeletons in the closets.  The world building continues to focus on the new Resort and Casino, their problems with the people of Fortuity, Nevada, and to what extremes the company will go to, to ensure their plans reach fruition.BURN IT UP is a story of mystery and suspense; secrets and lies; betrayal and heartbreak. The premise is engaging; the characters are colorful and entertaining; the romance was a slow build to a happily ever after-for now.But I did have some issues with the heroine as it pertained to her ability to judge others for their sins when her own sins were just as dark and dirty. Her lack of self confidence; her ability to manipulate others; her perceived sense of right and wrong; and her overall naivety was a bit of a distraction-she was a difficult heroine to like.  There was also an issue with the resolution of the original conflict it was unexciting and dull- but I suspect there is more to the story that has yet to be told.  The introduction of a new conflict has fired up some heartbreak and more questions; the town of Fortuity will lose one of their own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z0HGI8TZOBES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S75RY9U#wasThisHelpful","R1Z0HGI8TZOBES","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The lone $ex scene is intimate without the over the top erotic factor.Because the novella is such a short read, the focus of the storyline is the building relationship between Simon and Adam, and Adams attempts to break through Simons frozen heart. We learn a little bit about Simons past-what he suffered and why he has chosen to remain alone.DONT STOP BELIEVING is a sweet story; a wonderful look at two people who find their forever in a snow storm, and a town that comes together to celebrate Christmas Day.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36O1M7ZHX3WLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016J6X7QW#wasThisHelpful","R36O1M7ZHX3WLE","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"MY OVERVIEW:  WHAT HAPPENS UNDER THE MISTLETOE is a collection of four holiday-themed historical romance novellas: two storylines focus on second chance romances, while the other two look at cases of mistaken beliefs and a case of mistaken identity.  Because of the length of each novella, all of the romances are insta-lust or love; the $ex scenes are limited without the use of graphic sexual language.  All of the leading characters befit the time period, while only one novella uses language of the time.Anthologies are difficult to review due in part to a lack of previous knowledge when some of the novellas are part of an existing series. I am aware that Sabrina Jeffries and Karen Hawkinss offerings are part of ongoing series but I was unable to confirm the connection for Candace Camp or Meredith Duran.WHAT HAPPENS UNDER THE MISTLETOE is an entertaining anthology with Christmas/holiday themed novellas for your reading pleasure.THE HEIRESS AND THE HOTHEAD by Sabrina JeffriesREVIEW:THE HEIRESS AND THE HOTHEAD is a novella from Sabrina Jeffries SINFUL SUITORS historical romance series ( a spin off from the Dukes Men series). This is journalist/writer Lord Stephen Corry, and American heiress/mill owner Amanda Keanes storyline. Amanda is the sister of artist Jeremy Keane (The Art of Sinning #1).  THE HEIRESS AND THE HOTHEAD can be read as a stand alone without any difficulty.The storyline focuses on the unsafe working conditions in the cotton mills of England, and Stephens attempts to bring the atrocities to the publics attention by reporting and investigating the people and workers. Enter Amanda Keane, an American mill owner who views Stephens work as attacks against all mill owners including herself. But a mill fire finds our couple trapped following the rescue of a young boy, and a profession of love and a possible future are made in the heat of the moment.THE HEIRESS AND THE HOTHEAD is a quick read with a little bit of romance, conflict and a happily ever after. The premise is interesting with a holiday theme; the characters are familiar, colorful and entertaining; the romance is quick to develop- the lone $ex scene is mostly implied with no graphic imagery or text.TWELVE KISSES TO MIDNIGHT by Karen HawkinsREVIEW:  TWELVE KISSES TO MIDNIGHT is a Scottish, historical second chance romance between the Fourth Duke of Rothesay Marcus Sutherland, and Lady Kenna Montrose. The novella is part of Karen Hawkins  Oxenburg Princes series as Crown Prince Nikolai Romanovin, and Grand Duchess Natasha Nikolaevna play a small supporting role throughout the story. TWELVE KISSES TO MIDNIGHT can be read as a stand alone without any difficulty.The storyline focuses on the rekindling of a relationship between Kenna and Marcus that was destroyed ten years earlier through misunderstanding and male pride. A winter storm finds our couple trapped in a strangers bawdy love nest after Marcus is thrown from his horse on way to Kennas family cottage. What ensues are Kennas attempts at reconciliation, while Marcus continues to find fault with the way their previous relationship ended.  TWELVE KISSES TO MIDNIGHT finds our couple stranded together in a cottage completely bedecked for romance and $ex, including some fanciful and graphic paintings upon the walls.Karen Hawkins adds a little bit of fun and romance with the addition of TWELVE KISSES TO MIDNIGHT where the conflict between sparring lovers is easily resolved with a few well-chosen words leading to a happily ever after. Once again, the $ex scene is mostly implied with no graphic imagery or text. The characters are familiar and colorful; the storyline is entertaining- there is plenty of back and forth, accusations, and questions about love and loss.BY AN OTHER NAME by Candace CampREVIEW:BY ANY OTHER NAME by Candace Camp is a storyline of mistaken identity between Rylla Campbell and Gregory Rose. Dressed as a young man Rylla hunts for her runaway, missing eighteen year old in saloons and gaming halls wherein she will meet Gregory Rose-the man who will come to her aid, and steal her heart but a man who is lead to believe Rylla is someone else. With Gregorys help, Rylla goes in search of her brother only to discover that her brother is already on his way home.Candace Camp weaves a little bit of mystery and intrigue into an historical romance where our heroine fails to reveal her true identity allowing for a series of mishaps and perceived betrayal. The romance is played out while our couple are on the hunt; like the other storylines the $ex scene is mostly implied without the use of graphic language or imagery.SWEET RUIN by Meredith DuranREVIEW:SWEET RUIN by Meredith Duran is a storyline of second chances between Georgiana Trent, and Lucas Godwin. Two years earlier, Lucas walked out of Georgies life without saying good bye or an explanation as to why he ran. Fast forward to present day wherein Lucas has been hired by Georgies father to search for a stolen letter that may or may not be have taken by one of the holiday guests.  What ensues is a rekindling romance between Georgie and Lucas where the truth finds our heroine ready to move on from her family home.Meredith Duran weaves a Christmas tale of lost love,  intrigue and mystery where everyone is suspect in the case of a missing letter, but no one is aware that of the investigation or that anything is wrong. The collection of secondary and supporting characters reads like a game of CLUE but the guilty party has not returned home for the holidays.  Again, the lone $ex scene is mostly implied.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LLCCW8FBVNQR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCI7KK#wasThisHelpful","R2LLCCW8FBVNQR","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is TJ (Tate Jackson), and Cassie Jacksons storyline-a second chance at love and a happily ever after. UNION OF SIN can be read as a stand alone without any difficulty.

One year earlier, to keep his fantasies alive, TJ brought his wife into a different kind of sex club where things went from bad to worse in a short period of time. TJs need to punish himself for the wrongs against his wife found our hero destroying the love and the heart of the woman who calls to his soul. The seduction scenes are intriguing; the $ex scenes between our leading couple of impassioned and heartbreaking.The secondary and supporting characters include TJs Vault of Sin partners Leo, and girlfriend Shay ( A Shot of Sin #1), and Brian (aka Brute). Like many ensemble storylines of partnerships, the Leo and Brute play an integral role in TJs need to accept and understand his guilt and grief.  At times, the advice was harsh and real.UNION OF SIN is an emotional storyline. I may have shed a tear or three; I was a bit of a mess as I was pulled into the drama of one mans guilt, and the woman whose heartbreak was too much to bear. The premise is sensitive and profound; the characters are tragic, emotional and intense; the romance is a slow build to a happily ever after.  UNION OF SIN is an erotic look at two people whose love for one another is full of anguish and pain due to a misdirected guilt about the what ifs and whys.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NG0WMPFZODDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0163Y1SIE#wasThisHelpful","R3NG0WMPFZODDG","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.75 stars----THE FALL UP is a stand alone contemporary, adult romance from author Aly Martinez that focuses on two lost souls who found one another on the edge of a bridge one dark and lonely night. This is musician Levee Williams, and furniture builder Sam Riverss storyline.Told from dual first person perspectives (Levee and Sam) THE FALL UP focuses on recovery, acceptance, grief and letting go. For several nights, Sam had watched as a young woman in disguise returned to his bridge with what he believed were thoughts of suicide and ending her life.

Standing on the bridge together, Levee and Sam will discover that there is more to life when the one that you love is by your side. There is plenty of humor, sexual innuendo, friendly and sexy banter between Levee and Sam-something to offset what could have been a dark romantic storyline. The $ex scenes are intimate and seductive.There is a large ensemble cast of secondary and supporting characters including Levees best friend Henry; Sams BFF and lawyer Ryan, along with his sister Meg and Megs daughter Morgan. We are introduced to Sams supportive mother, and Levees less than enthusiastic parents. I am hoping that Henry, as well as Ryan each get their own storyline and a happily ever after.The world building focuses on grief, depression and recovery, and the people who are affected by the choices people make every day of their lives--Real life issues in a fictional storylineAly Martinezs THE FALL UP is amusing, impassioned, consuming and profound.

"3.5 stars----BREAK ME DOWN follows the D/s relationship between Domme Samantha Dunbar, and her reluctant submissive Gibson Andrews. Gibson is a dominant at the local BDSM Club-The Ranch- but his fantasies find our hero in a position of submission especially as it pertains to Samantha Dunbar-a Domme whose need to dominate and control is beyond anything Gibson has experienced.  What ensues is the break down of a mans control, and a womans emotional and psychological need to dominate.BREAK ME DOWN is a tale of erotica; of sexual, emotional and physical domination by a woman over a man with some dubious consent, and a rape fantasy with the female in the position of the aggressor. Gibson is a man with a past darkened by a controlling father; and Samantha is a woman whose past is mired in betrayal and abuse. Both our of leading characters act out their sexual aggression and fantasies  both in and out of the bedroom but for all intents and purpose I felt a line was crossed when the fantasies and sexual domination became more about the power over someone else. Rape is about power, control and anger, and in this, our heroine was acting out against her own perpetrators who, years earlier, took away Samanthas choices and control. The sado-masochist theme is strong throughout the storyline.  There is also a questionable scene where the safe word was ignored, and emotional threats against our hero, once again, stepped over the proverbial line.I have enjoyed Roni Lorens LOVING ON THE EDGE erotic romance series but BREAK ME DOWN was an uncomfortable read for me with so many questions of consent and coercion.  The use of force is questioned by the characters, and although the Domme, in the end, refuses to force her submissive, the fear and anxiety about the potential situation is a part of the storyline-none the less.BREAK ME DOWN is a sexually graphic storyline with contents that me be unsuitable for some readers. Gibson Andrews is a submissive who thrives on the pain inflicted by the woman that he loves; Samantha Dunbar is a Domme who must be in control and hold the power at all times but in the end, Sam knows when enough is enough.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WXM6N5D70GZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISEOM2C#wasThisHelpful","R2WXM6N5D70GZ5","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.75 stars---WALK THROUGH FIRE is the fourth installment in Kristen Ashleys contemporary, adult CHAOS erotic romance series focusing on the motorcycle club Chaos. This is event planner Millie Cross, and MC member Logan High Judds storyline-a second chance romance for two broken souls. WALK THROUGH FIRE can be read as a stand alone without any difficulty. Any important information from previous storylines is revealed where necessary.Told from first person point of view (Millie), as well as several third person perspectives including Logan, WALK THROUGH FIRE follows the rekindling of a love between two people whose lives were destroyed when Millie pushed Logan out of her life twenty years before. Now in the early fortys, Millie and Logan have once again crossed paths but Logans anger at Millie increases with every encounter and memory of the past. Millie wants to set the record straight why she walker away twenty years earlier but Logan wants nothing to do with the woman who broke his heart and destroyed his soul. But when a rival MC targets Millie, Logan is all about saving the first and only woman he has ever loved.The storylines follows the rebuilding of a friendship; a relationship that was destroyed when Millie discovered that she could not give Logan what it was he wanted in life. Millies decision destroyed both she and Logan, such that Millie never had another boyfriend and remained faithful to the only man she has ever loved. Logans hatred for Millie, and the resulting destruction has found our heroine persona non grata in the eyes of the Chaos MC. Millie was Logans old lady, and when she left she destroyed a good man whose life revolved around the woman that he loved. The $ex scenes are aggressive, erotic and intense. There is some dubious consent in the early pages of the storylines when our heroine gives into Logans demands and orders.WALK THROUGH FIRE has a large ensemble cast of secondary and supporting characters including Tabby and Shy (Own The Wind #1), Lanie and Hop (Fire Inside #2), and several members of the Chaos MC-Elivira and Malik; Boz, Hound, Big Petey, Tack and Tyra. We are introduced to Millies friends, employees, and her very protective sister Dottie and brother-in-law Alan who know that for Millie to walk away twenty years earlier has left a broken soul and deep emotional scars. And we cant forget about Cleo and Zadie; Chief and Poem.Told from memories of the past and present day text WALK THROUGH FIRE takes the reader on an emotional and heartbreaking journey of romance and love, revealing the growing love between two people meant to spend eternity in one anothers arms that was all but destroyed by a perceived betrayal and thoughts of what was to come. Logans treatment of Millie is heartbreaking, vicious and destructive.  The world building continues to focus on the Chaos MC, and an impending war with a rival MC for territory and power.I did have some issues with the storyline and there is some purposeful ambiguity in my thoughts to avoid spoilers but one in particular bothered me throughout the story:As is pertained to the reason Millie walked away. We are given no details or explanation. There was no mention of seeking help or trying to correct the problem-what was the issue? Could it have been corrected?  There are usually several methods to try and fix the problem but nothing was brought to light or attempted? It was as though our heroine gave up and walked into the sunset never to be loved or love again.WALK THROUGH FIRE is an entertaining and engaging storyline about two people given a second chance at romance and love. There is plenty of drama, palpable anxiety and tension, and sexual energy. The storyline conflict is multi-layered; Millies re-emergence into Logans life upends family, the MC, and Logans plans for the future. The premise is gripping and profound; the characters are emotional and impassioned; the happily ever is revealing and hopeful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P78EO4FNGQBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3E76II#wasThisHelpful","R3P78EO4FNGQBY","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Cara is an analyst for Dubois & Mellan, and the with the recent sale of the company to Branden Duke finds our heroine caught in a taboo relationship with her new boss, whom she first met at a gathering intended to introduce Branden to his new employees. What ensues is a highly sexual relationship between two people whose lives are connected by the past. Cara is the soul source of income and support for her mother and mentally ill brother since the death of her father, and with it comes the responsibility of both physical and emotional acceptance of what she is and is not capable of providing. Her position within Dubois & Mellan is a necessity but an affair with the new boss proves that nothing is secret or sacred in the workplace when threats, accusations and adulterated videos of Cara and Branden are used as leverage against our leading couple. Branden has begun an investigation into the financial assets of the company, and Cara has become the target of slander and office gossip while a stalker continues to threaten our leading couple.The relationship between Cara and Branden begins accidentally at a party to honour the new owner of Dubois and Mellan. Cara finds herself alone with a man she knows nothing about but a man who calls to her heart and soul.

The requisite evil has many faces. Cara's best friend Iris continues to push Cara to come out of her shell.The world building introduces the characters and players behind the scenes at Dubois & Mellan, and the loving relationship between Branden and his family. The witty text banter and phone calls are humorous and affectionate. The sibling interactions are familiar and warm hearted.FILTHY RICH is an easy read with drama, betrayal, mystery and suspense; the person responsible for the threats against Cara and Branden is unexpected, and not whom the reader may have been lead to believe. The premise is entertaining with scenes of drama, humour and a twist; the romance is erotic and not unexpected; the happily ever after is about to begin.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSFMI5VDOXZZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TCHXMHK#wasThisHelpful","RSFMI5VDOXZZ5","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Ghleannas brothers and Queen Rhiannon are well aware of Brams attraction to their sister and sister-in law, but Ghleanna is oblivious to the males wants and needs. While under house arrest at the bottom of the ocean, Bram and Ghleannas relationship becomes sexual wherein our couple soon realize that mating is not far behind.DRAGON ON TOP is a story with all of G.A.Aikens humor and snark; witty banter and family dysfunction that only dragon shifters and their kin are capable of doing. Their love for one another, their fierce protective natures, their interactions with other dragons and humans, as well as their need to defend family and friend is equal to the antics and ability to kill anyone who betrays the Royal line.  We get a glimpse at Ghleannas family dynamics including her relationship with her infamous father Aileen the Whore; and her embarrassment and humiliation with her fathers reputation and past.If you are a fan of G.A.Aikens DRAGON KIN series, DRAGON ON TOP is an extra storyline that focuses on the previous generation of dragon shifters.

Uriel has no desire to find the human female, as she is the mother of the half-breed Jinn Laylah (Devoured by Darkness 7) who currently guards a most precious child in the hopes of preventing a supernatural war.  What ensues is a trip between portals and worlds for Uriel and Kata as they battle Katas vampire turned twin in their search for a way home.Alexandra Ivy adds a little bit of mischief with Yannah, Levets demonic and future girlfriend, as she plays tour guide and matchmaker between Uriel and Kata. Kata wants nothing to do with another controlling or manipulative vampire, but Uriel recognizes that Kata is his mate and will do everything to protect the woman with whom he will fall in love.DARKNESS ETERNAL is a quick read; a fast paced storyline of insta-love between two unlikely people that adds a little bit of color, humor and history to the series as it approaches the final installment.

If this is your first DRAGON KIN read, I would suggest going back and reading the series in order as so much family history builds throughout the storylines and each successive novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYZAUFDIM8887/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TE6PH9K#wasThisHelpful","RYZAUFDIM8887","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"3.75 stars---FIRE INSIDE is the second installment in Kristen Ashleys contemporary, adult CHAOS  MC erotic romance series. This is Chaos enforcer Hop Kincaid, and PR consultant Lanie Herons storyline. FIRE INSIDE can be read as a stand alone without any difficulty. Any important information from the previous storyline is revealed where necessary.Told from first person point of view (Lanie) FIRE INSIDE follows the building relationship between Lanie and Hop. Lanies history with the Chaos MC has resulted in the near death of her best friend Tyra (Tacks old lady), and with it comes the guilt and knowledge that she placed her best friend in harms way. Lanie had refused to listen to reason, and found herself caught between the man she loved and the friend she didnt want to lose. Fast forward several years, and Lanie finds herself looking for a one-night stand with the CHAOS enforcer Hop Kincaid, never thinking to lose her heart to another alpha, bad boy. What ensues is Hops seduction of Lanie as Lanie continues to battle her inner demons, the guilt about the attempt on Tyras life, and a family history of betrayal and heartbreak.The storyline conflict focuses on Lanies inability to move forward following the murder of her fianc, and the near death of both Lanie and her best friend Tyra. Lanie and Hops relationship begins to venture into a sense of permanency but Lanie doesnt want anyone at CHAOS to know about her relationship with Hop-a secret everyone knows but the two people in charge. The $ex scenes are intimate and erotic; Hop knows his way around a womans body and her heart.FIRE INSIDE is a story about family, love, betrayal and friendship. The premise is engaging; the characters animated; the happily ever after very sweet and predictable,  but saying that FIRE INSIDE is more of a story of erotic romance than it is about the CHAOS MC.  The storyline focuses more on the building relationship; Hop and Lanies pasts and dysfunctional family chaos but had very little to do with Club business except by way of mention and the build up to a show down with Benito Valenzuela. I will also add there was quite a bit of duplicity and redundancy in the storyline text-something I think should have been caught by a good editor or beta reader.The CHAOS series by Kristen Ashley is not (so far) a graphically violent series. Much of the violence remains in the background or implied. I have read some series where the violence, blood shed and abuse against women is very explicit and ultimately very difficult for some readers to absorb. Kristen Ashley writes a series about alpha males and the women they love. All of Kristens men are protectors, lovers, bad boys and hard, but not so hard that their softer sides are easily reached and caressed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K2P1DOTFZZIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455534188#wasThisHelpful","R1K2P1DOTFZZIH","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

THE PLAYERS CLUB series is a spinoff from Erikas erotic romance THE MARRIAGE DIARIES series.Told from dual third person perspectives (Jase and Kendall) PLAYING WITH SEDUCTION follows the slow seduction of Kendall Shaw by Jase Burns.  For several photography sessions Jase (who is eight years younger than Kendall) has been one of Kendalls models for a romance cover shoot and has figured prominently in all of Kendalls fantasies.

Following a ten year marriage that ended in divorce, Kendall is ready to settle down and start a family but Jase isnt ready for a future with a family and kids. What ensues is Jases seduction of Kendall for a friends with benefits /casual arrangement that soon turns into something more.The relationship between Kendall and Jase is one of immediate attraction;  a sexually palpable energy with plenty of insta-lust, sexual situations, and an invitation to the Players Club where Kendall discovers that the man who stars in all of her fantasies is the man who will bring out the sexual side she thought lost and dormant. The $ex scenes are passionate and sensual although tame in comparison to some of Erikas previous storylines. The Players Club does not figure prominently in the series or storyline but is a point (and place) where all of the stories connect.  The secondary characters include the previous storyline couples as well as the introduction of a man whom Kendall met on-line and believes could possibly be her future husband and mate.The world building focuses on Kendalls boudoir photography business, as well as the sexual awakening of our leading heroine.

Kendalls doubts and anxiety about their age difference plays a significant factor in the relationship dynamics for our heroine.PLAYING WITH SEDUCTION is a quick and enjoyable read; a story of insta-lust/love where two people with different objectives find a future with one another.  The premise is engaging, promising and enjoyable; the characters are impassioned, cleverly written, and inspiring; the romance is seductive.  The happily ever after is not unexpected but I will add that the rush to the finish is a little disappointing and too predictable.

"MIDDLE OF KNIGHT is the second installment in Jewel E.Anns contemporary adult JACK AND JILL romantic, suspense series focusing on thirty year old twins Jillian and Jack Knight (aka Jessica and Jude Day). Their continuing story finds hero and heroine looking towards a future that doesnt include their past. But the past has a habit of breaking free and threatening any chance of future happiness when Jack (Jude) finds himself falling in love with an older woman whose own past continues to haunt her present; and memories of the past continue to haunt Jillian(Jessica Day) Knight. MIDDLE OF KNIGHT should not be read as a stand alone as each installment builds upon the previous storyline.Told from alternating timelines-past and present- as well as alternating between dual third person perspectives (Jack and Jill), MIDDLE OF KNIGHT follows three intersecting paths: Jills past and history with the love of her life Dr.Luke Jones: Jacks relationship with an older divorcee-Ryn Middleton- whose abusive ex still has some semblance of control over his former wife and daughter; and Jill who has found herself falling in love with a man who does not have long to live.MIDDLE OF KNIGHT is an emotional storyline about two siblings who are hiding in plain sight; a witness protection program of sorts where Jessica and Jude Day are now living as Jack and Jill Knight in a new town, a new state with new identities and new pasts. But our siblings want a future that does not involve lies, secrets or threats against their lives, and MIDDLE OF KNIGHT finds Jack Knight looking towards a happily ever after with the woman that he loves; and Jill Knight pining for the man she left behind. While Jills present focuses on the few remaining days and hours of her relationship with AJ Monaghan, the reader is pulled into an emotional free fall where there will be no happily ever after for AJ and Jill. This particular part of the story is heartbreaking, impassioned and real; the in your face agonizing pain and tumultuous journey of two people whose love was never meant to last is intense and full of anguish.Jewel E. Anns JACK AND JILL series takes a passionate look at love and loss; life and death; falling in love and letting go. The premise is powerful and visceral in its presentation; the characters are animated and fierce; the romance(s) is emotional, intimate and anxious.I have been a big fan of Jewel E Ann since the release of her first novel HOLDING YOU. I am not much of a fangirl; I dont kiss author a$$, and I dont lie about the books I have read and reviewed, but if you are looking for a new author, a new book or series that will rip out your heart and leave you emotionally spent, then pick up one of Jewel E Anns novels-you wont be sorry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V67VYVLFSWOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016DVHE1W#wasThisHelpful","R1V67VYVLFSWOT","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 stars---LUKE is the fifth and final installment in M.Malones contemporary, new adult Blue Collar Billionaires romance series focusing of the five Marshall brothers-Tank, Finn, Gabe, Zack and Luke.  This is youngest brother Luke Marshall, and Sevens storyline. LUKE can be read as a standalone but I suggest reading the series in order for back story, history and cohesion as there is too much information missing to understand the family dysfunction and the brothers connection to one another.Some background:  The Marshall family consists of 5 brothers and half brothers; three mothers; and one father with ties to the Irish mob.  Patriarch Max Marshall is a billionaire who earned his money through mafia transactions, and had bequeathed each of his sons an early inheritance. The Blue Collar Billionaires series is their stories.Told from alternating first person points of view (Luke and Seven) LUKE is the culmination of a building storyline wherein our hero, a child prodigy, will finally meet the father he never knew, and the online hacker he has considered a friend for close to ten years. Luke has always been a bit of a loaner; with few friends and only his mother as family and confidant.  Seven and Luke will finally meet when the FBI forces our duo into an unscheduled meeting, but a meeting that will find Luke and Seven on a path to love and a happily ever after. Meanwhile, the family begins preparations for Tank and Emmas upcoming nuptials.Luke and Sevens introduction to one another comes as a surprise to Luke as he never considered his online friend to be a woman.  The introduction between Luke and Seven is built upon a lie, and Luke soon discovers that Sevens appearance has much less to do with meeting Luke and more to do with a possible betrayal against Luke and his family.  Sevens past in the foster care system has left our heroine scarred and damaged; Lukes life growing up without his father has been a struggle but more so for his mother who has had to work harder to keep food on the table and clothes on their backs. The $ex scenes are erotic and seductive.The world building continues to focus on the Marshall brothers, their relationships with one another; and their mutual connection through an absent and troubled father. Lukes relationship with his half brothers continues to grow, as our hero begins to accept the new additions to his ever-expanding family.  Luke will finally meet the man he has never known, but is it too little, too late for a father whose life revolves around crime and illegal activities?LUKE is a simple and predictable read; an interesting look at the youngest son of an absent father; a father whose life revolved around crime and the Irish mob.  The premise focuses on Lukes relationship with Seven, and the real reason Seven has sought out a face to face meeting with her virtual, online friend. The characters are engaging and colorful; the happily ever after is not unexpected but a twist to the family dynamics changes all of the brothers lives for the future. The conflict resolution was disappointing and felt rushed to the finish. I was hoping for some more angst and intrigue.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRYNUQ1JO3TTD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KH503P0#wasThisHelpful","RRYNUQ1JO3TTD","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"3.75 stars---DANCE IN THE WIND by Jennifer Probst is the fourth installment in the multi-authored RISING STORM serial novella series focusing on the people of Storm, Texas.DANCE IN THE WIND, like the previous installments,  has a large ensemble cast of characters whose lives intersect and cross paths on a daily basis.  The secrets and scandals of Storm, Texas usher in gossip and potential danger for a  number of families, friends and co-workers in a Peyton Place like town where everyone knows your name, your business and whos sleeping with whom.Army veteran Logan Murphy returns home to a heros welcome but Logan only has eyes for Ginny Moreno-the young, pregnant woman whose boyfriend was killed in the first episode starting a series of rumors, innuendos and revelations.  DANCE IN THE WIND begins to focus on the possibility that Jacob Salt is not the father of Ginnys baby: and the Murphy boys (Patrick, Logan and Dillon) are secretly pining after unavailable women; the Salt family begins to implode following the death of their beloved son as Travis sets his sights on someone new; and the Alvarez family seek information about their missing husband and father.Because RISING STORM is a serialized storyline, DANCE IN THE WIND should not be read as a stand alone as each installment builds upon the previous premise and information.  For history, backstory and cohesion it is imperative that each installment be read in order.  DANCE IN THE WIND adds another layer of intrigue, revelations, secrets and lies to the RISING STORM saga.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DMAL96HFGF96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014XJKFJE#wasThisHelpful","R2DMAL96HFGF96","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

":  4stars--- FACING FIRE is the third full-length installment in HelenKay Dimons contemporary, adult Bad Boys Undercover romantic suspense series focusing on an undercover Black Ops organization known as the Alliance.  This is Alliance operative Josiah King, and PI Sutton Dahls storyline.  FACING FIRE can be read as a stand alone without any difficulty although I would recommend reading the series in order for cohesion and backstory. Any important information from previous storylines is imparted where necessary.NOTE: There may be some spoilers in my review if you are a follower of HelenKay Dimons BAD BOYS UNDERCOVER series. At the end of FALLING HARD (BBU #2) the Alliance Teams target is presumed dead and gone.Told from several third person perspectives FACING FIRE follows the Alliance Team as they are once again threatened by an enemy known only as Benton.

Benton is evil; seeks world domination through chemical warfare and is offering a secret weapon to the highest bidder. When Benton targets Josiah King, Josiah loses someone close in the ensuing carnage and death. Enter Sutton Dahl-a woman hoping to get close enough to a man named Bane, to seek revenge of a different kind-but first Sutton must convince the Alliance Team that she is not partnered with Benton in his crimes against Josiah and the team.The attraction between Josiah and Sutton is immediate but Josiah does not trust Sutton as she keeps secret her need to make contact with Bane. Suttons connection to the Alliance Team proves dangerous when she is tagged by Benton in his plans for revenge and retribution.

There is good natured camaraderie between friends; and heartbreak when one of their own sacrifices himself to save the others.The world building continues to focus on the assignments, and Bentons need for global control.  Benton is a man on a mission: the Alliance Team and everyone they love has been targeted in the name of revenge.FACING FIRE is a story of suspense, romance and intrigue: the premise is entertaining; the characters are animated and energetic; the romance is seductive.

Gage and Jordan were first introduced to the reader in Scott's Heart of Stone series:  Gage was head of security for for Tristan Stone, and Jordan is Nina Stone's best friend.Told from dual first person points of view (Gage and Jordan) UNFORGETTABLE is a second chance storyline.  One year earlier, Gage broke up with Jordan, the love of his life, with a few words and a phone call leaving a distraught Jordan heartbroken and depressed. Fast forward to present day where we are witness to Jordan's impending engagement and nuptials to wealthy businessman Brock Hannon-a man Jordan believes is right for her-a man she believes will give her what she wants and needs.

The premise is fast paced and entertaining; there are moments of mystery, suspense, romance and professions of love.

"3.75 stars--- ROCK REDEMPTION is the third full length installment in Nalini Singhs contemporary, adult ROCK KISS romance series. This is Schoolboy Choir rock guitarist Noah St.John, and actress Kit Devignys storyline. ROCK REDEMPTION can be read as a stand alone without any difficulty.Told from dual third person perspectives (Noah and Kit) ROCK REDEMPTION is a storyline about second chances at friendship and love. Noahs personal life is spiraling out of control and there is nothing he wants more than to be loved and love but our hero (or lack of a better term) has a secret-a dark and heartbreaking past that controls his present, and in this, Noah sets about to destroy the woman who holds his heart. Noah is on a self-destructive path into the abyss; his man-whoring reputation precedes his friendship with Kit; the drinking, drugs and $ex barely appease the voices in his head. Noah is a man who doesnt like to be touched; to kiss; or acknowledge the demons from his past.Kit is an actress on the cusp of making it big but her love for Noah St. John finds our heroine walking away when Noah betrays both his friendship and love for Kit Devigny.  The push and pull, and angst of Kit and Noahs friendship borders on emotionally abusive, co-dependent, and obsession. Noah continues to push away the only woman he has ever loved in the hopes of keeping secret his past; Kit tries to keep her distance, letting go of the man with whom she has fallen in love, but she is unable to completely sever the ties that bind. ROCK REDEMPTION follows Kit and Noah as they struggle with their rekindling friendship and building love.  Both Kit and Noah come from well to do families whose fame and fortune follow our leading couple wherever they go.ROCK REDEMPTION is an emotional storyline both for the reader and the leading characters of the story.  Kit and Noahs relationship is akin to a psychological study in co-dependency while the world around them begins to close in and tighten the rope.  There are moments of heartbreaking betrayal and family dysfunction, secret revelations and letting go of the past.  The relationship between Noah and Kit is emotionally draining; the sexual attraction and anxiety is highly charged; BUT the romance is very, very slow to build. There are only one or two quick $ex scenes (late in the story) that leave the reader wanting more.  ROCK REDEMPTION focuses on the rebuilding of a friendship before anything deeper can be explored. The lack of romance may be difficult for some readers especially with Noahs numerous attempts to destroy his relationship with Kit. I think Nalini needs to write a novella that furthers Kit and Noahs romance; the epilogue advances the storyline one year wherein we know nothing about the previous twelve months.There is a secondary plot running through ROCK REDEMPTION that barely merits mentioning:  Kit has a stalker whose identity and purpose seemingly come out of left field. For all intents and purposes, this particular scenario is more of a distraction; its purpose in the story is negligible and does nothing to affect the main storyline premise. It probably would have been better to remove this plot deviation entirely.Molly and Fox (Rock Addiction #1) figure prominently throughout the storyline as our hero and heroine find emotional support from Rock Kisss introductory couple, as well as David and Thea (Rock Courtship 1.5), and Abe and his ex wife Sarah whose own rocky relationship may see a fresh restart.  We are briefly introduced to Kit and Noahs parents, as well as Kits friend Becca, and Terrence, a man vying for Kits attention.ROCK REDEMPTION focuses on the struggles of a friendship destroyed by betrayal and mistrust. Noah is more of an anti-hero, and Kits emotional breakdowns are heartbreaking. There is no infidelity but Noahs attempts to push Kit away involve other women, drinking and drugs. The characters are colorful, charismatic and honest; the romance is virtually non-existent due to the very slow rebuilding of Kit and Noahs friendship. The sexual attraction and angst is palpable but our couple is slow to act on their growing feelings until a good portion of the storyline has elapsed. There are a number of scenes of self-reflection, and inner monologues with flashbacks that push the storyline forward (or back) revealing some of the backstory and history for our couple. The lack of romance between Kit and Noah may be a problem for many readers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R262SFF4UXB5EG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1942356358#wasThisHelpful","R262SFF4UXB5EG","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Axel, like many of the men in the series has issues with disobedience and spanking is his preferred method of discipline.The Wicked Lovers series of novels are ensemble storylines wherein a number of the previous storybook characters play secondary and supporting roles; most of WICKED FOR YOU focuses on Axel, Mystery, Heath and Mysterys Aunt Gail Leedy. Sean, Thorpe (Dominion Club owner and head Dom) and Callie (Theirs to Cherish #8) have cameo appearances for cohesion and history as well as Javier and Xander (Ours to Love #7) and Joaquin Munoz (His To Take #9).WICKED FOR YOU is a suspense filled story focusing on uncovering the truth behind Mysterys mothers death, and the possible connection to Mysterys abduction and her mothers past. WICKED FOR YOU is a fast paced and animated storyline. The characterization is presented through description narratives and indirectly through the thoughts and action of the leading couple. A several chapter-long flashback reveals Mystery and Axels introduction to one another and what precipitated Mysterys heartbreak and sorrow creating the building blocks upon which the present day storyline will focus. The conflict revolves around lies, secrets and deep-seated family dysfunction; the requisite evil is a two-fold twist to the storyline.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI3VLOXO919PA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425275469#wasThisHelpful","RI3VLOXO919PA","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"3.5  3.75 stars--THE SEEKER is a post- apocalyptic, science fiction/paranormal romance where an evil race of lizard-like aliens known as the Vymalns has descended upon Earth. The humans have become nothing more than slaves as the Vymalns set about to destroy whats left of Earths natural resources. Enter Aiodhan- a humanoid male of the Tirios species whose job as a Seeker finds our storyline hero caught between doing his job and the human woman with whom he is falling in love.Aiodhan, along with Pashmar, a fellow female Seeker are sent from Tirios each with a specific assignment but neither one was ever meant to remain on Earth. Aiodhan will meet Kara Michaels when he saves her from an attack by the Vymalns and a relationship between he and Kara will set into motion a series of events that finds our couple in a human encampment close to where the Vymalns have imprisoned Karas father and several other human slaves.The relationship between Kara and Aiodhan is one of immediate attraction. Aiodhan is a beautiful, over protective, alpha Tirios warrior, and Kara, a human female nurse, is about to become his intended mate but first our leading couple must defend themselves against attacks by the Vymalns, and the prejudicial specieism of Karas fellow humans and Aiodhans friend Pashmar. The $ex scenes are intimate; there are no over the top graphic erotic $ex scenes.There are a number of secondary and supporting characters including Karas brother Kevin and her father-a veterinarian who has been commanded by the Vymalns as their resident physician.  We are introduced to the survivors at the camp-several of whom have specific talents and jobs that are reminiscent of military troops preparing for battle. Aiodhan will find himself protector of two human children who have prophesized the upcoming battles and threats to the survivors.The world building is very reminiscent of The Walking Dead especially as it pertains to the prison, the hierarchy of positions within the camp, and some of the characters whose personalities rival some of the cast of TWD. That is not to say there are any walkers or zombies but the storyline energy and some of the scenarios are familiar.THE SEEKER is an entertaining storyline with colorful characters and animated personalities. The romance between Kara and Aiodhan is loving and sensitive; there are no overt erotic scenarios or questionable alien rituals.  The action scenes are limited as it pertained to the take down of the internment camp, and the encounters with the Vymalns are few and far between.  I did have a couple of issues with the story especially the lack of background information and history of the alien invasion.  Although THE SEEKER is a work of science fiction, I need answers and explanations as to the how and why-the reality is in the believability and I need to believe.There are several characters with potential stories, and the Vymalns still remain a threat throughout the world. Pashmars storyline is next in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NLRSHAB4KPE0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JZEOWG#wasThisHelpful","R2NLRSHAB4KPE0","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 stars---GERONIMO HOTSHOT is the fourth installment in Robert Blake Whitehills adult, contemporary Ben Blackshaw suspense series focusing on retired Navy SEAL Ben Blackshaw.  Although this is the fourth book in the series, GERONIMO HOTSHOT can be read as a stand alone without any difficulty. Any previous information will be revealed where necessary.Told from several third person perspectives the storyline advances the series one month. Bens wife had been injured in the previous storyline (TAP RACK BANG) and currently remains in a coma; our hero is unable to consider the future without his wife and embarks on another solo adventure to Bisbee, Arizona where racist bigots and white supremacists find themselves involved in a high tech drug war with the FBI, Customs and Border Patrol, a former sheriff, a murderous motorcycle gang, and the possibility of a biological weapon of mass destruction. Raging wildfires add another dangerous dimension to the equation wherein Ben Bradshaw finds himself trapped between the fires and his imminent death.The lynching and murder of a young African American boy finds Ben on a mission to locate the people responsible and the connection to a religious cult known as the Pure Nation Comitatus wherein the leader presents himself as The Messiah. On a cross country journey from Smith Island on the Chesapeake Bay to the drought riddled forests of Arizona, Ben will come in contact with several people whose connections to and information about the PNC sparks a new sense of dread and urgency in our hero. A local Native American will follow Ben on his journey in the hopes of retribution and revenge.GERONIMO HOTSHOT is a storyline with several intersecting paths, graphic violence, murder, action and adventure. From racism, prejudice, drug trafficking and murderous vendettas GERONIMO HOTSHOT looks at cult and culture; society, social inequality and community; race relations and new age religion wherein people are seeking direction from a charismatic leader who demands obedience and proof of loyalty.The numerous colorful and dynamic characters drive a good portion of the storyline as the build up follows several plotlines that will intersect and merge throughout the course of the novel. One thing is for sure: Ben Blackshaw is not your stereotypical hero-more of an anti hero-but a man who will command your respect and interest. There is intrapersonal conflict for Ben; and intergroup conflict between the PNC, biker gangs and the former local sheriff.  The backdrop of the Arizona forests is a major player throughout the story.GERONIMO HOTSHOT is an intriguing, enthralling and intense topical storyline. Robert Blake Whitehill will seduce your mind into a world of retribution and revenge. The destructive nature and powerful control of cults, drug trafficking and gangs are central to the storyline premise wherein the ill-fated machinations of the Messiah, the sheriff, and the drug lord will see reprisal and retaliation in the form of Ben Blackshaw and the FBI.

":  3.75 stars---SLASHED is the third installment in Tracy Wolffs contemporary, new adult Extreme Risk romance series focusing on a tight knit group of extreme snow boarders. This is Luc Jennings and Cam Bradleys storyline. SLASHED can be read as a stand alone without any difficulty.Told from dual first person points of view (Luc and Cam) SLASHED follows the rebuilding of a friendship between Luc and Cam. Four months earlier Cam and Luc crossed the line between friends and lovers; Cam walked away distraught and embarrassed fearing reprisals and loss from her friendship with Luc. Fast forward to present day where Cam and Lucs friendship is icy, still barely speaking to one another and making life miserable for everyone concerned.  When Cams home life implodes, she finds herself on Lucs doorstep, hoping for a place to stay and support when she needs it the most.The relationship between Cam and Luc is one of friends to lovers to frenemies and back to lovers. Cam and Luc have always been attracted to one another but both of our leading characters have some major issues of self esteem, insecurity and lack the ability to communicate with one another.  Cam sees herself as the ugly duckling whose mother abandoned the family when Cam was five years old; Lucs success on the snow hills has been less than spectacular and he constantly compares himself to the success of the others. Both Cam and Lucs mindset is tentative; they fear rejection and failure; and with it comes the inability to move forward or let go of the past.  The $ex scenes are intimate and provocative.All of the previous storyline couples and characters play secondary and supporting roles including Z and Ophelia (Shredded #1), Tansy and Ash (Shattered #2) as well as Ashs brother Logan. I am looking forward to Logans story but the series would have to advance several years before we see a romance for our struggling, young hero.The world building has deviated from the snow boarding competitions and the main focus is on the couple in question. The summer months finds the friends wake-boarding and considering the upcoming snow boarding schedule while the tentative friendship between Luc and Cam hits a major change in direction-their lack of communication and too many presumptions are the major causes of most of their issues and problems. Lucs jealousy of Cams friendship with another snow boarder as well as Cams one time unrequited love for Z is a major stumbling block on their road to reconciliation-Lucs issues are fueled by his own preconceived inadequacies.SLASHED has moments of heartbreak and sorrow; anxiety and tension; letting go and moving forward. Luc and Cams storyline was at times frustrating watching two people whose love for one another was hampered by low self esteem and demons from the past.  I shed a few tears-I am not sure if the tears were due to my own particular mind set at the time but the shear pain of Luc and Cams insecurities is all too familiar and relatable-believing you will never be enough or the best. Cam and Lucs story continues; the final chapters reveal a surprise twist in their relationship but with it came an abrupt ending that leaves the reader waiting and wondering about hope for the future.The premise is intimate and dramatic; the characters are engaging, animated and heartbreaking; the romance is impassioned and emotional.  In the new adult storylines there are always issues from the past that control the future where an all-consuming love is easily destroyed by painful memories and dramatic realizations. SLASHED looks at fated lovers who fell into the gaping hole of disillusionment and doubt only to come away with the possibility of a promise of forever and a happily ever after.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25C79ONC02AQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PD7JM#wasThisHelpful","R25C79ONC02AQ0","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.25 stars---BREAKING A LEGEND is the first installment in Sarah Robinsons contemporary, adult KAVANAGH LEGENDS romance series focusing on the Kavanagh family of MMA fame. This is former MMA champion twenty eight year old  Rory Kavanagh, and bartender Clare Iverss storyline.Told from dual third person perspectives BREAKING A LEGEND focuses on the building relationship between Rory and Clare, and Rorys recovery from a devastating career-ending injury. Tens months earlier Rorys injury in the cage left our hero a broken man in more ways than one. Enter Clare Ivers, the newest waitress at OLearys Pub, and the woman who would call to Rorys heart. Coming from a big, Irish Catholic family, Rory has never lacked support but Rorys choices in life have left our hero fighting the dark demons that resulted from the catastrophic injury.Clare Ivers hides a secret. Our heroine is one the run, trying to stay one step ahead of her past and falling in love was never in the cards. When Clares past resurfaces, our heroine is willing to walk away from Rory and the family she has grown to love in order to protect everyone from the life she once led.The relationship between Clare and Rory is one of immediate attraction. Rory is a man taught to respect women and in this Rory is the ultimate gentleman as he slowly seduces the woman who calls to his heart.  The $ex scenes are gentle; there is no erotic, graphic imagery or text.  But I did take issue with the lack of condoms. In an age of STDS and deadly viruses, the use of condoms should  never be questioned.We are introduced to Rorys extended family including brothers- Quinn, Kane and Kanes twin Kieran (who is currently in prison), and the youngest Jimmy, who is a member of the local police department.  Jimmy has his hands full keeping his family on the straight and narrow.  Rorys loving parents Seamus and Dee Kavanagh are the backbone of the Kavanagh family ; and Rorys cousin/sister Casey who befriends Clare when she needs it the most.  The family feel to this storyline is loving and supportive.The world building focuses on Legends-the gym owned by the Kavanagh family where legends are made and history is written in the Bronx borough of Woodlawn, New York. We are up close and personal with the fighters as they prepare for the next championship. There is some history with Seamus Kavanagh and the local Irish mob but we are not currently privy to the background information.SPOILER ALERT:  I did have some issues of believability with certain aspects of this storyline as it pertained to Rory and his ability to get clean and sober. It was all too neat and tidy; there is no mention of withdrawal, side effects or the physical and emotional pain one suffers during detox. Getting clean is a long process and doesnt happen over night or in a matter of a couple of days. The unreality of the situation is questionable.BREAKING A LEGEND is an easy read with a large ensemble cast of characters. The premise is entertaining; the characters are engaging; the romance is sweet and seductive but saying that, there was something missing in the telling of the story; the details are missing for many of the storyline components especially as it pertained to Clares past and Rorys fall into the abyss","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L767TIZT2NG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VD043F4#wasThisHelpful","R2L767TIZT2NG9","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.75 stars---PLAYING WITH FIRE is the second full length installment in Kate Meaders contemporary, adult Hot in Chicago romance series focusing on the Dempsey family-a family of firefighting foster siblings who have seen their fare share of heartbreak and pain. This is female firefighter and only Dempsey daughter Alexandra Dempsey, and sexy Chicago Mayor Eli Coopers storyline.  PLAYING WITH FIRE can be read as a stand alone without any difficulty but for cohesion, backstory and family history I recommend reading the series in order.Told from dual third person perspectives PLAYING WITH FIRE follows the antagonist relationship between Alexandra and Eli. For months Eli and Alex have been the bane of one anothers existence since Alex and her brothers off hours antics find themselves the targets of paparazzi, media and you tube videos that find the Chicago Fire Department on the receiving end of harassment and lawsuits. The Dempsey family of foster siblings has a rocky relationship with the political elite of Chicago and adding Elis less than vague misogynistic insults directed at Alex, we have a volatile situation between our leading couple.As the lone female firefighter at Engine Co. 6, Alex has presumably had her fair share of issues and problems with the other men, but Mayor Cooper is determined to throw Alex off of her pedestal by making her an offer she cant refuse-Alex must pretend to be Elis girlfriend until the mayoral elections, and in return Eli will keep Chicagos richest businessman from keeping true to a promise to sue Alex for a botched rescue that destroyed his $400,000 car. The only problem is the sexual energy and chemistry between Alex and Eli is off the charts, and the faux relationship between our couple will be anything but fake.Eli and Alex have butted heads throughout the series and PLAYING WITH FIRE sees the misogynistic Eli brought to his knees by the loud-mouthed, alpha female who calls to his heart. But Alex s feminist ideals are very radical in the face of main stream feminism-as the only female firefighter she has been targeted by the media and the men with whom she works, and in this Alex would over react and take comments and conversation out of context deeming them an attack against herself and woman as a whole. There were times Alexs feminist beliefs were a little over the top as she was quick to jump, accuse and berate Eli Cooper for some perceived insult meant as a compliment or conversational starter. Romance storylines are not necessarily a platform for espousing radical feminism, or at the very least, presenting the heroine as a ball-busting b*tch of epic proportions-coming back from a less than positive characterization makes it difficult for some readers to find sympathy for the character in question.  But we mustnt forget Eli Cooper-as an arrogant and cocky politician, our hero knows how to play the audience, and Alexandra was a very captive audience.  The $ex scenes are erotic, intense and seductive.All of the Dempsey foster siblings play secondary and supporting roles includingLuke Almeida and the love of his life Kinsey Taylor (Flirting with Fire #1), and Gage Simpson and Brady Smith (Melting Point 1.5).  Mayor Eli Cooper is a former military buddy of Brady Smith, and with it comes a life long friendship of kindred spirits.  Elis family history is revealed a little at a time.  Beck Rivera and Darcy Cochrane (Rekindle the Flame .5) play a larger role than in previous storylines.PLAYING WITH FIRE looks at heartbreak and betrayal; family and love; secrets from the past and letting go.  The premise is fast paced, sexy, engaging and clever; the characters are inspiring, impassioned and intense; the romance is playful, lighthearted and provocative.  Alex and Elis road to a happily ever after was not always smooth but Eli was determined to win Alexandras heart anyway he could-Eli is a man who can grovel with the best.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R196NUYDSHKAQ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCI7Q4#wasThisHelpful","R196NUYDSHKAQ4","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.75 stars----BOUND BY SIN is the third installment in Jacquelyn Franks adult, IMMORTAL BROTHERS mythological romance, paranormal fantasy series focusing on four brothers cursed, by the gods and goddesses, in their search for immortality. This is Jaykun and Jileanas storyline. BOUND BY SIN can be read as a standalone but for backstory and cohesion, I strongly suggest reading the series in order.SOME BACKGROUND:  Two hundred years earlier, four brothers (Dethan, Garreth, Jaykun, Maxum) went in search of the waters of Immortality and upon the discovery drank from the forbidden streams. The gods and goddesses were angered and cursed each brother to suffer eternal damnation and pain.  Each of the brothers will sacrifice for love landing them in the favor of the gods with a happily ever after.  Jaykuns punishment is to suffer an endless cycle of burning from the inside out-like a star going supernova on a nightly basis.  Maxums story will be told next in BOUND IN DARKNESS (November 2015).Told from third person perspective BOUND BY SIN follows the building relationship between Jaykun and Jileana-a young woman whose naivety and surprising beauty is unexpected near the battlefield and waters, and in Jaykuns life. Jaykun has been freed from eternal damnation but still suffers the nightly fiery burns as will be witnessed by our storyline heroine.  While Jaykun enjoys the ministrations of the strange female, Dethan and Garreth begin to suspect there is more to the young woman than meets the eye. When Jileana invites Jaykun to visit her forbidden world beyond the waters, our hero finds himself a virtual prisoner in a gilded cage until the rising of the next moon. Jaykun will soon find himself enmeshed in a political coup and uprising when, Jileanas Empress is threatened, by members of her own royal family.The attraction between Jaykun and Jileana is immediate and palpable but there is something otherworldly about Jileana. Her time on Jaykuns world has an expiry date, and with it so too does their growing relationship and love. Jaykun has been burned by a former love and with it comes betrayal and issues of trust. The $ex scenes are intimate without the use of graphic sexual imagery.Dethan and Garreth, Jaykuns brothers play secondary and supporting roles throughout the storyline. Our series heroes are currently on location, warring and pillaging on behalf of the gods. We are introduced to Jileanas family, including several of her over protective brothers and father, as well as the Empress, whose control of her own people is questioned and usurped.  The requisite evil not only threatens Jileanas future, but the future of her people and world.The world building focuses on the continuing wars between the gods and goddesses as each brother must fight in the name of Weysa, the goddess of conflict, as she continues to demand obedience and subjugation. We are transported to Jileanas world of immortal creatures with supernatural powers. Jileanas true species and distinctiveness are easily identifiable early in the story but the path to realization is slow as the storyline builds and allegiances are drawn.The premise is slow to build as the storyline focuses on the relationship between our leading couple while keeping Jileanas identity a lightly, veiled secret. Most of the conflict arises within Jileanas world where our hero is tasked with saving a world  and a species he knows nothing about.  The characters are colorful and magical; the romance is hopeful but Joykuns issues of trust have left our hero without the ability to love.  We are offered a quick glimpse into Maxums mind- the final brother whose need for revenge is calculating and cold.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJHORRXXUHNC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=055339343X#wasThisHelpful","RJHORRXXUHNC2","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 stars---  JUST DESSERTS is the third installment in Ashley Listers contemporary adult Sweet Temptation erotic romance series focusing on executive chef Bill Hart, and baking entrepreneur/celebrity cooking judge Trudy McLaughlin. JUST DESSERTS should not be read as a stand alone as many of the events in the first two installments lead up to the events in Just Desserts.Told from single, third person limited point of view (Trudy) JUST DESSERTS focuses on the turmoil of Trudy and Bills relationship upheaval due to the events in Bills personal and private life.  Bill remarried his ex wife to keep the woman from being deported, and with it comes the heartbreak between two people whose love for one another must face another obstacle and road block on the path to their own happily ever after.  Bill and Trudys relationship will become gossip between friends and the media, and the threats against Trudy and Bill will continue long after Bills marriage to appease his ex-wife.JUST DESSERTS continues to focus on the erotic BDSM relationship between Trudy and Bill. Bill is a man who likes to punish Trudy for some perceived wrong, and spanking is Bills form of chosen discipline. I am not sure how I feel about the BDSM scenario throughout the series- it always felt unnecessary and voyeuristic as though it was an afterthought to the story.  But while Bill and Trudys relationship must be kept secret from the public eye, their past will come full circle when their secrets are about to be exposed by a jealous ex-lover who wants Trudy all for himself.The colorful secondary and supporting cast of players includes all of the previous storyline characters including Trudys co-workers and friends; Bills ex-wife Aliceon and their daughter Imogen, and grandson little Bill.  Trudys ex business partner Donny continues as the requisite evil but this time he has brought along a couple of co-conspirators for the ride.JUST DESSERTS is a fast paced, quick read that addresses the trials and tribulations between Trudy and Bill while Trudys former friend and business partner is wreaking havoc upon her and Bills lives; and Bills hasty wedding to his ex wife finds our heroine planning nightly rendezvous with the man that she loves.  The premise is intriguing; the characters are animated and engaging; the conflict resolution was a bit scattered; I am not sure if the people responsible for the attacks against Trudy and Bill would be free to walk around until the final few pages of the story. Law enforcement should have been aware of the identity and whereabouts of the guilty parties.JUST DESSERTS appears to be the end of Trudy and Bills story although it could also be the beginning of a new adventure. Thank you Ashley Lister for allowing me a ride on the roller coaster relationship between Trudy and Bill-if only we could have seen more than a happily ever after-for now.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KSMXB290373P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N7348NC#wasThisHelpful","R2KSMXB290373P","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UNDAUNTED is the first installment in Ronnie Douglass (aka Melissa Marr) contemporary, new adult Knights in Black Leather MC romance series.  This is twenty year old college student/bartender Aubrey Evans, and Zion aka Killers storyline.Told from first person point of view (Aubrey) and some third person perspective from Zion UNDAUNTED focuses on Aubrey and Zions growing but forbidden relationship. Aubrey is new in town from Portland, Oregon, living with her grandmother, attending Williamsville college in Tennessee and looking for a job when a fellow student Ellen suggested she go check out the local biker bar Wolves and apply for a job.  There she will find her knight in black leather Zion-who aided in her rescue a few weeks before when she ended up drunk at a local fair. What ensues is a forbidden relationship between Zion and Aubrey-one that goes against the Wolves MC and biker bar laws.Throughout the story there are several incidences of property abuse and attacks against Aubreys grandmothers home and neighborhood but Grandma Maureen has some deep connections to the Wolves MC, and with it comes years of familiarity and a friendship wherein Aubrey and Grandma have the promise of protection from MC  President Echo, Zion and the Club.The relationship between Aubrey and Zion is one of immediate attraction but Aubrey has a multi-year plan that doesnt include dating or getting involved with any man. Zion continues to pursue Aubrey who is constantly sending out mixed signals and in this I had some difficult times with Aubreys character and her wishy-washy attempts to stay away from Zion. There is also the potential for a love triangle with Zions cousin Noah, and throughout the story my anxiety continued to build as Aubrey played one cousin against the other. Not only is Aubrey the new girl in town, but she  has caught the eye of every eligible young man.  I thought I was reading a YA storyline-the build up, lack of romance and one lone (mostly implied) sexual encounter did not read like a new adult or adult storyline but a premise directed at the young adult or teen reader. Aubreys no dating policy, her attitudes towards her virginity or lack thereof and the parents as representations of all things corrupt and the epitome of dysfunctional parenting, all screamed young adult and not NA.  When I looked further into the author, I discovered Ronnie Douglas is the alter ego of prolific and number one selling young adult author Melissa Marr and thusly my thoughts about the YA connections were confirmed.There are several charismatic and colorful secondary and supporting characters throughout the storyline that are the backbone of the story and kept everything on track:  Uncle Karl, Echo, Nash, Ellen, Grandma Maureen and all of Grandmas neighbors and friends.  Grandmas connections to the Wolves MC and especially Club president Echo were touched upon briefly but I wish there was more background and history revealed between a number of these characters-in fact, there is very little background and history revealed about most of the storyline characters including our leading couple. For me, or any reader, to be pulled into a story we need history and background to understand the mindsets and emotions of the characters.UNDAUNTED is not your typical MC storyline but a much tamer and vanilla version.If you are a die-hard MC series fan, UNDAUNTED will probably be a disappointment as it is missing most of the MC dark and dangerous habits and storyline tropes, but if you are a fan of YA type storylines, then UNDAUNTED may be for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ4O6RQRXNF2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062389602#wasThisHelpful","RQ4O6RQRXNF2L","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 stars---THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT is the third installment in Katie Roses contemporary, adult THE BOYS OF SUMMER romantic sports series focusing on the New Jersey Sonics baseball team. This is professional baseball player Gavin King, and physical therapist Jessica Harts storyline. THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT can be read as a stand alone without any difficulty. Any important information from previous storylines is revealed where necessary.Told from dual third person perspectives THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT follows the rehabilitation of big league slugger Gavin King. Gavins near career -ending injury has found our storyline hero in the unenviable position on the DL Disabled List- as he endures months of physical therapy due to the invasive surgery of repairing the meniscus in his knee. The potential for the injury to destroy his career has landed the once a-list player as the newest member of the struggling New Jersey Sonics following a trade from one of the top rated teams. What ensues is the building relationship between physical therapist Jessica Hart-a young woman who has been burned by a previous relationship with a former Sonics player.Jessica and Gavins attraction to one another is immediate and intense but our storyline heroine wants nothing to do with another professional baseball player. Her previous relationship disaster has left Jessica jaded in the face of a potential love match with Gavin King. Gavins history of dating fashion models finds Jessica struggling with self esteem issues about her own beauty and body type.  As Gavin continues to pursue Jessica in the hopes of something more, Jessica begins to pull back believing their relationship will end in heartbreak for our storyline heroine. The $ex scenes are intimate without the over the top erotic factor-quite vanilla in context and description.Most of the secondary and supporting characters include the members of the New Jersey Sonics including Darcy and Chase (Bring on the Heat #1) who are preparing for their upcoming nuptials, and Nikki and Jake (Too Hot to Handle #2).  Several of the team management and PT staff are present, as well as both Gavin and Jessicas exes who are looking for a second chance. Jessica and Gavins extended families play a supporting role including Jessicas brothers who want to know Gavins intentions with their little sister.The storyline premise is interesting although a little slow to build as we follow weeks to months of physical therapy for our storyline hero. The writing is simple although the author has done some research as it pertains to the physical therapy and sports related injuries.  The characters are well developed, colorful and believable.  The conflict is quick to resolve but in all honesty our heroine is the root cause of most of the storyline anxiety-Jessica has issues of trust, and in this, her immaturity is a point of contention for this reader:  any threats to Gavin and Jessicas relationship are blown out of proportion by the perception of betrayal and the possibility of second chances for Gavin and his ex.THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT is a light read with a little bit of everything: $ex, romance, conflict, fun and falling in love.  There are no complicated scenarios; no mind blowing issues of dark demons or past histories with devastating actions.  It is a story about two people who meet under professional circumstances and fall in love.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U0U5OZPVENOU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RKWAJSO#wasThisHelpful","R1U0U5OZPVENOU","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"3.5 stars--WRONG NUMBER, RIGHT GUY is the first installment in Elle Caseys contemporary adult THE BOURBON STREET BOYS romantic suspense series focusing on the Bourbon Street Boys (BSB) private security firm. This is owner Ozzie, and professional photographer May Wexlers storyline.Told from first person point of view (May) WRONG NUMBER, RIGHT GUY focuses on a case of mistaken identity-or-accidental text messaging wherein May receives texts from a number she believes belongs to her sister. When the messages become more incessant, rude and demanding our heroine show up at a local biker bar, May is all about keeping her sister happy. What May doesnt know is that the phone text is from a man deep undercover whose messages are accidentally being sent to Mays phone. When May shows up at the bar, gunfire and a car pursuit find May in the protective custody of the Bourbon Street Boys, who will soon offer May a position within their group.The relationship between May and Ozzie is one of immediate attraction as May finds herself drawn to the man in charge. Following a number of threats against Mays life, Ozzie has May move into the BSB headquarters wherein a sexual relationship between our leading couple ensues.  Ozzie is the epitome of tall, dark and dangerous to Mays Bo-Peep in pink outward faade.  The $ex scenes are limited, provocative and intense.There is a large cast of secondary and supporting characters including all of Ozzies Bourbon Street Boys security personnel. We are introduced to Toni-the only other female specialist-and a woman with secrets of her own. Toni has some issues with May, and May intends to get things out. Mays sister Jennifer-a computer specialist and single mother to three young children- plays a small recurring role as a support system for her sister, and quite possibly a potential new member of the BSB team.The world building focuses on the men and women of the Bourbon Street Boys. We are witness to their individual pursuits and job descriptions as well as their current series of investigations and special operations. There is a building storyline at the local Marina where income and expenses dont meet up. Elle Casey adds some humor and asides throughout the story as we listen to Mays internal dialogue, banter and jokes pertaining to her current situation. Some of the humor was palatable but there were several instances where the flippancy and blatant attempts at comedy fell flat reminding of a young boy vying for attention with jokes and one-liners. I also had a few issues with the lack of character description and development as it pertained to our leading couple, and the lack of heat in the romance department. I think Mays characters lacked some maturity as it pertained to relationships making for some uncomfortable scenarios and relationship talk.WRONG NUMBER, RIGHT GUY is an easy read;  an entertaining storyline where two people from different walks of life find happiness and love all because of a wrong number and a few misdirected texts.

"4.25 stars---HILO is the first book in Judd Winicks The Boy Who Crashed to Earth middle grade graphic sci-fi novel about a boy name Hilo and his new best friends D.J. and Gina. HILO focuses on friendship, failure, bravery, and helping one another but looks at the scientific potential for robots to control the world.Hilo is a robot; a childlike robot that mysteriously crash lands on earth without any memory of who or what he is. Like all young boys, Hilo gets a thrill out of burping (repeat business), eating things he is not supposed to eat (e.g. dinner napkins), and his favorite word is outstanding. The target audience may be 8-12 year old boys due to the nature of the storyline content.Our hero is not quite a boy but a robot from another dimension where robots are built to serve humanity. Hilo is a protector; when other robots go wrong Hilo must stop them before they destroy the planet but Hilo ran scared when he was unable to stop the bad robots, and in this Hilo failed at what he was built to do. Befriending Gina and D.J, Hilo and his new friends will start an adventure unlike anything they have known as the monster robots come to earth seeking to destroy the planet and return Hilo back home.The philosophical and scientific conundrum about robots and humanity will make you question the conscience and cognitive potential of robots now and in a future time. The ultimate in omnipotent power and technology-known as Razorwark- has evolved to destroy the world in a battle to rule the universe.The storyline also looks at working families and some parent-child interactions that reflect the busy lives and a childs self-esteem when the parent or sibling is too busy to sit down and acknowledge the little things that are important to a child. Sometimes a fantasy world is all that a child has left to enjoy.HILO has everything for the young and the young at heart: bright colors, giant insects, funny bodily functions, and killer robots. Hilo has super powers with lasers in his hands, and at the end of the day, he will need the help of DJ and Gina to stop Razorwark-once and for all. HILO ends on a bit of a cliffhanger so be prepared.If you are a fan of Bill Wattersons Calvin and Hobbes, you will see many similarities between the HILO series and Calvins Spaceman Spiff outer space adventures with giant robots and spewing bugs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BM9XSYM09M13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385386176#wasThisHelpful","R2BM9XSYM09M13","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TAKE A RISK bundle-release September 15, 2015Robin Bielmans TAKE A RISK Bundle is engaging and impassioned. The premises are heartwarming, encouraging and inspiring; the characters are colorful and engaging; the happily ever afters are the stuff of fairy tales and hopeful futures. Each of our couples is fated by circumstance and passion with an intense love for the person who calls to their heart. The novellas are quick and easy reads with emotional fall outs and intense interactions but all are connected through the World Heritage Fund and the love of preservation and heritage protection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNEFZBBCLTV73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0140Q31UU#wasThisHelpful","RNEFZBBCLTV73","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 stars--SLATE is the second installment  in Kelly Gendrons contemporary, adult  Breaking the Declan Brothers erotic romance series focusing on Jax, Slate and Zeke Declan of  the Bayou Vista, Texas. This is MMA fighter and co-owner of the family JZS bar Slate Declan, and social worker/ divorce mediator Rayna Keeneys second chance storyline. SLATE can be read as a stand alone but I recommend reading the series in order for history and cohesion.Told from dual first person perspectives (Rayna and Slate) using flashback and present day timeline SLATE follows the rekindling of the relationship between Rayna and Slate but for all intents and purposes Slate is not the man Rayna left six years earlier.  Along with her best friends Emmie and Lurlene, Rayna has returned to the Texas Bayou for a summer vacation and with it the friends have focused their time and seduction on the three Declan Brothers.  Each of our heroines has a history with one of the Declan Brothers and they are determined to break the boys for sins of the past.Rayna and Slate have been friends since the second grade when  Slate was transferred to Raynas school following the death of his parents. Throughout their earlier years Slate was Raynas best friend and protector, and eventually they would become lovers. But finding Slate in bed with another woman pushed Rayna out of his life and six years later, Rayna returns home to a man she no longer recognizes-both emotionally, mentally and in physical appearance. Slate is a MMA fighter whose demons ride him hard; whose past is rife with heartbreak, pain and addiction; whose need for Rayna has never diminished or faltered.The relationship is one of second chances but Slate is no longer the man he once was. Years of self-inflicted abuse have changed the man Rayna once loved and our heroine is determined to see Slate through his recovery and new direction in life. The $ex scenes are erotic and aggressive. The Declan boys like it rough in the bedroom, and spanking is their preferred form of foreplay and punishment.  I will add that upon reintroduction to the women that they love the Declan Brothers come across as jerks, a$$holes and sexual predators. There are threats and promises of a sexual nature that for most women would require a police intervention but our heroines believe that what it is they want, is the man who is emotionally abusive at the start of their new-found relationships.All of the previous storyline characters play a secondary and supporting role including Emmie and Jax Declan, Deke Declan and Raynas friend Lurlene. The character building is much more detailed in this particular storyline. We are witness to the past events that lead up to Raynas escape from the Texas Bayou, and the events leading to the destruction of Slate-mind, body and soul.  The cause of death of Jax, Slate and Dekes parents is a little more detailed, but we have yet to learn the entire story.SLATE is the story about a broken man; a man whose life was all but destroyed but I did have some issues of realism and accuracy as it pertained to Slates recovery and treatment.  The author should have researched the side effects, consequences and time frame; what is presented in the storyline is not realistic or plausible. There is also an issue with Slates reasons for allowing the woman that he loved to walk away without a fight-again-the believability is lacking.SLATE is a fast paced, quick read that will break your heart for a man who has suffered so many losses.  There are moments of love and loss; heartbreak and pain; letting go and moving on.  The premise is entertaining; the characterizations are well rounded and informative; the romance is sexy and hot.  As with Jaxs storyline Slate will get his happily ever after but the path to happiness is a bumpy ride.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BMDSW6Z4ZUWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1515032663#wasThisHelpful","R3BMDSW6Z4ZUWX","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 stars--JAX is the first installment in Kelly Gendrons contemporary, adult Breaking the Declan Brothers erotic romance series focusing on  Jax, Slate and Zeke Declan of the Bayou Vista, Texas. This is bar owner and MMA fighter Jax Declan, and former beauty queen/book editor Emmie Rues storyline- a second chance for two people whose lives went in different direction following the death of Jaxs parents.Told from dual first person points of view (Emmie and Jax) JAX follows the rekindling relationship between Emmie and Jax upon Emmies return to the Bayou Vista of Texas. Emmie, along with her best friends Rayna and Lurlene, head to the Bayou for an extended summer vacation with a plan to seduce and break the Declan brothers. Each of our storyline heroines has a past with one of the Declan boys, and with it will come memories and dreams of long ago.  With Emmies return, Jax needs to push his aggressive bedroom tendencies aside for fear of pushing away the woman who has owned his heart since she was sixteen years old.The relationship is a friends to lovers/second chance of sorts-for Emmie and Jax. Jax has always had a crush on Emmie but the death of his parents found a then nineteen year old Jax unable to pursue a relationship with Emmie when he found himself both mother and father to two younger brothers. The second chance romance finds both Emmie and Jax have matured, and with it comes sexual needs that must be addressed in and out of the bedroom.  Jax likes it a little rough, and Emmie is willing to give Jax what he wants.  The $ex scenes are aggressive, erotic and intense; spanking is Jaxs preferred form of sexual punishment.We are introduced to Emmies best friends Lurlene and Rayna, as well as Jaxs younger brothers, both MMA fighters and co-owner of the JZS bar Zeke and Slate. Zekes persona is a bit of a man-whore, but it is Slate who will garner the attention and break your heart.  Slate and Raynas storyline is next.JAX is a quick read; a storyline about friendship and second chances but I was disappointed in the lack of character development for our leading couple .Emmie and her friends return to the Bayou Vista intent on seducing and breaking the Declan brothers, and in this the sexual heat and aggression begins immediately upon the reintroduction of Emmie and Jax.  The characters are colorful and animated although lacking in some background history; the world building takes a quick look at the Declan brothers JZS bar and their foray into MMA world of backroom fighting leaving this reader wanting more details about the who, how and why. Like many introductory storylines there wasnt enough background information-some authors info dump while others tread carefully so as not to overwhelm the reader.  The romance between Emmie and Jax is quick to develop as our leading couple has always had a thing for one another.If you like a storyline and series about family struggles, brothers who loved and lost, and the women they cannot forget, then the Declan Brothers Series by Kelly Gendron should be on your list of want to reads.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R74GVLKYBC05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1508773068#wasThisHelpful","R3R74GVLKYBC05","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.75 stars---OWN THE WIND is the first installment in Kristen Ashleys contemporary, adult CHAOS motorcycle club (MC) romance series- a spin off from her Dream Man series. This is Tabitha (Tabby) Allen-MC president Tack Allens daughter- and Chaos brother Parker (Shy) Cages storyline. We were first introduced to our leading couple in Kristen Ashleys MOTORCYCLE MAN (Dream Man #4). You do not have to have read the Dream Man series to understand the premise. Any important information is revealed where necessary.Told from first person point of view (Tabby) with some intermittent third person perspectives from Shy, OWN THE WIND follows several years in the life of Tabby Allen and Shy Cage. At sixteen years of age Tabby knew she loved Shy Cage but she was the MC presidents daughter and off limits to the member of the club. Saying that, Tabby was always on Shys radar, as he and the other members of the club felt obligated to keep Tabby out of trouble and trouble seemed to invite Tabby wherever she went. Fast forward several years, wherein Tabby finished college, fell in love with another man and then lost her fianc in a tragic accident.  Tabbys friendship with Shy had been placed in cold storage throughout the years but Tabbys return to the Chaos MC brought with it old feelings and the potential for a renewed relationship. The slow build of Tabby and Shys love spans several years and multiple lovers.OWN THE WIND is a storyline with a large ensemble cast including a few characters from Kristens Dream Man series Tack and Tyra, Hawk Delgado, Mitch Lawson, and Elvira. We are re-introduced to Tacks brothers at the Chaos MC, and Tabbys best friend Natalie whose life is spinning out of control.Kristen Ashelys OWN THE WIND follows a similar outline to many of the MC series although the majority of the violence is behind the scenes or mostly implied.  The $ex scenes are intimate and provocative without the abusive and aggressive erotic factor that some MC series represent.  The action behind the scenes is left to the readers imagination.OWN THE WIND is an entertaining and colorful storyline. The characters are animated, realistic, and interact well with one another. The dynamic personalities of Shy and Tabby adds to the history between our leading couple; Tabby had to mature before Shy was able to make his move.  The relationship between Tabby and Shy begins as acquaintances, to friends to enemies, to frenemies to friends, and finally lovers- as you can see their relationship was all over the place as life and everything it had to offer followed a familiar path of loss and love. We learn Shy and Tabbys backstories-their heartbreak, their grief, their mutual attraction and need for one another; and we see a father who loves his only child beyond measure.If you are a fan of the MC storylines with happily ever afters then I recommend Kristen Ashleys OWN THE WIND-heres to a few more happily ever afters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CJ3BDIE3DJPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AMIL9C8#wasThisHelpful","R3CJ3BDIE3DJPB","AW4NFCPN81CS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW4NFCPN81CS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The real replacement parts work every bit as well as the originals. I can tell the difference on my carpet when I put a fresh set of rollers in. For the first few cleanings after a fresh set, the bin is extra full with all the dirt and cat hair that the previous set had begun to miss.Use caution however: A great many sellers are offering knockoff parts. Signs to watch for: Rollers that aren't cleanly cut on both sides, rollers made of thin plastic that's almost translucent in parts, side brushes with no screws provided, side brushes with no stitching through the rubber arms, and air filters with noticeable different screen mesh spacing. If you notice any of these signs, you should return the set. Using non-OEM parts will void your warranty.If you elect to go the non-OEM route and you're okay with knockoffs, make sure you're not paying more than $12 for a complete set. Also keep a close eye on the parts after every cleaning. The extractors may begin to shred and peel off at the edges and can hurt your motor, and a failed filter may mean you need to replace your bin if the fan is allowed to fill with debris.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UC5KT16Q6966/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VMWZIL6#wasThisHelpful","R2UC5KT16Q6966","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm perplexed by all the four and five star reviews on this.The spacebar on mine doesn't register keypresses in the middle; it's necessary to press firmly on the left or right edge or to give a firm whack if pressing in the center. All of the keys have shallow travel and no tactile indication of when they actually register a keypress. They're just squishy with no secondary resistance at the bottom of their travel. Even if we assume my space bar is defective, it makes touch typing very difficult.The layout around the right shift key will throw you for a loop every time if you're accustomed to touch typing on a keyboard with a traditional layout.The touch pad doesn't register small movements without a large movement preceding them. It's necessary to constantly swish a great distance then correct, even if you only wanted to move from one UI element to another that's right next to it.The wireless isn't Bluetooth, it's something proprietary. That would be fine if it worked as well as Bluetooth, but this is something inferior. If you've got a lot of wifi traffic, a microwave running nearby, or Bluetooth traffic, it interferes with this keyboard. Unlike Bluetooth this doesn't seem to retry until the receiving dongle confirms receipt of a keypress or key lift. Instead of delaying like Bluetooth, this just misses keys or keys get stuck in their down position until you tap the repeating key again to register another press and lift.I mainly got this to use as a HTPC (Home Theater PC) keyboard, but it's not good enough for that.For the good: It was easy to set up, no pairing operation was needed with the included dongle. I also liked that it has a hardware on/off switch. That should conserve batteries if it's rarely used. The extra left mouse button in the top left of the keyboard is a nice touch as well. The price is also good for something that tackles mousing and typing operations. But these don't address the bigger issues. Even at three stars, I feel I've been generous.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQJMORNQ9M5GE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DKZTMG#wasThisHelpful","RQJMORNQ9M5GE","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This only has one speed, and it's loud. Despite the fan moving very rapidly, the tiny plastic blades barely move any air. If you look at the picture, you can see the blade structure. Lots of short, closely-spaced blades at a high speed makes a lot of noise while moving little air.If you can afford the space and a little more electricity, consider a floor-standing box fan instead. Even on low (40 watts for the floor fan versus 20 watts for this), a floor-standing box fan moves many times the air with a tiny fraction of the noise. This thing is about as loud as a box fan on high (70 watts), but the noise is focussed in a higher pitch that's less soothing. It's tough to describe the characteristic of ambient noise, but imagine a vacuum cleaner just around the corner of an open door, or sitting on a commercial jet with a seat just behind the wing. You don't want to try to think or relax with that anywhere near you.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J7IKS9GYR6J5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007N5LHM#wasThisHelpful","R1J7IKS9GYR6J5","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The idea is clever: It's a tray set atop two plastic pillars set in a basin that you fill with water. Ants can't cross the water, so they can't climb the pillars up to the food tray. You can approximate the effect with items you already have if you put a little water on a plate and then put your pet bowl in the middle of the plate.There are a few caveats. First, standing water attracts ants. Ants enter homes in search of water just as they do for sugars, fats, and proteins. You can have your home absolutely pristine and still have ant invasions. You need to keep countertops dry, keep your dishwasher sealed, and keep your sink dry. You don't need another pool of standing water that ants flock to for a drink. The simple fix is to add a little soap when you add water to the food tray's basin. The same is true of the plate trick above. Avoid anything with a strong scent, such as many hand and dish soaps. You don't want a smell that puts your pets off their food. You should also change out the water at least once a week and give this a good scrub or use a little tea tree oil to avoid any mildew or mold growth.Second, the top half of this - the tray - is difficult to keep clean. It's too large for most sinks, it has a rough surface that food sticks to, and it's not designed to snap on and off very easily. The snaps that hold the pillars in place stick and break after a few times on and off. Resist the temptation to snap them in place at all. The pillars stay in place without snapping, and it makes it easier to simply lift the top off. If the snaps do break, a little duct tape wrapped around the pillars helps.I also like to put the food bowls on a separate tray that I set inside the top tray. I found these, and they fit just about perfectly: http://amazon.com/gp/product/B00GBFXUT6 Any 12 by 16 cafeteria tray should work if you don't like those. As a bonus, I can also put these trays in my dishwasher (no heated drying). No hand-cleaning is involved, no matter how messy my cats get with dragging their wet food out of the bowl. Another added bonus is that the tray covers the fill hole in the middle, so the soap smell doesn't rise up between the food bowls.Note the size of this as well. It's in the product details. It takes up quite a bit more space than the food bowls that sit on top. Measure and make sure you have a good place to put it before you commit. I was a little surprised at the size once this arrived. The height isn't as much of a worry as I thought. My adult cats can still comfortably eat from a bowl sitting on top, but kittens and puppies might struggle.Also note that this offers a bit more freedom in food bowl placement. As it does contain food really well, you can put this on carpet. I enjoy having the food bowls in my office where my cats like to spend the day with me, and now I'll be saved from any more steam cleaning since the cats don't drag food onto the carpet.Overall I'm glad I bought this. The price is a little high for what it offers and it has some design shortcomings. But it's easy to work around all the shortcomings, and I haven't seen a better offering.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RG4OEZPOI60I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VPY57Y4#wasThisHelpful","R2RG4OEZPOI60I","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whey is best just before and after workouts. It's much more bioavailable than proteins like casein, which are better for overnight or sustained satiety.This is a solid whey protein. It's easy to mix, the taste is decent without any strong aftertaste, and there aren't a bunch of added carbs. The 2g of carbs per serving are mostly from the lactose that comes with all whey proteins without a lot of synthetic treatments. They got all the key things right.The only thing not to love is the container. It has a rectangular lid that makes it much easier to open and take large scoops from. But the lid doesn't snap on as securely as traditional screw or coffee can-style press-on lids. I can flex the sides of the box or the lids and air easily escapes. I wouldn't trust this to have the shelf life of other proteins once it's open, I'd be careful about tipping it in transit or storage once opened, and I'd be anxious in a kitchen that's prone to ant or other pest invasions. Even if insects can't get through the small opening in the lid, they'll smell this from many meters away and they'll come exploring. Initial shipping and storage isn't a problem however: there's an additional peel-off foil lid guarding the product before it's first opened.For my own use, I'm using the full container and I'm inclined to buy more. But I've transferred it to a pop-top kitchen storage container so it has a tight seal.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35UO8117OZX9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNX6M4A#wasThisHelpful","R35UO8117OZX9Q","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Check the size - it's only 11.5 oz, which is less than a pound. That said, we're supposed to review the product and not the price.The product is good! It's regular Hellmann's mayo, which is more or less the standard by which other mayonnaises are judged. If you buy store brand or something else, usually they're trying to make it as close to this as possible. Hellmann's generally uses higher quality, non-GMO ingredients. That's all a plus.What's unique about this one is the container. Inverted mayonnaise squeeze jars are nothing new. They help prevent losing too much product stuck to the walls, and they make it really easy to cover a burger or sandwich without extra utensils involved. But this one has a very different top than the usual flip-top mayonnaises.With most flip tops, there's a bit of mayo squeezed out of the bottom when putting the cap back on, and it mooshes out the sides of the cap. If the container warms and cools a couple times, usually a lot of it works out between contraction and expansion. But this one has a different angled shape to the ""nozzle"" part. It's more like a cone with just the tip exposed, and then the cap seals all around the cone. It neatly captures and preserves the mayo, while still making it easy to spread it across a food surface. I'd say this is perfect for an office kitchen or a dorm. Basically anywhere where you want a small container and zero mess.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TQPTFKJ6OV4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T8AUZT4#wasThisHelpful","R1TQPTFKJ6OV4X","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This fills a big gap for me. There's a ton of protein in this, and the shape is perfect for slipping into a pants or gym bag pocket. It's got about as much bulk as the typical Ford car alarm key fob with a bunch of keys dangling from it. Unlike protein bars, this doesn't melt or get strange if it's kept in the pocket or left in a hot locker.I'm a big fan of Protein Sparing Modified Fasts for losing weight with little or no muscle loss. I suspect my protein powder buying habits were why Amazon's tools selected me to receive a pack of these for review. For any who haven't tried a PSMF, it means cutting carbs and fat out entirely while keeping protein and vitamin levels up. The goal is to lose weight quickly without sacrificing muscle. A PSMF can be used for rapid weight loss, or for weightlifters to help tone the body after bulk up period.But one of the challenges of an effective PSMF is in eating lots of small meals all throughout the day. Instead of three meals, it's not uncommon to have anywhere from six to ten at regular intervals. That helps keep the appetite under control even at a big calorie deficit, and it keeps the body burning body fat and consumed protein instead of going after muscle. But missing a single meal is a miserable experience - starvation's low energy and foul mood are always a single meal awya.With the New Whey vial in my pocket, there's no more worrying about getting back to my car or home for regular meals. At any time I can have all the protein I need in a couple gulps, and get right back to things.Now, I'm not sold on the flavor. At all. It's a bit like a concentrated fruit punch with artificial sweetener aftertaste. But that's the last of my concerns. I don't want something that tastes like candy and leaves me hungry for more. I just want the protein to keep me going with no fat or carbs added. I won't knock off a star for the flavor just because I'm not convinced something flavorful and rewarding is possible in such a small profile without a toxic sludge of odd chemical garbage.As a couple others mentioned, this has a pretty high sodium content. Again, for a PSMF or for bulking up, that's ideal. That's a big part of avoiding muscle cramps for PSMFs and post-workout refreshes alike.

"I bought these to replace the pads on a Plantronics Audio 400 headset. I use the headset daily, and the Plantronics cushions typically wear out every 2-3 years, well before the rest of the headset needs replacement.The foam isn't as thick and airy as the Plantronics pads. While they feel just as comfortable and prevent fatigue from the headset pressing on ears, they do feel a bit warmer after a while. I suspect the denser material doesn't breathe or wick away body moisture as well as the original pads. For my own use, these are fine. But if you use headsets all day, this subtlety may make a difference.It takes a bit of stretching and pulling to cover the stated diameter, and at first it seemed like they would never fit. But by the next day they had settled into a new shape in a surprising fashion. Don't fret if they don't fit perfectly at first, just line up the seam with the edges of the headset speaker and wait a while.There's nothing phenomenal about these, and the original Plantronics pads might be slightly more comfortable for long-term use. But at less than 1/8th of the price per pad, I can't give these fewer than four stars. I got enough pads for 5 replacements for less than the price of replacing both the pads a single time. If these last a couple years, I'm good for a decade.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTA2BT8U23M9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZNE3A78#wasThisHelpful","RTA2BT8U23M9Q","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 5% cash back reward is nice, but a couple times a month I have to keep asking whether it's really worth the headache.The most annoying thing: Charges get declined, seemingly at random despite sufficient credit available. They usually go through if you ask Amazon to resubmit the payment attempt. But if you make several purchases in a row, such as buying a handful of Kindle books, or using Subscribe-and-Save which triggers a burst of orders each month, a slew of charges get declined and you have to call Synchrony Bank to unlock the card.Calling the bank is frustrating. The automated voice system is designed to keep you from dealing with a human if at all possible, but their fraud department requires human contact of course. So with each call you are forced to wait through balance information, payment information (all the things people routinely call about), where to send payments, etc before it lets you choose to speak to a human... which you already knew you'd need to do.Note that as a side-effect of the declined charges: If you use no-rush shipping, a week goes by, Amazon begins preparing shipment and the charge gets declined... you end up starting over and waiting ANOTHER week before they attempt the no-rush shipment again. Instead of 1 week, you can end up waiting 2 or 3 weeks to get something.Unlike typical charge cards, Synchrony also gets a list of all purchases which includes the items purchased. Having an itemized bill is nice. But phone agents get chatty about specific items purchased. This feels a little creepy, and I feel for the person who buys a few bodice ripper novels as a bit of escapism, then has to talk to someone who starts asking about them. Phone agents shouldn't have access to purchase history, or should have to ask customer permission before reviewing the contents. It's not there to be conversation fodder.Synchrony Bank also blocks third-party sites from downloading transaction data. If you use something like Quicken or Mint to keep a high level view of all your balances and transactions, you're out of luck. According to the makers of Mint, Synchrony Bank blocks them because they regard other financial service companies as competitors. They're fine absorbing your Amazon purchase information, but not with sharing transactions with another party of your own choosing.I'll probably keep using the card in order to get the 5%, and I'll hope Synchrony shapes up. But I still flip back to my 3% Amazon Rewards Visa card whenever I'm purchasing something where I don't want to risk a delay. And I'm probably just 1-2 more declines away from cancelling the thing completely.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27SJMNXD0LM2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008A0GNA8#wasThisHelpful","R27SJMNXD0LM2P","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Odds are you're here because you're interested in a good USB DAC and amp for your Mac or PC. At the sub-$100 price point, both this unit and the FiiO E10K are good contenders. This unit sounds great, with a good flat response curve. There's sufficient power for punchy or sustained bass, and using a pair of Yamaha RH-5Ma headphones (unsung heroes for sub-$100 headphones) I'm enjoying music in a way I just wasn't with my iMac's headphone jack.If you're comparing this and the FiiO E10K, each has one main advantage:* The FiiO E10K has much better electrical isolation. Try both units on a PC with poor electrical isolation and you'll hear USB noise relayed through the SMSL M2. The FiiO E10K is nicely isolated. If you buy the SMSLS M2, try an external powered USB hub. A by product of the external power supply is that its power source doesn't inherit your PC noise. If you have a big box brand PC (Apple, HP, Dell), you shouldn't have to worry about this.* The SMSL M2 has a much better amp. Line out on both units is pristine, but the FiiO E10K sounds sterile once you add a pair of headphones. I suspect it's underpowered for any kind of sustained bass.* The SMSL M2 supports both synchronous and asynchronous USB. The FiiO E10K only supports synchronous USB. If your PC or USB controller is struggling and skewing the bus clock, or if it just has a cheap and inaccurate bus clock, the FiiO E10K will stutter or skip. The SMSL M2 recovers gracefully and you may never notice.I am slightly concerned about the build quality on the SMSL M2, however. Mine came with a little bit of the sole large capacitor in the unit shaved off the top and rattling around inside. I removed the shaved piece and it hasn't affected the functionality of the unit. However the tolerance is such that when they push the board into the aluminum chasis, the cap is pressed very tightly against. That could theoretically turn the capacitor mount into a fatigue point as the unit warms and cools. I know what I'll check first if the unit ever fails.The size of the SMSL M2 is tiny. It about looks like you could stack one and a half of these in an Altoids tin. I'd be tempted to mount this right on the back of my iMac's monitor stand with a little double sided tape and there wouldn't be any worry about falling off under its own weight.Overall, I'm pleased with the purchase. So far the build quality is the only concern, although watch out for the bus noise issue detailed above if you have a low end or self-built PC and aren't confident about electrical noise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7EYFVTE0WJW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLXGB5G#wasThisHelpful","R7EYFVTE0WJW3","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is meant to be a clone of Apple's leather folio cover. In some ways it matches the original, but it comes up short on a few points.First, this adds a lot of bulk to a Nexus 7. The tablet is nearly twice as thick while inside of this case.Second, it's too thick for the induction charger to work. You'll have to plug in a cable each time, or you'll have to pop your tablet out of the case each time you wish to charge it.The tablet also doesn't stand up as well in this as the iPads do in the Apple folio case. The good news is you can do a bit of work on it and get it to work better. At each bending point, try folding and crushing the cover one way, then the other. That includes both of the bending points in the cover, as well as the area that connects the cover to the portion that holds the tablet. I really had to pull and stretch at the portion that connects to the tablet a while before my Nexus 7 would stand on its own. Of note, it only stands reliably with the triangle formed in the opposite direction of what's in the product picture - inner portion folded outward.Apart from that, it does seem to offer a good amount of protection. It's not a thin case by any stretch. Being a combination of polyurethane and leather, it doesn't add much weight either. The mechanism for turning the Nexus 7 on automatically when opening the cover (magnets) works reliably as well. So far I haven't had a miss.I'm keeping this cover as I don't use my Nexus 7 (2013) terribly frequently.

"The concept is nice, but this really doesn't work out well. Tissue cubes are meant to be used upright. In normal upright use, tissues in the box cling together, and gravity keeps the bulk of the tissues from coming out at once. When the box is horizontal, the entire wad of tissues is pulled sideways against the opening and they prevent you from pulling a single tissue out without lots of poking your finger through the slot or repeated short tugs.The sideways orientation means that the box also needs extra desk space. It's wider than it is tall, and you need additional space to pull out the tissue. It doesn't save space compared to a regular full size box of tissues unless you make good use of the storage space on top.The unit is otherwise well designed. It's cheap plastic, but there's a rubbery grip on the bottom and a little weight that keeps the box in place on a porous surface like glass or wood, given you don't tug too hard.Several people commented about the stickers. I didn't have trouble removing them, but there was a lot of glue of the type that dries out fairly quickly. If you have trouble, consider soaking the thing in a large salad bowl with a little dish soap. Give it an hour and you should find the label comes off easily. But give the unit a try first.

"You can imagine the great fun you can have with a radio controlled vibrator in public. The We Vibe is also surprisingly strong for its light size. It has a good hour of active (buzzing) use on a single charge, or quite a bit more if you don't use the stronger settings. The available iPhone app also adds to the fun: You can design your own pulse patterns, adjust through ten different intensities, and your companion never knows whether you're checking a text or about to tease.Cleaning the unit is very easy, as it's completely waterproof. The charging stand completely hides the toy, making it discrete enough to leave out in plain sight. All in all it's a very well thought out toy.I knocked off one star because of one major flaw, however. The toy has a 15 minute automatic shut off. You need to trigger the toy at least once every 15 minutes with the remote app (or the included dedicated remote) or it shuts off and stops listening to the remote. It then has to be activated again by applying substantial pressure to a button on the vibrator for a few seconds - it's not something you can do for your partner discretely. The timeout means if you're going to play with this in public, say over dinner, there's a good chance it won't be alive anymore by the time you drive your date to the restaurant. This shortcoming is unfortunate and unnecessary as the battery will last all day as long as the unit's given quick stay-awake ""nudge"" with the phone app. Even a split second pulse will do. I really wish they offered an option to disable or change the duration of the automatic shutoff. If they fixed this for a We Vibe 5 and changed nothing else, I'd be an eager customer for a five star product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQK69TZI0AR87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2DT6ZW#wasThisHelpful","RQK69TZI0AR87","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The size of this makes it ideal for a quick daily scoop. Even with a large box, you can cycle all the litter through the scoop in just half a dozen scoops through the litter. If you use clumping litter, the large size and wide slats also help reduce dust if you use it properly. For my money, it's the perfect scoop.My approach: Get the scoop deep into the litter and lift upward while shaking it lightly side to side. Don't raise it more than half an inch over the litter until the last of the litter has sifted through. By keeping it close to the surface of the litter, very little dust ends up airborne. The wide slats make it quick, and the large surface of the scoop increases the ratio of litter that passes through nowhere near the edges of the scoop.I did knock off one star because plastic isn't as easy to keep clean as some metals. The plastic also isn't entirely sturdy. While mine has lasted a year so far, it feels flimsy and does occasionally make a cracking noise that makes it sound like it's going to give way. I haven't found which part is breaking yet, but I fully expect it to give out at some point. At the price I don't mind buying a spare to keep on hand. It's a tenth the price of a sturdy metal scoop, and some of those still break where the handle meets the metal scoop. But I'd be happier if I could spend a few bucks more and have something that felt like it would last forever.I can't believe I'm three paragraphs into an essay on cat poop scoops.

"Dec 2014 Update: Mac users, take note that the problems detailed below have been addressed in the newer version of this product: Dell Computer Ultra HD 4K Monitor P2415Q 24-Inch Screen LED-Lit MonitorOriginal review:The picture is lovely - you can read the other reviews for details. However, this monitor presents problems for Mac users who wish to use it at 60Hz. You may find yourself stuck at 30Hz for one of two reasons.Thunderbolt 2 / DisplayPort 1.2 requirement:The display requires DisplayPort 1.2 for 60Hz use, otherwise it will run at 30Hz. If your Mac has Thunderbolt 2 ports, you then must enable DisplayPort 1.2 support in the monitor's menus to use it at 60Hz. Even if you are stuck at 30Hz because of Thunderbolt 1/DisplayPort 1.0, the display provides a solid image. It has memory sufficient to retain and redisplay the image without flicker.Power saving bug:In 60Hz DisplayPort 1.2 mode, the display uses ""multi-stream transport"" mode. This effectively splits the video between two channels on the Mac, and rejoins them on the monitor. This is necessary because a single display stream transport provides insufficient bandwidth to send the full frame buffer 60 times per second. There is a problem in the implementation, however. The Mac only sends power saving signals on the first stream. The Dell monitor incorrectly looks at the second stream for wake signals. The result is that once the monitor has been asleep a while, it will not wake. It's necessary to power the monitor off and back on again. If you are using this as a second display, you will find that your windows are all pushed back to the first display every time you do this.According to Dell, there is no way for them to fix the problem in the field. When and if they create a fix (they have not yet as of November 2014), you will need to send your monitor back to Dell, and they will send another used monitor back to you with updated firmware. The alternative solution would be for Apple to send the power wake signal on both streams, however Apple doesn't have a history of making non-standard tweaks for third-party hardware. The only workaround is to use the monitor in DisplayPort 1.0 mode at 30Hz, which causes the Dell monitor to rely on the first/only stream for power wake signals.If you wish to know more about this issue, search Google for this exact string to find the Dell forum with Dell engineers discussing the issue: ""UP2414Q won't reliably resume from sleep or reboot using mDP to DP cable""","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQX1BPO8BQM5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HALPPM0#wasThisHelpful","RQX1BPO8BQM5S","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've tried a few different treat balls, and this is my favorite. Others broke easily, or ended up spread around the apartment.The egg shape is better than the sphere shaped, as the ball stays within a fairly small area. My cats still push it around the room quite a bit, but constantly in different directions. With a round ball, they would often send it careening across the room or ultimately out the door.The adjustable treat release holes are designed more intelligently than with other balls. They're spaced such that turning the adjustment can open only one hole, one and part of another, or all three. Others tend to make all three holes adjust to the same size, which means there's no making the cats really work for the treat. With this one, I can make it a little difficult and they'll diligently work at it for a few minutes per treat.The plastic used is a hard plastic, with no parts that rely on flexibility. The pieces all twist together snugly, and there are no tabs that break off.The ball twists apart in two even halves for filling. It's possible to fill the reservoir end without treats spilling all over the desk or into one's hand. With some others, a hatch opposite the dispensing end opens, which means treats flow into the ball and spill back out as it's being filled. I'm happy not to have that problem here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKF2ITQ6M52A6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003H44R5K#wasThisHelpful","RKF2ITQ6M52A6","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You can find a few other treat balls on Amazon. I'd recommend against this particular model. It's very fragile. If you don't press a locking tab firmly enough, the tab will break off when you adjust the hole widths. If you press just a bit too firmly, the tab will break off as well. The whole thing seems to have been designed to be molded in a rubbery plastic, but it's molded in a stiff and brittle plastic.Additionally, the adjustable holes all must be opened to the same width. They aren't spaced unevenly around the ball so that the adjustment can be turned to open just one or two holes. This means either treats are going to be dispersed very easily through all three holes, or not at all. Other models allow opening just one hole, or opening one hole partly while opening another fully.Last, the way the ball is refilled requires that it be inverted so treats fall out as it's filled unless you block them all with your hand. Other treats unscrew into two halves for refilling, or have the filling hatch on the same end as the individual holes.I'm also not a fan of the perfectly round shape. My favorite is an egg-shaped treat dispenser. This keeps the treats within a room pretty well. With the round ball, treats end up dispensed out of one room and down the hallway. It's a nuisance when it gets under the bed.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXE8YJO9I7D40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018CG40O#wasThisHelpful","RXE8YJO9I7D40","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are many sets of dry erase markers and erasers on Amazon. This one is a stand out for also including the spray cleaner.PRO* The markers work well and don't have an overpowering smell* The tips are well made, and don't depend on writing angle as much as many others do although a variety of line widths is possible* The included spray works great on dry erase markings that have been on boards at length. No more running off for a damp rag or rubbing alcohol! It seems to be gentle on my cheap white board as wellCON* The eraser is a little on the small side. It's nice in that it stays on a white board ledge fairly easily without the usual sideways balancing act, but it does mean erasing takes a few extra passes.* I wish they included a second black marker, as is common in some other sets.

"To be clear, this is not a traditional clumping litter. If that's what you're looking for you should examine other options. Instead, this is a very coarse litter designed to absorb urine and wick the moisture off of feces well enough that it stops smelling after a while. The wood scent is meant to cover ther est up.PRO* This approach produces very little dust. If you're trying to control dust, this may be a good solution for you.* The pine (I think there may be other wood smells too) smell is not overpowering, and it does an okay job of covering poo smells eventually, but it does take time.CON* The cats track the large wood pellets everywhere. This happens to all litter to an extent, but I found them everywhere in my apartment. They really hurt when stepped on, versus litter that settles into carpet and gets picked up by regular vacuuming.* Scooping is a challenge. The wood pellets are much larger than regular litter, and I couldn't find a scoop with slits large enough to allow me to sift this. I ended up throwing a large amount of litter away with every scoop.* The pellets do absorb urine somewhat, however it doesn't stop liquid from getting to the bottom of the litter box. You can get away with rarely or never cleaning a litterbox with clay litter. With this, expect to scrub the box by hand a couple times a month.I ended up not using all of the litter. Despite the extra dust, I greatly prefer clay litters. It's easier to balance a vaccum cleaner hose on the litter box when scooping clay than it is to have to fully clean a litterbox and cope with the feces smell that takes longer to subsude.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TWW8CQ1J2KO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IYI0O4M#wasThisHelpful","R2TWW8CQ1J2KO8","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is tasty and has a good texture to it. There's no chalkiness, as with many protein powders, and it mixes very easily. It didn't take much stirring to get rid of all clumps whether mixing this with milk or water.It has real sugar and stevia, which aren't exactly healthy but may be better for you than many artificial sweeteners. Digestion should be fairly easy between the natural sugars and the extra bit of fiber this includes. Compare this to other protein powders which often include inverted sugar alcohols which are only digestible by gut bacteria and lead to intestinal distress.I don't know how to qualify how good the protein is. There's a lot of disagreement in body building forums about which proteins are best, so look at the ingredients and make your own decision. Mixing up protein sources is believed to be one of the better approaches, and this can fit in with that approach.The only down side is that the vitamin content isn't very high overall. I see this more as a supplement than a meal replacement. It's good for energy and protein, but you wouldn't want to make a habit of replacing one of your daily meals unless you're eating more than three meals a day.

"The good:* Easy to set up with a mobile app. When you power on the camera, it creates its own wi-fi network. You tell your iPhone or Android device to use that network, run the free mobile app, and associate it with your normal wi-fi network and an online account.* Cheap. Wi-fi cameras are really coming down in price, and this is in the middle of the low end price range* Mobile app works well at home and away. It's smart enough to use peer-to-peer if the mobile device and camera are on the same network, and it relays through a third-party service if one is away* Integrates with the WeMo app. It can be used as a motion detector to trigger power on/off rules on other WeMo devices.* The IR vision actually works. Often these are muddy and unusable on low-end cameras. Here it's decently crisp* 1280x720 resolution (720p) makes the camera quite usable even at a distance of 20-30 feet* Built in microphone works fairly well, even when subjects are 10 feet away* A website is provided for viewing the camera in a regular browser. Flash is all that's required.* The mobile app can save snapshots and video clips directly to the camera roll (tested on iPhone) - the video integration was a nice surpriseThe bad:* No matter what, you're not getting a decent framerate out of this. It looks like 8-10fps despite the listed specs, even when little is changing in the frame. There's also a significant lag (2-3 seconds) that you just won't get rid of with the web view. Less on the mobile app.* Big mobile app annoyance: Every time one switches to the mobile app, it plays a pointless animation. Every. Single. Time. If you toggle between the camera and text messaging for example, you will watch this animation for what feels an eternity. It doesn't even resume the last active camera view, even if only leaving the mobile app for 2 seconds.* Wide-angle view that you can't disable. It works relatively well for up-close objects. But there's significant fish eye on anything even 5 feet away. This is definitely a surveillance camera, not usable for chatting or other such uses.* The built-in two-way audio feature is nearly useless. Audio from the camera to the mobile device works fairly well, but the speaker in the camera is difficult to hear. It has loud midrange and little else, making it sound like a typical drive-through speaker. Don't expect to be able to use this to talk with kids from far away, and it scares the hell out of my cats.* Little adjustability for the motion detection. My cats set off the motion detector constantly, so I can't use it for security or notification about human visitors. Some other cameras allow setting triggers based on the type or amount of motion, while also allow rejecting motion low in the frame to deal with pets.* The website squashes the aspect ratio to 4:3 despite this being a 16:9 aspect camera.* The website disconnects after about half an hour and needs a new login each time. It does not work as a peer-to-peer connection even if on the same network, unlike the mobile app.* There doesn't seem to be any support for third-party camera software, or a way of viewing multiple camera feeds at once without manually opening a bunch of browser windows.Verdict:If you want a cheap temporary surveillance camera that's easy to set up, requires no wires apart from the power cable, and have an existing wi-fi network, this is a decent choice. Don't expect to make good use of this with multi-camera setups, always-on surveillance, two-way communications, or for any other advanced use.Note:I didn't count this as a negative since it's not how most home networks are set up, but I did have some trouble with the wi-fi configuration on a network that had multiple wireless base stations in order to extend range. (An example of this would be multiple Apple Airports, each wired to ethernet, and each configured to broadcast the same SSID and use the same password.) The Belkin app repeatedly failed to configure the network when I would pick the SSID from the network list, where the same SSID was also shown multiple times. Choosing the option to attach it to a ""different network"" and then manually typing the SSID worked. If you have a similar whole-home setup with multiple base stations, this may save you some grief.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T920AE1SLIUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNM763E#wasThisHelpful","R2T920AE1SLIUB","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're expecting something with the texture of a regular snack bar or granola bar, this isn't it. The texture (not taste) is almost like crispy bits embedded in a chewy molasses. It's confusing at first, but once you taste it you rapidly adapt to it. By the second bar, I was looking forward to the snack. They managed to make an interesting texture without incorporating glutens or some of the weird grain substitutes in other bars.The taste was spot on. It's sweet but not overly so, and the dark chocolate and raspberry really come forward. It's got a full taste that lasts throughout the bar. It's not like other chemically sweetened bars where the taste hits hard and tapers like a bad candy.I'm normally a bit sensitive to meal replacement and high nutrient snack bars, with energy spiking at first and then leaving me sluggish after a while. Instead, these seem to have a nice mix of low glycemic index ingredients which left me feeling satisfied and healthy for hours after eating.All around, pretty darn good.

"I've used a number of Belkin cases, and so I was excited to give this one a shot. The verdict? There's literally *nothing* to complain about!Much like an Apple flip cover, it has a built in magnet that can wake the iPad when opened. If you don't like this behavior, it can be disabled in the iPad system preferences.The case is very light, which gives it a flimsy feel. Initially I was going to treat this as a spare case, so I abused it a bit, pulling and trying to tear at the seams. It proved surprisingly strong. It showed no signs of give. I believe it will wear well, and in the end I'm using it as my main case after all.Unlike many cases, this was already a good fit. There doesn't seem to be any kind of breaking in period. Belkin seems to have machined this with tighter tolerances than any other case I've used, save perhaps Apple's own. The iPad stays in well, yet it's not difficult to pop the iPad out of the case.I love the color choice. It's fun, but not gaudy.

"I'm using this for an array of SSDs which are in a fairly noisy enclosure. This lets me put the RAID in my closet, 30 feet away from the computer.Before anything else, I tested and benchmarks were identical with this, compared to the 1 meter Thunderbolt cable that came with the RAID enclosure. If there is any performance drop, it's smaller than the few megabytes per second difference I get between successive runs of the benchmark on identical configurations.The cable really does allow tight turns without any sense of fragility. It arrives coiled fairly tightly, and you're not likely to route the cable at a tighter radius in normal use. Still, given the price of the cable you might use extra caution. With that (and my cable-munching cat) in mind, I ran it with some network cables and used zip ties to contain the whole set in some loom tubing. You can find small diameter tubing at a small fraction of the price of this cable. The extra security is worth it, IMHO.Note that this does require a self-powered Thunderbolt device on both ends. Both ends contain an optical transceiver that needs power. That said, even in power saving mode Thunderbolt devices should power the cable. So you shouldn't have issues with waking peripherals from sleep or similar.Edit: I'm now using this with a Retina iMac and Thunderbolt 2. It is indeed a Thunderbolt 2 capable cable, with sustained speeds of about 15 gigabits. A traditional copper cable doesn't do any better with my SSD RAID array.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BLIPPVICI8LC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HSTC496#wasThisHelpful","R3BLIPPVICI8LC","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was apprehensive about giving this a shot, but I'm glad I did. Lightweight litters are known for being more dusty than regular litters, but this was not the case here.I couldn't find any significant tradeoff between this and regular litter. Dust levels were ordinary - as with any litter, I was able to control it by using my sifting scoop close to the surface of the litter to the litter didn't fall far through the air. This litter clumps every bit as effectively as regular clay litter. It has a strong but not overpowering scent, doing most of its odor control by rapidly wicking away moisture. Beware some multi-cat litters that smell like perfume bombs. Scooping is a little bit easier than with regular clay litter, both because the scoop weighs less when full, and because the clumps push through the lighter litter more easily.The only down side I experienced was that the cats seemed to track the litter a bit further from the box with this than with ordinary litter. Cats sweat from their paws, and so litter clings. My speculation is that the cats may not have felt this litter on their feet so readily as with other litters, and so they may not have worked as hard to wipe it away. If you have a litter mat or other measure to control tracking, this shouldn't be an issue. Otherwise, you might have to sweep the floor farther from the box than you normally would.On the whole, I like it.

"These chips are very flavorful. As the name implies, they're sweet. It's not a cloying sweetness but much more pleasant and nicely complemented by the chili and garlic. The combination is almost addictive. If you have trouble putting away a regular bag of chips unfinished, or if you have a sweet tooth, you're unlikely to resist finishing these medium sized bags.The good news is they're much less salty than regular chips. If you're on a low sodium diet or you just don't like being thirsty after a snack, that's a plus. I was pleasantly surprised in comparing the salt content with other chips.The bad news is these are also much messier than regular chips. In addition to being a little greasy, the chili and sugar add a bit of a grainy texture and a colorful smear to anything you touch. It's like Doritos in this regard (but arguably healthier). Bring plenty of napkins.I also had a little bit of heartburn, possibly from the combination of chili and sugar. Admittedly I'd had these chips several days in a row.

"The RAID management software for this unit on OS X has serious problems. As part of the install for their OS X ""RAID Master"" utility (current and most recent version rev358), they install copies of apache 2.2.22, php 5.3.16, openssl 1.0.1f. apache server is configured to listen on port 8848, and presents a RAID configuration interface.Problems:* The server listens to port 8848 on all interfaces.* The web service is unauthenticated. A network attacker or unprivileged local user can alter or destroy a RAID array using a regular web browser.* The web service does not sanitize browser input before concatenating it to a shell command and executing. At multiple points in ajax.php, a remote user can execute arbitrary shell commands as the 'daemon' user if he or she is willing to alter the RAID array as a side effect. Shell commands can be concatenated on each argument to the RAID setup.* The web service does not protect against CSRF. Third-party pages can manipulate the RAID if a user merely browses to any web page embedding RAID commands.* The bundled versions of apache2, php5 and openssl all contain multiple vulnerabilities, including further potential for remote users executing arbitrary code. There is no update mechanism in place, nor have they provided newer builds.* The RAID configuration utility does not advise the user that it is opening a service on all ports (or even disclose that it is installing a web server in the first place). Users may not realize that they are exposing a vulnerable service on the local network, or installing web services that need updates.* Security issues aside, the RAID configuration utility stops working 30 days after installation with a ""License has expired"" error. To avoid reinstalling the same version of the same software every 30 days, I had to alter the software. (Look at the IsExpired function in /usr/share/odm/home/*/ajax2.php if you want to fix your own copy - ""default"" is the choice if using English). The disabled state does NOT remove the security vulnerabilities above, it only prevents browsing the user interface.* No uninstaller is provided. Advanced knowledge is necessary to remove the software and the security problems it introduces.My recommendation is that you wait for other similar Thunderbolt RAID solutions until they get this under control.My original review:Title: Great performance, not quiet, some problems with SSDsStars: 3I would love for this enclosure to have worked out for me. Performance is wonderful, licking at just shy of 800 megabytes per second in both read and write with four SSDs in a RAID 0. But some noise and SSD recognition problems are deal breakers for my own desktop use.This unit is not quiet. If you put it behind an iMac, it still sounds several times louder than the iMac with the GPU and CPU fans running at full tilt. With the lid off, the fan is an acceptable low hum, but with the protective lid on it reverberates at a higher and inconsistent pitch. If you are looking for something as quiet as your Mac, this is not the RAID for you. It sounds like a commodity PC power supply.There is also a problem with SSDs (and possibly other hard drives with quick startup time) used in a JBOD configuration. When multiple drives come online quickly, they are not reported to the OS. It's necessary to pull and reinsert each unidentified drive one at a time in order to get them to be recognized by the OS. This behavior was consistent with Samsung 1TB 840 EVO, Crucial 960GB M500 and Intel 480GB 730 SSDs. I could not find a combination that consistently powered on properly. If you're using SSDs, you do not want to use this enclosure for JBOD.The Thunderbolt ports are recessed. This isn't a problem with the supplied cable, or with Apple's cables. It actually protects these plugs against shearing force. But be warned that many third-party Thunderbolt cables with wider shrouds will not fit. Given that the size of the shroud is part of the Thunderbolt spec, these third-party cables are technically non-compliant, however they are plentiful. Be careful about cable selection. The protective feature can cause a wasted cable order.Curiously, this enclosure includes a canvas-like carrying tote with a very tight fit. It was a clever and surprising extra that gave me a really positive impression initially. However the carrier isn't big enough to include the power supply and thunderbolt cable as well, or not without leaving the RAID itself squeezed part-way out of the tote.Also of note: One SSD/2.5"" rail set is included. I didn't see this documented anywhere, and so I ordered four SSD kits directly from the manufacturer. I only needed to order three.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XVOAZ0QRSRJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CC0VRQC#wasThisHelpful","R1XVOAZ0QRSRJS","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It was completely plug-and-play.However, if you will be using this in a chain with other devices you may experience problems with the shroud around the Mini DisplayPort end. The shroud around the plug is substantially fatter than a Thunderbolt plug. The result is that even if a peripheral can be daisy chained with DisplayPort at the end, the plug may not physically fit if the ports are crowded close together or if the plug is recessed with only enough clearance for Thunderbolt spec cables.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26YAONL56LTMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CAGDUA#wasThisHelpful","R26YAONL56LTMP","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Before using Fresh Step Multi Cat, she was extremely fastidious.If you've already ordered this, and if my box was representative of a normal batch, I recommend cutting it with regular litter to reduce the overpowering scent.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MVYQR7GKQ32F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003LPZTTS#wasThisHelpful","R3MVYQR7GKQ32F","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fun toy. The iPhone app that controls it is a breeze to set up, and has a large number of options for playing with the color and intensity of the bulb. You can do more than choose the color and brightness - you can also tie it to music, and set up gradual hue changes.The bulb options can only be changed when the phone is near the bulb. There doesn't seem to be an internal long-term timer for any kind of automatic on/off at preset times when the phone user is away. Range is limited by Bluetooth, not wi-fi, so you can't use it from the far side of your home either. This is only a toy for playing with room lighting while you are present.The bulb simply isn't very bright, either. It's great for a small and intimate space. Don't expect to light a medium sized room with this. You'll want to put it in a separate bedside lamp or the like.I like it, and it feels like a taste of the kind of mechanisms that will be built into all home lighting decades from now. For now, it's a brilliant little experimental toy.

"The look of this is absolutely great. In addition to being attractive, it has a satisfyingly hefty weight, and it's cool the way it folds flat for packing and storage. Unfortunately, it doesn't work as well as some of the more basic napkin holders.Rather than a weight that focuses on one small place in the center, as with most napkin holders, the holder has a bar that lays flat against much of the napkin when full. If one pulls upward and out, as one would with most napkin holders, the arm flips up and off the napkin. It needs to be moved back in place manually.If the napkin holder isn't full, the arm tends to move backward on its own, causing the stack of napkins to skew backward. It's unattractive. It also doesn't work as well once the arm moves back, as it grips only the back edge of the napkin. This often results in a second napkin to come out part-way when removing the topmost napkin.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15U56HL1I51RM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CZA1A66#wasThisHelpful","R15U56HL1I51RM","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This popcorn pops up to a nice size, and the flavors are very evenly distributed. The taste of this isn't much different than the regular butter-and-salt versions. The ""classic butter"" and ""sea salt"" may be feel-good labeling more than anything else. But it's still a very tasty popcorn. It could perhaps use just a touch more butter.The cool thing about these is that the bags have a built in ""bowl."" By pulling the red cellophane-like plastic off, the bag unfolds into a self-standing serving bowl that's comfortable to hold, or to stand on a table. We enjoyed it for movie time. Getting the plastic off takes quite a bit more of a pull than you might guess. Be forceful, but be sure you're pulling in the right direction so you don't tear the bag.The only real down side is that the bag contains slightly less popcorn than some of the other bags. If you're using a microwave with an automatic popcorn setting, you may need to pull it out a few seconds early. The setting will probably assume a standard portion size. The first bag came away slightly burnt when this ran through a full automatic cycle.

"This is a great find for large dogs. But for cats, even the half gallon size is far too large.Half a gallon is 64 fluid ounces. Cats need 2-4 ounces a day. That means the half gallon size holds 16-32 days' worth of water for one cat. However, any cat water dish starts to look a bit funky and unpleasant after just a few days. Unless you have a huge number of cats sharing the waterer, or unless you absolutely need to leave the cats untended for a week, consider a smaller waterer.The construction of the thing feels sturdy. The built-in water filter is a nice touch as well. Unfortunately, the instructions don't tell one to remove the plastic from the filter brick (it's not obvious), and don't tell how to flush the filter before the first use.

"The good: This is as precise as you would expect from a Wacom input device. Having a mouse that's designed for the tablet surface is convenient; there's no worry of scratching your Wacom when using a device designed for that surface. It also works with later version mice. Wacom removed the ""Intuos4"" portion of the product name for this same model when they released the Intuos5 tablet.The bad: The scroll wheel is slippery. There's no ribbing or coarse surface as with other scroll wheels, but there's enough resistance that it doesn't move easily. It's made of a very slick and only slightly rubbery plastic. I frequently have to lick my finger in order to prevent my finger from merely sliding over the mouse wheel, or I have to constantly bear down a bit and risk misclicks. I've given serious thought to trying to score the surface with a razor blade in order to give it more of a grip, but I may still return the thing so I can't do that yet.The scroll wheel jumps in coarse clicks. I would guess that there are only 16 or so clicks for a full rotation. This means the wheel has to be set to be very slow with lots and lots of spinning to move, or one has to live with scrolling pages 1/4 of a screen at a jump.The ergonomics are bad for any but the tiniest hands. The mouse is not as long as a typical mouse - if you've used a notebook ""travel mouse,"" you know how that feels. This one is also taller than typical mice, giving it an almost ball-like shape in your hand. It has an unusual downward slope toward the buttons. I've got hands that are only slightly larger than average, yet I have to contort my hand like I'm posing for some kind of kung fu ""eagle talon"" move in order to rest my fingers on the buttons and scroll wheel. This thing makes my hand ache. I'd love to see one with a profile more like Apple's wireless mice.The verdict: I'll probably send it back and get felt feet for an existing mouse, or try to get used to the Intuos5 touch input.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S9H90H2M9FCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002BH4Q5K#wasThisHelpful","R3S9H90H2M9FCV","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you only need to read Blu-Ray media, this is a cheap, workable solution. It works well with Windows, Mac and Linux with appropriate software. It does require two USB ports in order to provide power, unless you purchase a separate power adapter. This is common for external optical media drives.The unit has an exceptionally cheap feel to it. The plastic case is a flimsy, yielding plastic that you would more expect from a Happy Meal toy than a computer peripheral, but it does its job. Just don't stack anything on it. The tiniest bit of pressure on the top is enough to flex the case and grind against the spinning media.The trouble comes in with older CDs and DVDs. The overhead space for media in the drive is ridiculously low. If you have media that's even a fraction of a milimeter thicker than normal, as happens with adhesive labels or some older multi-color screen printed CDs and DVDs, they'll actually scrape against the internal surface of the unit, either refusing to play or producing too many errors for playback.

"The quality of the printed study content varies significantly. Much of it is spot on; it's up to date and relevant. However, the author often drops into explaining basics that shouldn't be necessary for any computer professional. At other times, the author seems to state opinions and speculation as fact. The book desperately needs review from a technical editor. Much of the content could be excised in order to make a much, much smaller and more focussed book.The practice exam content is good. Many would do well to purchase that and decide whether they need the remaining content, or whether this set is the best source of that material.Some of the advertised study content is completely missing from the CD. What's present is difficult to use if you aren't using Windows, as the primary navigation tools are Windows executables. (Really? For platform-neutral content?

"With a person on the scale, this unit can take far too long to settle. The number jumps up and down a pound or three at length before it finally announces a number. Unless you're very light or have exceptional stability, this can take as much as a minute of trying to stand still.The packaging claims that this is accurate to within a tenth of a pound, but that doesn't match my experience. Setting a fixed weight on it will return different values with each subsequent weighing. I put two 60lb dumbbells on the scale, and the reported weight was sometimes as low as 118.5, and as high as 121.3. In half a dozen weighings, that's 2.8lbs variance on a fixed weight! At least with the non-moving dumbbells, it was able to announce a number in five seconds instead of a minute.The announcement voice is also incredibly loud, really more shouting weights in a grainy voice than announcing them. After the tests above, I tried taping a paper napkin over the speaker. That helped quite a bit, making the voice sound clearer and more natural, though still quite loud.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OPG80ZJ0SHOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014ZQH84#wasThisHelpful","R1OPG80ZJ0SHOZ","A1D3DDK2FXO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D3DDK2FXO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Track ListThis review is for the COMPLETE score, which is currently not available ANYWHERE to my knowledge, but is the ideal way to hear this score (naturally). For reference, after seeing the film in the theater twice, I believe the correct chronological order of the music to be:OvertureThe GridFather and SonThe Son of FlynnEncom Part IEncom Part IIRecognizerArmoryArenaRound OneRinzlerThe Game Has ChangedOutlandsFather and SonAdagio For TronNocturneOutlands, Part IIReflectionsEnd Of LineCastorDerezzedFallSea of SimulationRectifierDisc WarsC.L.U.ArrivalFlynn LivesSunrise PreludeTron Legacy (End Titles)Solar SailerFinaleThe PiecesOverture is a mix of electronic and orchestra, and is not used in the film. It is the main theme of the film which is used many times and is a perfect overture.The Grid is very similar to Overture, but features a build-up and voice-over by Jeff Bridges. Normally I don't care for voice-overs...but this one is awesome.Father and Son is a slower version of the main main theme. Beautiful.The Son of Flynn is an electronic piece that sounds more like a Daft Punk song, building upon its own electronic themes. Great.Encom Part I and II are atmospheric film music which are uniformly excellent and a nice break after the faster paced The Son of Flynn.Recognizer is the awesome music you remember from the Tron Legacy Trailer, a sinister foreboding piece that gradually builds upon itself to become an epic awesome musical masterpiece evoking appropriate awe and wonder of the first glimpse of a world only previously imagined.Armory is a slow down-beat piece played while Sam is being suited up to fight in the games, it's one of my favorite tracks. Slow, methodical, and beautiful.Arena, Round One, and Rinzler are all battle music from the games and to me are similar in feel. They are more brash, harsh, loud, and lively than more of the other tracks, featuring a lot of digital distortion. Still good though.The Game Has Changed is another one of the best tracks, featured during the light-cycle battle. Show-down music. Great stuff.Outlands Part I and II is atmospheric music to evoke the landscape of the digital world, and is similar to something John Williams or James Newton Howard would use in Hook or Peter Pan. Another of my favorites, though both pieces are very similar, almost to the point of being one piece.Adagio For Tron is slow piece that builds in in sad gravity like Chopin piece, as it describes Flynn's creation of the new Grid, and how it was then corrupted and filled with tragedy by his creation C.L.U.Nocturne is another of my favorites, mostly because it reminds me of Nightvision from Discovery. It's slow, sad, and sweet. I love it.Reflections is basically the start of the theme from C.L.U., and thus is part of the theme of that character. Dark and sinister starting with strings and then moving into electronic sounds.End of Line, Castor, and Derezzed are all club music from the End of Line club. The first is industrial sounding, the second is more rave-type club music (more upbeat, with a cut-out seconds after it starts). Derezzed is arguably the best ""Daft-Punk style"" track on the score, with infectious beats and addictive electronic stylings that will make you want to listen to it over and over. A perfect piece of music for a stylized fight. Fantastic.Fall is an appropriate piece of music played during a quick crisis in the film, a piece that gets the heart rate up quick. I don't care for the electronic distortion on this track as it distracts from the main musical theme played.Sea of Simulation is another slower paced piece that sounds very Daft-Punkish in tone. Soothing and slow, it's the music from the journey on the solar sailor. Another favorite.Rectifier. Sinister villain music of threatening imminent demise. CodeMaster Talon told me it reminds her of Captain Hook's Theme from Hook. Appropriate music. A good track if you like Zaibach from the Vision of Escaflowne soundtrack or One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII.Disc Wars is a piece full of determination which builds on itself. Less brash than the arena battle music, it is nonetheless appropriate battle music. Excellent.C.L.U. is naturally the villains' main theme and an excellent sweeping sinister piece which builds upon itself going from sinister to contemplative to urgent, blending the best of Reflections and Fall. Outstanding.Arrival is your brief breather before the epic finale. It's the music played when our heroes finally arrive at their destination and there is a spiritual tint to the piece as it goes from light and angelic to heavy and mortal. Gates of Valhalla music. Brilliant.Flynn Lives is by far the best piece of music in the entire score. It is the epic climax music which uses Wagnerian string and horn motifs for brilliant dramatic effect. This piece literally makes the final showdown of the movie what it is. There are no words to describe how brilliant and awesome this piece is. Academy Award material if I ever heard it. The main Tron Legacy theme is used to its maximum potential.Sunrise Prelude is....gorgeous. It combines the slow beautiful beats of the style of Encom, Armory, or Nocturne with the slow orchestral beauty that comes later from the finale. It's the last track in the movie and being at once sad, dramatic, romantic, and achingly beautiful... is absolutely perfect.Tron Legacy (End Titles) is perfect ending credits music. It's an electronic, upbeat, catchy, fantastic remix of the main Tron Legacy Theme from Overture, The Grid, ect.Solar Sailer is another slower paced electronic piece similar to Sea of Simulation (and goes quite well together with it). Not my favorite track as it's just not progressive enough in its melody for my taste, but it's a favorite track for many people (including my girlfriend).Finale is the Sunrise Prelude (only orchestra with no electronic sounds) which morphs into the main Tron Legacy theme with carefully chosen electronic instrumentation. After a somewhat rousing main theme is quietly takes its leave like the last star of night under the light of day. An wonderful finale to a fantastic score.The ScoreTron Legacy has one of the greatest musical scores in film history, easily on par with the best of John Williams, James Horner, and perhaps even the revered Ennio Morricone. It's THAT good. And this coming from me, a person who pretty much only listens to video game music, J-pop, and most of all, TONS of orchestral scores for TV shows and films (you would think Silva Screen Records is on speed-dial and City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra as my homepage for all the music I have from everything from El Cid to The Last Starfighter).The first Tron had a very unique musical score that was largely made-up of electronic sounds, resulting a very appropriate computerized feel. When I heard that Daft Punk would be creating the score for Tron Legacy, I didn't know WHAT to think. On the one hand, I was a huge fan of Daft Punk's album discovery (check out my spotlight review on Amazon if you don't believe me). And on the other hand...there was just so much potential to get everything wrong and ruin the score by producing something that didn't fit with the vibe of the new film and the original. Hence, I tried to keep an open mind and not set my expectations too high so as not to be disappointed. I needn't have worried.Some have said that the score needs to stand on its own, and is best heard separate from the film. I couldn't disagree more. A ballet is meant to be watched, an opera is meant to be watched, and a film score is meant to be watched. When you see the film Tron Legacy the music fuels everything on-screen. The film was actually cut to the music, resulting the movie feeling very much like an awesome long music video. From the opening notes and title of the film to the epic climax at its finish, I highly recommend seeing the film to fully enjoy the music. That said...This score manages to perfectly capture the feel of the world of Tron, simultaneously paying tribute to the past while being completely fresh and new (I have heard the score to the original Tron and could not find any copied musical cues whatsoever). Rest assured, the themes in this score are brand new, yet totally appropriate. Sometimes the music is completely electronic, sometimes it is completely orchestral, many times it is a mixture of both, but it is always excellent.Too Many Adagios?It appears that most of the negative reviews of this score are from people who were expecting another Daft Punk album. In case you haven't guessed it yet, this is not an album like Discovery. Not even close. There are no words to any of the songs, and they were designed for a film, not a dance club. While some of the tracks certainly are brilliant in a very similar way to Daft Punk's past work (Derezzed and other tracks like End of Line and Castor), primarily this score succeeds as what it was designed to be. A film score.Some have commented that the score to Tron Legacy is similar to other scores, and this is true. It may at times remind you of Mass Effect (with its heavy synthesizer use) or Inception (with its heavy two-tone use) but that is very unfair. This score blows Inception's score out of the water in every way. I had thought Inception had the best score of the year until I saw Tron Legacy, but it feel incredibly repetitive and unimaginative in comparison. And Mass Effects themes are not nearly as dynamic, full, or original in comparison (the tracks on Mass Effect are also very short).Flynn Lives, And So Does Daft Punk's Greatest AchievementWhen I heard the track Flynn lives I thought of the finale to an Ennio Morricone score like The Good The Bad And The Ugly where a soaring vocal would not be inappropriate. The main theme is simply that strong, that beautiful, that good. Honestly, this score belongs with the best of the best, and deserves to be listened to along with the best of great film composers of the last 30 years (Williams, Silvestri, Powell, Horner, Goldsmith).It would be absolutely criminal if this score does not win an Academy Award. If you are a fan of film music you owe it to yourself to purchase the score immediately. Just be sure you get the complete score and listen to it in the proper order, and see the film at least once to experience the music the way it was meant to be.Special note on the LP edition of the score:This is the most complete version of the score available to my knowledge. While the tracks are not in chronological order, there is only one track missing. Ironically it is one of my favorite tracks and the one I listen to the most, Father and Son. This is especially irritating as this is a Disney album and Disney and Apple are very close partners, yet this is an iTunes exclusive track. Its absence is absolutely idiotic in this otherwise complete album.Also, the beautiful album notes on a sheet of paper inside of the album rather than on the record sleeves, and there is no digital download or other extras included with this LP.Musically, the LP version of this album is practically identical to the MP3/CD release versions, however the digital and orchestral parts of the soundtrack blend together slightly better (the digital sounds are less sharp), and the bass is greatly reduced. The bass from the MP3 shakes the foundations when I play the Overture, but is nearly unnoticeable on the LP. I own both and consider both an essential purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OC6E25CIKCG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011V1WTB4#wasThisHelpful","R3OC6E25CIKCG2","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw this show listed on Netflix for a while, and had meant to give it a try. My wife watched a bit of the first episode and told me it wasn't very good, so I avoided watching it for a while. Then a good friend came over and told us that we HAD to watch this show, because it was so good. I was intrigued, and willing to give the show a chance.I saw the first few minutes and thought it was a poorly animated, low-budget, generic show not really worth my time. But I'm open minded and patient, so I continued to watch the show. And as the show went on, I was shocked.Everything a Teen-Aged Super-Powered Show Should BeI've seen a lot of anime and cartoons in my time, and watched a lot of teen-aged super-hero stuff. Heck I'm even trying to write a superhero academy story myself (but that's another story). So when I tell you that this is the best story of this type I have ever seen, try to comprehend how many shows were inferior. Why is this show so good, and why does it rise to the top of the crowd of shows in this genre?Welcome to Beacon AcademyThe world of this show is one filled with evil monsters and defended by super-powered ""Hunters"". They get their powers from ""dust"", and naturally they all go to superhero school to learn how to do this.Shows of this type tend to have lousy voice acting, superficial stories, flat characters, and be incredibly generic (generally failing to tell a story that feels compelling or involving) and certainly at this point we have all seen so many similar superheroes that every new superhero starts to feel incredibly generic (or even worse, yet ANOTHER interpretation of an old character without any of the charm or awesome backstory that made it a good character in the first place). That's what makes this show so refreshing. It isn't afraid to pile on the homages, the archetypes, the action and the drama, but at the same time there's an absolutely delicious blend of charm, wit, and innocence that's reminiscent of the very very stories ever told. You don't like these characters because they remind of something you used to like. You like these characters because although they are borrowed from classic fairy tale, anime, and comic book tropes, they make them all their own.Homages or Rip-Offs, Stereotypes or Archetypes? A show or a movie?Unlike seemingly EVERY other person writing reviews for this show (and liking it) I have NEVER watched anything by Rooster Teeth, nor had I ever even heard of them before now. I have never heard of the show's creator (I am sorry he died though). So all I can go off of is what I find as I watch the show. There are homages galore on this show. There is a main character who looks like Little Red Riding Hood, a girl whose bow looks like cat ears, a battle maiden robot, and a dog whose name is a number in German. These are no rip-offs. They are shout outs.Every one of the main characters has a personality and backstory that you can see coming from a mile away. That does not, however change the fact that the characters are very well done and extremely likable. Their personality is thoroughly developed and very charming. Honestly, I think a lot of the people who complain about the characters simply don't understand the subtleties of this show. If character development is told through expression, though the food the character eats, and through the music that plays during scenes, this is not a sign of a poorly made show. It is simply the sign of one that has an introverted undertone that rewards persistence and determination, rather than exposition-bubble spelling-out of everything that many Americans are used to.I didn't watch this show in the manner it was originally produced (a series of short episodes), but rather as two movies. While everyone seems to be complaining that the ""series"" isn't non-stop fight sequences, for a MOVIE, the pacing is just about perfect. There's action, romance, character development, and lots, and lots, and LOTS of character interaction that builds the world of the show and is incredibly enjoyable.The styleGetting to the style of the show, while it certainly is low-budget (lack of detail on background characters in the first season), it is also very stylized, reminding my of some of the better cell-shaded polygons of some video games famous for their art style. It certainly won't wow for accuracy of physics when you look at the characters' walking movements (they kind of ""float""), but the emotion expressed in the main characters is fantastic, and the fights certainly do wow.The SincerityMy friend observed quickly while watching the show that while a monster was clearly decapitated, instead of a fountain of blood there were ""flutters"" or red rose petals. In the course of two seasons, I can't recall hearing a single swear word. My immediate reaction was one of confusion. Is this supposed to be a show for kids? The main protagonist is a young teen, so...maybe? But wait, everyone else is an older teen. The jokes and plot and structure of the show seem geared toward an older audience. But then...why no swearing and gore?This is no flaw, in fact it's incredibly charming. All of the characters, and especially Ruby, are so incredibly sincere in everything they say and do, that it's impossible not to quickly fall in love with them. I quickly realized there was not a single main character I didn't like, and that's something I don't think has ever happened for me in any show I've ever seen. This is the real reason why this show is so good. You want to believe in the characters and are rooting for them all the way.Why things will changeForget about the great action, the low-budget beautifully-styled animation, and the fairy-tale monster-hunter trappings. What you have left is a the best thing since Sailor Moon and My Little Pony:Friendship is Magic. It's a show about young girls with a distinct personality, a strong mission in life, a quest of personal discovery, and wonderful interaction with each other. It isn't stereotypical. It's downright revolutionary in today's culture.If anyone says these characters are flat and one-dimensional, I'm sorry, but they just don't get it. These characters are portrayed from the heart, and they constantly surprise you with things they say and do, and new dimensions of their personality. They learn, and grow. The ice queen realizes she needs to re-examine her view of life. The dragon protagonist intuitively comes to realize she needs to take charge. The goofball clueless idiot comes through in the aid of others. And the catgirl learns to trust and rely on her friends and deal with her past while the older sister digs into her own.This show is a reconstruction of American animation and the magical-girl/high school girls/teen super-hero genres, and I KNOW that it is going to influence the future animation, particularly in the United States. The world needs more shows like this, and it's a massive breath of fresh air. I cannot wait for the third season. As it is...it's difficult not to get even more drawn in than I already am.This show is not to be missed by anyone who appreciates anime, or any kind of animation in general. Just watch more than the first episode, as the first episode is NOT a good representation of the overall quality of the show.P.S. The floaty cartoon physics remind me of Reboot!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JRAYEQ8ZBPTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EDR5N3A#wasThisHelpful","R2JRAYEQ8ZBPTP","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had bad experiences in the past with VGA switches, as I'm sure many others have. Ghosting, fuzzy image, various kinds of EMI (electromagnetic interference). So I was willing to pay a few dollars more for quality this time around.I'm using this box to switch a Desktop PC and Xbox 360 into a 720p projector, and the picture quality is perfect. No ghosting. No fuzziness. Just crystal clear perfect quality. Usually a passive switch (unpowered) has problems detecting image sources and resolutions, but this is not the case here. I'm able to run my 360 and my PC at completely different resolutions, and so far the resolution has not reset and there have been no problems detecting image sources.The switch may eventually wear out but for this price it's perfect considering the image quality.

"I bought this game a while back but only got to play it yesterday for the first time, because it requires three players and we always only had two, and the rules are pretty complicated (perhaps overly so). Just the same, when we finally got to play it...If you are familiar with say, Libertalia or Jamaica, you will understand the main gameplay mechanic of a day and night action, and if you ever played Monopoly (who hasn't?) you shouldn't have TOO much trouble with the buying and selling pieces.The game board is beautiful, but not really big enough to accommodate the cards for the wrecks. Likewise, there is detailed art for the divers, but I'm not of most of them because they're so mean looking. All the monsters look the same. The pieces are very high quality. The personal deck cards for players have cards that looks almost identical for the market where you sell and the equipment shop where you buy, resulting in my accidentally using the wrong card for an action. Similarly, people kept getting goods, gold, and artifacts confused because the cards look too similar. The rule book is at once over-complicated and lacking in detail on important topics. Some parts of gameplay are explained over and over, and you are STILL confused about where or not you can send multiple divers to the same wreck, or how it gets decided who goes to a wreck first (since you all move your ship at the same time). At the end of the game when there were only two wrecks left, the last player of three could do nothing because the other two players had already claimed wrecks (frustrating).People have said in other reviews that there is no backstabbing in this game, but I did not find this to be the case. Often other players KNOW where the good treasure with no monsters are, and when someone jumps in with two divers and drops a weight each, they clean the deck out before another player gets their turn. Likewise, it is REALLY irritating when you need ONE piece of equipment but can't buy it because another player is at the equipment shop and the price is now ten dollars more than you have. Playing this game, it was obvious to me that I was going to lose, because I had no idea that shallow wrecks had no monsters and contained far less valuable loot than deep wrecks until very late in the game. This could have been made clear in the instructions.All in all, this IS a fun game, and it has wonderful artwork and theme. I do think the game could be improved by a bigger board with dedicated spaces for wrecks, re-written rules. and better artwork for the player cards and monster cards (with different effects than just LOSE YOUR DIVER). I would love it if there were say, minor monsters, mid-level monsters, and big monsters that required bigger weapons to defeat and had bigger effects on the player. If this game ever gets a new edition with changes like this I would buy it for sure. In the meantime, it was a good fun game, but it's certainly more complicated than Jamaica (my father kept calculating the math for his sales wrong), but a lot more fun than Monopoly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD6G00TP8F3NQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160125072X#wasThisHelpful","RD6G00TP8F3NQ","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried a lot of protein powders in recent memory, but I've come to the conclusion that there's really only one brand that you need. I gave this one a shot, and it's not terrible (mixes well, decent taste), but it has a slight chemical taste (probably from the artificial flavor). It has a good ratio of protein to sugar, but not the best I've seen.All in all, it's a decent product, but not recommended. I stand by my old recommendation for the King of Protein Powders, Jarrow. Jarrow has NO artificial flavors or sweeteners, mixes and tastes better than anything I've ever tried, and make you feel great after you consume it.On the plus side for this protein, it comes in a nice container with the scoop on the top, not buried at the bottom.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE7SRG7MW3JI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WE0AWM0#wasThisHelpful","RE7SRG7MW3JI4","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Judging by the description of this novel, it sounds like a lot of fun. But once you actually start reading, you find that a lack of writing skill makes a story that should be exciting drag instead. For starters, for being set in SPACE the description is not very interesting. You never feel like you are THERE. Space lends itself to stark writing with bite, or beautiful poetry, but you'll find neither here. Likewise sci-fi is often the realm of kooky teams of heroes or extreme isolation and introspection, but instead there's just...nothing. I feel nothing for these characters. They have no personality. I don't know them, I don't care about them. The space location is boring. The computer tech doesn't sound particularly brilliant, or even particularly bright, more just weird and delusional (but she lacks enough description or internal monolog to even be annoying).Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a variety of sci-fi. I'll read the fantasy epics of Brandon Sanderson, the dry hard sci-fi of Isaac Asimov (where plot is king), and the adventures of Anne McCaffrey with their heavy characterization. This book isn't awful. It just really isn't very good. It needed to be rewritten with some character and description, and then re-written again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EBX3B57GZI7A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553394428#wasThisHelpful","R1EBX3B57GZI7A","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Up until now my favorite Daft Punk album has been the amazing Discovery, but this album is so good it gives it a run for its money. While most convert albums suffer a bit from the ""noise"" of the crowd's cheers, in this case they actually add to the experience rather than distracting.Discovery was a sweet box of evolving melodies, but this is a driving, thrumming, buzzing beat box of awesome! I always loved how the melodies of Discovery melded into each other, making you want to listen to the entire album. This is a series of Daft Punk's best songs mixed together perfectly with enough wonderous glorious bass to benchmark any speaker system.If I have a single complaint, it's the that the Close Encounters of the Third Kind opening is missing from the audio recording, and should be included. Other than that, listen to this and enjoy. It's awesome music for just listening, but it's REALLY great for exercise, doing chores, or (obviously) having a dance party. Highly, HIGHLY recommended.Final note: If you have a record player the complete Alive Boxed Set is totally worth it as it includes a backstage pass, stickers, bonus tracks, a turntable pad, and a gorgeous art book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EBBVPB5QQR2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YBH2UG#wasThisHelpful","R1EBBVPB5QQR2H","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a big fan of giant robot anime and a love Saturn games that combine 2D and 3D. This game is a perfect blend. While your ship/robot is 2D sprites the enemies and level are in 3D. There's horrible draw-in but I don't mind a bit because there's a super helpful radar, perfectly designed levels, and absolutely gorgeous high-speed graphics.The game has it's main menu in English but the controls and mission briefings are in Japanese. This isn't a problem because the objectives are straightforward and the controls can be figured out in a minute or three.I've played a lot of games like this over the years (robot war-machines fighting in cities) but this is the most anime-like of any of them, with the best controls, the best graphics, and the most fun gameplay by far.If you love Saturn action games and especially if you love giant robot anime you are going to love this game. It is worth the high price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13IUVPXQ7SLXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000092PJZ#wasThisHelpful","R13IUVPXQ7SLXV","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've played a lot of board games in the past few years, and as part of my research I've watched a lot of online top lists and board game reviews. This game kept showing up at the very top of the game lists, so I've been wanting to play it for years. The only thing that has held me back is the relatively high price that just wouldn't come down. Then I got a chance to get a copy for around 35 bucks and knew I had to grab it.If you've played Libertalia, you'll understand the concept of morning and evening actions, and if you've played Formula D, you'll understand planning your dice rolls and playing the odds to get further ahead, else crashing and burning. But even if you haven't, this game is NOT as complicated as it may look at first, despite game mechanics seemingly copied from everywhere.Every player has a deck of cards, and each ""round"" a ""captain"" is appointed who rolls the dice and sets the dice in the order of his choosing (a bit like the Godfather of Cash N' Guns). Each player resolves their morning and evening action after flipping over their selected card (Libertalia), placing resources into their ship's hold. You move your ship and pay the cost of spaces (Monopoly). When ships occupy the same space space they fight (Formula D Danger Dice). First one to pass the finish line ends the game, and everyone else finishes the round (Splendor) adding up their victory points which are a combination of treasure chests, gold coins, and board position.Great, great, but is it any fun?I have played this game ONCE, using five players. I immediately fell in love. The instructions, board, and pieces are absolutely fantastic. The theme is glorious as is the artwork and build quality. Gameplay moves quickly, and there is plenty of room for rivalry. More than that, this game is incredibly fun to play. I enjoyed it from turn one, and it only grew on me more from there.People who complain that this game is boring, or that the winner was determined too early, are actually complaining about the skill inequality of the people playing. Just like Formula D or Splendor, a very good player is going to absolutely destroy everyone else. While playing the game, I quickly started calculating the cheapest way to move forward, and the best time to use my movement cards. Everyone else was accumulating gunpowder, or food, or money, but I knew that the easiest way to win was to win the race, so I focused all my strategy on that. Focusing on WINNING by staying at the front of the pack, and perhaps pulling ahead in point at the last minute by increasing your treasure or gold, is where the REAL fun would come from, as a tense rivalry is always fun.The last time I played Formula D, it was an insane all-out tire-melting rivalry between my father and me to see who passed the finish line first, and who blew up their engine. Likewise, two skilled players could have quite a fight for the lead at the end of this game, but families with kids could also have a great time playing this game. I played this game with the best of Korngold (The Seahawk, Captain Blood) playing on my record player and have a rollicking good time.Good times, and highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KBR2QC0CUK01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012M7TLS#wasThisHelpful","R3KBR2QC0CUK01","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The last time I tried out a Vega product (Vega Sport Performance Protein, Chocolate, Tub 29oz), it made me sick. My sister suggested one of it's ingredients may have been an allergen, and thus caused my discomfort. My wife was surprised when I gave this product a go, fearing I would have the same reaction. Fortunately, I do not seem to be allergic to this product or have any stomach discomfort, so that's a plus. On the other hand...I've used a lot of different shakes mixes over the years, and so far the best by far has been Jarrows. In theory a vegan solution should be superior as long as it uses quality ingredients, but I am not impressed with this product either.First of all the product doesn't taste very good and very chalky. Others have said it tastes disgusting, which I did not find. It's far from good though. And for a product packed with nutrition I expected a huge energy boost and overall good feeling like I get when I mix up a shake with some fruits and veggies and some of the Jarrows protein powder. No such good feelings after mixing with a small bit of fruit and few suppliments. No energy boost. Apparently all of the healthy-feeling effects of the all the veggies crammed into this product were lost somewhere in the manufacturing/processing.Finally, this product is expensive.My two cents? Skip this stuff, buy some Jarrows protein powder, and blend with some liquid vitamin/minerals and a generous helping of fruits and veggies. You'll feel amazing after drinking it and it will taste much better than this stuff. On the other hand if you're a vegan...I can't help you. I have yet to find a vegan nutritional shake that 1. tasted good enough to want to consume and 2. actually appeared to have health benefits.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QL1UC6DMOKO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R0Y12SS#wasThisHelpful","R1QL1UC6DMOKO2","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some people have called me an Apple ""fanboy"", which is pretty darn ridiculous when you consider that I haven't been a fan of Apple computers since the 90's when they came in any color you wanted as long as it was beige. At any rate, my experience with ""modern"" Apple products has been kind of hit and miss. I wasn't a fan of the white MacBook my sister got back when OS X was young, and I've had varying degrees of success using ipods, pod touches, and more recently my wife's MacBook Pro, an iPad Mini, and two iPhones.My experiences with a hand-me-down iPhone 4 were disastrous from the beginning. For starters, it CONSTANTLY dropped calls. People couldn't hear me if I was sitting down, and when phone calls DID work they were filled with static and extremely low in volume. Text messages took forever to send, the cell signal was abysmally slow and constantly dropping, and the battery life was terrible as well. To top it all off the thing's microphone didn't work so I couldn't record YouTube videos. Overall impression? Yuck! All that said, despite the horrific time I had getting it to play Infinity Blade and sending texts etc, and the fact that it would refuse to play songs from my iTunes (it removed songs as soon as it played them sometimes for no apparent reason and the phone backups constantly corrupted), it was the only smartphone I had and my wife insisted I keep using it so that she could send me pictures in texts (otherwise I would have gladly gone back to a dumb phone).A few years passed, and my wife got two phone upgrades. Her first one was to a Samsung Galaxy S4, and the second was to an LG G3. She tried to give me the S4 but I didn't want it. When I announced I was going to get a G3 she said if I got it she was taking it. So I let her have it. In the meantime it was getting harder and harder to justify paying my enormous phone bill to Verizon when I had a phone that couldn't really make phone calls or do anything else. So in the end, despite my better judgement, I slapped down almost three hundred dollars to get a White iPhone 5c and after jumping through some hoops (had to order a Sim Card from Verizon and Activate the Phone) I finally got it working. My thoughts?If you are using a sad iPhone 4 throw that piece of junk away and get one of these!First of all, despite all the benchmarks saying that the 5S and 6 are a gajillion times faster than this little phone, it's still WORLDS faster than an iPhone 4! Infinity Blade III takes seconds to open instead of minutes. The color and contrast are much better. It's built much sturdier and has a slick, smooth, extremely comfortable feel. Sending texts is instant. Navigation is smooth, liquid, and incredibly responsive. The first time I turned it on it transferred everything off of my old phone using iCloud in mere minutes. And the 4G LTE results in persistent, fast, responsive Internet that is much less of a drain on the battery. I took the phone to work today and when I got home it still had 75% left on it's battery!What else can I say? It includes Siri, the camera is greatly improved, it supports IOS 8 and runs great with it (not choppy as iPhone 4 was with IOS7). It's beautiful, sturdy, and relatively cheap. As I said, around three hundred bucks for a refurbished one that looked new, and with 32 GB of space.I haven't transferred my MP3s over from iTunes yet because I'm currently cleaning up my music collection, but it after cleanup and loading it up with MP3s they all play without disappearing like on my iPhone 4, I'd say this phone is perfect. As it is, it's by FAR the best phone I've ever used. Very, very nice!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNQNH4FVHEYM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3ISEUC#wasThisHelpful","RNQNH4FVHEYM1","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was kind of half-dreading the release of this film for quite a while, while my wife was eagerly anticipating it (completely with a elbowing and whispered ""You're taking me to see that"" upon first viewing of the trailer). I must say, for once the trailers were honest. This film appears from it's trailer to be overblown, and it is. It appears to be overlong, and it is. It also appears to be a heavy drama, an existential, confusing conundrum, and a visual-effects candy explosion, and...surprise, surprise! It is, it is, it is!Don't get me wrong, it's kinda sorta awesome in a way. It's either the best awful movie you've seen in a while or the worst awesome movie you've seen in a while (an ""honor"" it perhaps shares with Jupiter Ascending [ya know, cuz everything else is ""Rising"" these days]). It starts with a bleak, dusty future where humanity is doomed due to a crop ""blight"" of all things, and space exploration is largely forgotten as humanity sits and waits out it's end on the ball of dust-blown dirt called Earth. A series of strange events draws our has-been protagonist to what's left of the Space program, and sets him on his inevitable journey to save the human race in some form or other.The space sequences in this film are incredibly breath-taking, but it takes what feels like an hour and half to get around to them. This film seriously feels 3 hours long and suffers from a terrible need of some judicious editing. At any rate, once the space part of this space movie starts things finally get moving both dramatically and physically.Through the course of this film there's confusion aplenty, and lots of aching, angsty emoting from everyone onscreen as they argue the merits of betrayal, hopelessness, ridiculous gambits, lies, and finally, groan-inducingly impossible Deus Ex Machina plot twists that jump the space shark through a wormhole and back.On the whole, you CAN enjoy this film, if you take it as a modern 2001:A Space Odyssey, and realize that it is more religous/fantasy than hard sci-fi, and is attempting through slick visuals and wild leaps of logic to take you to a place where ""love"" can conquer all and accomplish the impossible, even filling in plot holes the size of a planet.And yeah, the scene with the music ""No Time for Caution"" is completely amazing. It's too bad the rest of the film wasn't as riveting.*Update May 22 2014*My wife really likes this film so she insisted we buy it. I wanted to wait for it to be cheaper, but wait she could not. Therefore we bought the Digital HD version on Amazon and watched it that night on our projector in the living room. Thoughts?On another viewing this film has improved dramatically. When you know what you are getting it's easier to sit back and enjoy the wonderful music, incredible special effects, and great acting. The plot is still a bit bonkers in some ways (a certain scene at the end near/in a black hole still makes me laugh because it's so darn ridiculous), and there are some serious issues with editing, but ya know...This film grows on you. The music is quite mesmerizing. The characters are more likable in subsequent viewings. The relationship between the astronaut and his daughter seems less weird than it did in the theater somehow. And the cinematography in some places is really really great.After a second viewing I was left with the feeling that this is a very good film that could have been a great one if it just had had better editing. It's something my sister pointed out to me a few years back. A film is more editing than anything else, and great editing is woefully unappreciated. Very often what people think is good direction is really just good editing. Where the editing on this film is good (docking sequence) it shines. Where the editing is not so good (on Earth) it drags in places. Overall though, it's STILL a film worth seeing, and now I think it's a film worth seeing over and over, and especially if you enjoyed it in the theater. It's not perfect. But it's quite fun for a nearly 3 hour film. It's also a great showcase for your home theater setup (just crank up the bass and enjoy the music's roar in key scenes).","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3442Z3KPWIZFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI7GCJK#wasThisHelpful","R3442Z3KPWIZFY","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an economics fan, I've read a lot of books on the subject over the years. I've read books on how the economy works, comic books that explain economic history, and plenty of books on personal economics and behavioral economics. I have to say, if you combine this book with ""Crossing the Energy Divide"" you pretty much know everything you need to build the future, stop global climate change, and eliminate unemployment and poverty once and for all. It's the doing of it that proves problematic.A lot of the people writing reviews seem either have very poor math skills (sub-fifth grade level), no knowledge of economics, or to be against this book because it isn't a) A Brief History of time or b) Appealing to every political agenda while addressing a very divisive subject. Look at the world around you. People have sorted themselves geographically, ideologically, and politically into clans that work themselves into a frenzy before going to war against everyone and anyone who doesn't agree with their views. Views reinforced, strengthened, and worsened by constant positive and negative reinforcement. There was a time when good facts had a chance to educate. Now if facts don't agree with a religious dogma (and that which cannot be disproved is a religion despite what anyone may think) then they are slammed as a worthless opinion no matter how truthful, valid, or useful. But enough with the other reviewers. On to the book!In the course of all the economics books that I have read I was struck again and again by the strange fact that despite the supreme confidence that economists had in their theories, they did not explain actual events. This book fills in the gaps, and explains easily and logically what the flaw is in previous theories. This is not a hard to understand book loaded with difficult math. I have seen those books before. While the writing isn't superb, it is entertaining and more than readable for a person of average intelligence. In fact, I would recommend this book as a textbook for a 6th grade economics class. It would help young readers get a firm grasp on how economics actually effects them in the real world.Explaining the problem alone would make this book fifty pages, so the author explains lots of methods he suggests to fix the problem in aggregate by compensating for a lack of Free Market Economics in the real world. Are his ideas pie-in-the-sky, idealistic, unrealistic, fantasy? In some ways yes. It's highly unlikely that the Powers That Be will sit still for ANYTHING that helps the poor at their expense, and we all know that. But it's not the job of an economist to fix the problems of the real world. It's the job of a good economist to find the answer, tell you what it is, and give you some suggestions for how to implement said answer! And this the author does wonderfully and beautifully. Does he naively believe that he will be taken seriously by politicians he thinks are on his side? Sure. Does it matter? Nope. Because now that he has PROVEN what the source of the problem is and what solutions in the real world would look like in theory, it's up to future generations to apply this knowledge. Or not, depending on if they like their world filled with unemployed starving people.To me, this book is definitely one to keep on my shelf for future reference. If you love economics books, read this book immediately. It won't cure cancer or reverse climate change, but it DOES explain the real cause of unemployment clearly, logically, and irrefutably.My only read criticism is, the title should be ""Raise Wages Now (and end unemployment and poverty while you're at it)"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10RF8VPKVIJFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1137280077#wasThisHelpful","R10RF8VPKVIJFG","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My hat's off to everyone involved in this film. After the insanely, atrociously, hilarious bad first film I didn't think it was possible to create a more hilarious, cheesier movie. But apparently the sequel's creators kicked common sense to the curb to make the impossible possible.First of all, obviously I loved the first Sharknado. If you enjoy cheesy movies it is by far a classic in every way. But this...sweet mother of shark! I refrained from seeing this film for a long, long time after it was released because I was frightened, genuinely scared, that is would be a horrible film now that the creators and actors were self-aware of what a phenomenon the first movie was. But...no. It can't be. This film is literally BETTER in every way!!!!The Only Thing Missing is Bruce Campbell...and maybe a shower scene for Kari WuhrerApparently a LOT of people loved the first Sharknado, to the point where they begged and pleaded to be in the sequel. And apparently someone in production read my review (not seriously, but...maybe?) and said ""Hey! He's right! We need some Return of the Killer Tomatoes product placement jokes and Kari Wuhrer from Beastermaster 2:Through the Portal of Time and Eight Legged Freaks!"" Because...yes! She is in this film! And looking DANG good for being 47 years old! The product placement jokes are absolutely hilarious. The cameos likewise are ridiculously awesome. I'm talking Kelly Osborne, Will Wheaton, Reality TV stars, B-movie stars, morning television stars, commercial stars, and just about every B-list actor you've ever heard of. The only real downside here is that the gorgeous Kari Wuhrer is absolutely wasted in her role, with no double-shotgun wielding/kung fu kicking action that I'm been hoping for (and continue to be disappointed by the absence of) since Eight-Legged Freaks. She's a gorgeous woman with a lot of presence and needs to do more Shark Butt Kicking! But hey, at least she's in the movie...Wink, winkJust about everyone in this film plays things incredibly straight faced yet incredibly good-natured. From the weather girl talking about a shark storm to a certain famous taxi driver, just about everyone who isn't a main character makes you smile. The film itself is incredibly self-aware, but it doesn't' come across as groan-worthy from anyone. that's probably helped by the fact that...Strike a PoseAll the main characters play their parts so incredibly over-actingly seriously that it's absolutely priceless! The protagonist Fin's anguished face and endless camera posing are sure to be the stuff of legend in years to come. His once famous, now down-and-out actress love interest Tara Reid likewise plays the role EXACTLY like in the first film. If anything they are even MORE into their roles than before!""There's something on the wing!""You know you are in for a treat from the INTRO to the movie, which an absolutely insanely awesome combination of Snakes on a Plan (Sharks on a plane? Sharks on a plane!) and the classic Twilight Zone episode Terror at 30,000 feet. It's absolutely quite possibly the most hilarious intro to a movie ever made, and worth seeing the entire film for alone. The rest of the film alternates between goofy, forced, and awesome, but seems to lose a bit of steam, until the sharks attack, and then again, until the finale which I simply was not prepared for. I THOUGHT nothing could top the ending of the first Sharknado, but was I ever wrong! It's the most over-the-top ending to any monster movie ever by a long shot.Forget Lake Placid. Forget Gator and Gator 2. Forget Eight Legged Freaks and Bats. THIS is the greatest monster movie franchise of modern times, and one of the best comedy series of all time to boot! I simply cannot wait for the sequel!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RH7J8Z8NXYT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LOCLBS8#wasThisHelpful","R2RH7J8Z8NXYT7","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've literally played every version of Virtua Racing that exists. I played it in the arcade as a kid. I played it on the Genesis. I played the Playstation 2 version. And yes, I bought and played the Saturn version. And I am here to tell you that this is indeed the very best version in existence.The original arcade version was fondly remembered for it's crisp beautiful graphics, and the crazy seat that moved around to try to simulate G-forces. The genesis version lacked a lot of the excitement of the arcade, but it was still very fun to play. And the PS2 version was very pretty, but had horrible sound effects every time your turned sharp etc (really annoying tire screech sound). This version...is awesome.I love racing games on the Saturn, and have actually found very few that I didn't like (not fond of Daytona USA on Saturn, but that's about it). This version of Virtua Racing features gorgeous simple graphics and a decent draw distance. It moves at a fast pace, and the controls feel perfect. The sound effects, music, and overall feel is excellent. The races run a bit long, but it has a lot more depth than any of the other versions of this game and the tracks are all beautifully designed.I played this game on my projector just to see if it was worth keeping. I expected to play it for just a few minutes and then decide it was another lousy game to be traded in. I ended up playing it for hours. The races can get a bit boring and repetitive if you are looking for AI that does more than drive in circles and and don't like your races long, but the fact that it's a bit more of a simulation than an arcade game is actually a bit of welcome break from all of the other excellent arcade-style racing games I own for Saturn.In the end, if you are a serious fan of SEGA racing games, and Virtua Racing in particular, you are going to want to own this game because it takes a one-trick pony and turns it into a fully-fleshed-out championship of racing and lets you drive a variety of cars on large selection of tracks compared to every other version of Virtua Racing. Highly recommended to Saturn Racing game collectors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NM8R9U915FI5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00002STWU#wasThisHelpful","R1NM8R9U915FI5","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read quite a few similar books to this over the years, and I think maybe people have the wrong idea about how the scientific mind works. A good scientist asumes nothing, and doesn't care about how obvious what they are testing may appear to others. A good scientist cares about reproducible, provable results. And a good scientist who is a decent writer tries to share their proven knowledge with others to better their lives.I find it kind of silly that people criticize this book for telling them what they already know, because honestly some of the greatest books of the past century do the exact same thing. How To Win Friend and Influence people tells us WHY it's important to take interest in others. Dave Ramsey tell us WHY budgeting, getting rid of debt, and saving for the future is a good idea. And this book tell you WHY you need to think of money and save it in different ways than you have been. Not because you don't know necessarily what you should do, but maybe because you need a nudge to make you motivated to DO what is in your own best self interest.The beauty of behaviorI find behavioral psychology very compelling, and the way it applies to economics is particularly compelling to me. So often people waste years of their lives pursuing a machine-like way of thinking that they think will lead to a better life, but in actuality makes them miserable. I grinned as I read this book repeatedly because I came to realize that things I had been criticizing myself for (buying things far in advance, eating very small portions of treats, buying things and then letting them sit on the shelf for years before using them) were all actually things I had unconsciously done to INCREASE my enjoyment of life.But the real compelling point of this book isn't about behavior, it's about THINKING. If you focus on acquiring material possessions, and how long you have to wait for them, if you are always worried about wasting time because it costs you money, and if you buy ever greater quantities and become selfish, you will be very unhappy indeed. If on the other hand you turn using your possessions into an experience, you buy things in advance, you savor your treats, and think unselfishly, you are going to be happier. Your focus determines your reality, young Jedi.The book is not perfectly written, but it is short and breezy and entertaining, enjoyably well-written. I recommend reading this book to increase your happiness per dollar. And if you are forgetful or need reminders you may want to put it on your shelf to help you remember the importance of adjusting your thinking now and then.I know that personally this book has already made me happier because I realized I can stop beating myself up for doing things that make me enjoy life more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JZUW518DUJR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451665075#wasThisHelpful","R3JZUW518DUJR7","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I heard about this book through a news story online that briefly mentioned the coming demographic crash. At the time I had never heard of such a thing, except perhaps in a speech by Al Gore long ago where he asked people by a show of hands what percentage of the crowd came from a large family, and what percentage had a large family themselves. Back then, I was quite shocked to learn what I had been told as a child (overpopulation would destroy the world) was completely untrue. Fast forward to now, and after reading the article I realized I had to read the book and get the whole story.Great WritingPeople can argue about the accuracy or world view of the author all they want, but I cannot deny the author writes with great style. I was again and again reminded of one of my recent favorite books talking about the future of the modern world ""Crossing the Energy Divide"". Both books are clearly written by authors that have a genius of writing a difficult and complex subject in a light and entertaining manner, while at the same time a thoughtful and convincing one.This book is not long at all, and you could arguably read it in a day. But giving how powerful, compelling, and important the message is, you may want to buy it put it on your shelf for reference. While the author does have slants in his view, it's obvious that he is trying very very hard not to be biased or push his views on others, but rather to simply give the facts and broad strokes of the problem and possible solutions as he sees them.You might not agree with all of the language, or the solutions proposed, but you'd be a fool to think the message isn't an important one that needs to be addressed before it's too late.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RKU07PQIDLBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594037310#wasThisHelpful","R1RKU07PQIDLBM","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been a long time coming, but the ultimate release of a classic film is finally here! I've owned the old Manga release, and the horrific ""Special Edition"" that butchered the opening credits. When I saw that the a new release was out I immediately purchased it, hoping that AT LAST I would have the release that this film has always deserved. I was not disappointed.First of all, you are probably wondering if the picture quality has finally been cleaned up to make this film look the way it always should have, and the answer is a resounding yes! It appears that like so many American DVD releases of anime coming out, this one was pulled off of an HD Japanese master probably used for the Japanese blu ray. No more yellowed, speckled, cruddy, dirty picture. Everything is bright and colorful and crisp. Simply gorgeous! But the REAL surprise for me was in the audio options.I know that voice!I was a fairly big fan of the old Manga release (but not the additional swearing), and the Japanese dub is a classic despite it's mono sound. So when I saw there was yet another English dub I was thinking it would probably be yet another sub-standard dub like the mediocre Disney dub from Castle in the Sky. I was shocked and amazed when what I found was more akin to the classic English dub of Giant Robo!Like Giant Robo, the original English dub is VERY loose with the translation and is nowhere near the subtitles. And like that classic dub, it is incredibly over-the-top. And yes, like that dub, I absolutely love it to pieces! I did detect a voice or two from Giant Robo, and I'm pretty sure Trigun is in there as well as some other classic 90's voices (Solid Snake from Metal Gear Solid is Lupin!!!!). Everyone does an absolutely fantastic job in their role. In particular I loved the ridiculous fake European accent from the guard who now sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger! It's silly, over-the-top and at time laugh-out-loud cheesy, and all the more awesome for it. In addition...The Effect of SoundAnime in general is not known for having fantastic sound effects, and the sound in the original Japanese dub of this anime is quite subdued. But the new dub features surround sound effects that are incredibly immersive and superbly balanced. You hear birds chirping, thunderous waterways, and suitably punchy sound effects in fights and chases. All of this makes the movie immensely more theatrical than it was before. Likewise, while the original Japanese dialog is classic, the new Americanized dub is on-par with the very very best of dubs that rewrote the dialog to create something new. I'm reminded again of Giant Robo, but also of Martian Successor Nadesico and Bubble Gum Crisis Tokyo 2040.There's more!There's also a commentary, a reversible case, and other extras. Purists will buy this release for the improved picture alone. But if anyone wants my two cents, I'll say you absolutely MUST hear the new dub if you haven't before. Yes, the original Japanese is a classic, and so is the old dub. But this dub, amazing as it may sound, is ANOTHER classic. It's nothing like the old dubs with their quieter, less immersive effects, but it IS absolutely fantastic and recommended both to fans with an open mind, and people who don't normally like anime and have never seen this film before.If you love great films, buy this release. It's definitive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AV19UYIAXWWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PEA6LJK#wasThisHelpful","R2AV19UYIAXWWD","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've seen a lot of Mecha in my time, and that this show featured a giant robot and got good ratings was enough for me to want to check it out. I was surprised that is was only 13 episodes because usually a standard sci-fi is 26 episodes. There are, however, a few sci-fi classics that short, and the short length pretty much guarantees that a lot is going to be crammed into every episode. So...what did I think?The show starts out with a huge sci-fi Mecha battle in space. There's no explanation, but the sharp direction and superb dialog very quickly make us realize what is going on. The protagonist is a soldier who lives like a machine, engineered and perfected and only awakened when he's needed to fight, then quickly put back to sleep. In today's battle things go unexpectedly, and he soon finds himself stranded in a strange environment, a fish out of water, and wondering how to get home and back to war he was created to fight.That may be the initial premise of the show, and if that's all the show was, it would still be superb. In the English dub the perspective of the focus character is always in English, and everyone else is speaking their native language. This is absolutely fantastic. We feel as the protagonist does as everything at first seems foreign. Then we see how strange and thick-headed he seems to everyone else as he slowly tries to make sense of the new world around him and decipher the language.The glorious colors (my wife comments ""This is a pretty show!"" in the opening space battle and the rest of the first episode), the beautiful art style (reminiscent of Gundam 00, Gurren Lagann, Zegapain, or other Sunrise shows), and fantastic music quickly draw you in and keep you watching as the story unfolds. You are very entertained. And then...I didn't see the show going in this directionMy wife saw some of the plot twists coming, but I was downright jolted by the second half of the series. Nothing is ever really slow moving in this show to begin with (even though it somehow manages to cram in a ""beach episode""), but once things get going, they just go faster and faster. At the start I figured this was going to be a show about sea pirates and an intergalactic protector, but that wasn't even the start of things going crazy. Without giving too much away, NOTHING in this show is as it appears. Not the space empire that the protagonist came from, not the pirates, not the ship Gargantia, not the sea monsters below the waves.Is it possible to use so many tropes that you create something completely new and original?It's aggravating to try to describe this show really accurately, because a huge amount of the awesome comes from unexpected sci-fi tropes and plot twists. The title ship reminds me of Battle Star Galactica (with it's ""fleet"" of ships). The main character reminds me of a quiet serious space man from an old 80's sci-fi super-cheese fest. The aliens and their ultimate origins remind me of too many sci-fi to mention. There's moments in this show that remind me of Oblivion, Big Hero 6, and even Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, in the very best way possible. If you are a fan of sci-fi, it's almost impossible not to be reminded of something, but this is no criticism.Watch ItThe direction is sharp, but the writing in this show is even sharper. It is at times compelling, heart-breaking, hilarious, and inspiring. And most of all, it is very, very clever. About three quarters of the way through the show there's a character whose actions are out of character, and the show takes a sudden turn that seemed a bit strange, but the other plot twists in the show more than make up for it. Aside from that one turn that nearly jumped the shark, this show pretty much always grabs you and makes you hang on for the wild ride from that point on.When we started watching this show we thought we would pace ourselves so that it wouldn't be over too soon. But once we started the second disc we finished it all in one shot. When the final battle gets started this show goes from good to great again and even better, feels like an absolutely fantastic sci-fi film.The voice actors do an amazing job in the English dub. That cannot be overstated. It makes the beginning great, the middle forgivable, and the ending unbelievably awesome. Add to that some outstanding animation (except for the choppiness in the space battle of the first episode) and you have a sci-fi classic.Watch the ending of this show on the biggest screen and best sound system you've got in the house. Thank me later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6RB9DB7QA6ZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBNZ9GY#wasThisHelpful","R6RB9DB7QA6ZZ","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was previously using the Nature's Way brand, which has the same amount of 5HTP and a bit less Vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Since Vitamin C found in supplements isn't the real thing you get in oranges for instance, I wouldn't expect that to have any bearing on effectiveness, so maybe it's the capsules themselves that are resulting in better absorption.The consensus seems to be that putting B Vitamins in your 5HTP is a bad thing due to possible harmful effects and causing it to metabolize too soon or whatnot, but I've seen too drastic an effect in my mood taking this to attribute to placebo effect. Many also believe you would have to be taking a very large amount of the product for it to do any harm.So in conclusion, this product is cheap and works well. It may be better to get a supplement without ""vitamins"" in it, but for now they don't seem to be causing any deaths so go for it if you need a relatively safe mood booster. Medical science contradicts itself so often I try not to worry about the latest belief about what's ""bad"" for you unless people are dropping dead from the effects.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RXBI9H3TX036/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NRXNO0#wasThisHelpful","R3RXBI9H3TX036","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not normally a fan of anything scented as that usually translates to ""chemical skin irritants"". In this case, I didn't get any itching, rashes, or hives, so I think it's alright in that respect. I'm not a fan of the smell because I'm just not a fan of chemical smells in general.The colors of my clothes didn't seem any more vibrant, the whites didn't seem any more white, and the clothes didn't seem any more clean than usual.On the plus side, you don't have to measure or pour liquid detergent and there were no white streaks that I sometimes get on my clothes with packets like these. I used one packet for a large load and I think two would be too much. As it is the smell is mild and the chemicals are not irritating. Any more added would likely be overpowering in both regards.The top of the box seems to have immediately broken when I opened it, meaning you can smell the obnoxious smell if you are near the container, so store it in an enclosed space.Overall, this is a decent product but not quite at my dream level yet. If they start offering one with no scents that darkens blacks and leaves no streaks I'd call it a winner.*Update 2/5/15*Last night I was wearing a shirt that ran in the large load of laundry where I used a single capsule. My wife said ""I'm allergic to the detergent you used on the laundry"". I replied that I had only used it on mine so that wasn't possible. And then she told me that being NEAR me when I was wearing clothes washed with that detergent WAS MAKING HER BREAK OUT IN HIVES. Unfortunately, if someone in my household can't even be near someone whose clothes are washed with this product I can no longer recommend it to anyone, as it's just too strong an allergen. I'm dropping my review from three starts to two. On the plus side, she said the shirt smelled nice. :)","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FL0JEPHEDL50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H5LFI68#wasThisHelpful","R1FL0JEPHEDL50","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been wanting a superhero deck builder for some time now, and researched carefully before making a purchase. After reading numerous reviews of this game I purchased it. My thoughts?A steep cost of entryThis game sat on my shelf never played for a VERY long time (since December 13, 2013), despite being the game I wanted to play more than any other game I owned. I pulled it out, read the rules, and tried to play it with my wife. An hour later we gave up and I was very confused. I lent it to a friend hoping to have him figure it out and then explain it to me. He was never able to explain it to me but said it was now one of his favorite games. Okay, so it is definitely a game worth playing, but I still don't know how to play it. I read the rules again. Still couldn't figure it out. I watched video reviews. No good, they talk about the game but don't explain how to play it. Some more time went by. I saw an expansion for sale on the cheap and bought it (Sentinels of The Multiverse: Vengeance). Every week I still promised that this weekend I would figure the game out. And every weekend I could not. Fast forward to Yesterday....A BreakthroughI sat down with a friend and forced the poor guy to play this game with me despite the fact that he wasn't really interested. I slogged through the rules and setup AGAIN and got the game underway. At first, my friend had a look on his face like like he was both bored and irritated, and several times I thought he was going to make me give up and end the game. I was repeatedly confused by rules and procedures, but I was DETERMINED to get through the game and we battled on. And then, a funny thing happened....we started to have fun!A Glorious Mess of a GameIf you have never played this game before, you need to understand something right now. This game is LOADED with stats that have to CONSTANTLY be adjusted. You will have cards that increase/decrease damage you deal, decrease/increase damage you take, status ailments, etc, etc. And then you will constantly be negating those same effects, discarding them, and destroying cards of all kinds left and right. This leads to massive confusion early on if you aren't ready, because most games spell out for you how to deal with conflicts of cards (how much damage does a villain take if his minions lower the damage he takes but i played a multi-target damage weapon that killed his minions?). This game explains NOTHING like that. Heck, it doesn't even explain what to do with the dividers or tokens. Use them or don't, the game designers could care less!The strange genius to this (which should have been made REALLY clear in the rules) is that you are supposed to FIGURE IT OUT YOURSELF!!!! If you activate a power that shields you from damage but don't take any damage this turn, is it still in effect next turn? I said yes and that's how we played. We also attacked minions FIRST with multi-target attacks so that the villain wouldn't get their bonuses! Is this the RIGHT way to play? I have no idea and honestly I don't think there IS a right way to play.Likewise, there were times we accidentally played an environment card twice, or didn't account for damage that should or should not have been taken. Did we backtrack? Sometimes yes, others no. The important thing is to keep moving forward and don't over-think it. This game shines when you keep things going.""Did you just sucker-punch a dinosaur???? He just sucker-punched a dinosaur!!!!""The real fun with this game comes when you let the extremely strong and fun flavor of the game shine. Watching minions get killed by the environment (dinosaurs ate his minions!), redirecting attacks at the villain (""Did you just LAVA-BEND???""), and playing ridiculous attacks at random environment monsters was absolutely hilarious and incredibly fun. Even though me and my friend lost this game (and he's unsure about whether he really likes it or not) I am in love with this game right now. Because this game lets you be characters like Batman, Superman, The Flash, etc, and in all the best ways. The art is wonderful, the cards are hilarious, the gameplay is incredibly fun, and the replay value is near infinite.Words of caution:Again, this is an absolutely fantastic game that every comic fan should play. Just remember (especially the first few games) that the important thing is to keep moving forward and quickly resolve disputes (I suggest electing a game-master/team leader before starting play). When in doubt, do what you want. There's absolutely NOTHING in the manual about how to use the tokens, so put them next to a character to keep track of it's health, and put status indicators next to characters for the same reason. Read and re-read all cards in play to remind yourself of modifiers. If you're confused about what you are supposed to do in a conflict have your game-master/leader make a decision that sorta makes sense, and get on with the villain trouncing!As for me, after FINALLY figuring out how to play, this just might be one of my new favorite games.*Update 2/2/15*After finding something in Advanced Rules about having someone play as more than one character in a two player game, I began to suspect that my friend and I were decimated because the game is unbalanced if you have only two players with one character each. Sure enough, after looking it up on the Internet I found that the game is indeed BROKEN if you only play with two characters. Yet another example of something that should have been very clear in the instructions and was not. If you choose to play this game with fewer than 3 people, be aware that at least one of them must play two characters or the game becomes unbalanced.*Update 2/10/15*A search of the Internet resulted in my finding a 49 PAGE list of rules and clarifications created by fans of the game using responses from the game's creators on forum posts (complete with similar font, color, and illustrations). I HIGHLY recommend locating a copy and printing it out double-sided. It GREATLY clarifies the game rules, and makes the game far more enjoyable. It's pretty ridiculous when fans of a game write better instructions than the creators of said game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R129CONGQD32GQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0095ZFA5Q#wasThisHelpful","R129CONGQD32GQ","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tested and used a couple of gaming devices in the past, but have found their ""gaming"" designation a bit misleading. When i think of gaming I think of customization options specifically geared to playing games. Unlike say, the Mad Catz R.A.T., which prioritizes customization and game-specific optimization above all else (make the mouse as heavy or light as you want and a dedicated ""sniper"" button to increase DPI), or a mechanical gaming keyboard that prevents ""locking"" and ""ghosting"" the gaming keyboard I tested featured crazy colors and a load of macros and not much else (that one was a Steel Series). So I imagined more of that sort of thing would be found here. And while I do feel that is less of a gaming mouse and more of a multipurpose/customizable mouse, it certainly has a few customizations that will make it more ideal for gaming for some.The HardwareFor starters, my previous mouse-of-choice was the Microsoft IntelliMouse Explorer, which is light, responsive, hand-fitting, and wrist-fatigue reducing, while also naturally being a laser mouse that works for a long, long, time. I found the weight on this Corsair mouse to be comparable, and the fit to be similarly ideal for a hand, but very different. Your hand does not drag on the mousepad with this mouse, but rather ""floats"" due to the thumb and pinky rest. Mileage will vary on whether you like this or not but I found it very comfortable and strain reducing. The mouse itself is ""grippy"" as opposed to slick, and I like the feel of it and minimalist design. There are plenty of buttons but accidental clicks are not too frequent save for the left mouse button (more on that later). There's a satisfying click on most buttons, however they are a tad ""spongy"". The device seems study and well-built. The cord is particularly nice, but the usb end is pointlessly large and may block other usb ports if you are cramped for space or have other large-ended usb devices. There is a cord-wrap and an annoying tag attached. I ripped the velco cord wrap off because I don't plan to take this cable anywhere anytime soon and have better uses for a velcro cord wrap, and I don't like large tags on anything I own.The SoftwareAs with the Steel Series keyboard I tested a while back, while you CAN program a ton of macros if that's your thing, and customize the lighting, if you have no intention of installing yet more irritating software into your rig you can use this device without it. By default you can use the normal left and right, scroll wheel, and DPI up/down, as well as the exceedingly useful forward/back buttons. I have not yet found a use for the middle mouse button.Actual usageI tested this mouse on a setup I created very recently. I have a projector in my living room with an old gaming PC plugged directly into it. When I first started using it a mere few days ago I quickly found that my trusty Microsoft Mouse was giving me wrist pain and fatigue. I plugged this mouse in and started playing with it. I also read the manual, as a lot of reviewers here apparently failed to do.The manual is incredibly sparse, but it DOES give you the default functions for buttons. The first thing I tested was different DPI settings which are easily changed, and the forward/back buttons. As this is a gaming PC in a living room with a mouse on a mousepad on a book in my lap, setting the DIP really low allowed me to zip the mouse across the screen by moving a few centimeters, and at the lowest setting just barely twitching my hand. Combined with the floating feel of the thumb and pinky rest this greatly reduced mousing fatigue in my right hand. I tested the forward/back button while web surfing in Chrome and found them extremely useful as well.My one complaint? While the buttons are all very responsive, the left button is TOO responsive. Both myself and my wife found that if you barely touch it, it registers a click. I made many accidental clicks, and my wife woke my PC up by accident. I can get used to it, but still, take note.Gamers and Seniors and Disabled PeopleFor a gamer, the ability to set their DPI very high for their FPS's (personally I don't play them but whatever) is a cool feature, and the lighting is nice. Personally I think the bright red light is too bright but mileage will vary on that as well I'm sure. The color-coded DPI setting will help you when adjusting it (I wish many other devices had color coded settings), and if you like your mouse REALLY fast being able to set DPI extremely low is awesome.The wow for me though, is the fact that since you can set the DIP extremely low and the buttons are so responive, if the user is someone with limited hand-movement ability or who suffers from wrist fatigue this mouse may greatly improve their ability to use a computer. Seriously, when I set the DPI at the lowest setting I thought of Stephen Hawking in his wheelchair. If you could only move your hand a few centimeters in every direction, this device would allow you to use a PC. And the forward/back buttons would likewise make web surfing ENORMOUSLY easier for someone like my parents.A common person however, may not know that DPI relates to tracking speed, and for this reason (not explaining that in the manual), and for the spongy,over-sensitive left mouse button, the device gets four starts instead of five. If you are a gamer with a living room PC buy it for yourself. If you have aging or disabled family members with limited hand-mobility buy it for them and show them how to adjust speed and use the forward/back buttons. Wonderful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VSTXRKZB3TWW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHJYXO4#wasThisHelpful","R3VSTXRKZB3TWW","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story of my love for this show is a complex one. I watched the original My Little Pony as a kid because I had two sisters and was the only boy. To me there was nothing strange about watching Lady Lovely Locks, Rainbow Brite (the movie rocked!), and Strawberry Shortcake. It was just what we were watching. It wasn't until much, MUCH later that I discovered Transformers, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and the like (my mother didn't like all the violence). Fast forward to my 30's and a funny thing happened at work.DiscoveryA co-worker of mine had a name that sounded a bit like ""pony"" so people so some teasing occurred based on his last name. Then another co-worked mentioned that there was indeed a growing phenomenon of ""bronies"" watching My Little Pony. Knowing only the original show from the 80's and it's immediate sequel shows (having completely missed the brain-dead recent ones) I assumes he was talking about the originals. I looked it up on search engines and started to read article after article on the phenomena. My reaction was immediate ""I must watch this show and know what this is all about.""BacklashI couldn't believe how good this show was. Just watching the first two episodes, which were clearly heavily influenced by Sailor Moon, the circuits in my nerd brain were blown. It was so incredibly well done! I begged and pleaded with my wife (a big Sailor Moon fan) to watch JUST THE FIRST TWO EPISODES. She resisted, then relented. Eventually she ended up watching every season so far (four as of this writing) with me. While she enjoyed watching the show ONCE, she's no fan-girl or brony. And my friends and acquaintances are even worse.I don't really understand why so many people have such a strong aversion to things that target a different demographic, other than perhaps that propaganda has thoroughly washed their brain. Rejecting something ONLY because it appears childish...is a mark of immaturity (Or as C.S. Lewis once said ""Now that I am an adult I have put away childish things such as the need to appear very adult.""). So ironically, many people appear to be too childish to give a kids' show a chance. Go figure.GeniusI've been a fan of animation from all over the world my entire life. I grew up watching every Disney animated feature and every cartoon on the Disney Channel in the 80's. As an adult I discovered anime classics animated shows and films from the 80's that I missed as a kid. I'm here to tell you, this show is not good. It is a work of genius.I can't count how many people I told to watch this show said they ""can't stand the singing"". It's hard for me to choke down my gut reaction, which is to call them all sorts of intelligence insulting names. This show has songs that rival the best Disney ever put in a show or on film. Its songs are better than ANY songs currently on the radio. The lyrics are downright brilliant. The melodies are infectious. The song structures are brilliantly executed and wildly inventive. Even songs that I wasn't crazy about at first slowly embedded themselves into my brain until I wanted to listen to them on repeat for hours. And yes, I have finally gotten to the point where I listen to ""At the Gala"" in French and ""Winter Wrap-Up"" in German. The songs are that good. The only music with lyrics I can think of recently that is that good would be the soundtrack from the Disney film Frozen (which I also have international versions of songs for).If you strip away the iconic characters, gorgeous flash animation (yes, that is possible), catchy songs, adult and pop-culture references, etc, you still would have an exceedingly clever show, which is thoroughly self-aware, and tells an absolutely wonderful story. Our real world is filled with negativity, sex, violence, and hate. I can't watch shows on TV designed for adults that aren't based on cooking or some everyday activity, because modern TV drama for adults makes me sick. The explanation for this programming has always seemed to be that people are simply dark, evil, twisted creatures who crave nothing but these base things for their amusement. But then, out of nowhere something like Friendship is Magic emerges which exceedingly proves that no matter how dismal and dark things get in our modern world, good things come from within the hearts of good people, and simply cannot be suppressed. This is not mindless entertainment. It is a show about growing, and showing love for others on a very deep level. It encourages embracing your identity, cherishing the things that make us different, and true loyalty (to name only a few of the reoccurring themes). The world NEEDS shows like this desperately to teach children (and adults) the life lessons that are constantly being undermined by the screams of mainstream media to be selfish and self-centered.Aside from that, the characters really are truly outstanding archetypes with amazing depth and goodness, even to the point of being profound. Through the course of the show into the later seasons, you'll see a tomboy who loves sports embrace reading a good book, a refined woman get dirty to make a child happy, a shy mousy animal-lover overcome her fears, an independent spirit learn to rely on others, and an extreme attention-deficit character learn to focus on what truly matters in life. There is something deeply moving about a protagonist who sacrifices for others, a person who gets their entire self-worth of seeing others become happy, and a character who creates art but is only joyous when the creation is for the benefit of others. This is great stuff people.ConclusionsThis is where it all starts. Watch this show and fall under the spell of something truly good that springs from a love of people and everything that makes friendship the wonderful thing it is.If like me you are a shy nerd who struggles to make friends, this show may make you feel like more as a person. If you have no interest in such things and appreciate a good cartoon you will at the very least find it wildly entertaining. And if you think cartoons are for children, singing is stupid and only weirdos and perverts would want to watch a show for little girls when they are an adult male, I feel deeply DEEPLY sorry for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BPK96FV8V5SF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0096W47NO#wasThisHelpful","R1BPK96FV8V5SF","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a fan of GONZO's work for some time now, ever since watching their first show Blue Submarine No. 6. They have released many popular anime over the years, but it seems like for some people this one slipped through the cracks. The premise is...unique, to say the lease (two planets at war, each populated only by a single sex), and things just get more bonkers from there. If you look closely, however, beyond the silliness and strangeness there is a shockingly good show to be found.I hear voicesFirst of all, if you like your shows in English this show is absolutely incredible in the voice acting department. It's a shining reminder of just how good English dubs got for a while as we have main characters voiced by the people who played:The Major (Ghost in the Shell), Tanya (Battle Athletes Victory), Spike (Cowboy Bebop),  Milly (Trigun), Count Cagliostro (Lupin III:Castle of Cagliostro), Toph (Legend of Korra)....and last but not least...Rick Hunter from the Robotech Macross Saga!!!!!!!!I mean seriously, GOOD GRIEF!!!! This HAS to be the greatest voice cast ever assembled!!!!! Er..umm...moving right along...The charactersVoice actors smoishactors you say? Well these awesome voice actors who could make the stupidest, most shallow character even sound like Shakespeare or Star Wars have some GREAT material to work with. This show has character development for EVERYONE. There are no minor characters here. Absolutely ever character (though some might call them stereotypes) is positively dripping with personality, to the point where it's darn hard not to love absolutely everyone in this show. For the first half of the show, there isn't really much of a plot, but there doesn't need to be one because the English voiced characters just so dang entertaining!The StoryThere actually IS a great story to be found, it's just very convoluted and confusing, and a lot of things aren't really explained at all until halfway through the show. Be patient grasshopper. DO NOT judge this show by the first ""season"" because the story improves drastically, along with everything else once you are into the second half. The characters get more depth, the story gets more fleshed out, and oh yeah...The AnimationNo bones about it, the first half of this show has HORRIBLE CGI that makes it look very low budget. the animation itself is fine (if very computer-assisted looking) but the cell animation and pure CGI blend about as well as oil and water (on Earth). Fortunately, the show seems to get a HUGE animation bump in the second season, to the point where it's almost like watching a different show. And that's really great because...A Really Great StoryYou might have a hard time believing it from the start, but this is a really great story. You have genuinely inspiring speeches, compelling examples of understanding and tolerance (I try to be as patient and understanding as the Doctor), heart-warming devotion, and heart-breaking loss. There is one episode in particular that has a newly introduced character die...that honestly made me cry. Because a character underwent a drastic change as a result of that loss, even though he very briefly knew the character introduced. And if there is one way to describe the style of this show, that would be it. Despite throwing things out you suddenly and between comic silliness, it still makes you CARE.This show's style is very hyper-active and disjointed. It rapidly cuts between people and locations and everything happens very quickly. There's a lot of planet hopping, fast action, and people talk fast. If you don't like that sort of things and like your anime slow and ponderous this is not the show for you. If you don't mind watching a show where you can just kind of hang on for the ride and have a wild time this is probably more your speed.FlawsNeedless to say, if you are ultra-conservative this show is going to be all kinds of offensive to you. It doesn't force you to watch anything graphic (heck I think there's like one kiss in the entire series) but there's plenty of innuendo and references to everything from mono-gendered societies (duh!) to religious fanaticism and body-part harvesting. There's also of course tons of fan-service as just about every woman is dressed in a provocative way (which absolutely makes sense if you consider the fact that they were raised on a world with no men to leer at them).Al that is arguably not a real flaw though. The REAL flaw is that this show is letterboxed, not presented in animorphic widescreen. That means that even if you have a widescreen television like mine, there are still black bars on the top and bottom. Yuck! The show badly needs an animorphic transfer/remaster for that reason alone!In the EndIf you love the great dubs of the 90's on shows like Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Battle Athletes Victory, Giant Robo, and the Big O, there is absolutely no excuse not to pick up this show. It is superbly voiced and hilariously entertaining. Highly recommended to fans of 90's anime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJSKGKN54S457/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00576U9LW#wasThisHelpful","RJSKGKN54S457","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My father installed this in his new car and had lots to say about it. First, others are right that the device is cramped on a small dash and a bit difficult to install. It also does not come with a sleeve for storage, which is a negative if you are worried about getting your car broken into. That said...My father said using this device...is ""like opening present after present"". First, he loves the large, easy to read display, but there's a lot more to the device than that. We have owned Magellans before and I asked how it compared. ""Like day and night"". The device is much easier to use, and not only has many useful points of interest (he used it to track down a toy/hobby store to repair a radio-controlled helicopter), but it also features PHONE NUMBERS of businesses listed. His words ""I just called the phone numbers and if they are disconnected I know the business is gone, otherwise I can call them while driving and save money by not using 411!"" So, if the person who will be using the device is a senior citizen who likes a large, easy-to-use display, and likes to go exploring, and call businesses listed from the device, that alone makes it a winner. But wait! There's more!The device ""is more talkative"" than previous models, and gives directions in greater detail and more often. One time it got a bit confused when my father drove to a mall as it kept telling him to turn around after entering the parking lot. He really appreciated that it uses LANDMARKS to direct you ""turn right at the Shell Gas Station"" which helps him to avoid taking a wrong turn or overshooting an exit.My father found the device easy enough to use that he put it together without even using the manual (and he is not ""tech savvy""). I would highly recommend this device for seniors. However, you may wish to assist them by updating the maps for them so it has the most recent map information.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17DURJV3HVL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJF2VP0#wasThisHelpful","R17DURJV3HVL6","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's easy to clean, chops very nicely (it doesn't exactly reduce to powder, but excellent on chopping nuts), fast (two speeds), easy to clean, safe (won't activate unless pressed down), and uses bowls that can be used to store and serve food (comes with two strong glass bowls).I call this one a winner!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CEFREWI9ST18/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPYK13Y#wasThisHelpful","R3CEFREWI9ST18","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tried to give this game a chance. I really did. I guess you just have to be a certain kind of person to like it.While I would whole-hardheartedly recommend it to the extrovert who thinks on their feet, to a slow-thinking board game geek like me this game was a recipe for a headache and not even slightly fun.This game operates by having you constantly change the rules of the game and attempt to achieve an ever-changing objective. I think I could maybe get behind that idea if the game was over in 10 minutes. But playing with only two players, as the rules stacked up on each other I started to get a serious headache trying to keep track of them.I think I would like this game better if it had a limit to new rules (say, two or three) and if the gameplay was more fun. As it is, I felt like someone was asking me to memorize random numbers and just as I memorized them I was asked to discard them and memorize more. As a person with a very limited short-term memory I found this extremely unpleasant.For what it's worth I don't like anything else about the game either. Not a fan of the artwork, game mechanics, etc. To me, even if the game didn't give me a headache I'd still find it boring. If, like me, you have a bad short-term memory I'd suggest a bluffing game like Coup instead to fill your time in between bigger, longer games. Or you could always play a similarly fast-moving but much more enjoyable game like Splendor or Lost Cities.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FFCMSK9SCY75/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OETKWCE#wasThisHelpful","R1FFCMSK9SCY75","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've played a few racing board games in my time, but so far this one takes the cake.This is a game that sounds a lot more difficult to play than it is, and comes down to strategy far more than any other game of it's kind I have yet to play. You race around a board with your car, moving up and down in gear as you approach corners and straightaways. You take damage for skipping gears, overshooting corners, and collisions. There are a few other basic rules if you are playing the simple version but they are largely logical and easy to understand (if you roll the highest number in a later gear you are straining your engine, you can't zig-zag in a straight line).The game is incredibly well-designed, the board is beautiful, and you can play with up to ten players, though the game is really fun with only two (which really surprised me). There is a large amount of risk/reward going on which separates this from a mere dice-rolling game, and if it's too easy you can apply a ton of extra rules to make the game more complex (pit-stops, weather, driver powers, individual damage meters for car parts).The main thing to remember is that this game is REALLY fun. I kept hesitating to play this game thinking it would bore people, and my father looked a little scared as I read all the rules, but once we started to play he quickly got into it, and by the time time we got to the final corner he was on the edge of his seat and I was close to wrecking my gearbox and dropping out of the game.I think this game will especially appeal to people who love auto racing, and those who have large groups who like to play games. Unlike most games where ""It's over when the first person passes the finish line"" I can see an epic battle to not be in last place taking place with this game, as well as ridiculous collisions at the start of the race as everyone is jockeying for position (like the real world!). I have only two minor complaints. 1. The boards damage easily. and 2. Only a few of the boards released before Asmodee bought the rights have been released and I am absolutely dying to race around real world tracks like Laguna Seca, Suzuki, Silverstone, and Monza. If Asmodee is listening, I'm begging you to put the street racing tracks together on expansions and real world tracks together, instead of mixing the two, and start releasing some real world-class tracks. If you make it, the fans will buy! See you at the track!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12EX6BPB2AE1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=2914849648#wasThisHelpful","R12EX6BPB2AE1C","A2KVUYPLEW4LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KVUYPLEW4LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Haven't curled up with a medieval romance in a while so this was a delicious treat just for being something different from my usual.  I've been wanting to try the author's books for some time after hearing wonderful things.  Right mood and right time led to a few enjoyable afternoon reading sessions.  Knights, chivalry, damsels in distress, betrayal, and family behind a spirited pair of lovers left me eager to get my hands on more of the series.This book is part of longstanding de Piaget series as book #13 and also connected indirectly to the MacLeod series.  I had no trouble jumping into the middle and treating this like a standalone.  The characters from the earlier stories were present, but this book's plot was independent and took place in a slightly disconnected setting.  The story features the youngest de Piaget daughter who I assume was part of the earlier stories as the wallflower sister.  Siblings, parents, and grandparents are present, but this Isabelle's story.The story opens with Lady Isabelle pondering a rash course of action.  She has received a letter threatening her family if she doesn't personally and privately comply with the sender's wishes.  Isabelle is the youngest daughter and unmarried.  She is uninterested in the suitors who come for Amanda who is recently wed and are forced to turn their tepid interest on her.  Isabelle longs for adventure and a chance to step outside of the shadows.  Well, here she has just such an adventure only, her family's lives are dependent on her quest's success.  All must be done in secret.  Isabelle makes arrangements to get to her grandmother's convent in France where the mysterious letter writer orders her to go.Gervase de Seger once the terror of the tournament circuit and handsome well-sought man is now a shadow of his former self.  He inherited his family titles and lands along with the care of his six younger half-brothers, but soon after he took his father's place, someone tries to kill him and nearly succeeds.  He is crippled by injuries from the fire started in his hall and the crossbow bolt that pierced his thigh and shattered muscle.  Gervase nearly died and lives in weakness and constant pain.  His sufferings distract him so that the needed work along with the investigation into his would-be murderer remain undone.  Into this situation comes a bedraggled waif he rescues, but doesn't want to be responsible for so he sends her to the kitchens to work there.In the shipwreck, Isabelle was injured and lost her memories.  She recovers some of her memories only after she is taken for a peasant girl.  Isabelle decides to keep up the appearance until she figures out why she is in France and not back home in her father's castle in England.  How she got there and why nag at her because she vaguely remembers that it was for an important reason.  In the meantime, Isabelle sees the situation in Gervase's household and starts taking things in hand which rubs her against Gervase and his dark moods, his younger brothers, and the running of the household.  She can complain about many things when it comes to Gervase, but unlike most of the male population, he not only sees her- really sees her and remembers her name, but he calls her beautiful and talented.Gervase eventually learns the extent of his danger when he is told who the lovely, irritating not-subservient enough to be a serving woman is.  Now there is Isabelle's quest, his need to find his would-be killer, and the force of the de Piaget family ire hovering over him like a mighty storm.  And he thinks on the possibilities with a spirited woman like Isabelle being just the person he needs in his life.Alright, so this one was a lighter romp compared to most medieval romances I've read.  It took me a bit to adjust to the tone because of that.  I did have an issue and it was a big detractor from my overall enjoyment, but it wasn't the sort of thing to make me put aside a story.I'm glad I continued on through because there was a lot about this story that was fun and engaging.I figured out who was behind all the trouble early on so that plot thread didn't provide me with any suspense, but the daily life in Gervase's home with his younger brothers was sheer delight.  I loved the sizzling chemistry between Isabelle and Gervase along with their witty dialogue.  The late inclusion of Isabelle's twin brother made each scene he was in just shine.  And the romance was warm, well-developed and heart-warming beyond the passion.As to the big issue I had, it was Isabelle or rather the likelihood of a woman of Isabelle's background engaging in what she did.  We see it often enough in historical romances- the heroine who steps out the usual role and goes against convention, exhibits behaviors that are too modern, and is pretty much not so convincing as a woman of her time as a result.  Most of the time, I shrug and go with it for the sake of some escape reading.  Like I said, not an unusual thing, but there is only so far I'm willing to take it.  I'm reading a historical so I really do want to see a woman who, for the most part, fits her setting.The medieval period made it harder for me to adjust and accept.  These noble women were sheltered and protected from anything outside their castle walls.  They were not secret warrior ninjas who could outfight and out man the menfolk.  The subsequent events of chapter one and onward when it came to Isabelle's quest were as unlikely as they come.  So unbelievable that it undermined her character for me.  I couldn't get past the ignorance and arrogance that launched her into action.She gets a letter threatening her families lives if she doesn't show up at her grandmother's convent in France.  So a young woman who has a family full of well-trained fighting men on both side of the channel decides- instead of calling upon them to help- that all depends on her alone.  She will protect them all against someone who may have the means to kill a lot of well-armed and well-protected powerful people.  She has no training or skills in defense, she has no knowledge of weapons.  She is a beautiful woman alone in a harsh land of lawlessness outside the protection of the lords and their castles.  She has a long journey and no idea what is the purpose of the threat or who it's from, but hey, she's a little bored and feeling under-appreciated so she's doing this.  She doesn't have the excuse of a young girl's impetuousness.  She's twenty-three and her father made sure she is well educated and knows how to use her brain.So yeah, I didn't buy all this at all.  Then she decided later in the game to be cautious right when the smart thing was to be honest and communicate to Gervase who she was. He'd proved that he was a good and honorable man.  But no, let's let the poor guy who rescues her from robbery, violence, and rape get put in a tight spot when her family thinks that Gervase took her and kept her for his own nefarious means.  Again, I shook my head.  Is she altogether a flaky, stubborn-stupid heroine?  Of course not.  Isabelle has spirit, good intentions, compassion, understanding, and courage.  She was never mean and she wanted the best for all involved.Now Gervase!  Gervase's situation was the highlight of the story for me.  The unwanted son who makes good when he goes out into the world.  The fighting man who believes in the knightly virtues and upholds them, untempted by the decadence his wealth and status can give him.  He comes home to do his duty and make things better after his lazy father dies and his conniving step-mother deserts her young children for court.  He now has the neglected younger brothers and the equally neglected duchy in his care.  If the weight of his duties wasn't enough, he has to recover from a life-threatening wound that unmans him.  Gervase is lost and must find his way back.  And he does, one step at a time.  I loved that Isabelle saw past the scars, the weakness, to the man with the heart of a warrior.  It's what redeemed her for me.  She could have been attracted to his handsome grown brothers, Jocelyn and Guy, who were easier to be with and like but she wanted the man with depth and strength and good heart.  He also knew how to swallow pride and take help.  I fell a bit in love with Gervase, if you can't tell, despite his cranky moments.I can appreciate so much about this story and enjoyed it to a certain extent.  The wry humor had me chucking more than a few times and the family togetherness was touching.  That stuff with Isabelle pushed my credulity too far even for a lighter read was the only fly in the ointment.  Would I read more of the series?  Yes!  Definitely want to go back for some of the other stories as well as my eagerness for her brother, Miles and his brother Jocelyn to get their books.  Medieval romance fans who like the tone to be light and the romance only slightly spice should take a closer look.My thanks to Penguin Group for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKQO4GCN9GOXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0515153478#wasThisHelpful","RKQO4GCN9GOXL","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the first book in this series and fell in love with the author's blend of fantasy, western, and sci-fi all in one story.  There were fierce dragons, the protective dragon riders, and gritty wild western living on a harsh, desert like planet where a bunch of earth colonists were left and ignored by the Federation.  Couldn't get enough of it and I came back for more.This second book really needs to be read after the first short novella.  This is the story of the young Jeremey the troublemaker who has now come of age.  The book begins several years after the last one, but  it assumes the reader is familiar with backdrop, characters, and some of the situation.The story opens with Jeremey coming of age.  He was orphaned when his parents were killed in a wild beast attack while the family was out seeing to their herds.  Jeremey carries around a fair amount of survivor's guilt because he felt he should have some how been able to save his folks.  Sheriff Charlie Colcord, his childhood hero, cares for him until his mom's relations come for him.  They don't want him and don't like him.  Now he can finally leave.Jeremey wants to be a brave dragon rider like Charlie.  He wants to protect people like he couldn't protect his parents.  But first, there is the part about getting one of the native dragons of the dragon valley to submit to him as a rider.  The other riders are suspicious of the guy from somewhere else so they don't make it easy on him.  However, right when he's about to give up on capturing a dragon, a magnificent blue dragon comes to him and willingly allows Jeremey to become his rider.Jeremey and Promise grow close as they work together on menial tasks.  Jeremey chafes at not being out on patrol and finally gets his wish when his boss sees him using a blaster with deadly aim.  While out patrolling, Jeremey and Promise see two space ships crash out of the sky.  And from there, Jeremey and Promise go on an exciting adventure that gives Jeremey the opportunity to save all the people on No Man's Land from an alien threat and maybe discover a secret chance at happiness.Alright, I had a good time with this one like I did the first book.  I didn't get to experience the same shocking surprise twist the author gave in the last book, but she slipped in a few new ones to make me marvel.  The plot developed slowly at the beginning, but by the middle, a suspenseful exciting pace picked things up and didn't slow down until the end.  Charlie and Zorevan the dragon return- much to my delight- and the relationship and revelation about the dragons when Jeremey was chosen by Promise to be his rider was great.  Finally, the origin story and explanations that the first book didn't include about the mysterious race of dragons.These stories are not very complex, but they're just plain good storytelling.  The setting is a blend of elements I enjoy.  The characters are likeable if not very deep.  The situation is dire and there is betrayal, suspense, action, friendships, and the surprise of first romance.  The whole package together leads me to devour the story and then hope there will be more.  Love this world of dragons, space cowboys, and their interesting exciting lives together.I think these are fun and light and would recommend them to the lover of m/m sci-fi romance who likes their dragons and the flavor of the Wild West.I received this book from Net Galley in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JGC9212JXKRH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620046792#wasThisHelpful","R2JGC9212JXKRH","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why did I pick this one up?  The shorter answer would be why I wouldn't pick it up.  A fast becoming favorite author, holiday setting, and a tender-hearted love story between two people who find healing in each other.The story is loosely connected to other stories by the author, but is indeed a standalone.It opens with former Navy Aviator, Maggie Benson, coming home.  Maggie was shot down in the war and had a long period of recovery from burns and then the loss of her lower leg due to infection.  She wanted to give up, but is now shakily trying to put some semblance of her life together by going home and finally letting her family's strength support her.  Going home is scary and hard after her dreams of being a pilot are gone, but there is someone who may give her hope of a new dream if she can let go of her disappointments and fears of inadequacy to accept the gift she wishes for.Former NBA player and now local high school coach and teacher, Will Fitzpatrick, knows a thing or two about having to pick up the pieces of a life shattered by injury and loss.  He is drawn to Maggie's beauty and spirit.  He can see beyond the scars and the prosthetics, but can he convince Maggie to believe that he does?  Will knows what he wants for Christmas.The story moves along quickly as novellas do, but it was full of heartwarming small town goodness and a hopeful romance set against the holidays on Long Island.  It was a perfect holiday read and a great feel-good story.  The author did a wonderful job of showing what it is like for a person recovering from horrific injuries and living with PTSD to heal and re-integrate into civilian life.  I had such admiration for Maggie- and all the real life folks who have similar tough personal battles still to fight.  Will is a great guy.  He's middle aged and after two failed attempts with women who who couldn't see the treasure he was, he is still hopeful of finding love, marriage, and a family.  It was refreshing to read about a hero who wasn't hung-up on commitments.  This is good because Maggie is so newly dealing with her own issues that she has enough hang-ups for both of them.Sweet, tender, and mildly passionate holiday contemporary romance that I would recommend for a great heart-warming holiday read.I received this book from Net Galley in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO09OMZGTZKM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017L6YJ16#wasThisHelpful","RO09OMZGTZKM1","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"He's only got a few months to live.  Logan Holstock realizes what is truly important to him.  He heads west to find the brothers he was separated from when their parents died on the Santa Fe Trail and leaves behind a cold-blooded fiancee', a wealthy life of the Chicago elite, and the business he built to success beside his adopted father.  Meaningless now.  But in searching for his family, he finds so much more and he regrets more than ever the fact that he'll be gone soon.Sybil Spencer has lived with a selfish, greedy man for the last six years and now he wants to send her little girl off to boarding school because he can't stand the sight of her.  Sybil has been a dutiful wife and took Norman's arrogant attitude, but she will not let him send Kitty away.  She marches down to the bank and confronts Norman only to get into the middle of a robbery.  Norman is arrogant and pays for it with his life, but a sickly stranger comes to her rescue.  Then he impresses the whole town, but wants to be left alone.  Only, Sybil wants very much for Logan to hope and live.Ah yes, the blurb was enough to hook me in.  And then I was excited because it was an author I have especially wanted to try since I've been reading more western historical romance lately.  This was the third story in the Cactus Creek Cowboys series about the third long lost brother.  I didn't realize it was part of a series when it caught my eye.  However, I wanted to read it so badly that when I noticed it was part of a series, I said heck with it and grabbed it anyway.I'm so glad I did.  I can see where I missed out on some good stories with Colby and Jared's stories and their marriages to two other Spencer cousins, but this story was easily read out of order.  I loved that the romance is only part of the story that also includes the story of the small western town of Cactus Creek and part of a large family of Spencer- Holstocks.  The children play amusing roles and the other brothers and their families are a strong part.But besides the small town, the family, and the romance, there was a mysterious murder from Sybil's past and the present machinations of Logan's adopted cousin trying to get her paws on his money by any means she can.  Most of the book is fairly tame and even dragged a few times before picking up again, but the opening scene and then the big end scenes put the action element in to provide a gritty variety to an otherwise gentle pace.The characters are engaging.  I was totally won over by all of them particularly Logan who was dealing with being a good man and doing the right things even though he was dying and Sybil who made some mistakes as a young girl that she had to keep paying for.  And then there was darling Kitty, a little girl who had a gentle nature and a heart of gold.  Trusty the dog was practically a character too.  But all the additional characters populating the scenes were also fabulous.The romance was a slow burn and developed slowly because Logan thinks he has nothing to give since he's so sick and Sybil has made a couple bad decisions about men so is wary of her feelings even if Logan were receptive.  They do finally come together and its a sweet loving that felt just right for this story.  This pair started out friends and partners to save Sybil's bank and I liked that though the attraction was there, the other came first.I'm not sure if this was the last book in the series since all three brothers are happily matched, but the world of Cactus Creek, Arizona, was a great place to visit.  It's a baby western town and the pioneer spirit that brought the people there is alive and well. The western setting stayed pretty much in the background to the human lives and the romance elements, but it was drawn well and balanced nicely with the story.All in all, I had a fantastic time with this tender, heart-warming western romance that I would happily and easily recommend to others who like moderately spicy and moderately gritty action with their historical westerns.My thanks to Sourcebooks Casablanca for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GWUH9U15TBML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0108GOKX8#wasThisHelpful","R2GWUH9U15TBML","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed the authors Baba Yaga series so I eagerly accepted this one where she again weaves her creative magic in writing an entertaining Urban Fantasy story of witches, dragons, shapeshifters, and dark secretive forces set to tear apart the world. A small band of misfit paranormals takes on the powers that be and the powers that live in the shadows in this paranormal adventure with a hint of romance. It ended on a high, hopeful note that felt more like a new beginning than an end.The story opens with witch cop, Donata Santori, called to a crime scene to interrogate the dead witnesses. Humans still are adjusting to the fact that they have magic users living amongst them, but Donatas gift of speaking to the dead is a harder sell than oh say a healer like her sister. But when push comes to shove, she is right where she wants to be earning her own way and making a difference for people.This murder turns up something disconcerting in regard to a painting that is the main piece of evidence. The restorer who died makes Donata his new crusader in the fight to both render the painting harmless while getting it to give up its secrets before it falls into the wrong hands. The painting is spelled and it will take an expert and specially qualified restorer to work on it. Donata is appalled to discover her new contact also happens to be a half-dragon professional forger who has no idea he has a bit of flame and scale in his family tree.But between dodging the Cabal and her own paranormal Council, Donata and crew struggle to fulfill their tasks. Donata also is confused about her growing feelings for the forger and the feelings that are fanned back to life by a past lover who joins their rag-tag crew. It was one breathtaking, intense story nearly to the end once everything got going.Alright, this one sets up like a paranormal murder mystery in the beginning with the author carefully weaving in the worldbuilding and situation for each of the characters. Donata is the sole narrator. She was engaging and wry, tough, but has not wholly come into her own yet. She hopes that by completing the task laid out by the dead man that she will earn the respect of her family and her boss with the police. She is surrounded by characters who in their own ways are just as in limbo as she is and must figure out how to rejoin the world around them and make peace with their past.As to the romance, like many Urban Fantasies, this one has hints and some moments, but nothing concrete since the focus is on the quest and not the development of relationships. This story ended leaving things up in the air and a potential love triangle. Normally, I run from those, but not when they are developed organically and not just present to beef up the drama.The background of this story is strong. I enjoyed the color flavors of creative characters in that the half dragon is slowly learning about himself and the shapeshifter is more blended with Viking Berserker (yum), and there is also a Kobold who is like a short elf who can be a strong support or a dangerous annoyance when riled. Donatas own witch background is the most filled in. Her spells were intricate and felt authentic when she was weaving and casting them (makes sense with the authors background). But even the little things like delicious foods, the art connection, and the police politics were all nice layers to the story.I hope there is more after this story though I loved what I got. I would definitely recommend it to Urban Fantasy fans who enjoy a strong witch heroine and a colorful cast of paranormals supporting her in her mission to protect the world.My thanks to Penguin Group for the opportunity to read this story in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MN2EIK348NB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0125VU39Y#wasThisHelpful","R3MN2EIK348NB5","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the prequel for the series as part of the Way of the Warrior anthology and loved the idea of a family of law enforcement brothers in a romantic suspense series.  Did someone yell 'Come and get it'?  Yeah, I was eager when this first in the series came up telling the youngest Dawson brother's romance.Kyle has been butting heads with his dad since he can remember.  Everyone else worships the great Sheriff Mac Dawson.  Kyle can't stand the idea of it all and takes his need to serve and protect into the FBI and away from Sheriff Mac's bailiwick.  Kyle carries a chip on his shoulder and smarts off and does his lone wolf thing once to often down at the New Orleans field office and gets hit with a forced leave of absence and a transfer.  Right back where he started or close enough.Three years ago Abby Morrow crushed Kyle Dawson's heart and forced him away.  She had her reasons, but now wonders if they were worth the fact that she still hasn't gotten over him.  She works for the Sheriff's office for his dad and with his brothers mostly as a cyber cop taking side jobs to investigate things on line.  This latest on-line investigation for a wealthy business firm exposes the fact that someone is running a human trafficking ring and her brother in law's international security firm is somehow involved.  She barely has a moment to decide on a course of action when her sister is taken and she is threatened if the files are not handed over quickly.  She can't handle it alone and has to turn to the last man who should want to help her the way she treated him.Kyle never got over Abby's inexplicable rejection and now here she is in dire straights and danger swirling around her.  Kyle takes it as his chance to not only keep Abby and her family out of danger, but maybe get an explanation and a second chance. And maybe not just with Abby.  Coming home was hard, but also a good thing.  Returning to supportive family and working on Abby's case brings them all together again.Meanwhile, those who can't have Abby sharing what she knows and destroying a lucrative illegal business are not afraid to take care of the problem.  Permanently.So, I'm on the fence about this one.  I enjoyed the previous story with Kyle's brother.  But this one was only moderately enjoyable.  The investigation and the cat and mouse stuff going on with the professional crooks and hired assassins was intense stuff.  It was neat that she was a cyber crimes cop and he was an FBI agent.I was enjoying it until the moment of learning that Kyle and Abby had been in love and together for months until she pushes him away and says she can't marry him because she doesn't love him.My enjoyment instantly soured.Not another one of those 'I had a perfectly legit reason for crushing your heart and lying to you.  I was scared we'd turn into my father and my mother who had a bad marriage so I made the call. Sorry about your luck for loving me.'  But sigh, it was.  Teeth officially are on edge now.I kept reading because I did love all the other elements of the story, I loved Kyle's character, the investigation and danger, and the Dawson brothers together are a treat not to be miss.  Fun peek in with the first couple and the set up for the next pair after this one.But then the real zinger came.  She kept a second truth from him.  Now this is the one that crossed a line for me and destroyed most of my enjoyment of the story.  This is the one that made the whole thing feel contrived and just so much drama.For the life of me, I don't understand how people can keep such a thing from the one they love.  Abby's secret was Kyle's truth to know, too.  Because I didn't buy the reasoning, I didn't connect with Abby or the re-starting romance.So, the romance was a bust for me.  But getting some good cops and bad guys action, seeing Kyle going after the bad guys with his brothers at his back, and getting to see Kyle and Mac work out their differences.  All that was to the good.Would I continue with this series?  Absolutely.  We got two more Dawson brothers who need some loving.I know for others that hiding important secrets and lying is just all part of the delicious drama mix so I can still easily recommend it even if the romance wasn't my cup of tea.  Romantic suspense lovers who likes some spice, danger, and a full cast of hot and handsome law enforcement brothers might want to try this one.My thanks to Sourcebooks Casablanca for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL7XXJRAXIWW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492618349#wasThisHelpful","RL7XXJRAXIWW9","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was captivated by the eyes staring at me from the cover and curious about a title that was a city and state.  I checked the blurb.  Again, sounded like my kind of story.  So I was good to go.Paranormal stories particularly those involving shifters can be all over the place for me.  I love them, but they generally hit the shallow end of the pool for me relying hard on the heat in the romance or the action instead of developing the tone and setting to create an atmosphere that 'feels' paranormal.  I'm not sure if I'm explaining myself well enough to be understood.  This story felt genuine and authentic instead of contrived.  If a guy was to uncover the fact that 'others' live alongside the humans, this is how I would expect it to come about and how he would react.The story opens when Randy moves from big city, Washington DC, to the sticks of Wolf, WY.  He made a quick, arbitrary decision.  He needed to get away from his lying, cheating ex-fiance, his stifling life as a long hours high pressure lawyer and he needed time to reassess away from his controlling mother.  It was like moving to another planet.  And the locals want nothing to do with the newcomer most especially his own next door neighbors.Randy has this cozy day dream of living in a nice neighborhood, talking over the fence, participating in Halloween candy giving and enjoying the peace and harmony of the country.  But then he meets his standoffish, unfriendly neighbor, Vaughn O'Connell.  Vaughn is a widower with three kids.  His oldest is eighteen and his other two are in grade school.  The family ignore all attempts at friendly waves, hellos, or even eye contact.  What gives?  Randy bristles from the treatment and so is ready to explode when he catches the drool-worthy Vaughn and his oldest in his yard cutting down one of his trees.They have their say and he, naturally has his.  He can out snark and out argue the best of them.  But the bottom line is they think he's a helpless city guy who will screw up often and force them to have to pull him out of difficulties before he eventually either goes back to where he's from or dies from exposure.  Randy has full intentions of proving Vaughn wrong, but unfortunately he does prove rather inept when it comes to winterizing his vehicle, to generators, to the wolves, and to even knowing to wear the right clothes for the cold.  And then there are the odd moments of weirdness about that family.  Randy can't quite figure it out.  Lyle seems to be on some kick of proving himself by showing an interest in Randy because his dad, Vaughn doesn't approve.  And Vaughn's behavior around Randy are confusing at best.Randy is learning that life in the country certainly isn't dull and there is definitely the possibility of something with the irascible Vaughn, but then the secret of Wolf, WY is revealed in the most shocking way.So, this one was a more gently-paced book that had nuances and subtlety to it.  It eased the reader into Randy's life.  Randy is the sole narrator.  He's a fascinating individual.  I didn't like him much, but I enjoyed experiencing his story.  I don't think I was meant to like him to tell the truth.  He comes with expectations, assumptions, a chip on his shoulder, and a truckload of attitude.  The reader can see that while Randy is busy judging and assuming about his neighbors that he misses the fact that he's no paragon of virtue.  He's offended because Vaughn worries about the new neighbor watching his kids and warns him off, but then turns around and worries that Vaughn is an abusive parent.  Later, there is a moment where Vaughn tries to tell Randy that he needs space to deal with some issues Lyle is going through.  Randy jumps down his throat with a 'gay' rant and how Vaughn needs to accept his son.  It's not always about your trigger issues, Randy, my man.  Sigh...The pair of them were both pretty crotchety cranky sorts.  Maybe that's why I had fun watching the hostilities slowly morph into something else.  The story takes place over several months and Vaughn's hesitations and slow advances leave Randy off balance and unsure.  Randy is slowly figuring out country living and slowly getting through to Vaughn and making friends with Vaughn's children even if he has to be careful with the oddly volatile Lyle.The big reveal of Vaughn's secrets was the high point and moment of crisis in the story.  I enjoyed how it came about and the fall out.  Emotions and reactions were genuine to the characters and situation.  Doesn't mean that I didn't think Randy was a putz for snarling at Vaughn's kids the way he did while he was in a moment, but it was an example of things getting real.Another twist comes after that and I loved it because it came out of nowhere, but made sense.I'm glad to see this one is part of a series.  Not sure who gets their story next since this one is very isolated to mostly Randy, Vaughn and the kids with maybe four other characters even mentioned far in the background.  Getting Lyle's story would be good.All in all, I found the story something refreshing in the way the characters were portrayed along with the paranormal tone.  I would recommend it to those who enjoy M/M Paranormal Romance.I received this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JQDTYPVSHY24/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016X3YDJG#wasThisHelpful","R1JQDTYPVSHY24","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A story set in the late '40's American South all by itself would have been enough to grab my britches, but stir in Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice story and my interest rose to a fever-pitch.  This was one of those stories that doesn't easy one in and let them get comfortable.  It grasps one by the senses.  I laughed, I sighed, I nearly cried, and I had moments of despair and triumph.  I absolutely could not put this book down.  It was a romance and a re-telling, but it was also so much more.I felt like it was the story of several women that happen to have romantic entanglements or at least erotic encounters as they find their way clear to their own brand of happiness.  Not that the men don't play good, interesting roles, too, but this was where my mind focused and how it processed the story.So, I'm going to do a bit of something different with my summary.  I'm going to summarize the gals that caught my attention and made me feel oh so many things.  Bear with my quirks!There is Lizzie Bennet, spitfire and non-conformist who has lost her way.  She is content with her home on the farm, her family, and her simple life until one Fitzwilliam Darcy jostles her out of her fog and gets her good and angry enough to engage with life again- particularly if it is sparring with the wealthy arrogant, annoying jerk.  Just when she starts to heal, her past rears up and shatters more than one person's happiness.Next, there is Jane Bennet, oldest and most beautiful of the Bennet sisters.  Jane carries a disease in her body that made no promises how long she would live.  This puts a death knell  on a marriage and children as far as Jane is concerned.  Thus it nearly crushes her when she falls for the lively, handsome Charles Bingley who buys Netherfield Plantation because it is close to his construction contracts with the military.  Charles is everything she could want in a man and she enjoys their time while knowing there is an expiration date on anything really developing.Charles' sister, Caroline accompanies him when he moves to Meryton.  She is snobbish and cruel, conniving, and set on having her way.  She settles for cheap, tawdry encounters and dreams of a life of wealth to distance her from her dark past.  Something is broken inside her and the milk of human kindness just isn't there.  She will do whatever it takes to have Fitzwilliam Darcy, the biggest catch of them all.Charlotte Lucas, mayor's daughter and best friend of Lizzie, dreams of escape from her overbearing, sometimes abusive mother who hides a cruel side behind her public face.  Charlotte wants out so badly that she latches on to the worst possible man for escape.  Lizzie suspects why Charlotte doesn't even try to find a compatible guy and it breaks her heart for Charlotte's future chances.  Charlotte must walk her own path and hopefully find a ray of happiness in the dark.And finally, there is Georgiana, William's sister and a woman before her time because of a youthful mistake in love and in trusting old family friends to have her best interests at heart.  She has done her penance and now is emerging into the world shy and terrified that she can't judge characters and will make another big mistake.  It is the misery of her usually taciturn brother and the relapse of her mentally fragile and broken cousin that force her to step up and be there for the men in her life that were always there for her.So, there were many threads in this story.  William and Lizzie had the main roles, but everyone else had some pretty strong secondary parts.  I like what the author did with the modernization aspect of characters, setting, and plot.  Pride & Prejudice's tale, characters, and scenes was clearly there while also the offering of something fresh and original.I liked what the author did with Mr. and Mrs. Bennet along with Colonel Fitzwilliam, Mr. Collins, and Anne deBourgh.  Again, I knew them, but yet these characters weren't pale copies of the originals, but their own vibrant personages.  This Collins made the hair stand up on the back of my neck just as this Colonel Fitzwilliam's pain broke my tender heart.  Anne shocked the pants off me, but then it really, really worked and I was in awe of the brilliance.  Truthfully, I could go on and on about each characterization because I felt this was where it was at.  This and the historical setting.  Honestly, I love my romance, but it wasn't the foremost aspect of the story for me.The story has an edgier tone and doesn't apologize for being set in the age its in.  I've not had much truck with the South other than week-long visits from time to time, but from what I've observed and heard from others, this background felt authentic.There were so many other elements in the mix that had their place in this time and place.  Jim Crow laws and attitudes, PTSD, women finding their place after the men came back from war, women and children's recourse when in an abuse situation, what was deemed cause to be institutionalized (shudder) for 'treatment', and the aftershocks of the Great Depression among other things.Probably not the story for people with strong sensibilities to racier romance and activities, taboos like homosexuality, and triggers to child abuse and domestic violence.As to that racy romance business, for those looking for the payoff of the stormy, sizzling romance full of passion and conflict?  This is the book for you.  Past hurts, misunderstandings, outside interference, former lovers, and present complications make for a hard fought romance for a few couples, but especially William and Lizzie.  That end feeling of hope, triumph, and rightness was so worth what it took to get there.To wrap it up, this was fantastic.  It is a standout read of the year for me.  I can easily recommend it to a wider audience range:  the Austenesque lover who wants for something grittier and spicier and in a different way, to those who like their historical romance set in the nearer historical eras, and to the women's fiction fan who enjoys seeing broken characters grow and triumph.My thanks to Meryton Press for providing the book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBY2JLS8QST35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0178ICE8C#wasThisHelpful","RBY2JLS8QST35","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a quick holiday paranormal romance.  It was fun and hot.The story is about two co-workers on a paranormal police type force who keep the mean nasties from hurting the humans.  They have been attracted for some time, but never done anything about it.  Until now.  Cornell is an old-natural born vampire who recognizes his mate in the forbidden slayer that he brought in, had trained, and now has her on one of his teams.  He is just giving her time to grow up and heal from a personal family tragedy.  A friend reminds him that there's no time like the present.  So he goes for it.Dani has made herself into a tough, independent slayer.  She's not big on rules and deals out the snark.  She's had a thing for her starched up, rule following boss, but prefers to deny her feelings and attraction.  She would go right on ignoring her desires if Cornell hadn't made his move.Alright, this one got down to things quickly as it's rather short.  Its a fated mates romance set during the Christmas season, but its also a story that felt like I began in the middle.  It also felt more like an intro to a series than a book with a full story arc.  Still, I had a good time and I love the idea of a paranormal policing force so I'd recommend it to Paranormal Romance Fans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPIKCDSODYN06/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSENUGI#wasThisHelpful","RPIKCDSODYN06","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whew boy!  This is one hot, sensual wolf shifter series.  Unapologetic, this story gets right down to the heart of things for a race that are affected by mating heat and hunts, sometimes together.This is the first book in the series, but there is a prequel which I didn't read.  I didn't have trouble slipping into the story.And happily, there is a bit of story to go with the sexy times.  Curvy girl Beth went away to college to see the world and get her education.  In the meantime, she lived entirely as a human and locked away her wolf.  Four years later, her wolf will now no longer emerge leaving her the odd wolf shifter who cannot shift.  Her unmated vulnerable state has left the pack alpha with little choice, but to lay down a tough decision for her- mate with one of the unmated wolves or leave the pack.Dale has wanted Beth for years, but gave her the space she needed.  Now, he is done waiting.  She needs a mate and as far as he is concerned, that mate will only be him.  He was abused by humans and he doesn't trust them just as Beth is comfortable living as one, but he hopes that somehow he and Beth can find a way.Meanwhile, someone else is intent on getting the wolves blamed for dead cows and deer found scattered on the mountain ranges.This was fast-moving, hot, and gritty.  The wolves don't pretend to be humans especially in the bedroom.  And for those who draw the line at sex while shifted, I will say that it doesn't actually happen, but in this shifter world, they do it and there was a dream of it.Beth is hung up on her weight and Dale is resolved against humans, but they are a good pair and I liked them together.All in all, I liked this fast-paced, super hot shifter romance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SIY3IFCGBQ5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BVA2QBO#wasThisHelpful","R3SIY3IFCGBQ5U","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well let's see...immortal Viking warriors, enhanced humans, soul mates, lab experiments, and a deadline...No brainer here! I grabbed it!The exciting world of Norse mythology and Vikings come to life was heady stuff.  For an opening story to a series this one did a fantastic job of setting up the series plot and offering up the first romance and volley in the battle between Loki's minions and Odin and Freya's warriors.The story begins when Naya Brisbane who has been hiding out in the world returns to the lab that captured her and experimented on her to retrieve her younger brother.  He is in a bad way and the experiments have poisoned his system instead of enhancing him to be a super warrior like they did her.  Naya gets him to safety and then leaves to keep those who would recapture them from tracing his location through her.  Naya is a brilliant cyber-security expert and turns to that to fund the treatments for her brother.Leif is the Viking King of the berserkers and valkyries sent back to earth to protect the humans, stop an end of the world epic battle, and prevent otherworld interference.  Leif and his band know that Loki is behind many attempts to send enhanced humans and creatures to destroy the only group that can stop him.  Of late, Leif's inner berserker has become harder and harder to manage.  There will come a time when the berserker will take over entirely and Leif will have to be put away for the safety of all.An encounter with a band of new breed of minions who poison him with a new more powerful drug and his rescue by a mysterious warrior human woman from said minions may just be the saving of him.  Leif and Naya both have secrets and both have trust issues that keep them from sharing easily.  The attraction between them is great, but Naya works hard to ignore it because she must always be alone and Leif doesn't want to give any more than he has to after the losses he suffered the first time.  Then their is their tug o war about safety, independence, family, and finding home.  Will they put off admitting truths and accepting what they have together too late?So, this was the opener in a series.  It was exciting, action-packed, and full of conflict, but also delivers an engaging cast of new characters, worldbuilding, and the direction of the series arc.  The author's knowledge of Scandinavian history and Norse mythology shown through and made for a solid premise of the story.The band of brothers camaraderie with Leif and his warriors was also an asset.  Loved when they went into action or were just hanging around the stronghold.For me the weak point was the romance.  Leif and Naya were both guilty of squirreling away pertinent information.  I get that trust was tough, but there is a point when the secrecy was carried too far.  Lives are at stake and important things bigger than them or their tightly hoarded secrets.  And then there was so much resistance to there being any relationship that when the resolve came I was left with wondering where I was when they resolved the issues that both made so much of for most of the story.  The suddenness instead of a gradual acceptance and development was the issue and not the characters themselves.  Oh granted, Leif is an arrogant, misogynist Viking leader and Naya is a prickly, fiercely independent loner, but I was good with their pairing.  And what's not to like about a big, brawny, possessive Viking as passionate in the bedroom as he is in battle?I liked the direction of the action part of the conflict.  There were a few big exciting scenes and its obvious that though good prevails in the end that there is a lot more to come from Loki's bag of tricks.  I look forward to each of the warriors getting their story as this ongoing battle rages.All in all, this is a good start and I look forward to what is to come.  Something a little different in the way of Paranormal Romance that I can easily recommend.My thanks to Sourcebooks Casablanca for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNQOBMEKSX8US/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQC2OO8#wasThisHelpful","RNQOBMEKSX8US","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Painter, Painter, Painter, the biker that had me wincing each time he really stepped in it. This guy really needed some tough girl loving. I couldnt wait to pop open his story and see him fumble his way toward love. And not far in, it was indeed, a mess, but I had to see it through because I knew it would be worth it to see Painter and Mel get it all ironed out. But also, once again, spend time at the Armory with the Reapers as they once again took to the road for their brand of biker excitement.So yes, this is part of a series and I would definitely recommend getting them in order (though between us, I started at book two, shush). Painter and Mel were both strong secondary characters in the previous book and Painter has been around as a background character for a few back books.The story opens with a huge opening scene. No shocker it was a lulu! Painter is done and hes going after whats his, damn the torpedo and full speed ahead! Be still my knocking knees and knickers that man was a force of nature.But then the story stepped back a few years and started from the beginning setting up how it all evolved. It begins from the point Reapers Stand left off with Painter in jail after the big rescue and Melanie back home not understanding what all went down, but drawn to the guy who was good to her in her hour of need. Painter sees Melanie as that beautiful dream girl that if he wasnt so messed up that he could have, but he is a mess and so doesnt deserve her. He wants all the right things for her and so stays away when he gets out and comes home.Mel is not on the same page with Painter. In her mind, hes everything she wants. Okay, well beside that pesky association he has with his motorcycle club that she wants nothing doing. He would leave it all behind for love, right? And it hurts to see him look right through her when they meet for the first time when hes there with the other Reapers to help her and Jessica move into their own place. Loni is happy with Reese, but Jessica warns her as does her own instinct that the Reapers can do nice things, but they are hard, dangerous men. Then there is Em and Kit who bust onto her scene and drag her right into the middle of it all and where she secretly admits she wants to be even if Painter is ignoring her.Painter has to work hard to stay away from Mel, but he cant just let her go off with another biker while shes drunk and ignorant of the trouble she can get into. Trouble is Mel doesnt want his help; she wants him. He gives into the attraction even as danger is drawing tighter for the Reapers when a nearby club shows signs of problems that will affect them all. Painter goes on assignment with Gage to do some undercover recon and the signs dont half tell the real mess within the other club. Mel begs him to get out and away and be careful or hell go back to prison, but he has to stand by his brothers.Mel is devastated when events turn bad. They all tried to warn her and she wouldnt listen. Painter is not there in her time of need and he put his club first. What they had together is gone and now her life will never be the same. He wants back in, but there is no way. She will fight that with all her being. First her mother and then Painter. She will do fine on her own even if she cant get him out of her system.Alright! This was one rocky, emotional ride. This pair was enough to drive me to question my need for variety in romance because you know, nothing wrong with a light hearts and flowers read, Ha! And there isnt, but Ive come to enjoy this authors tough fought relationships that match the spirit of the setting and character types. And the pay off is so much more rewarding when things arent easily won.Some people sabotage their own happiness and that is this pair. Painter has a gift for screwing up a good thing, no doubt there, but Mel, now she is equally messed even if it doesnt seem that way at a casual glance. Painter let her down, but then she held it against him with a vengeance because Painter was paying an emotional bill that wasnt his. Mels mom left and it did things to her so when Painter, forgive him for reacting wildly to the shock Mel through at him, didnt immediately respond well to her surprise, she shut him down, but good. Then held everything even stuff out of his control against him as her anger armor. No forgiveness, no second chance! And Painter, he was so traumatized by his growing up years and his need for his club family that he wasnt in a place to see that he could have both Mel and his club. It was frustrating particularly in the latter half where I just wanted to wrench Mels denial glasses off and give her a swift kick in the direction of her own desires and happiness. Not to worry, Painter was man enough to set his own affairs in order and it was great to see when he emerged a man strong and steady and accepting that he was the guy for Mel. I feel I must warn potential readers: Patience is needed.Beyond, the stormy relationship between Painter and Mel, there was a solid, tense, and exciting action driven story. I wondered were the story thread would go after the big finale in the last one, but this story line is equally absorbing. Another MC is rotting at the core, may have ties to the drug cartel or even the FBI. The Reapers need to know because they share borders and business. So in go Gage and Painter to infiltrate. Just when I thought it was over and I could loosen up, wham! Loved that late inning twist that was quite the exciting climax to this story. But argh, there was loss, too.Now, there is that tantalizing bits of Gages story that was going on parallel to this one that will tease me until Gages book releases.On a side note, the author gave extras at the back that includes a prequel to this story and a teaser for the next. Yum!To sum it up, the romance in this one exhausted me, but was also so very good along with all the biker action making it unputdownable. Club life, drama, suspense, passion, action, and bikes on the open road are all bundled into these books. Those who enjoy biker romances and havent read this series really need to rectify that and for those looking to give this sub-genre a try, I can highly recommend the series. The biker action is on the mild to moderate end of the spectrum, but has the real feels for all that.My thanks to Penguin Group for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V4AE1RORB567/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SA5KFM0#wasThisHelpful","R3V4AE1RORB567","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A true Christmas gem for the Jane Austen Lover!  From its gorgeous presentation to the contents within, it was like the unwrapping of a much anticipated gift.The book is sectioned by a handful of years that highlight significant points in Jane Austen's life.  The focus is the Christmas season for each of these years.  Beyond this, the author fills in details of English daily life, Christmas traditions, social customs, recipes, descriptions, illustrations, and of course the details of Jane and her Austen family's life found in letters and research notes of Austen and Georgian Era experts.The strings of quotes might have been considered dry or even disconnected, but I found them insightful, informative, and most definitely entertaining.  I found it interesting which moments of Jane's life the author chose to highlight and also how his opinions leaned about these fascinating moments.  For instance, the first and second chapters placed a spotlight on Jane's cousin, Eliza.  And not just Eliza, but the situation with Henry and James Austen vying for her attentions.  I knew about Henry's interest of course seeing as how he married Eliza, but that was a surprise about James.  And it was fun to see the parallels made to Jane's infamous character, Lady Susan.For the most part, the details, but no less of interest.  I felt delightfully immersed in the Georgian Holiday Season and I treasured this time to spend it with the witty, vivacious Jane Austen.This would make a lovely gift for the Austen lover and I would definitely recommend it to serious Austenesque lover and those who are new to Jane Austen and wish to know her better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29DM3MI3QBJJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1604335912#wasThisHelpful","R29DM3MI3QBJJL","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just getting out of prison on parole right before Thanksgiving, Lacey Gallagher returns to her brother's home and the family Christmas tree farm ready to get her life back.  Too bad she encounters the man who arrested her and he's as disdainful of her as ever.Austin Wilder wasn't prepared to encounter the woman he arrested for transporting drugs and being a huge part of a drug ring.  She looks harder and wary, but she's also the only one he knows who can get the steam locomotive up and running in time for the Christmas charity activities to help get the donations for the camp for kids with special needs like his nephew.Working together, day in and day out takes some of the edge off their hostilities, but Lacey never wants to be dumb about men again and the best way is to keep her distance and Austin doesn't know what to believe now that he's getting to know Lacey.  In the meantime, Lacey's lawyer brings startling news and starts to raise her Christmas hopes.I saw the blurb and couldn't resist such a situation- an ex-con and her arresting officer?  Plus she works on trains!  How cool is that?  Plus it's Kat Latham and I enjoyed her rugby players so I had to give this Christmas story ago.The book is connected both to the Montana Born Christmas series and the London Legends stories through Austin's siblings' romance that chronologically happen before this story.  There is also a tie to a separate book that tells a parallel time line romance with Lacey's brother.  For all that, this is still a standalone.The story was a good blend of holiday cheer and hope with the reality of Lacey being an ex-con and Austin being directly involved in the investigation that put her away.  The author did a good job of writing a character who was convincing as having just spent time in prison and now must live with the consequences.  The story went by quickly, but the author still took her time developing a romance that starts as hostile at best.  There was also the shadows that Lacey's experiences cast over the relationship.  It was many of the little things that the author got right whether it was her response to touch, her near terror at seeing Austin in uniform, her appreciation for real coffee and private bathrooms, and even the struggle she has to connect with her very supportive brother.Now, the other thing was Lacey's physical reaction to Austin and his to her.  This pair were hot tamales once they got to a certain place.  Lacey is not a gentle, retiring sort.  She is a strong, lusty woman that works hard and is honest in her needs and wants.  Austin soon finds that what he thought he wanted was all wrong.  Lacey's it for him.  He gets hot seeing her covered in grease and sweat and wrestling train parts together or hauling a Christmas tree up over her shoulder and loading it for a customer just as he can't get enough of having her in his bed.  But while Lacey will take what Austin as to offer in bed, she struggles to get past the fact that he was there for all her worst moments- her arrest and her court hearing and sentencing, and she doesn't think he can see past all that either.The holiday element was woven in well.  There was the Christmas tree farm which was a festive setting, but also the preparations for the Christmas town to raise money for the special camp.  Lacey wants decorations and music around her to reminder her that she is free and Austin finds that he enjoys providing it all just to give that sense of freedom and peace to her.So, all in all, I thought this was a great Christmas romance involving an unusual circumstance and pair and would recommend it to readers who like snow-melting holiday contemporary romance.My thanks to Tule Publishing for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R133ZQ0HB40VEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0175N50IG#wasThisHelpful","R133ZQ0HB40VEJ","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was the title.  I freely admit that I was drawn in by the title.  It was so cute that I had to check out the blurb and the promise of Christmas in a Southern small town and the Cherry Cola book club hooked me.This was actually the fourth book in the series, but I didn't realize it when I snagged it.  I ended up figuring this out quickly as I started reading.  Thankfully, I had no problem getting into the story as there was enough explanations along the way.The story opens with Maura Beth and her new husband Jeremy returning from their honeymoon to discover that their little town of Cherico, Mississippi is in trouble.  The big cowboy boot factory has decided to locate nearer Nashville and that was the last big chance to keep people from moving away after jobs.  And with the people, so goes the small town businesses.  Practically the only good thing going is Maura Beth's new library.  And added to the loss of businesses, there is a theft at Periwinkle's restaurant and Maura Beth's library desk worker's husband now has Alzheimer's.  The mood of Cherico is low.It's up to Maura Beth and the Cherry Cola Book Club and a determined city council member to save the day.  With a little thought, home town generosity, luck, and hope, they bring together a Christmas gathering that no one will forget.Alright, so this was a gently-paced, sweet small town contemporary.  It's not deep or dramatic, but was a relaxing read.  The characters were long established.  Maura Beth is the lead and she is now fighting to help keep her friends' businesses in town, helping her friends at the restaurant with their thievery mystery, keeping an eye on a cunning city council member who has it in for her, compassionately helping her assistant through a family emergency, and chairing the quirky members of the book club all while adjusting to married life with her Jeremy.  There was a lot going on.  I enjoyed the engaging characters and all the story threads.  There is humor, sweetness, and sorrow along with a few romances.  There was a flavoring of Southern life and holiday festivity to it all.  The atmosphere of Cherico and the holiday spirit was definitely a strong point.I had a good time with this story and would definitely like to return for the early books as well as see the series continue.  Those who enjoy both women's fiction and small town contemporary romance should take a look.My thanks to Kensington Group for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSHJT4WACNQ7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617733431#wasThisHelpful","RSHJT4WACNQ7J","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And I thought the last one left me dizzy and breathless...This latest installment was like a shot out of cannon and never lost momentum.  It was the usually Cassie Palmer thrill ride that advanced the plot a few leaps between rough patches of fly by the seat of the pants and bad luck (because this heroine doesn't catch any good breaks).This is the seventh book in the Cassie Palmer series that not only should be read in order, but read within the world of all her books including the spin-off series and tweenie shorts and novellas if you can swing it.The book starts off right where the last one ended.  Cassie has teamed up with an unusual ally to go about getting back John Pritkin.  She's forced to drastic measures of leaps back in time, avoiding nearly everyone who wants something from her including the Silver Circle of Mages and the Vampire Senate.  She's responsible for a bedraggled Pythia Court, a few other unwanteds, and even her own bodyguards.  There's a huginormous list of people out to kill her and the top one is a god with powers of epic proportions.  Her daily check-list keeps growing by the second as she dashes about putting out fires.Cassie can't figure out how anyone thought she was capable to do what she is being nearly torn apart to accomplish.  Somehow she is making her way, but the ignorance and feelings of ineptitude are nearly crushing her.  If only the end of the world crises would give her a chance at a breather and if only she could pull everyone together to work for the common good against a common enemy.  But at the very least, she needs John Pritkin and it wouldn't hurt for Mircea to show her that she means more to him than having her status as Pythia on his side.Whew!  It's been a while so I had forgotten what these books are really like.  There are no calm waters and anything that looks like a break in the action is just a precursor to a change in the action.  While I find it exciting and a rush, gotta say that I'm not sure how much I can take without something big breaking soon. I felt like Cassie has spent the last few books chasing her tail and reading her frustration over her helplessness and feelings of failure between events stymied my enjoyment.  Yes, there has been forward progress, but there has been a lot of stalling out and rabbit trailing, too. I did resort to skimming a few times. The rabbit trails may or may not be significant later on as proven by past tie-ins that didn't seem important, but later were big so I'll give that some latitude- just a little though.The romance, well, um.  Still confusing with interesting things brewing for fans in both main camps at the moment.And that's about all I can say without giving too much away.  It's a tough book to breakdown because its a transitional one that is mostly doing the work of lining things up for something big in a later book although it's still full of fast, hard action.  It left me impatient and unsatisfied, but I'm still pronouncing it good stuff for the Urban Fantasy lover.  How's that for a confusing summation?I received this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39VHGH7K8N086/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGI91YS#wasThisHelpful","R39VHGH7K8N086","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seriously, I think with the next new release from this series, I'm just going to pick it up. The Deadly Ops series is officially in the auto-buy category. Tucker made my knees weak with his heroism and Karen is the gal I want to be when I grow up. And the story? Grabbed me from the beginning and I didn't put the book down unless five alarm life needs were going on.The book is the fourth book in the Deadly Ops series. It could be read as a standalone. The surrounding characters are recurring, but the plot, developments and romance are specific to this book.Everything starts when Tucker Pankof, DEA undercover agent, returns from his last op only to be targeted in his own home, learn that his boss and mentor has been murdered, his clearance within the DEA is revoked, and he is now considered a fugitive. He and the other members of his team are being set up to take the fall for a series of other astounding events like the bombings by a stolen drone and connections to a terrorist organization. Their only chance is to get his boss' best friend who is the deputy of NSA to believe them and help them. Tucker has a daring plan to accomplish this.Karen Stafford is a brilliant analyst for the NSA and up for a promotion that will put her in charge of a department. Out of the blue, she is kidnapped by a group of dangerous men. They give her their story and as scared as she is, the story rings true especially in light of another event going down. Her analytical mind sifts through the facts and her instinct is that they are being set up. Just as her instinct senses the attraction between her and Tucker. She cautiously agrees to contact her boss and Tucker agrees to come in. Before they can make it happen, their enemy discovers that Tucker and the others are alive and now are dangerous loose ends that have to be cut off. Karen is caught in the enemy's crosshairs, too.Things happen fast and Tucker has to keep them both alive long enough to talk with Buckley and help figure out who is behind the bombings and set ups. Betrayal will run deep. Karen's strength and resilience cause softer emotions to surface and he now is determined to protect her with his life if necessary.Alright, this one was off to the races without much set up and I was all onboard with that. The story divides not just between Tucker and Karen's POVs, but also the bad guys and other agents. Normally, I'm not keen on the villain's perspective particularly in a romantic suspense because it can give stuff away, but in this case, it heightened the tension. I loved the rock/hard place situation that Tucker was in and how he handled it. He was one guy with some serious skills and mojo. His team of guys weren't bad, either. Karen was a gal to ride the river with. She was scared, but always used her smarts. I enjoyed that the author didn't turn her into more than she was. She was an analyst with some field training, but she was comfortable in her role. I loved these two together. Boy howdy were they a quite the pair for some fast, hot, and dirty or some passionate loving when they had the time.""Karen, I..."" His fingers skated over her spine. ""You've been through a lot in the last twenty-four hours. I don't want you to do anything you'll regret later. I...can't take advantage of you,"" he muttered. His voice was tight and raspy. He let out a low curse before she felt the bed dip as he got up.Surprised, she turned over to find him striding out of the room in quick, hurried movements...When she heard the shower in the guest bathroom start, she cringed again- until his words registered.Words that had been in direct contrast to the signals she read in his face and body. He didn't want to take advantage of her? Fine, she'd take advantage of him.p.154-155 Karen and Tucker from Edge of DangerAll in all, this was thrilling, intense, and another powerful installment in the series. Romantic suspense lovers who like the covert types and lots of passion with their suspense should pick this one up.My thanks to Penguin Group for providing this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC14AA8ELWK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S75RXLY#wasThisHelpful","RC14AA8ELWK7","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The third book in the Desert Dogs series tackles the story of Casey Grossier and Abilene Price. Casey is the Prodigal who came home to help, but reluctantly. Abilene has been lost for a long time, but has found a home in the dusty 'end of the earth' desert town of Fortuity.Alright, so this is a story that I was ready for since Casey blew into town and had that tantalizing secret past and the strange dream connection to his mother. I wondered what would be the new direction of the series after the wrap up of the last book's murder mystery. Now I know and its another doozy that waits to show up in full until near the end. Whew boy is it a rough one and leaves me gasping for the next book. The books in this series feature a different Desert Dog each time, but the series arc does build on the ones before so I would highly recommend getting them in order.So this one starts out a few months after the last one with Abilene already had the baby and now is living out at the ranch with Miah's family to give her some protection when her angry ex gets out of prison and follows through on his threat that he is coming to see his baby. The dust is settling on the Casino plot, but there is still the developers after the ranch and Abilene's ex as potentially dangerous. The Desert Dogs have an uneasy peace particularly between Miah and Raina, but they come together to back Abilene. Abilene is on edge both because James will come after her because of his daughter, but also because he knows her secrets and they are not ones she wants her new friends to know. She has a new name, a new life, and a new chance, but its all built on lies. Then there is Casey. He thinks she's wonderful and she couldn't bear it to see him turn away in disgust if he knew the truth not that he's not harboring his own secrets and has made it clear that he doesn't do relationships.Casey feels absolutely twitchy because he's cutting free from the life he has been living for several years and putting down roots. Between worrying about having his mother's mental illness, trying to do right by Abilene, and setting up the bar and restaurant as co-owner with Duncan, he is maxed on responsibility and duty which he has avoided for years. Vince is proud of him as is Abilene, but they don't know just what he has done and the temptation to drop everything and go back to all that carefree living. He can't be what Abilene needs for long-term, but he will stand between her and her ex to protect her and the baby girl he knows deep down are more his than that man's.This one was an interesting blend of table setter for what comes next in the suspense and the current romance. Like the others, it has an earthy, gritty quality to its characters, plot, and setting. These people are raw, rough, but essentially good. The author has a gift for place. I've been in this part of Nevada and she has nailed it. She also has a gift for taking flawed people and getting them on a good path without it becoming some sort of hearts and rainbows affair. It was also interesting to see how the author did a few misdirects to keep things interesting. It's definitely a good series to not assume because people or situations are not always what you think. I enjoyed the startling reveals in that aspect. As to the romance, Casey and Abilene were not the stuff of romance particularly in their past lives, but maybe that's why they work. They both appreciate the dream of starting over with a new slate.I wasn't really a fan of their romance because I wasn't an Abilene fan. I felt she was a manipulator and talked the talk, but didn't walk it. She's busy insisting that she's going honest, but she lied to herself, to Casey, and well, to everyone. She stirred up a lot of people and made a certain person out to be a bad guy to cover her own butt. No respect for that stuff, Abs! Her little couch seduction scene didn't work for me either. Again, it smacked of manipulation and her getting high off controlling men instead of wanting to be with Casey and caring about him. Might not be perceived that way by others, but that's how it went down for me. Then she pulled this high road crap on Casey when he came clean while she was still hiding her dirty past. I knew this was where she would grow and finally change, but I guess I wasn't into her enough to care. I didn't hate her or their road to romance, but was more indifference than anything.I will say Casey and Abilene's baby girl was some sweet loving that I did adore. Big rough men gentling around babies and caring for them will melt me every time.The stuff stewing in the background out at the ranch between the worries over developers, the drug runners, and the shadowy visitor, and Miah's slow recovery from losing Raina were actually my favorite part. I also loved seeing the Desert Dogs come together for each other. That big scene near the end left me gulping back tears for another loss. Man, this group can't catch a break it seems. But it's all leading to something big in Miah's book. Can't wait!All in all, its still a captivating, rough and tumble passionate series. I'm not sure if its Contemporary Romance or Romantic Suspense, but I think those who like those genres when they get a little gritty and spicy might want to give these a go.My thanks to Penguin Group for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YMCDV5NC2Q7A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451476603#wasThisHelpful","R2YMCDV5NC2Q7A","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was primed and ready after reading Killian's story. I wanted more O'Brien family and happily got it with the start of a whole series about the rapscallion family of brothers and their sister. This is Curran's story. Curran has an irreverent mouth and he's a good cop, but something happens leaving him with a darkness in him and a loss of confidence. He is really floored when his hot one night stand from college turns out to be his brother's intern and Declan has Curran act as part of her protection as they handle a big case against the mob.This is book one of a new series and can be read just fine as such, but it is a spin-off series to Shattered Past and acts more as a continuation in my mind particularly as characters from books two and three make appearances in this one and refer back to shared events.The story opens when Curran is put on leave from his regular patrol after the shooting of a rookie cop he was mentoring. His brother, Declan, is an assistant DA and handling a high profile case against the mob. Declan has police protection and wants Curran to be part of the team put on his research assistant intern. Curran isn't happy, but has no choice. Things begin looking up when he sees that the buttoned up stick up her butt intern is none other than the wild girl in the bedroom back in college that he never forgot. He is amused by her standoffish behavior and blushing glances so he sets out to provoke her out from behind her pretenses and show that woman who tied him to the bed with her argyle socks and made love with wild abandon.Tess Newart has a goal to finish her law degree and hopefully snag one of the new assistant DA posts opening up. Just six months and she can escape the control of her abusive, but powerful and rich father. The man verbally and emotionally abuses her while controlling everything from how much food she eats, to what she wears, to whether she gets heat in the winter. She is not allowed to form her own relationships and doesn't even get a cell phone or car. She needs out. But now Curran bursts back into her life. He's tougher and there is a darkness to him, but he's strong and capable. She wants him more than ever, but knows she can't have him. Unfortunately, her resolve weakens as they spend so much time together while he guards her. Now she wants to help him get past what happened so he can heal and maybe in the meantime Curran, his big boisterous family, and the love blossoming can help her heal and find her way out from under her father's thumb.Like the Shattered Past series, this one runs deep, but the characters are adult instead of new adult range. The story is still told with first person perspective alternating narrative so it has the same feel. The author takes the time to make the setting of Philly, the O'Brien family, and the new situation really come alive. The local color is there, but not pounded over the reader's head.The plot is a combination that includes character development, romance, and a certain amount of suspense. They are interlocking and never over-balance each other so that it works as a whole bit of storytelling and not shifting from element to element.As to the characters, their flaws and strengths, and their situations, this is where the book shines. The camaraderie of family is strong and I love that it is since the series theme is the O'Brien family. They all went different directions with their lives, but they are still all connected. This is Curran's story, but Declan, Killian, Finny, and Wren are right there in the background as are his brothers and sisters in blue. Curran is a loud, obnoxious, over the top type that makes me grin because for this bluff Irishman, it works. He is rough and so blue-collar that nobody can see him with a girl like Tess, but when they are together, it really works. He wants to be tough and not admit he needs help for his PTSD, but he finally goes because he wants to be whole again and have Tess' proud of him and love him.At first, I was not impressed with Tess. At. all. She was such a timid mouse, but also a little snobby, too, at first. I was aware that she grew up with a controlling father who still worked his fiendish power over her. But as the story progressed, I was able to slip more and more into an understanding of just what it is like for a person who is abused with such finesse, if I can put it that way for how that beast worked her over. She was broken down and re-made, never being allowed to get away from it so that she drank the Kool-Aid. She doesn't have the skills or the self-confidence to strike out on her own even as an adult though even if she did, her father had contingency plans to keep her in place. It angered me enough to feel homicidal by the time things really hit the high point in this book. I credit the author with the deft way she changed my feelings about the heroine.So put it altogether and I was most definitely as pleased as could be with this new spin-off series start. Curran is a hot O'Brien brother and I loved to see the beginning of Declan's thread. Can't wait for more. Those who enjoy blue collar passion-filled deeply emotional contemporary romance need to give these a try. Start with Shattered Past series if you can.My thanks to Loveswept for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21CG6GS65HL8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TCI48WW#wasThisHelpful","R21CG6GS65HL8U","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This story sounded so poignant and heartwarming that I easily snatched it up for one of my holiday reads.  One man is living on borrowed time and another doesn't see the precious nature of his own time until they are stranded together in a blizzard.Trevor is an artist and a man who has learned to appreciate the zest of life now that his own life may be coming to a close.  He needs a kidney transplant and has waited for years.  Now, he is down to his final opportunity and the doctor has briefed him on his choices of trying to stretch it out with dialysis or going off dialysis to make it quicker.  So, when he can't get a flight out to his family and is given the opportunity to be with a man who is the first ever to light up his life, he takes it.  But it is just for the here and now.Marc is a successful lawyer and lives for his work.  In fact, that's all he has because his family put him aside when he came out and he can keep a relationship with his hours.  His assistant finally tells him that enough is enough.  Go and live a little.  A blizzard that strands him in a hotel gives him just such an opportunity.  He meets Trevor and the connection is instantaneous.  In fact, he opens up to Trevor like he has never done only to have Trevor pull back and insist that whatever they have can only be for Christmas.  Trevor lights up his home and brings Christmas to his house for the first time.  He makes Marc want to try at life.  Marc will never be the same.  How can he let this man walk out of his life?This was a story that grabs the emotions from the beginning knowing that Trevor may not live and Marc has never started living.  I was cheering for these guys with all my being before they even met up.  The story is a shorter length, but the author introduces engaging characters, a strong holiday setting, and a plot that is very much emotion and character driven.The romance is a love at first sight, but I tend to be more forgiving of that in my holiday stories.  There is a lot of sugar, but it is tempered by the hot spicy times between these two.  They both really come to life together and it was beautiful to read.All in all, I enjoyed this one for a quick afternoon read.  I can easily recommend it to those looking for feel-good m/m contemporary holiday romances.I received this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUWBJC3QFV9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017GHTD3Y#wasThisHelpful","RUWBJC3QFV9C","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Its fall and I was in the mood for a paranormal read, but also something Austenesque so I took up this follow up story that blends Pride & Prejudice with werewolves.The paranormal element is not dark and gritty at all and is rather gentle as werewolf stories go.  This story is meant to catch up with where the Darcys are at now after Elizabeth adjusted to the momentous reveal that the man she loves is lupine once a month.The story sets up for some nice conflict with the strange story of the Ghost Buck in Pemberley's woods drawing attention right where it is dangerous to have it for the Master of Pemberley.  It also provides more conflict when Lizzy's rival will not be leaving for Devon as thought, but would be staying in Darcy's pack.  Also, an unstable French wolf would be joining them, too.Many aspects of the story were engaging including the hilarious inclusion of updates on Lord Antony staying with Lady Catherine.  I would have given much to have read a few of those scenes first hand.  Whew, the fireworks over Rosings that would cause.It was a mild story and lots of reflection was done by Darcy and Lizzy.  I would have preferred more dialogue and action, but there were some direct conflict scenes near the end that pulled the reader in close.  It was a bummer that the story ended shy of Lady Helen's gala.  With the way she and Lizzy rub each other wrong, I find it amusing when they are in scenes together.Then there is Lizzy and Darcy.  So many tender and passionate scenes showing their going strong.  Had to laugh when Darcy told her to stay indoors for her safety and she blithely blows through that rule the second she feels his safety is in jeopardy.  What a small unarmed woman was going to do to protect a werewolf I'm not sure, but protect him she would.It was fun to return to a nice mash up story that could count for one of my spooky reads.  The story would work out of order, but I really think readers would get more out of it reading it after the first book.  Sweet, light paranormal follow-up romance for the Austenesque lover.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X1EA4F3H17K0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A9LG360#wasThisHelpful","R1X1EA4F3H17K0","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've enjoyed this author's books in the past and it has been some time since I picked one up.  I couldn't resist the heady combo of historical mystery, sequel to Pride & Prejudice, and a favorite fictional secondary character in Colonel Fitzwilliam.I didn't realize, but probably should have since I knew about them that this one is connected to a few previous books by the author.  I had not read all of them so had a few moments of wishing I had the backstory as a result.  I would suggest reading it after Christmas at Pemberley, The Disappearance of Georgiana Darcy, and The Death of Mr. Darcy.The book begins when Georgiana Fitzwilliam sends for her brother, Fitzwilliam Darcy, because her husband General Fitzwilliam has disappeared.  Darcy brings along his family to first comfort Georgiana before heading to London to search out her erstwhile husband who left and doesn't want to be found.Darcy is hurt, angry, and left confused as to Fitzwilliam's actions.  He thought he understood the cost of war on his cousin, but learns the man did not heal through his return to peace and marriage.  With the help of others, Darcy is able to track down his cousin in a deplorable condition only to learn that the state of affairs is much worse than he imagined.  Fitzwilliam's unwillingness to cooperate are the least of it because now the man stands accused of brutal multiple murders.  Time is running out in the shadow of the hangman's noose.First and foremost, this is good storytelling and a cunning historical mystery.  I enjoyed the attention to historic detail when it came to the art of detection, the state of criminal law, and the situation of men come back from the war.  The mystery had complexity and the least of which was the ensuing courtroom drama.Of secondary interest for me were the connections to the Pride & Prejudice characters.  Shocking, I know, to admit that.  Darcy, Lizzy, and Georgie are always fun to read about and they were in this one, but their ongoing story was swallowed up in something else for me.I read a lot of military romance including historical and contemporary so I tend to be very tender-hearted about the wounded warriors.  This was the dynamic that was more compelling- Fitzwilliam's disconnect with family, their perception of him and his situation, and his own perception of all that even as something new must emerge from all this for the family.In this story, I found it a difficult thing to watch Fitzwilliam's family's anger, blame, and disappointment that he succumbed to the darkness inside him.  Darcy had him on a pedestal as did the rest of his family as a 'war hero' and they had to come to terms with him being a  mere man.  Broke my heart to watch.  The flip-side was Fitzwilliam's own acceptance with his new reality which was even more painful.  I felt the author treated this all so well.The original characters like the professional detective that was the family friend and even Anne's husband were a great inclusion.  I think I could read a whole series of books about the detective and his cases.The multiple bits of excitement near the end were the icing on the cake.  The drama and danger were just the right amounts.  I thought I had this one figured out and learned that I only had about half of it right.All in all, this was an engaging book both in the suspense and the character driven plot.  I heartily recommend it to Austenesque lovers and lovers of historical mysteries.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11J5H5N05RQJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YTETDLA#wasThisHelpful","R11J5H5N05RQJC","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This author has been on my radar for so long and I've wanted to read her books and just somehow never did.  Finally, the perfect storm of opportunity with this re-release, blurb, setting, and mood made it possible.  I got two delightful surprises nearly from the beginning.First, I didn't realize what this author's writing style would be and soon discovered that I felt like I could have been reading one of several of my favorites.  I had to chuckle when I saw in the description afterward that the author is even compared to other favorites of mine like Mary Stewart or Diana Gabaldon.  Sometimes, comparisons are far off the mark for me, but in truth, this one would be an accurate assessment for me.My second surprise was time period.  I wasn't expecting the holiday season, but I got Christmas in a small Welsh village near Pembroke.  The tradition of decorating, caroling, Christmas services in the little country church, parties, shopping and presents were fun and as vibrant as the characters and story.So no surprise that I found this, my first outing with the author, was a splendid read and I am definitely going back for more of her stuff.This was an atmospheric romantic suspense with mild magical element to it with the emphasis not so much on romance as a tension that leads to romance.  The story is a slow build and slow burn affair that gently works its way to the startling climax at the end.  It was like watching an approaching storm that starts out as distant building clouds and pressure that slowly form and approach.  You can see it and feel it coming, but it takes a while.  I enjoyed that sensation.This was a modern story that began when Lyn Ravenshaw, literary agent, is coerced into a Christmas holiday in the Welsh countryside to act as wingman and distraction for her prize author.  Whatever Bridget wants and all that.  Lyn sees Bridget clearly and doesn't mind being used since it gets her invited into the home of an author she respects and the chance to meet a reclusive playwright whose way with words enchanted her.  Bridget has author James Swift dangling after her, but it is untouchable and withdrawn Gareth she wants.  Lyn can't see the appeal in the insufferable Gareth, but finds it all rather entertaining at first to watch Bridget and the men buzzing around her.Castle Farm is a lovely old quirky place and the village is typical of most, but Lyn senses underlying tension between the people of Castle Farm and then there are her own nightmarish dreams that have taken on new aspects.  Uneasiness becomes outright concern when events of the distant past start to parallel events of the present.  Is the young widow next door crazy with her talk of dragons and Merlin or is something much more concrete and sinister going on?  Will the encounter with these people break Lyn who has suffered guilt and grief or will it be her road to healing?Now, I did enjoy this book and definitely want more from the author.  I loved the atmosphere and over all mastery of storytelling I had in this book.  I did get the sense that the author could have made it even better which I know conflicts with what I just said.  The difference between good and great, if you will.The ties to the dream world were confusing and a muddle that never quite gets fully explained especially since there are ties to Merlin and Arthur legends and later Owen who led the Welsh rebellion and still later with early Tudor ties.  It was all mashed together and distracting.I also felt that the suspense element could have been teased out better.  The waiting and watching were superb, but I felt there were missed opportunities for the villains to be more hands on and stir things up more by being more present than they were.The drawing of the characters and then weaving them into the plot was really good.  Even without the mystical dreams and the suspense, just reading about the people was extremely diverting.  Bridget was a scene stealer.  She cracked me up.  She is so unapologetic and willful, but also possesses compassion.  James is her counterpart in ways though he is more cerebral and less intuitive.  Christopher is a modern rogue.  Owen was salt of the earth.  Elen is waifish and ethereal.And then there are Gareth and Lyn.  He is a craggy man with an old soul who is hard to know and not one that invites closeness and warmth.  Lyn is the outsider and looks on, cold and lonely as the others move around her.  Her grief and guilt has insulated her against engaging with folk and I loved seeing that change when the village of Angle, Castle Farm, and Gareth start to batter away at her walls.  I wanted a bit more in the end, but things were left in a good happy for now spot.All in all, I would dive into this author's books just to get more of the atmosphere and tension, let alone the compelling characters.  I would recommend this to folk who enjoy the more classical style romantic suspense.My thanks to Sourcebooks Landmark for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E38SN9V1IDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140225864X#wasThisHelpful","R3E38SN9V1IDY","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love it when authors employ humor in their storytelling, but it can be a chancy thing for the humor element to set well with me.  But I wanted to finally read one of this author's books, I love P&P retellings, and I most definitely wanted to read a book chalk full of role-reversals.  Heh, yeah, that last part was tantalizing.  Think of every one of Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice characters, add in a few more original characters for good measure, now switch their gender.  Yep, see?  Couldn't miss it!I was prepared to have a good time and do some giggling and snorting- and I certainly did that many times, but I found it a pleasant surprise how much this book engaged me to really consider things in a way that I hadn't before.  It held a mirror up for me to see how I associate things with gender.  I had to ask myself questions like did it make a difference if the one doing/saying/thinking something was a woman or a man?  And yes it did, I found.  Just like I responded differently and engaged in the story differently when the roles were reversed.  I found Elizabeth Darcy's first scene at the ball to be more abrasive than I ever did Mr. Darcy's.  And an indolent Mrs. Bennet with a nervy Mr. B was an unsettling swap.  It was refreshing to ponder this though it truly is a story and meant to be appreciated as such.Now while some swaps made me thoughtful or mildly uncomfortable.  Most of them had me highly amused.  A Miss Wickham, a Sir Lew deBourgh, a Miss Collins, the youngest two Bennet boys, and a Mr. C. Bingley was a hoot.  Villains are villains no matter what as are snobs, silly folk, and those focused on themselves.I liked how the author balanced out keeping things close to the original, but also explored a few new avenues with the freedom from the characters swapping from male to female or the reverse.I can see where this wouldn't be for everyone whether it was the style of humor or the gender swapping, but I had a good time with it.  Austenesque Lovers who want something a bit different should take a look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPEJXUBEIKFUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936009315#wasThisHelpful","RPEJXUBEIKFUX","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had no expectations that the author would return to Criminy and Tish's story and the Criminy's circus where this whole delightful series got started.  Bravo, Ms. Dawson!  I didn't realize how badly I wanted it until it was suddenly a possibility so I snatched it up and devoured it like the sweetest, most sinful morsel.The story is indeed a follow-up book focused on Crim and Tish, but it also was a reunion story that brought together everyone from all the previous books and novellas.  It felt like coming home when I returned to the world of Sang and I absolutely recommend getting these in order.The story opens with Tish facing down a decision that she does not want to make.  The witch's curse has literally sucked the life out of her and continues to do so, but she won't let Criminy take the last of her humanity and Blud her.  She says it is because of her dear gran back in the earth world, but deep down it is fear of the final, irrevocable change.  She is abrupt and stormy, but Criminy is there beside her even when she leaps at the new idea of bringing her gran across and letting Criminy blud her to save her from dying.  Criminy is reluctant, but does it for Tish.Tish soon finds that her young, youthful gran who insists on being called Ruby is nothing like she expected.  Ruby is flamboyant and daring and dismissive of Tish.  Then she is gone from the circus.  Criminy advises Tish to let Ruby go, but she can't.  So off they go on a dangerous adventure to find Ruby who has gone in search of a powerful dark witch.  In the end, Tish is forced to face her fears and not just a few facts and may lose that which is most important to her.Alright, being reunited with Criminy, Tish, and the rest of the gang in Sang was an absolute treat beyond measure.  The worldbuilding was just as colorful, unsettling, dangerous, and exciting as ever.  The tone was so well-done the way I had no trouble feeling like I was visiting a bizarre new place.There was lots of familiar settings and characters, but I loved that the adventure took me into a new situation of 'what happens after happily ever after' for people like Criminy and Tish.  Tish is stubborn and impulsive and Criminy is devilishly attractive in that foreign macabre way of his.  The story cements them as a couple through thick and thin.  I loved that they got so much page time together.  And the adventure was not easy nor was it loss, but it kept my attention riveted to the very end.  I probably should have detested Ruby, but I found her a most interesting character that made a scene absolutely crackle with tension.  I had no trouble seeing the situation in a way that the heroine, Tish could not and didn't until near the end with Criminy's help.The adventure was dark and gritty like it can get in the Blud series.  The author isn't afraid to let the monsters in this world whether they are good or bad or a bit of both out.  The blend of fantasy, paranormal, and steampunk is done well.  By this story, most of it goes unexplained and is just assumed which was fun in its familiar feel.The romance is an ongoing relationship, but it never felt staid or settled.  Criminy is as larger than life, passionate, and dangerous as ever and has no trouble getting Tish out of her head and off her worries.  He worries for her in this story and it was sweet to see him expose that vulnerability to Tish.  It was a nice blend of scorching passion and tender romance.All in all, this last book of the Blud series was all that a last book should be.  Do I still want more visits to Sang?  You bet!  But if I have to say good-bye then this farewell was done well.  I would recommend this series to those who enjoy a bit of macabre, some grit, and some passion in a blending of paranormal and steampunk in a fantasy world.My thanks to Net Galley for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PM1WLHJ8EVTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WRBQP0O#wasThisHelpful","R2PM1WLHJ8EVTB","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ah, guilt can really do a number on a guy especially when he is a tender-hearted, responsible, hard-working Georgia cowboy. He really needed the sassy Jersey girl reporter who came along wanting a story about his horses and in the meantime found a whole lot more than she was looking for in small town Chatham Ridge, the Southern Belles Book Club, Aunt Barbara Jean, and a stubborn hurting man.This gentle, heartwarming story just hit the spot right at the moment I needed something easy going. I've enjoyed this author's books before. She has a knack for mixing light-hearted secondary characters, warm scenes, and characters who need to heal.This is the first book in the series, but I was introduced to it previously in a crossover novella in the anthology that came out just prior. I love small town romance so it was an easy grab.The story opens with Elizabeth Palmer arriving in Chatham Ridge to do a story for a magazine on the recent success of a local quarter horse ranch. It is her first writing job and she is a nervous wreck about succeeding after she chucked her accounting job to follow her dream. This is her first time doing something daring. Her mother was always a dreamer and one to chase such things and Elizabeth paid the price when there was never any stability in her life. Determined never to be like her mother, nonetheless, she was stifling in her old job and feeling a bit bruised when her ex left her for the gal upstairs in their apartment building. The change of scenery and new chance comes with her first encounter with Hunter McCoy. Her prospects aren't looking good when he announces that he has no intention of doing the interview and it was his aunt who set it up. He has a horse ranch to run and wants no reporter tagging along at his heels.Hunter has been hurting and heartbroken for the last two years. His fiancee' is dead and it was his fault. Her angry, hurting father doesn't blame him more than he blames himself. Now, all he lives for is his horses and his ranch. His dad's gambling habits almost ruined it all, but Hunter is determined to bring it back to its former glory. What he doesn't need is some bubbly, sassy woman from Jersey making him feel things he doesn't want to feel. She may only be there to do a piece on the ranch, but she sees more than she should. He is torn between wanting her around for the light and laughter she brings to his life and getting rid of her before she gets past his emotional guard.In the meantime, Hunter's sister, Amberlee, works to prove to everyone that she is quite grown up, his Aunt Barbara Jean has a chance at a late romance if she has the courage to go for it, and Elizabeth learns from the McCoys and the ladies of the Southern Belle Book Club what home and family really mean.As I said, this was a gently-paced story. The plot isn't deep or tangly, but the conflict is there for two people who are trapped by their separate pasts. The pace was slow, but not boring. I loved all the additional details about the ranch, the daily life of the McCoys, and the fun inclusion of the book club ladies. The atmosphere is downhome cozy.The characters were developed and had a strong backstory that played a part in the present. It is obvious to the reader what the real barriers are, but the hero and heroine are mired in their issues and struggle. Hunter is a good guy buried under pain and guilt which makes him cranky whenever anyone threatens to break through the wall he has put up. Elizabeth is a nice gal who is very busy trying to deny part of who she is out of fear that she will become her mother. I enjoyed seeing them grow internally away from their issues while building a tentative relationship.""..You'll meet the girls, you'll have fun, you'll get away from Mr. Grumpyface-""The backdoor opened and Hunter walked in, as if conjured up merely by the conversation. He doffed his hat and cast an amused glace at his sister. ""Did you just call me Grumpyface?""""You're my brother. I can call you anything I want...And if you don't start being nice to Elizabeth here,"" Amberlee said, ""I'm going to call you far worse things.""""You have been talking to our aunt. And she has been filling your head with all kinds of nonsense. I'm nice to Miz Palmer, aren't I?"" He raised his gaze to Elizabeth's.It was as if someone turned on an electric generator. When the two of them looked at each other, there was a hum in the air...P. 113-114 Amberlee, Hunter, and Elizabeth from When Somebody Loves YouAs to the romance, this was oh so carefully progressed forward as they first became friendly and started to open up and trust. They had the heat of attraction there all along that they denied and gave into in turn. I confess to getting a little impatient with the back and forth, but it made sense for what was going on with them personally. The expiration date on Elizabeth's stay is what finally forces the issue for the pair of them.I loved the setting. I had no idea there were quarter horse breeding and training centers in Georgia since I always pictured that breed as a western ranch horse. But hey, why not. I've always enjoyed stories involving horses and those who handle them.The kitchen at that ranch with Aunt Barbara Jean's cooking was my favorite place in the book, but the cozy reading area at Noralee's bookshop ran it a close second. I really want some of her cheesy jalapeno corn bread and chili and I wouldn't say no to her other dishes, either. There is food on every other page of this one between Barbara Jean and Noralee down at the bookstore with her baked goods.Had to slip this one in:Charlotte sat back in her seat. ""Well damn. I really thought we had something juicy to discuss tonight.""""We do. Their called books."" Suzie held one aloft, a romance novel featuring a bare-chested man wearing dog tags. ""We can talk about men afterward. Books before brawn, remember?""Amberlee sighed. ""One of these days we'll have the books with the brawn.""""Sexy men to read to us. Now that's a club I'll join!"" Charlotte laughed.""That, my dear, would be a whole other kind of bookstore."" Noralee laid the last platter of desserts on the table and took the lone empty seat. ""So shall we get started?""p. 126 Charlotte, Suzie, Amberlee, and Noralee of When Somebody Loves YouAll in all, this was a cozy, satisfying contemporary romance. I look forward to visiting with the Southern Belles Book Club girls again and again. Those who like slightly spice small town romance should give this one a try.My thanks to Penguin Group for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAO6ZSUOW5FPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425279375#wasThisHelpful","RAO6ZSUOW5FPH","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So a PR gal in tight pencil skirt and high spiked heels sets out to corral a boxing team of alpha Marine boxers while fending off a smarmy reporter, and trying to figure out who is sabotaging the team and why. But the all business gal finds a certain devil may care Marine has plans for her sexy heels and long, long legs and his plans are the opposite of strictly business.This is the second book in the First to Fight series that continues the story of Brad Costa and Marianne while shifting the spotlight to another pair of lovers. The books build on each other though in a pinch I suppose they could be read as standalones.Greg Higgs didn't feel that strongly about joining the team and planned to treat this time as some fun before he went back to regular duty. But somewhere along the way, he started caring and taking an interest. Part of his interest is in the cute PR gal who wears those starched up suits, high heels, and tight buns that leave him having sexy fantasies of unleashing Reagan's wild side. He slowly works on her all-business attitude even while holding back all the things he keeps tucked away about his past from her curious questions.""I don't want to mess this up. I wasn't sure if I even wanted to be on the team, but now I am. And I wasn't sure I wanted to tangle with a woman, but I do. And I wasn't sure I wanted that woman to be you, but she is, and I'm glad, but it's ...terrifying.""p. 137 Greg from Against the RopesReagan Robilard needs to make this job a success to prove to her disbelieving family back home that she could make something of herself and to prove that to herself. She's fresh out of college and got the job on gumption, but now she has to prove that she can do it. She feels the pressure mount as the saboteur continues to wreck havoc, a newspaperman is treating the series of vandalism attacks as his ticket to stardom, and a certain Marine pushes her to let her hair down and have fun even while she knows he is holding something back.Greg needs to find a way to open up to Reagan or he'll lose her and Reagan needs to figure out how to fight to hold her job.Alright, so I enjoyed this book for the most part. I liked the characters. They bantered and circled around each other and it was a slow developing romance.It was wrong, and she shouldn't press, but she had to know. ""Why did you stop (kissing)?""His smile was slow, and it sent alarm bells ringing in her head, but she wasn't quite sure which ones.The alarm that said 'Run now'! or, the one that said, 'Suppers on, come and get it!'""You were expecting it.""""I...okay."" She crossed her arms over her chest and leaned back against the door. ""So what if I was?""""When I kiss you the first time, its not going to be expected. And its not going to feel the way you 'think' you should feel.""Reagan turned that over in her head for a moment as she got in the car. She let it marinate while he drove them out of the parking lot, and half the way home.""How do you know what I think I should feel?""""Legs,"" he said without taking his eyes off the road, ""You've got TTBP all over you.""""I'm almost afraid to ask...but TTBP?""He grinned, his face illuminated in the headlights of a passing truck. ""Trying to be Professional. You play the starched up business lady during the day, and you tried to bring her out tonight. But you've got a wild streak that you're trying to keep hidden for some reason or another. When you're ready to let that loose, then we'll see.""p. 57-58 Greg and Reagan from Against the RopesI also enjoyed the other relationships weaving through it. Like Brad and Marianne are still very present as are the intriguing possibility of Graham and Kara. There is also the ongoing issue of the sabotage though I've got a pretty good idea of who it is and its driving me nuts that it's still not resolved. Hopefully in book three? And who wouldn't enjoy hard-bodied athletic Marine's doing gym work or that one wet boxer line up? Whew, be still my heart, people!But...Yeah, there's a but though not a huge one. For all that, I spent long periods of this book struggling to engage. I wasn't in hate with the story or even dislike; it was more like indifference until things got rolling with the conflict and tension of the latter half. And, I really would have liked more on the boxing front. The one time Greg boxes it is from Reagan's perspective and she ducks out in the middle of his bout.Beyond the romance of Greg and Reagan, I found the author's inclusion of scenes where they both spend time with their friends particularly Greg with the other guys or when the whole gang gets together was a plus. I'm generally into romances that are told within a larger story rather than in isolation. Some threads are left open-ended so I'm eager to pick up the next book to see where they lead.So, despite the fact that it took a bit for this story to get going for me, I still had a good time. The witty banter, the humor, the everyday folk, the tender slow burn romances, and that pesky sabotage situation all come together for a satisfying read. Though this one is about Marine boxers, I would categorize it more as a sport romance than a military one with the romance being a blend of spicy and sweet. I would definitely recommend the series for those who enjoy slow developing Contemporary Romance.My thanks to Penguin Group for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10Z48J6KSWRWW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425279278#wasThisHelpful","R10Z48J6KSWRWW","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I returned to the world of Wicked Lovers after a long drought and was eager to engage with this latest story. I was relieved that even though I've missed several of the latest releases; I was still able to read the story quite easily. That said, I do need to get caught up.The story opens with Mystery Mullins, daughter of the famous Hollywood director and star Marshall Mullins, back in America for the first time in six years after her kidnapping and rescue. She can't seem to get over the man who rescued her and rejected her eager young love. Oh, she gets why he had to back then, but unfortunately Axel ruined her for other men. But that's about to change hopefully. Mystery has a plan. She will go to him in disguise, proposition him so he will accept, and then she'll discover that he's just a man and get him out of her system.Axel doesn't know what to make of the woman who inexplicably came on to him at his favorite bar, but she is definitely more than she is saying and there is something familiar about her. She's a hot woman and her submissive nature calls to his dominance. He wants her not to mention she engages his curiosity to discover what she is hiding. Then, he discovers the truth of who it was who slept with him and ran. Mystery Mullins! Unfortunately, once again, she is back in danger and his protective instincts kick in. He will help protect her, but they are going to deal with the Pandora's Box she opened and she'll learn better the kind of man she thought to manipulate.Alright, this one grabbed my interest from the beginning, but I hesitated when I read part of the blurb. The woman has the not so brilliant plan to scratch an annoying six year old itch and move on with the guy in question none the wiser because she's in disguise. She claims it is to get him out of her system, but it felt like a spoiled girl not getting her way back then and now determined to have it. Axel did the right thing about not taking up her provoking offer because she was the wrong side of twenty and had just gotten out of a situation with a sleazy captor. But in the end, I liked this author's books before and wanted to try her new one, so I did.Part of me was glad to have read the story because there were some elements that really engaged me, but the part that made me hesitate turned out to be an issue for me.When it comes to BDSM stories, I need those engaged in it to be mature characters or at least characters of the same maturity. They are engaging in acts that expose a whole lot more than their physical bodies and the trust and communication factors have to be there or someone's going to get hurt possibly physically, psychologically, and/or emotionally.I brought that up because the heroine left me feeling like she was too young. Her actual age might be mid-twenties, but her cognitive and emotional processes said different. There is of course her half-baked plan to which I referred earlier that didn't bother to consider the fact that she was in essence using a guy who not only put his life on the line for her, but respected her enough not to take advantage of what her naive young hormones were offering up back in the day. Then there is the way she impulsively jumps into action or leaps to conclusions on several occasions. She consults only her own feelings much of the time. I didn't hate her, but with how quickly things got down to it with the sex and romance, with the dangerous situation from her past, and with the way Axel was portrayed as a mature, stable, thinking guy, she didn't work for me as a romance interest in a BDSM erotic romance.She backed into the chair and crossed her arms over her chest. ""What?""""I'm trying to have a conversation with you, face-to-face, the way adults do. You're making that damn hard when you're pouting.""""Well excuse the hell out of me for being shocked that you could (have sex) with me twice in the last few hours, then look awfully comfortable with another woman in your lap. Do you know how stupid that made me feel? How manipulated and used?""""And you didn't use me when you picked me up in the bar to scratch your itch? By your own admission, you had zero intention of coming clean with me about your identity or talking to me again.""""We discussed this. I never meant to hurt you. I apologized.""""But I genuinely listened and tried to see your side of the story. Could you extend me the same courtesy?""His question pricked her with guilt. He had listened. She just kept butting in and sounding like a jealous shrew. ""Fine. I'm all ears. What's with you two?""p. 236 Mystery and Axel from Wicked for YouBut past that, I was riveted for the portion of the book that flashed back to that time six years before when Mystery was kidnapped and Axel came to her rescue. It got intense and visceral as they fought to survive in the desert and fought off their enemies. If things could have picked up from there with Mystery being older and wiser and ready for a dominant man like Axel, I probably would have been praising this book to the heavens. As it is, its still pretty good.The suspense element was the driving agent for much of the plot, but it stayed in the background until near the end. The 'who' question had me pointing fingers in a few directions before I finally got it right. I enjoyed wondering who was behind it all, but I had a pretty good idea at why from early on. I was partially right because, naturally, there was a twist.The passion between Axel and Mystery took up a large portion of the book. I had to set aside the fact that in reality things happened way too darn fast so I enjoy the sizzling heat between this pair. Mystery soon discovers that she bit off quite a bite when she took on Axel. He's not just a real man as she calls him, but Axel is dominant. He sees her natural submissive tendencies and wants to help her explore that, but he has to deal with the crap going on in her head much of the time so their time together is either lust driven or he has to help her sort through her fears even though she promises to be honest and trust him. The BDSM elements are mild for the most part and involve bondage, spanking, and a few pervertables like clothespins and an interesting use of a cutting board and rice.He enjoyed her urgency and the closeness of the moment. Someday, he'd make love to Mystery softly and let her touch him at will. Today wasn't that day. Everything inside screamed not only to dominate, but to claim her, to bind her to him with pleasure. Because he still didn't know if she would truly want him when the real world came calling again...But maybe, if he gave Mystery more pleasure than she could manage, when the dust settled with whoever pursued her, none of that would matter.p. 182-183 Axel from Wicked For YouIn summary, it had some strengths that were really enjoyable and some things that took away from that. I found the author's exploration of the repercussion of cheating on a marriage and family and walking away on a marriage and family had far reaching effect especially on the children. The blend of erotic romance and suspense was a nice balance and I have definitely whetted my appetite for more books from this series. Those who enjoy the blend of mild to moderate BDSM and suspense should try this book/series.My thanks to Penguin Group for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9F1FQ2CBHX10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI026Y2#wasThisHelpful","R9F1FQ2CBHX10","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the first book, my favorite character was Rev Malloy. I was glad to discover that he would be the hero in the very next book. Happily, Rev continued to be an engaging character and even more so when the author revealed so much more about him and turned him into a veritable knight on shining Harley.This second installment would work as a standalone in a pinch, but the reader would see obvious connections to the first book a few different times in the story as the first book's characters are very present.Rev along with Bishop get a call for help that is personal to him and the Raider brother who calls him. Breakneck's daughter was kidnapped by a rival club in Texas who abducts young women and sells them to a Mexican human trafficker across the border. Their rescue operation is moderately successful and Rev ends up saving Annabel Percy, a powerful Senator's daughter, during the raid of Mendoza's compound.Annabel was taken two months before and sold to Mendoza who runs the sex slave trade for American girls. Her hopes slowly withered and died and then just after Mendoza beat her within an inch of her life, she is rescued by a hard-bitten biker. Rev becomes her life line. She is overwhelmed with feelings of self-loathing and a desire to give up and she feels like it would have been better to die. Rev says he understands and she lashes out in anger until she hears his story and learns that he really and truly does understand as most others cannot.They open up to each other and develop trust. Annabel slowly heals in the safe and warm arms of the Raiders MC, Rev's family, and with Rev. However, both think they are unworthy of each other and meanwhile, Mendoza plots revenge.There were aspects of book one that really didn't work for me, but I decided to give book two a chance especially since it was Rev's book. I have to say that some of the stuff that bugged me- mostly to do with the previous heroine- are not present in this one. Annabel was raped and endured so much that her road to recovery is naturally tenuous and hard. She is a whole different personality and as such this book was a much more engaging read for me.As to Rev, while I don't think he was the stuff of which typical fictional MC Presidents are made in that he didn't have that assertive alpha quality, he did have a quiet commanding presence that people respect and listen to. His brother, Deacon, from the first book and the current MC Vice President was more that personality as is his younger brother Bishop, but in retrospect, I'm not disappointed that he was something different. It turns out that he was just right to handle having a rape and abuse victim for his love interest. Now does he screw things up with his own inner demons screaming at him? Yep, but he is well aware of it and knows to express his words of remorse even if Annabel isn't ready to receive them right away. He's also so very close to his family and that were cute and heartwarming scenes.""You seem to get along well with Bishop.""Rev grinned. ""Ah, yes, my dear, sweet baby brother who should have been here half an hour ago with dinner."" After he laughed, he added, ""Yeah, he's my best friend. Along with our older brother.""""What about your mother?""The amusement in Rev's face was replaced with such a look of admiration and tenderness that it caused an ache in my chest. ""She's my hero. Everything good and decent that I am is because of my mother.""His endearing words, along with the conviction with which he spoke, momentarily left me speechless.p. 87 Annabel and Rev from Redemption RoadThere was a scene with Alexandra, the previous heroine, that again, had me grinding my teeth over her mean mouth. And unlike Rev, she doesn't remember what an apology is and leaves it as understood that she didn't mean what she said.The action and danger in this one took a backseat to the character and romance development, but the reader always knows its there simmering in the background and not knowing when that pot will boil over. Mendoza was an evil fiend and I really wanted him to come to a long drawn out painful end.The romance takes its time and develops at a believable rate for a rape survivor. I will put out a caution for folks with triggers from rape scenes. There are at least two flashbacks and nightmares that don't get overly descriptive, but do reference back to the rapes. So yeah, they start out with comfort and then companionship to friendship, and finally tentative attraction. It was great to see them playful and later, passionate. What a lovely couple they are and I nearly swooned at several scenes. I wasn't exaggerating at Rev's knightly hero qualities.My rational mind told me to be frightened of him. He was a stranger- a strange man at that. He towered over me with muscles that could inflict great harm. But everything I needed to know about him was in his eyes. Searching them showed me that he was a gentle giant, and he seemed like someone I could trust.At what must've seemed like my continued apprehension, Rev held his hands up. ""I'm not going to hurt you, I swear. As long as I have a breath in me, no one is ever going to hurt you again. You're safe.""I stared at him, weighing his words. ""Y-You saved me,"" I whispered.p. 51 Annabel and Rev from Redemption RoadAll in all, this was a good comeback for me when I wasn't sure after the first book. Bishop's book is next and he's such a loud-mouthed, arrogant manwhore that love will totally cut him off at the knees I think. Might be fun to read, right? Anyhoots, this was a slightly gritty on the action, passionate romance, but mild on the MC stuff contemporary romance that I would recommend to those who enjoy such stories.My thanks to Penguin Group for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDPXASVKD0COI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI02F16#wasThisHelpful","RDPXASVKD0COI","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems lately when I pick up this author's books; I fling around words like 'epic', 'amazing', 'gripping', 'emotionally draining', 'triumphant' and 'saga' and I don't feel like I'm hyperbolizing one little bit. This was a grand, sweeping western saga that was twelve years in the making. Their love lasted through coming of age, greed, interference, sorrow, war, misunderstanding, the disappearing wild west, and the grand dream of the transcontinental railroad. I don't care what you have to do (yes, a price tag can be put on your first born child- and yes, I was hyperbolizing this time), but if you love western historical romance sagas, just do it (sorry Nike, I needed to borrow your catch phrase).The story opens when Colt Travis, a half breed scout is hired to guide the wealthy Landers' party west from Omaha to scout the future path for a transcontinental railroad. Colt is a simple man who loves the wildness of the Great Plains. He can't imagine a railway through some of the toughest, rugged land imaginable, but a few powerful men of wealth like Bo Landers believe it can be done. Colt has decided opinions about the people he is guiding, but unfortunately he can't make the sweet, curious and brave Miss Sunny Landers fit the slot of spoilt, whiny, rich girl. Even at the dawn of womanhood, she is beautiful and he is attracted, but he doesn't need the rumblings from her overprotective father to remind him that she is not for the likes of him. Still, the journey is fraught with danger and he has the opportunity to show his heroic qualities and earn the lasting respect of the Landers before he parts ways from them.Sunny Landers will forever be changed by her western adventure and time spent with one Colt Travis. No man can ever measure up in her mind. But she is destined to help her father achieve his dream no matter what it takes. She is an heiress worth millions and Colt owns the horse he rides and the clothes on his back. Their situations are too different. Sunny accepts this and allows her father to mold her into what she needs to be even as they secure the support of other businessmen like Dr. Thomas Durrant and Illinois senator, Abraham Lincoln. They race to get congress to approve the bill even as the clouds of civil war threaten to sideline their railroad dream. Family dissension, personal tragedy, and loneliness face Sunny and in her darkest hour, it is Colt who is her dearest solace and comfort.The years and circumstances separate and bring them together over and over, but they carry their memories, their disappointments, sorrows, hopes, and dreams through to the finish of the twelve years leading to the rolling thunder of steam locomotives across the plains and right on through to California.Honestly, I have nothing, but praise for this book. It's huginormous, but I still read it in two sittings. I laughed, sighed, and cried. Lots of crying so don't grab a tissue; grab the whole blame box if you are an emotional reader. It's not a typical historical romance. I mean this seriously because it is twelve years in the making with lots of hazards and missed chances, wrong-headedness, interfering others, and pretty much anything else stepping in between them. However, these are two very passionate people when it comes to each other- soulmates if you will and the tension and waiting is oh so very worth it when they do come together.The historical backdrop is some of the most exciting and authentic one can find. The heart of the western frontier is probably the real main character of this one. American history between the early 1850s through late 1860s is well represented when it comes to the transcontinental railroad and how it affected several groups of people from the Native Americans to the power brokers in government of that day.In summary, get the book and thank me later, western historical lovers. I will be feeling this book for quite a long while, I do believe.My thanks to Sourcebooks Casablanca for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD4NU30EAG0X2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083JC7HE#wasThisHelpful","RD4NU30EAG0X2","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was with relish that I picked up this latest installment from the Hitman series (oh please, please, let there be more). These books are something else with their anti-heroes can be more villain than the bad guys, sizzling hot romances, gritty and dark plots, and in depth development of characters. I would have never thought these would be my thing, but I've enjoyed them all.This one is book four and includes the story of Rafe Mendoza who first made an appearance in book two, Last Breath. He was an enigmatic character and I was glad to get more of his story. These books can be read out of order, particularly this one which is more loosely connected, but there are connections between the books that make more sense when read in order.The story opens with Rafe and some of his men keeping surveillance on an American woman in a hotel across the street. Rafe's good friend, Davidson, is being held by the US government in return for his cooperation in stealing the secrets that a wealthy French crook, Duvall is planning to sell on the black market. His plan is to steal the papers from this Ava who is being coerced by Duvall to be his 'mule'. Ava has some samples to show the legitimacy of Duvall's sale and meets with each prospective buyer individually. There are a few more buyers to go and then the sale will start. Rafe has to succeed grabbing what the government wants for his buddy's sake Rafe tries not to think of what will happen to Ava and her friend, Rose, who is being held hostage by Duvall to keep Ava cooperative, when she no longer has the papers. Watching her day in and day out, the way she hides her fear and shows such spunk in the face of Duvall's thugs and the danger she is in brought grudging respect and then attraction. He wants to be close to her and he uses the valid excuse of going for the files she has.Ava will do everything she can to get Rose back alive. They have been friends and together since childhood. She deplores Rose's choice in men that got them into this mess and she hates the slimy men that work for Duvall and get off on smacking her around and lusting over her. But she will put up with it to save her friend, if she can. Then things start happening fast when a darkly handsome Rafe Mendoza enters her life. She suspects he wants the papers she was given and told that they would mean Rose's life, but she can't stop the attraction she feels for the dark, broody man. Through a series of events, they end up being plane crash survivors and it is Rafe she must depend on to get them out of the Amazon jungle alive. Only, will he really help her in the end and why won't he act on the interest that flares between them?Alright, as has been the case in previous stories, Rafe is a whole lot more than he seems as Ava learns. I love how the authors present a character and then peel back layers to reveal the person slowly. Ava is fairly straight forward as a buxom, bubbly, and bungling girl who pretty much says what she thinks (generally without a filter or thought for the repercussions) and acts impulsively. She isn't stupid, but she's not complex either. Now, Rafe is really her opposite. He is a product of his upbringing and his harsh life. He is careful what he says and controlled in his actions. He works hard to suppress his feelings, too. I found the interactions between these two sometimes painful, sometimes humorous, heartwarming, and many times just plain hot.Yeah, this one has some exciting moments and some jungle survivor stuff, but a great deal of it is two horny people in heat, sometimes resisting and sometimes giving into the flaming passion that is dirty and raw most of the time. If you think I jest, Rafe's unusually huge penis could have been a starring character as much page time as it got. I think Ava's mind was on it for over 50 pages straight, but to be fair Rafe thought his physical size kept him from being with a woman so his mind was on the monster in his pants, too. This much attention to his penis wasn't my thing and I wanted things to move on, but I can also see both the humor, frustration, and even past hurt because of it. I'll focus on the humor with one quote so you get an idea of what I mean:Mendoza just holds me like there's no place he'd rather be.And as I'm pressed against him, ignoring the throb in my bad arm, I feel something pressing against my lower belly that's not a hand. Mendoza's aroused at my wet body pushing against him. Okay, that's probably my fault. I'm fine with that.But it reminds me just how freaking big his equipment is. It's not something I should be noticing in a life-or-death situation. It's not. But when a guy's got something like a Maglite stuffed down his pants?You sort of freaking notice, no matter the situation.Actually, Maglite might not be big enough. More like wine bottle.p. 75 Ava from Last HopeSo, this one leans toward the erotic storyline more than the suspense, but it does bring the characters on a journey of understanding and growth. It won't be my favorite of the series, but it was definitely an engaging enough story. Those who can appreciate an assassin anti-hero, a lust-crazed heroine, an adventure in the jungle, and some intense moments both romantic and suspense with the balance toward erotic romance, should give this one a go.My thanks to Penguin Group for providing a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R226L0SCHCEYGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SA5KFS4#wasThisHelpful","R226L0SCHCEYGR","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Second installment scores with me. And why not? Fierce Viking descendants in the harsh and beautiful Orkney Islands, betrayed love, secrets, gifts from the gods, stormy passions, and epic magical battles. It read quickly and my attachment to the storyline and characters was there at the beginning. I am now jazzed to meet the next pair to join the ancient gods' descendants and see what happens in their struggle against the evil goddess and those who serve her.This is book two in a series. This one flowed right out of that one and would not make a good standalone or out of order. Its a new pair than the one before and the main plot is specific to this story, but the series arc is very strong with the previous books' characters very present in the latter half of the book.The story starts when Soren loses his beloved grandfather, but not before the old man tells him some fantastic things and encourages Soren to believe that he has the power to control the air and weather. Only, there was an odd moment or two when the wind seemed to obey him and he got a burning mark on his arm. Soren is distracted when he realizes the woman he hurt and lost has returned to the island.Ran left home two years before and planned to never return after Soren betrayed her and walked away. Her heart shattered and she agreed to anything her father demanded even an arranged marriage to strengthen a business connection and gain more wealth. She finds that she is not indifferent to him and her feelings are not just anger and pain. Her stupid heart still wants him. But she pushes personal issues aside to deal with the shock and confusion to discover that she has some sort of power over the sea and all water which calls to her. Soren seems to have some answers so they must work together.Hugh does not lick his wounds after he lost to the fireblood and warblood. They may have sealed one entrance to the world from the place where Chaela is trapped, but there are other stone circle gates into this world. He knows the prophesy and what it means unlike the other Warriors of Destiny. He will triumph and restore his goddess to the world. For now, he needs to convince the newly risen stormblood and waterblood to open the gate which only they can that is hidden somewhere in the Orkneys.Ran and Soren strengthen their abilities and hunt down answers while trying to resist the pull of attraction and their love which wasn't as dead as they thought. Meanwhile, the band of other Warriors makes their way to the island to unite with them against Hugh. Things drew to an exciting conclusion when Ran Waterblood and Soren Stormblood worked together along with their new allies.Alright, so this one was good stuff. I saw marked improvement in things that bothered me in the last book that had the job of introductions and getting things set up and in motion. Raging Sea had the benefit of simply continuing the momentum just with a different pair of main characters. The pace was steady or fast and never dragged. Additional worldbuilding was dispensed evenly as needed instead of dumped. And unlike the first romance, this one also was just an issue of continuing after a break of sorts instead of two strangers hastily bonding after brief encounters. I don't want to give the impression that the first book was bad because it wasn't. This one is better, that's all.As to the characters, I enjoyed this strong and tough heroine who protected her heart, but she was still fair and able to be a team player. Ran was in a dangerous situation trying to save her father and thwart a bad guy who knew a lot more about what was going on than she did. I felt like she was stronger in many ways than Soren even though he did the best he could with the situation he was given. He hurt Ran in the past, but not by choice and hurting her was torturous to him. He has feelings of guilt, but also a desire for another chance to make a different decision now that circumstances have changed. Like Ran, Soren marveled at his gift, but didn't take overlong accepting and using it. I loved seeing them work together as partners, but also as romantic partners, too.""...Act as one. Rely on no one, but each other. Accept his strength, forgive his weakness.""Aislinn to Ran from Raging SeaIn the last book, I was enamored with the villain, Hugh. I loved the complexity and conflictedness in his nature. Things were different in Raging Sea. The conflict was not evident. He is set on his path and only has one idea- free his goddess. He is sadistic and brutal. I usually don't care for getting the villain's point of view mixed with the hero and heroine, but I was glad for the few times that Hugh had the narration. He's fierce and terrible, but yep, I'm still fascinated.A few times, there were opportunities for William and Brienne to narrate between Soren or Ran's larger passages. I appreciated this because it allowed for catching up with their story and to see Brienne finally shake off her hesitant nature and be a real warrior and leader alongside William. William is a fighter and there is nothing subtle about him. He is ready for battle and relies on Brienne to keep his battlelust that his berserker gift gives him under control. The priestly guides, Marcus and Aislynn, are joined by a newcomer in Soren's childhood friend, Father Ander. I was sorrowful over the loss the group endured, but intrigued by that bit Aislynn saw of her future near the end.All in all, stronger installment, fierce battles, passionate romance, and strong characters in an epic fantasy style war of good and evil. Even though these are set against real world history, they do have a fantasy quality to them. I would recommend them for those who enjoy historical paranormal romances or fantasy romances with some spice and gritty action.My thanks to Penguin Group for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DC4PSS1UK6S2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451469100#wasThisHelpful","R3DC4PSS1UK6S2","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was sitting on my shelf for some time just waiting for the right moment for me to read it.  I had forgotten what the synopsis was and had a vague idea from recollection.  So plunging into it delivered a surprise.  I love variations on the original so was pleasantly surprised when right off the bat, Darcy and Lizzy meet at younger ages and then there is quite a shift in their separate family circumstances so that the story went in an entirely new direction.  It is safe to say that if you don't appreciate a lot of liberties taken with the original Pride and Prejudice story and its characters then its best to steer clear of this one.Like the title states, this is pretty much a story of what happens when fathers go wrong in the head.  Darcy's father lived a life of promiscuity in his younger years and then blatantly favored his illegitimate oldest son, George Wickham over the son of his marriage, Fitzwilliam Darcy.  Oh the turmoil this causes!  While on the Bennet homefront, the Bennets do have an heir in a most loved and favored son, but he dies and Mr. Bennet flips out and blames Lizzy entirely even to the point of throwing her out and disowning her.Some characters are recognizable and reprise their usual rolls like Lady C, Mr. Collins, the Gardiners, and Caro Bingley.  But others like Mr. Bennet, Jane, Georgiana, Wickham, and Anne are significantly different. I didn't mind this per se, but in the case of Jane, I was pretty confused as to her thinking and actions more than once.The one character that didn't quite do it for me was Elizabeth, herself.  I liked her and admired her, but I was also the wee bit bored.  She handles anything from being held at gun point, to minor surgery, to dramatic family situations, and dealing with personal family pain.  Her inner strength and possession just the right skill when needed was impressive.  In fact, it was too impressive and defied belief. Over and over, she is the only one who can fix it, handle it, and settle it.  I missed a heroine I could connect with her humanity.As goes the story and characters, so the tone of this book.  It had a different feel to it and the best way I can describe it is that it felt like a Shakespearean Play- Much Ado About Nothing, maybe?  It was a fun nearly over the top feeling that couldn't be taken seriously.  The gaggle of Bennets, Bingleys, Darcys, and Fitzwilliams brought high comedy to the tale.The romance was less conflicted than the original because none of the massive misunderstandings took place.  This was a tender love story between two people who connected over shared sorrow and pain.  I had so many swooning moments with them.While the take on the fathers was startling, I enjoyed how the author explored what happens to all involved and the legacy it can leave.  My heart broke for Darcy the way his father treated him particularly since Darcy, Sr. is dead and can't see the horrid thing he perpetrated by indulging Wickham and denying his other son.  I wanted to shake Mr. B until his teeth rattled because he was still alive and causing all sorts of mischief.  It was a struggle and pushed the limits of believability to see him so extremely hateful like that, but I get that there needed to be a villain of the piece to drive the plot.So, in the end, I enjoyed this imaginative take on an old favorite.  I am intrigued to continue with the saga to see what happens with the other characters.  Very creative, humorous, and heartwarming.  Austenesque lovers who don't mind liberties taken should definitely give this one a go.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QW9P6CF5I0C8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1496129180#wasThisHelpful","R1QW9P6CF5I0C8","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dare he hope that this time around the widower, Gabriel Tilden, will choose him?  Or will he leave Anthony with a crushed heart and hopes like last time.  It has been seven years since the young Anthony fell for Gabriel, but learned that his love was not returned.  In the meantime, he moved to London, ascended to the Viscountcy on his father's death, took care of his family, and continued his search for The One.  One glimpse of Gabriel lets him know that he was very much right the first time.Gabriel is living his own personal form of hell.  For the last six months- no, for the last seven years, he has been living a lie and paying for it by his own sense of guilt and the knowledge that he betrayed the one he truly loved out of fear.  He tried to escape all the sympathy and pity by going to London to stay with his sister for the Season, but here again, people want to commiserate with him on the death of the wife he never loved and never wanted.  Not that he wanted her to die, but the guilt over feeling the fresh air of being free weighs him down.  And that's all before he spies Anthony across the room.  By all rights, the man should hate the sight of him, but instead Anthony is kind and friendly.  Do they have another chance?  Or what if they do?  He has secrets that can crush any chances.  And Anthony might have a big secret of his own.Alright, so this third installment in the Gambling on Love series was obviously a doozy and I expected that.  This writer packs her stories with heart, pain, hard fought romance, and growth.  I love what she brings to historical erotic romance with her realistic situations, attention to detail, and the dynamics of love, passion, and power in the bedroom.  This one could be read out of order, but it would be more engaging in order because then the reader would know the backstory of the others who play secondary roles in the story.This story was an interesting romance between a man who knew he was into men from the beginning and a man who had to come to that knowledge and does, a step too late for happiness the first time around.  But as with some second chances, I had the strong belief that these two actually needed the time apart to season and grow so they would be a better fit.  Gabriel is loaded down with all manner of uncertainties and gets stuck in his own head a lot.  Anthony is pretty much his opposite in that he is full of conviction and doesn't get weighed down by thought.  What is interesting is that in the bedroom the two roles are reversed once Gabriel gets the hang of things.  And here again, I was uber impressed with how the author wrote the sensual and passionate scenes.  She let Gabriel blunder a bit and have to take time to get his footing because he was a virgin when it came to being with a man.I enjoyed how these two are set up with flaws particularly Gabriel.  In fact, Gabriel was a insecure user for much of the book the way he kept trying to reject Anthony's giving nature and hope for a future together even as he kept coming back out of lust.  Fortunately, that's only how it looked on the surface.  In reality, Gabriel was terrified and guilt-ridden which made him a right mess.  Anthony demonstrated more patience than I would have while waiting for Gabriel to get it together and then finally stepping in when Gabriel made an even bigger mess of things.  Some people really need each other and Gabriel is one of those.  Though I wanted to smack Gabriel several times, I loved these guys together.Another treat was the inclusion of lots of scene time with the past two couples in this series.  They helped in the desperate times of Anthony and Gabriel's need and they were there for some of the sweeter times too letting the reader catch up with past favorites.All in all, another fantastic entry in the series.  A tough fought for scorching hot m/m Historical Romance that I would recommend to those who enjoy them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2517BM7HYYOTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQVDZ98#wasThisHelpful","R2517BM7HYYOTX","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ask and ye shall receive!  I wanted another installment that took place after the guys returned from the war (WWI) and that is exactly what I got.  For some reason,  I feel the way the war years tempered and matured them adds that extra layer of complexity to an already deeply engaging pair of characters.  The author has done a splendid job of being flexible in how she writes these two pre and post war so that their experiences shape them instead of them being stagnant no matter what has gone on around them.  And maybe I am also partial to characters who are middle-aged and still showing passion, gumption, playfulnes, and ingenuity as they love and detect together.  Yep, I'm a big Orlando and Jonty fan if you can't tell.This is book twelve in the Cambridge Fellows series about a pair of college teachers during the late Edwardian through post WWI eras.  They eccentrically refuse to be stodgy as they secretly solve crimes and make a relationship work.  While its possible to enjoy the stories out of order and each mystery is solved by the end of the book, there is an ongoing story that has developed about these two characters and those around them through the series.This story takes place in 1921.  Orlando and Jonty prepare to celebrate their sixteenth anniversary together even as Orlando pines for a new case to stimulate them.  Jonty comes home from a social engagement with just such a gift for his lover.  It's a locked door double suicide only the sister of one of the men doesn't believe it.There is little real evidence that doesn't point to suicide to go on and so Jonty and Orlando must carefully sift through all the facts and interview all the witnesses.  The case dredges up unpleasant memories from Jonty and Orlando's pasts and the men have to decide whether they can continue down the twisty path to the truth.The story reads like a cozy whodunnit as the actual murder took place prior to Jonty and Orlando coming on the scene.  It was a ticklish locked room case and I pointed the finger several directions and was just as confounded as the detectives.  It was a strong mystery.I also enjoyed the development of the personal story surrounding the mystery that visits Jonty and Orlando's world at the college and also pulls Jonty's sister, Lavinia in along with Ariadne Sheridan as partners in crime.  Their sweet moments as a couple are heartwarming and I love it when they banter.All in all, it was another absolutely delightful and satisfying installment in the series.  I would recommend these to folks who enjoy gentle m/m historical romantic suspense.My thanks to Riptide Publishing for providing this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XKTWX1LHZ40X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626492743#wasThisHelpful","R1XKTWX1LHZ40X","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After rushing through book one and having a good time with the western-paranormal- steampunk world, plot and characters, I was eager for book two.  When I read book one, I had no idea that it was a duology.  I was thinking it would be a longer series and maybe it will, but the particular story arc in book one was concluded by book two in a most satisfactory way.This is part two to the story begun in book one and thus, its not one that can standalone or be read out of order.The story picks up from where book one left off.  Clark and Amethyst are traveling about collecting the important magical gadgets that his father invented to keep them out of the hands of the powerful Senator Horan, the rest of the Treasures are faced with a conniving army captain trying to capture and bring Clark in for experimentation and exploitation of his necromantic power even while the Senator is working to crush the Treasures once and for all.Things get pretty dire for everyone, but it is not hopeless.  Amethyst takes advantage of an opportunity even while the Treasures learn they are not without friends in the midst of betrayal and injustice.Alright, this one leaped out of the gate and never looked back.  There is a thrilling opening scene and then things escalate from there.  This is not the book to grab if you're looking for deep character development.  Any character building and plot development took place in book one.  The worldbuilding is established although the characters explore a few new settings in their adventures.  I felt that this book was the big finish while book one was the foundation that built to the finish.  Not that this was a problem, but it was unexpected since I didn't realize it was a duo instead of a series.  This is on me.  I made the adjustment and enjoyed what I got.I was actually glad for the feverish pace because that issue I had with Clark and Am's relationship was still there and my iffy feelings about Am probably got stronger.  I can appreciate Am's spoilt, strong-willed character and even chuckle a bit at her over the top antics and 'the world revolves around me' view.  But like it and respect it?  Not really.As to the relationship between Clark and Am, I didn't feel like they grew up as much as got somewhat more cunning and slightly lucky.  It was like two horny teens with impulsive tendencies and not enough maturity to be in a relationship.  I was left hanging on something that should have occupied a significant part in the end when it came to their relationship.The end came fast and furious when it came to the confrontation with the villains.  And then things wrapped up quickly, too.  After all the build up through the first book and into most of the second, I did want more though I will say that all loose ends when it came to the action plot were dealt with.I don't mean to give the impression that I didn't like the book because I did, but just that there were some niggles mixed in with the like.  I enjoyed the time spend with the Treasure family and would hope for some more adventures.Speaking of more adventures, I loved that surprise short story about Clark tucked in there in the end.  That was a creepy one to be sure.All in all, I had a good time with this set of books blending the Old West with steampunk and paranormal, some romance and a whole lot of gritty action.My thanks to Curiosity Quills for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G0K0UY64XCBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015MDK2R0#wasThisHelpful","R1G0K0UY64XCBH","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In honor of the 200th Anniversary of Jane Austen's Emma, I have been reading stories set in that world.  I love it when an author tackles a secondary character and gives them their own story.  In this case, it is the enigmatic Jane Fairfax.  Jane was the woman that Emma set up as her own rival and was engaged to a man that was an iffy choice for hero.  I was so curious to see what the author would do with Jane's story.I found the treatment of Jane's character, her background, and her circumstances away from Highbury, the setting of Emma, was fascinating and believable.  The author's writing had a classical tone to it and she wrote Jane's story and Jane Fairfax herself without rose-colored glasses and if it had a fairy tale quality to it, it wasn't the bright romanticized version.  I loved this story for its bittersweet taste.Truly, there are only two things I would change.  I didn't like that Emma becomes almost a villainess in what felt like  a 'push Emma down to pull Jane up'.  I also wanted a bit more in the end.  Jane spent a lot of the book away from Frank and she endured so much while they were secretly engaged.  I wanted to see her in happy circumstances when the conflict was resolved.But the story was not all melancholy.  The treatment of Miss Bates and Mrs. Elton had me snickering.  Miss Bates the chatterbox and Mrs. Elton the vulgar, sneerer were well-written.The setting, thoughts, actions, conversations, and overall feeling felt true to the historical period and situation.  The author did beautiful work and left me believing I was the words of someone strongly acquainted with Jane Austen's voice and works.I would definitely recommend this as a good sequel to Jane Austen's Emma and because of the way it is written, the reader should have some acquaintance with the original story to appreciate this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPHELLX5IBN6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031215707X#wasThisHelpful","RPHELLX5IBN6L","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love stories about Jane Austen's characters and retellings of her stories, but I also love fictional stories about her own life.  It is a work of fiction, but the author put the time in to quote Jane from her letters and place her in situations and with people around her that really happened.  In the gaps, she speculated knowledgeably and the choices she made in the story fit what is know from Jane's life.  I was engaged with the story and had strong emotional responses.The story gives a glimpse of Jane as a child, as an eager girl falling in love only to have it crushed by the reality of her circumstances, then to have that truth brought home while visiting her brother, Edward's home so that by the time she encounters a handsome Navy Lieutenant in Sidmouth, she is scathing with her words and dismissive of his interest.I enjoyed several things including the early drafts of Jane's stories, the encounters with people who bare striking resemblance to later characters in her novels, and the sharp and witty dialogue.  Each man that Jane was drawn to had exciting minds and were worthy of her interest.  The last part of the story was very emotional and the author brought things to a close right where it should.The Jane of this story is not a soft, romantic woman though she enjoys some romance.  Her observations and wit are intimidating to some and she is unapologetic about who she is.  The family dynamics felt right.  These are real people with good and flawed traits both.All in all, I would heartily recommend this to the lovers of Jane Austen, but also historical fiction and romance fans who would want to learn more about this real life person.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1660R1QIM1AWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=069242962X#wasThisHelpful","R1660R1QIM1AWD","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I liked the premise of a broken soldier coming home, his girlfriend ditched him, but her hot, dirty biker brother is there and wants the soldier.  That was good stuff.  But this was a book that needed to be longer and needed to be developed.  It rushed through and didn't give me enough with which I could engage in the characters or their story.

Lucky is hired to be the assistant to 7 Force Recon Marines who happen to be shifters & now very wealthy lotto winners.  The alpha leader, Shane, discovers Lucky is his mate.

"Cowboys + Dragons + Sci-Fi = A story I had to have. The author created a fun western sci-fi that took place on a distant frontier planet with harsh conditions involving a colony of humans making their way in a tough world where the dragon riders fearlessly protect the people.During the day, Charlie Colcord is the sheriff of frontier town, Deadwood Gulch. He works to protect his town from the dangerous wild denizens of the planet and keep the laws of civilization in this harsh land. Charlie is an impressive man of six and a half feet with bright red hair, but what he is known for besides being the most successful sheriff of the colony is his taming of a wild and feral dragon, Zorevan, who tolerates no one, but him and will ferociously protect his rider.But in the night, Charlie's secret life takes over and it is in the hours before dawn that he is happiest with the one other being who shares his secret.This is a short story that engaged me from the start. I loved the setting mashing up western with sci-fi and the inclusion of the dragons and dragon riders was abso-fabulous. Charlie and Zorevan were a great team and it was exciting to see them work at rescuing folks from the creatures of the wild and fighting it out with some of the deadlier ones. Charlie's steamy night life and the surprise secret he keeps was also a satisfying part of the story. His time with his secret companion was sheer fun and delight.The story is goes fast, but it was developed and had great appeal. My only disappointment was that it ended and I still wanted more. Fortunately, this is the first of a series of stories. I don't know if it will continue to follow with Charlie as the hero, but I sure hope so although getting his cousin's story might be fun, too.In summary, it lived up to my excited expectations and I am chomping at the bit for the next installment. Those who enjoy m/m romance and appreciate the blend of sci-fi and western elements should grab this up.I received this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DHBVNPL7D6A9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015YKG2BQ#wasThisHelpful","R1DHBVNPL7D6A9","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Being back on the case with Patrick Shea is an absolute treat for my mystery-loving senses.  This is the fifth book in the series and I enjoy how each one presents a new case, but continues the series arc threads of Patrick's personal life and goings on with his career.  I confess that many times it is all the personal interactions and relationships that Patrick forms which engage me the most, but watching him put his detecting skills to work is no hardship either.In this latest installment, Patrick and the rest of DCI Boyles' Murder Investigation Team was working on the murder of a young university girl, but soon gets pulled off that case to get reassigned to a Jane Doe homicide in the city.  The team has also been made aware that something strange is going on at the Hampton Station where they are all getting reassigned.  The upheaval has shaken up many not the least of which is Patrick who tries to focus on the new case while figuring out what is going on internally with the police.Patrick gets a further shake up when the woman he still thinks on years later returns into his life.  He accused her of aiding a murderer and they parted with bitter disappointment.  But dare he hope that he stands a second chance with Maureen?  And if he does, will she ever tolerate a relationship with a police detective who puts in sometimes long and unusual hours and can be exposed to danger?Patrick along with Tommy, Karen, and the rest of the investigative team slowly and steadily track down all the clues that wind their shocking, twisting, and dangerous way to a solution.The story can get exciting and tense, but for the most part, the detecting is the gently-paced police procedural type.  The plot was interesting and as I mentioned before is a blend of the case to be solved and development of Patrick's own story.Pacing had some sloggish moments, but all in all, it was steady.  As an American reader who has never traveled to London, heard much about the crime going on there, or learned much about the infrastructure and politics of the British police force, the digression into explanations and descriptions throughout had great appeal.  The detailing of the 'Weekend Warrior' phenomenon (housewives who moonlight as prostitutes), the funnel of illegal immigration and organized crime activity all seething under the surface helped explain what the police are up against and made the tone of the story feel very modern and authentic.  The descriptions of City of London (and I do specifically mean the actual city and not the whole metro area), historical facts and features, and even forays into local color were fascinating.  And equally engaging was the dips into Patrick's family history  So all that to say, expect some interesting special features along with the story.The mystery was interesting and definitely engaging.  It was not a complex 'whodunnit' so much as the complexity was in having the burden of proof and how Patrick and his team went about finding it.  Patrick is the main character, but he isn't a lone ranger or quirky detective.  He's a team player- an every day joe with a gift for intuition and willingness to keep at it until he finds an answer.  The answers weren't easy or immediate; just that gathering the clues was along methodical lines more than intuitive ones for the detectives.Most of the characters were familiar from the series.  I love spending time with Patrick and his son, Josh.  Josh is getting older and Patrick covets the time he gets with his son, but misses that, because of his divorce, he was never able to be a full-time dad.  He does his best even though Josh doesn't live with him and he makes Josh a priority.Patrick's time with Maureen had the potential to be angsty and drama-filled after what went down between them before, but both time and their dispositions had them acting like mature adults willing to talk through things and be willing to let the past go.  I loved where things went after waiting for their chance at reunion through several books.The investigative team that Patrick is on are the people he spends the most time with.  Tommy Boyle is in charge of the team and he has been a mentor of sorts to Patrick.  Tommy isn't afraid to pull together a team of people that others would reject and I enjoy the interaction there as well as the diversity of characters.  Overall, the author writes her characters as ordinary types with strengths and flaws.  They have triumphs and disappointments both.  As a result, they are complex and three dimensional.All in all, this gently paced story was another enjoyable read in the series.  I would recommend these to those who enjoy arm-chair cozies, police procedurals, and light romantic suspense in settings and situations that are authentic and sometimes gritty.My thanks to the author for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HBRN5WV6HSUV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015BLJLSE#wasThisHelpful","R1HBRN5WV6HSUV","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Audio Book***I have come to really enjoy this author's books.  I love her attention to authenticism, her engaging characters, and a plot that grabs me from the beginning.  I confess that this story was one I hesitated over because of the situation of the romantic pair, but my hesitation was over-ridden by interest in other aspects of the story.  And in the end, I can say that I'm glad I gave it a go.This is the second full-length book in the Echo Platoon series.  The story works just fine as a standalone.  Each story is self-contained with brief mentions in this one of the pair from the last book.  I suspect that will be true of all the books as each SEAL gets his story.Brant 'Bronco' Adams is the easy and happy go lucky member of his team.  He loves his job and has a zest for life as a former bronc rider now turned SEAL.  After seeing the way his mom hurt when his dad 'loved her and left her', he swore that he would never do that to any woman.  He never wants to have a relationship and make some woman fall in love with him only to disappoint her.  He's doing pretty good at keeping things light and easy until his friendship with the commander's wife starts to take a turn toward attraction.  Getting involved with her is career suicide let alone wrong on a few levels.  However, caution goes by the way when Becca shares something suspicious about his commander and hints that things aren't that good at home.  Brant will help her sort through this dangerous new revelation and try to keep his hands to himself.Becca married 'Mad' Max McDougall with stars in her eyes not realizing the controlling, cold man he really is.  It is when she finds herself attracted to the fun-loving and kind Bronco that she realizes what a big mistake she made.  Her disillusionment becomes the least of her worries when she accidentally comes across something on Max's laptop that leads her to the suspicion that something is really wrong.  In desperation, she turns to Bronco and what he uncovers starts a dangerous clandestine mission to get the proof they need that will both protect her and free her from the entanglement she has gotten herself into.  Meanwhile, they both fight the attraction between them.  Bronco doesn't do long-term and Becca knows that the strong feelings she is developing are going to get her burned, but maybe not before Max's secrets get her or Bronco killed.This story sets up the romance and suspense elements quickly and then develops them.  There is a goodly amount of tension in fact, it felt more thriller at times.  Bronco, Becca, and Max share the majority of the narration.  Having Max's perspective didn't lessen the tension, but changed it because the reader is left wondering if he'll figure out that he's under investigation or if panic and do something drastic.  There is the tension of Bronco and Becca trying to be so discreet and whether they'll get caught out.  Things built to an exciting climax that left me breathless until the denouement.Now, I mentioned that the romance was a touchy concern for me.  I don't like it when a relationship begins while one or both characters are in an existing relationship with someone else.  Naturally, this one was not a cut and dry issue.  Becca's marriage was untenable by the time the attraction with Bronco was acknowledged.  The author allowed them to slip up with a few kisses, but nothing more happened until Becca was separated from Max.  I was uncomfortable, but still able to enjoy their story mostly because the relationship took its time and carefully built on short, solid moments together.Bronco was a great hero.  He's attractive in looks and personality while also being protective and caring.  It was sad that a guy who was fierce-some and brave in the face of everything else was scared that he would become his dad and hurt the woman he loved.  Becca is a gentle soul with simple needs.  She, too, was affected by her dad's desertion and didn't realize she married Max to fulfill that hole only to discover what real love and being with the one you loved and who loves you looks like.  I enjoyed watching them help heal each other, work together to sort out Max's dangerous mess, and tentatively forma a relationship.The author writes good villains.  She writes both the utterly black-hearted types and the conflicted villains.  Tony was the first type, but Max was a complex character that fascinated me more the the hero and heroine did at times.On a side note, I appreciate that the SEAL team actually goes out on a mission and that there is interaction between the members.  The team helps Bronco figure out what is going on and has his back.  Bronco's best friend is the zen-like, bookish Jeremiah 'Bullfrog' and Sam is there to give him advice.As to the narrator, Armen Taylor, was new to me, but I would definitely enjoy books he narrates.  He did well with the range of mostly male and some female characters.  His pacing was good and his storytelling didn't distract, but kept me engaged in the story.In summary, I was hesitant, but glad I took the plunge.  I enjoy what the author brings to military romantic suspense and look forward to each new installment in this series.  I love the strong SEAL heroes, exciting action plots, and passion-filled romance particularly because each story offers up something a little different and not cookie cutter in action or romance.  Lovers of military romantic suspense should give these a look-see.My thanks to the author for a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FM5KK397LR35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014PXGKQA#wasThisHelpful","R1FM5KK397LR35","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I get a book by this author, I prepare to laugh.  And wouldn't you know it, the giggling commenced before I was off the first page.  Her humor is the madcap style with an under layer of wit.  This was her first contemporary and I confess that I enjoyed it more than her historicals.  Maybe it was the background of West Meets East or the endearing persona of the heroine on her adventures of love and life with her favored Chai Latte in hand or maybe it was a bit of both and more.  I began with an amused laugh and ended with a satisfied smile.The story begins when American girl, Tabitha Timmons loses her job and her home, but gains a fiance' all in one day.  The part she is most dubious about, when she shares all this with her psychologist best friend, is the fiance'.  And she's not convinced that Chris loves her or that they even know each other very well.Tabby learns quickly that she really knew next to nothing when an engagement with wealthy Chris turns into a furious and fast education into his Indian heritage and how to impress the future in-laws particularly his grandfather who holds the family purse-strings.  Tabby wants this marriage and secretly has no plans to return home to America where her ex and her sister are happily married with her dad living with them and perfectly content that the embarrassing daughter who was dumped is safely across the pond.  So make over by Chris' sister Maya, lessons in how not to offend and how to impress, and one memorable faux pas after another, she has managed to gain at least grandfather's grudging approval with the caveat that she come to India where he can make the final decision in person plus she can learn more of their culture and be there for Maya's wedding.Tabby is eager and fearful to go on this adventure.  She wanted to be accepted and part of a family; well Chris' quirky family gives her that.  All, but one.  Dev makes her nervous and she pretends that it is because she thinks he's a murderer, but really its because he evokes feelings in her that Chris never stirs.  Tabby refuses to give in to them because she cares for Chris and is with Chris.  Meanwhile, Tabby and Maya plot to get Maya out of her arranged marriage to a guy that Maya's grandfather chose.Tabby's journey with Chris and Maya's family and her own adventures begin to reshape her, giving her glimpses of what she really wants.  But does she have the courage to step out of her comfort zone and grasp it.  Oh, and survive Delhi Belly, scary local wild life, militant villagers, kidnapping, scheming neighbors, and a devilishly handsome murderer.This was a light, fun read though it touches on some serious and thoughtful elements, too.  It reads like romantic comedy crossed with women's fiction set in an interracial posh Indian backdrop.  Tabby narrates the story though there is a lot of dialogue and description so other characters were easy to know and understand.The pace was uneven, but the few times it slowed way down, it picked up.  The humor and plays of words is probably an acquired taste though I think readers just need to give it time so they can adjust to it.  I had no trouble because of being familiar with the author's earlier work.The characters are engaging and even the ones designated as antagonists, have redeeming qualities.  I enjoyed that the characters are flawed and can grow.  Tabby seemed to drift along and was content with the easy way, but she slowly finds her way and starts to value herself as a member of a family community and someone people could love.  Chris is weak and oblivious, but not all bad.  Maya was self-absorbed a lot along with sycophantic to gain money, but she does grow a backbone.  Dev was an enigmatic character and I understood why, but I would have enjoyed getting to know him better.The story is more character development than romance. So be warned in case your expectations are different, that this one is slower developing and mostly sweet when it comes to the romance. I was confused about the direction of the romance for the longest time, but then it made sense and I enjoyed what I got.  The story gave a strong nod to Bollywood and I enjoyed that.  All the traditions, rituals, culture, society, and family dynamics were in-step with what I have seen in Bollywood movies.All in all, this was a delight and a fun romp.  Those who enjoy humor spread on thick, quirky characters and plotting, colorful and diverse settings and a blend of romantic comedy and women's fiction should give this one a try.My thanks to the author for the book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H9D7Y9DCDNPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012LH566M#wasThisHelpful","R1H9D7Y9DCDNPY","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title and blurb definitely pulled me in.  Sometimes a snarky work romance is just the thing.  This novella is part of the Wardham series, but it read well as a standalone.  The small town setting with the winery at the fore with all the close-knit friends and family felt good.  I read this one as part of the Red Hot Lovers box set and enjoyed sampling a new to me author and series.This one started out where the two mistook unwanted attraction for hate.  Beth thinks she can't stand the sight of Finn even though she secretly lusts for him and she believes he deliberately tries to put snares into her marketing ideas.  But underneath it all, when she wants to be truthful, she knows that the truth is that she could really care for him except he is not a guy who wants a real relationship and a family so she puts up walls and uses her snark to keep him at a distance.  Only that won't work so well now that her bosses hired him to be a consultant for the winery.Finn is convinced that long-term relationships are nothing but trouble as evidenced by what he saw growing up and now having to help his sister raise her four kids alone.  But Beth is the one woman that temps him and he can't get her off his mind.  He loves to provoke her and watch her eyes flash and he is eager to play cat and mouse with her as long as no feelings get involved.  Unfortunately, kissing Beth strengthens the attraction and really scares him.  He wants to be relieved when she backs away quick and makes plans to find a nice, solid guy who can give her what she wants.  One night stranded at the winery changes the game.  Which one will give in?Alright, so this one does indeed deliver on the promise of the fireworks and I enjoyed much of the story.  However, I was only mildly into the main characters.  Finn drove me nuts and I really had the urge to smack him in the back of the head several times.  I had no problem with his honesty about only wanting something temporary or that he might date around and finds Beth attractive.  My problem was that he wouldn't respect her goals of wanting a long-term guy and family.  He kept trying to seduce her and then would back off when it started to get real.  He got cranky when she moved on and really he should have let her.  Beth did it unconsciously at first, but her ball-busting routine with Finn wasn't attractive.  She was the instigator with the verbal lashing out and it was like watching a kid picking at another one until they responded back, yet that was exactly what she accused Finn of doing.  Oys, the pair of them....All in all, it was enjoyable.  I would probably pick up another of this author's books and more than likely one from this series.  Fans of office romance or small town contemporary romance with a bit of spice might want to give these a go.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23PJDICE59L0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KPI7BY0#wasThisHelpful","R23PJDICE59L0H","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had the joy to read this one when it was presented as a serial for a special Jane Austen event, Austen in August.  The author has taken a sweet simple secondary character from Jane Austen's Emma and given Harriet Smith her own story.  The events of this story fall before and a little after the events of Emma.  It is written in such a way that those who are not as familiar with the Emma storyline can enjoy this short story about Harriet.The story begins with Harriet's arrival at Mrs. Goddard's School and then jumps ahead to her life there growing into a young lady.  Harriet is well aware that without parents, without rank and without money, at best, she can only hope to find happiness in joining Mrs. Goddard's staff and working with the younger children.  Harriet is content and even happy with this prospect, but Mrs. Goddard insists that Harriet can and will do better once she enters Highbury's more humbler society.  To that end, Mrs. Goddard wishes her to accept a dinner invitation soon.Harriet is nervous about being introduced in the village and showing she has learned to be a young lady.  She is more excited about the Martin sisters who have joined the school as day students.  Their older brother who now cares for them and the family farm wishes them to have an education.  Harriet watches the other older girls take over her friends and push her aside because she is a natural child.  Who could ever care for a Ginger, indeed?The story is short, but it is sweet, engaging, and strongly developed.  It is told from Harriet's perspective and I think the author captured Harriet's spirit well in the tone of the narration.  Harriet is oblivious at times to what she observes or hears, but the reader is not.  This created greater sympathy and a desire to protect her, in me.Harriet is not a typical heroine.  She is a beta character unlike the others surrounding her in the story.  I ended up silently cheering on this gentle, humble, and sensitive girl.  She guilelessly makes friends with a local farm family and catches the eye of Robert Martin even as other girls from the school were plotting for their own benefit.Now, I did mention that this one is written so that those less familiar with Emma would do alright, but I think it would be mildly confusing or at least less engaging for those utterly unfamiliar with Emma's storyline.  Sweet Ginger starts before Emma, stops almost where Emma begins, and then takes up the story afterwards in the Epilogue.All in all, this was an adorable little tale about a side character that gave her more dimension and background.  It fit well in its setting and an interesting plot and cast of characters.  It will be perfect for those who want something delightful, but quick and love Austenesque Sweet Romance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO511DZJTRN32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0155R5SEU#wasThisHelpful","RO511DZJTRN32","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love it when minor characters get to shine in their own right so I was pleased to pick up this story about Charlotte Collins, the best friend of the heroine in Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but truthfully this one knocked my socks off with many surprises.  It is a sequel and follows the events of P&P, but shifting the spotlight to Hunsford and Rosings.Charlotte has realized that for all her prosaic and pragmatic words to Lizzy, that she is not as reconciled to her situation as she expected.  Mr. Collins' sycophant behavior toward Lady Catherine his patroness and his obliviousness toward anyone else including Charlotte is wearing her down.  Charlotte wants desperately for things to change.It is then that she realizes that if she wants change; then she will have to institute it herself.  Charlotte grows friendships within the village gentle folk and takes on the role of a vicar's wife in the care of their people.  She takes Mr. Collins firmly to task a few times and makes it clear that she will no longer consult Lady C or be influenced by her for everything.William Collins never gave much thought about his marriage or his wife, accepting her and her quiet organizing of their home without true appreciation.  It is only when he is placed in the untenable position of who owns his loyalty whether wife or benefactress that he sees things more clearly.Meanwhile, Charlotte has a further crisis of her own when she foolishly engages in a friendship and light flirtation with another man that leads to her having to make a dreadful choice.  Although by then, her husband's changed behavior makes it no contest at all.  She has learned to care for her husband, an improving Mr. Collins.  But what will Lady C make of all these changes since it is she who does indeed control their very livelihood.Alright, so surprise number one and its a biggie.  Consider yourself warned. Mr. Collins is the hero in this story.  And. I. Liked. Him.  There!  I said it.  Try not to freak out.  Mr. Collins, indeed, started along the familiar lines of a pitiful, bumbling fool that no one could respect let alone like, but this is the story of how learning to love a sensible woman and being willing to change for her takes him in a direction that was a delightful surprise.  It was baby steps and agonizing, but I was riveted.Second surprise, and related to the first.  Charlotte, too, comes into her own as a result of her marriage.  She is a lady who develops a spine of steel, but also is exposed to having a foolish side when it comes to her flirtation in an effort to feel appreciated, notice, and valued.  This particular part of the plot left me uneasy since she is a married woman, but I read on to see if she would succumb or overcome her folly.And that leads me to Col. Fitzwilliam's role.  I really struggled with his portrayal in this one because I love him as the gallant, gentleman-soldier or when he is irreverent, but still principled.  To see him in the role of Charlotte's flirt when she is a married woman and later when he loses his head, bothered me tremendously.  I had to pretend it was someone else just so I could enjoy the rest of the story.The cheating element was definitely problematic for me, but it did heighten the conflict and one of the big moment's of crisis.Anyway, this was a well written piece and had a feeling of the original as far as a sequel can.  I loved how the author brought Charlotte and William through all that they experienced and made them both characters I loved reading about.  Austen fans and even fans of sweet historical romance might want to give this one a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE5BWCVWMZ214/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0080ELL9M#wasThisHelpful","RE5BWCVWMZ214","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has been fun to catch these 'in between' shorter stories of the Midnight Breed universe while I wait for new releases of the next full-length story. This one jumped right into a murder mystery and a fast paced romance.  It was tense and passion-filled.This one was with characters that I don't recall encountering before, but its possible they appeared as minor characters in earlier stories so it could be read out of order.  Although, I rather had the impression that this one might lead into a future story since there was a plot thread that was left temptingly dangling.Matthias Rowan is the head of the Order in London.  His team of Breed Warriors mostly clean out the rogues who prey on the humans and try to support the local law enforcement in the form of JUSTISS, the organization of cooperation between Breed and human.There has been a spate of killings with bodies dumped into the Thames bearing a head shot and a tattoo on their hands.  Except the latest body is killed differently and has a partially worked tattoo on the arm.  Mathias and his men decide to check the tattoo lead.  This decision has him confronting a less than honest beautiful and haunted tattoo artist that captures his attention as no woman ever has.  He must tread carefully as she may or may not be innocent.Nova is covering up a really brutal and rough past.  She holds him at a distance and it stays that way until her vulnerability and fears that the darkness from her past may have found her again.  She doesn't trust easily, but Matthias seems the only thing standing between her and danger.I enjoyed this installment as I typical due with this series.  The characters of Matthias and Nova were engaging if not too deep.  He is a steady leader and lethal warrior with a sense of duty, but carries a gentleness and admiration for a tough woman who is doing the best she can.  Nova is spunky even while on the inside she is barely holding it together after the damage done by a fiend in her younger years.  Trust and opening up is a tough thing for her, but Matthias' caring and honesty break through her walls because he shows her that he is nothing like the male who raised her.The plot grabbed me from the beginning.  I liked these two together and how the trust developed as well as the passion.  The mystery was interesting and was a good foundation for the action and forward motion of the plot.  The solution was obscure, but made sense in the end.  Really my only issue was how quickly the romance went from a few passionate encounters to whipping out the 'I love yous'.  It's a novella and they did go through some traumatic stuff which formed a bond so I guess I wasn't too surprised about that.Looking forward to the next Midnight Breed story.  Those who enjoy vampires, a brotherhood of warriors, and sizzling hot romance should try this series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MDMBFD8Z9MPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVWNSA2#wasThisHelpful","R2MDMBFD8Z9MPM","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love it when an author takes a break from the main characters to give a compelling minor character his story.  Konstantin has been a pivotal secondary character through both the first two books in the series and he started up a bit of romance in the second book so it was fun to get his quirky, distracted, and sometimes impulsive thoughts and actions and see him bumble his way toward his chance at love.In the second novel, Konstantin makes a chilling discovery about one of the clockwork machines sent to attack the Prussians.  He is busy learning the secrets behind the clockwork dragon and its soul-powered heart when he is called away to act as a scientific assistant to the Archmanges' Ambassador to Russia.  He is both pleased and nervous about the fact that Captain Himmel is to pilot their airship and accompany them on their tours.Konstantin is drawn to Himmel, but is afraid to jeopardize his career, his freedom, and possibly his life if they are caught being together.  Plus there is the fact that he has no idea how to be with Himmel.  He is better with inventions and technomancy than people.  Himmel is patient and supportive even when, after meeting the cunning inventor of the soul-powered clockwork weaponry and clashing forces, Konstantin goes against his orders to bring down evil.This is a novella-length story and as such it moves along quickly.  But happily, it doesn't stint on all that I have come to enjoy about the series.  The author did a great job of altering the narration to suit Konstantin's personality.  He is brilliant and curious about all things tech and inventions, but he is relatively naive as to making his way in social situations and relationships.  He actually hurts Himmel when he panics and withdraws, but then when faced with death realizes what is truly important.And shorter though this is, it doesn't short change the reader on action and intrigue.  Konstantin is following the trail of an evil technomancer (inventor magic wielder) who enslaves souls to power his clockwork inventions.  It's illegal and immoral, but the ambassador doesn't want to cause a stink over it.  The rival technomancer is devious and has the home ground advantage and more ruthlessness.  It was exciting and fun to see Konstantin who has been the geeky behind the lines support guy, get in on the action.So a fun in between adventure for a minor character in the series.  This one could be read as a standalone in a pinch, but works best in order.  Lovers of blending steampunk (or in this case, dieselpunk) and paranormal romance might want to pick this series up.My thanks to Curiosity Quills for providing this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TDJ0KM0DLL7Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011JR1IYY#wasThisHelpful","R1TDJ0KM0DLL7Q","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This second installment picks up from where the first book left off.  It is definitely a series that should be read in order as far as I can see.  The enchanting steampunk and magical world, endearing characters, excitement, a dash of intrigued, and a love story continue to engage me in this sequel.Ardis and Wendel survived the big showdown with the powerful leader of the assassins that held Wendel in their control for so long.  Now they are probably considered outlaws by the Archmages and definitely have the wrong type of attention from the assassins.  Now there only hope is to join Archmage and technomancer, Constantin, on the lines of battle in Prussia against the invading Russians.  Wendel's necromancer magic is needed to help Constantin power the machines needed to defend Russia.Wendel is reluctant at best to return to his homeland where he will likely encounter the royal family that sold him and shunned him for his magic. He is also fighting internal demons that threatened to bury him in nightmares and despair after his deadly fall from the assassin's tower.  Ardis doesn't want to lose him and is willing to do what it takes to ween him off his chosen forms of co-dependency.  She has a secret that she fears and is also afraid that Wendel can't accept.Meanwhile, the Russians send sophisticated weaponry against them including a fierce clockwork metal dragon.  It will take Constantin, Ardis, and Wendel together to fight off this new, lethal threat.The story clipped along at a rapid, steady pace delivering equal parts excitement and character development.  I enjoyed the reunion with favorite characters and their world along with the introduction to newer characters like Captain Himmel and the broadening of the steampunk world to take to the sky in airships.I confess that I speculated even while reading the first book of a reunion with Wendel and his parents so seeing the action move to Prussia and include the royals there was great.  While Ardis continues to be the sole narrator, Wendel is very much an equally important character.  Through her eyes, his weaknesses and strengths are equally exposed.  The time with his family is painful and not swept under the rug quickly which I was glad for.Ardis' own newly complicated life with the secret she carries was an interesting addition to the story.  Ardis is a strong, highly skilled and complex woman, but she too, had her personal crisis moments which humanized her and I enjoyed the progress she made working through things.The war element was exciting and dangerous, but though focal wasn't the only focus.  The assassins are still on their tail and that left Wendel and Ardis having to watch their backs as well as the frontal attacks from the Russians.The world building that includes a blend of magic and steampunk was again, well-balanced and fit well with the story.  I loved how it even served to power the action and intrigue plots instead of just being present.In summary, the sequel kept up the good momentum of the first book and I look forward to continuing with this spellbinding series.  Those who can enjoy Steampunk blended with the paranormal with a faster-paced action line and well-developed characters need to give this series a try.My thanks to Curiosity Quills for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MK9GQGK3T01R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011JXDW9W#wasThisHelpful","R2MK9GQGK3T01R","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Twenty-one books in and this series of books has yet to fail me.  Undoubtedly, this particular installment had about it the air of a transition book setting up the next turn in the story arc even while it delivered on another mystery with political, social, and ethical ramifications that hits very close to home.Should they be read in order?  Short answer, yes!  The author has written a series of books that not only offer powerful and intriguing mysteries, but she also introduced three key players: the detective, the lady associate, and the barrister.  They are developed over the series and there are various long building series story arcs that move through several books while along the way other strong secondary characters are introduced and stay with the story.This story opens with Monk pursuing a case of arm's smuggling for his work with the River Police while Hester has taken up a temporary post at the Greenwich Hospital in substitution for her old army nurse friend who is ill.  Hester is a great addition to the team of nurses there because most of the patients are injured or ill military and having been a combat nurse in the Crimea, she knows how to treat battle wounds and deal with soldiers and sailors.  Scuff has decided that he would like to follow in Hester's footsteps and go into medicine, but as much as he has learned about Monk and Hester's level of society, he fears that a former river rat and orphan might not be good enough.Shortly after Hester starts her nightshift at the hospital, she is embroiled in a situation that leads to her kidnapping and her real fear that once her usefulness becomes unnecessary that she will be hushed permanently.Monk is busy with his smuggling case which soon becomes personal to everyone at the precinct when they suffer a loss due to a betrayal.  Then he discovers that his wife is missing along with a handful of children and a recent patient with a dire illness.  With his wife gone missing, he is prepared to do what it takes to get his beloved wife back.  Scuff refuses to be left out along a with a few others who will do anything for Hester.Oliver returns from a journey to Scotland to find Monk and Hester in the forefront of the news.  Oliver is still disbarred, but the prosecuting attorney comes to him to act as his assistant for this huge controversial case that on Hester's testimony.  Oliver is reluctant because he can see that this case has the potential for huge loss, but the prosecutor is overly confident and Oliver worries about Hester and Monk being involved so he agrees.  He can't help it and is compelled to visit the lady of his secret affections to lay the case out and get her opinion as an excuse to spend time with her.  If only she were completely free...  But he needs to focus on the case and make sure a wicked man receives his just sentence.This story had quite a lot going on.  In fact, for a while, I wasn't sure what the main mystery would be.  This one isn't as action-packed nor as intense in courtroom drama than others in the series.  Those elements aren't missing, but they are minimal.  Also, the main mystery itself morphs from being an ethical dilemma to a kidnapping to a murder, but the murder wasn't even the tough or most prominent part.  The resolution of this mystery is not a crisp triumph of good over evil although justice is served for the most part.  The ending is abrupt though very satisfying.I feel like I should make mention here that there is a provoking plot thread that was begun and left hanging.  I've seen the author do this before and have no worries that it will be addressed and even more likely grow into the main plot thread of a near future book in the series.  In the meantime, its like a teaser sticking its tongue out at me.  Haha!Hester's thread took a long time to get going while Monk's jumped off to a fast and furious start.  I found the complex and conflicting situation that Hester faced intriguing.  The author is not afraid to address social, moral, or ethical issues of the day which in this case was the advancement of medical science that will save thousands of lives weighed against the methods used to forward discovery and break-throughs.  She has a dilemma before her when it comes to the work of Hamilton Rand.  He is doing an important work as he is pioneering the first successful blood transfusions and working to cure white blood disorders through that.  Hester as a nurse involved in surgeries and wounds understood the need for what he was doing and applauded his advances, but her moral compass balked at seeing innocent and ignorant children used.  Hester also had the challenge of nursing a man that she didn't like and it was her fierce commitment to medicine and healing that kept her at it though she did let off a little spleen now and then.<i>""There is no indignity in being human,"" she said, anger at the stupidity of it making her voice sharp.  ""We are all born naked and screaming.  We all function essentially the same way.  We all need each other from time to time.  Nobody takes your dignity away.  Either you keep it, or you give it up yourself by behaving like a fool."" She turned to Radnor.  ""You are no different from any other man.  For goodness sake, stop making such a performance out of relieving yourself.  Nobody cares!"" </i>Loc 1659 Hester from Corridors of the NightThe renewal of Monk's amnesia playing a role in his life and work was actually welcome.  That element of him stepping out on faith blindly forward has been missing in the last several books.  Monk was a cold, ambitious, ruthless man before the accident that stole his memories as far as he can tell.  He encounters a man who recognizes him, but of course Monk only has a twinge of familiarity.  He doesn't know if the man hates him because Monk wronged him or if Monk served justice on him as a police officer.  Either way, he can tell that the man plans to take his revenge and Monk can only hope that innocents aren't lost in the crossfire.As always, the relationship of Monk and Hester that has grown deep over the years and now includes their adopted son is a special part of the story.  I love that the author continues to follow this relationship that might have mellowed from its tempestuous beginnings, but is still strong and deep.<i>Hester was a fighter- one to fight first and think of the cost afterward.  Not this time!  Not if she wanted to lives as badly as Monk wanted her to.  It was terrifying how much of his happiness was tied to her presence, her love, her belief in him.  He wondered if he would even have had the will to carry on when he had no memory, no knowledge of who he was, if she had not believed he was worth fighting for.  He had become a better man in order to live up to what she saw in him.</i>Loc 2068 Monk from Corridors of the NightIn summary, I am back on familiar ground feeling sad that another installment is over and trying to wait patiently for the next one.  Those who enjoy historical mystery or historical romantic suspense with gritty, intense mysteries set in an authentic Victorian London with a cast of well-drawn characters should take a look at these.I received this book to read in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNXXXES617YFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RKO3UEC#wasThisHelpful","RNXXXES617YFE","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't five pages in and I started mentally kicking myself for waiting so long to pick up this book.  Yep, it was sensational, jaw-dropping, can't breathe, squirming, all the good stuff romantic suspense.  I've read many that claim the description of 'enemies to lovers' trope, but really didn't.  However, this baby, it was the Real McCoy.  These two hated each other and had good reason, but they also had the skills to kill and never get caught so that added some real edge to it all.This was the fifth installment of the Killer Instincts series.  I'm going to pull a 'do as I say not as I do' bit of advice and suggest that they get read in order even though this was my first in the series.  I say that because yes, I loved it and had little difficulty reading it as a standalone, but there were also times that I wished when little hints or familiar characters appeared in the scene that they had been, in fact, familiar to me.  I think that I would have gotten even a stronger connection than I did to the story, characters, and series if I had but read them in order.  So yeah, it will work as a standalone, but would be a much better reading experience in its place.The story opens with super assassin, Noelle, getting contacted to do a hit.  She is surprised to discover the hit is on her greatest enemy, ex-Army Ranger and now mercenary, Jim Morgan.  Jim used her and betrayed her in the worst way nearly 20 years before, but Noelle is uneasy about the hit and does something unprecedented for her.Jim is the leader-owner of a merc group that are quickly going from a bunch of single soldiers of fortune like himself to people in strong satisfying relationships.  He never wants that for himself, but his latest short-term situation with a woman has ended and he is edgy after the woman speculates about what woman in his past burned him for a second chance.  He can't and won't share that he once loved a woman and betrayed her love for his country before she revenged herself in a bigger way destroying any feelings he had for her.Something is coming his intuition warns.  And when he finds Noelle in his compound, the source of his edginess is explained.  The years roll back and they both remember the past even as they warily circle each other now.  Jim is astounded that Noelle has come to warn him about the hit, but no more than she is by her actions.  He has to trace the source of the hit and neutralize it before the hit goes public and every assassin is after the reward for his death.Noelle thought to inform Jim and then leave, but he returns to Paris with her and will not go away even requesting her help, reluctantly and through gritted teeth.  Their love was killed long ago and the hate is very hot, but what neither of them anticipate is the heat of passion blazes even hotter.  While they follow the clues back into Jim's past and through the present to the identity of his shadowy enemy, they also are forced to confront their own shared past.  Noelle will not give in and let Jim close and Jim wonders if she is too broken to ever love again.  Meanwhile, there is one surprising and deadly twist after another waiting for them and their team of helpers.As I said, this is enemies to lovers at its best.  It's a story told switching between point of views and alternating present with the past.  I thought that part was all well done and easy to follow.  I liked how it all worked on me so that I was forced to revise my opinion several times with each new surprising reveal.  I felt a certain way about the characters and thought I had their motives worked out, but I only got some of it right.  I enjoyed the fast pace of the action that still allowed room for introspective moments.  And the passion?  Good golly Miss Molly, these two channeled all their frustration and emotions into the physical and it was as dangerous and intense as any action scene.The romance was by necessity slow to develop.  I was grateful to the author for distinguishing between lust and love.  These two were lusty, but the growth of love was something wispy and didn't become tangible for a long time.  Even then, it was the sort of love that was bruised and tentative because of what they had done to each other in the past and because of who they are, hard-core people in the death-dealing business.There were a couple other minor character plot threads that I enjoyed, but were also a little distracting because I wanted to stick with the main plot.  I think these must be setting up for books following this one.Speaking of minor characters, there is a whole host of them.  There is the plethora of people from Jim's merc team and Noelle's assassin squad that mix and match because of previous stories in the series brought them together.  They are all lethal operators and yet they form a hodge-podge family.  Other secondary characters include the villain group.  I liked that the author took the time to develop the villains' characters and their motives so that their actions and emotions make sense and there is depth.Alright, so this was one brilliant thrill ride that I hope to repeat both by catching up on the series and continuing forward with it.  I heartily suggest Romance Suspense lovers give these a try.My thanks to Penguin Group for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OY4GQMS9EI9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451465709#wasThisHelpful","R1OY4GQMS9EI9F","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A new series with a favorite author?  I'm in.  And check out that gorgeous cover!Off subject a little, I was a little late to the party and got hints from folks that the mystery of the heroine's identity would be big.  I want to thank those who read, discussed, and reviewed this one already for not spoiling my pleasure in discovering that whopper of a reveal for myself.So...after that, I'll bet curiosity has heightened about this book.  And well it should, folks.  The author has done it again with her talented ability to write an engaging, new heroine who bares little resemblance to her other heroines.  Veronica Speedwell is late Victorian age heroine who intrepidly speaks her mind, does her thing, and does it with panache.  This book was just the fantastic opener to an exciting and intriguing new series of adventures and its early yet, but I see myself groaning with disappointment each time I reach the last page of each new installment.The story opens with Veronica Speedwell attending to the funeral of the last of her two spinster guardians.  Veronica came to them as an orphan and the three lived quiet, uneventful lives other than the frequent moves from village to village until Veronica came of age and was able to pursue adventure through her naturalist hobby of expeditions to find, study, and sometimes sell rare butterflies around the world.  What the spinster sisters never knew was that Veronica explored more than butterflies on these journeys.  She was a woman with strong appetites, but was also disciplined in that she would have dalliances with foreign men exploring sexuality, but she had a hard and fast rule that England was home and English men off the menu.Now that she had nothing holding her back or holding her down, she was eager to depart the latest boring, little village and head off to find some new butterflies and see new places.  This plan is derailed when a mysterious Prussian Baron comes shortly after a break-in at the cottage to announce that she is in danger and hints that he knew her mother and the circumstances of her birth.Veronica is skeptical about any danger since she considers herself of little interest to anyone feeling that strongly, but the clue to her past is enough to send her off with this kind gentleman stranger who then turns her over to his associate for safekeeping while he makes some contacts.Her new caregiver, Mr. Stoker, is scruffy, rude, brooding, but seems very much capable of keeping physical harm at bay.  He wants nothing to do with her, but agrees because his old friend asks it of him.  Stoker is a compelling and interesting study to the keen Veronica and they share a love of natural history and exploration.<i>When we had finished, he reached for a tin and withdrew a cigar, lighting it with a spill from the stove.  He drew in great lungfuls of poisonously strong tobacco smoke, blowing it out in long exhalations.  He caught my stare and gave me a mocking glance.  ""Where are my manners?  Would you like a puff?"" he asked, extending the cigar.I returned his gaze coolly.  ""No, thank you.  I brought my own."" With that, I went to my carpetbag and drew out a packet of slim cigarillos, lighting one as he had done with a twist of paper at the stove.  He stared at me in stupefaction until I blew out a perfect smoke ring, then gave a grudging laugh.""Where did you acquire the habit?""""Costa Rica,"" I told him. ""And your cigar is inferior tobacco.""</i>Loc. 478  Stoker and Veronica from A Curious BeginningBefore she gets settled in with Stoker, the Baron is murdered and they are forced to go on the run.  Stoker is infuriated and grief-stricken over the death of his friend.  He is determined to find the culprit and Veronica is determined to have her part in the detecting.  They grumble and grouse their way keeping one step ahead of danger that seems to dodge their steps.  After clues start to more than hint, Veronica is forced to concede that her closed past may hold the answers to the present and that her 'no Englishman rule' might be tested by the charismatic Mr. Stoker whose past is as intriguing to her as her own.Alright, so this is something more than any one genre with its blend of historical fiction, suspense and romance elements.  It is set against the backdrop of England during the later Victorian period and days preceding Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.  The settings shift from the English countryside, to the East End of London and points in between.  Historical authenticity is colorfully painted into the background to add a lovely layer behind the steady moving plot.  The plot varies between character sketching, relationship building, and action.Veronica is the narrator and this makes sense as this is her story.  She is an amusing narrator with her vivid personality and  remarkable, quirky thinking dazzling the reader.  She is somewhat an unreliable narrator even though she is faithful with the facts and has keen observation skills.  It isn't the observation, but her interpretations of what she observes at times in question.  For the most part, she is brilliant and too smart for her bloomers.  But the way she was reared in isolation, pretty much self-educated while having a personality that is domineering, self-contained, and self-possessed means that she treats social interaction scientifically and other people as specimens so misses the nuances that the reader sees particularly when it comes to Stoker.  This is not a bad thing; no, it is humorous and also serves to humanize a character that might otherwise be boring in her flawlessness.<i>""You cannot discount a theory simply because it does not suit your prejudices,"" he reminded me. ""That is bad science.""""And this is not science."" </i>Loc 3693 Stoker and Veronica from A Curious BeginningVeronica is the main character, but Stoker is a strong and very present secondary character.  He is an enigma wrapped up in an infuriating mystery so he is the perfect partner for a woman who is her own person, brilliant, and very capable.  Stoker might be irascible and he gives as good as he gets in battles of wits with Veronica who is not used to that, but he is content to support her and he does respect Veronica.  Veronica drives the man to painting the air blue with swearing and strong drink, but he gets under her skin, too.  She wants to know what all his secrets are and it bothers her that she can barely touch the surface when usually men are an open-book and no challenge to her.  Stoker is a little bit of everything and has hidden depth that he hides until absolutely necessary.<i>""I must say, this makes an improvement, Mr. Stoker.  I thought you entirely incapable of initiative, but I am very glad to see that I was wrong.  I think there is every possibility of your making a thorough success of yourself if you continue on in this vein.  Of course, one could wish you would turn your energies to something more profitable and wholesome than felonius abduction, but it makes a start, does it not?""I smiled pleasantly at him, and he glowered at me from his seat opposite.  I was thoroughly satisfied with how swiftly he had turned to anger, and I made a note of it for future encounters.</i>Loc 920 Veronica from A Curious Beginning<i>""Whatever it is, whatever ugly truths are resting in that bank, you will face them squarely.  You have an odd sort of courage, Veronica.  It will see you through.""""Whatever happens tomorrow, I am glad you will be there.""""You may rely upon it,"" he said, but his familiar mocking smile was not in evidence for once, and I believed he meant it."" </i>Loc 3333 Stoker from A Curious BeginningAlong with these two leads are a host of delightful secondary characters who share the scenes with them.  A litle street urchin, an eccentric lord and his well-educated gentle sister, a host of odd specimens in a traveling show, and the others who follow and hide in the shadows that may be friend or foe.The murder wasn't particularly complicated, but the mystery of Veronica's origins was.  There was some foreshadowing so it wasn't a complete shocker, but man, it was still huge.  That end life and death scene was a real nailbiter.I loved where things left off and set the table for what is to come in the series.  As much as I love the author's Lady Julia series, I think Veronica's stories will be just as entertaining.  Historical mystery, fiction, and romantic suspense lovers should take a look at this bright, sparkling new series with its engaging, amusing heroine.I received this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSMUEE8MY4TUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451476018#wasThisHelpful","RSMUEE8MY4TUU","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've anticipated Rick's story since encountering him in Adrian's book. This series will be one of my all time favorite rocker romances. Jessica Topper tells a journey and not just a story for her characters. The background of the rock band world of Rick, the yoga world of Sidra, and the other characters doesn't stay in the background, but surrounds the main characters so that the story is deeply organic. The romance isn't the main focus for much of this book, but of equal focus to the individuals growing personally and then together. I loved that. Read this one in two sittings and was still looking for more when it was done.The series really should be read in order. This book continues from book one and relies on the former book to introduce the world, tone, characters, and backstory.Father. Widower. Rocker. Empty Nester. His dark brows lifted at that preposterous thought. How could that be? The contradiction in terms describing this current phase of his life brought him back to the present.Loc 107 Rick from Softer Than SteelThis one picks up pretty much where the novella, Deeper Than Dreams, left off. They were best friends, blood brothers, part of the same rock band, and then it was all ripped away before they've reunited the band and their friendship. Before it was Rick who found love and now he is the one watching Adrian have his turn.Rick looked to his best friend for backup. Surely Adrian wasn't going to allow him to be subjected to some sort of heart-to-heart alone with Kat?""Sorry, mate. It doesn't matter how metal you are. If an eight-year old hands you a pink ukulele, you sure as hell better play it."" Adrian smiled and began to strum as Abbey made hula motions with her hands to wave Rick and her mother out of the yard.Loc 759 Rick and Adrian from Softer Than SteelPressures from record companies, their managers, and his own personal life leave him barely hanging on. Something has to give and it's Rick Rottenburg as panic attacks and sleeplessness descends. He has to find away to de-stress and gain some peace. His son pushes him toward yoga and Rick decides to give it a try. And that's when he encounters the woman who steadies him and shows him that he might not be done with love. If only he can convince Sidra to step away from all the responsibilities she clutches close to keep the loneliness and fear of being left by those she loves.Sidra Sullivan is half Indian and half Irish. She lives in the old East Side neighborhood and has her yoga studio in the back of her cousin's record store that her uncle owns. Her musically talented brother works for her friend, Liz, who is struggling since her boyfriend, Kevin, broke things off. Sidra is working hard to earn the money to purchase the building from her uncle because he keeps making noises about selling up. Liz gets her a place teaching yoga once a week upstate at a kid's summer day camp and against her own judgment, she takes on a private student who makes her heart race. Rick's confidence hides a layer of vulnerability and pain, but after watching her dad start drinking hard and checking out on the family when her mom died, having the love of her life cheat on her and leave her for another woman, and dealing with all the men who treat her as an object when they come to her yoga classes, she is leery of men. It could be worse. He could be a rock musician like cheating Charlie. As time goes one, the attraction grows and she is no longer sure who is the teacher and who is the student.""Time to practice what you preach, teacher.""""You can't manipulate a heart to open,"" she insisted. The words sounded lame, even to her ears.Rick's fingertips tilted her chin, and his stare became her personal drishti. Her eyes threatened tears as she locked her focus, losing herself in his gaze.""But you can allow it to open, under the right circumstances.""Loc. 2652 Rick and Sidra from Softer Than SteelWithout being angsty, this was an emotional read. I referred to this as a journey and it was. The author took the time to set up Rick and Sidra's stories separately before allowing their lives to intersect. They take turns narrating the story in alternate chapters. They meet briefly and part again a few times before sharing a lot of scene time.Other minor stories are going on too- Adrian and Kat's wedding, the band's work in the recording studio and the dynamics with promoter and manager, Sidra's family troubles and the potential sale of the family building, Sidra's brother's chance to head out with a local band on tour, Liz and Kevin's on again off again relationship, and Sidra's yoga work. The scenes involving little Abbey are always fun little gems and bring smiles. The dynamics in the band group, Sidra and her Sullivan family group, and Kat with her posse of friends are all humorous and the added a lighter, flirty tone to an otherwise more serious story.I found it refreshing that the romance slowly built and grew organically out of all the times their lives intersected. It really made much better sense this way. In the beginning, Rick is still very much a grieving widower and Sidra is still emotionally bruised from discovering the guy she loved cheating on her and now moving on like they had nothing together. The fire and passion were not lacking once things were well under way. And yeah, a yoga instructor and a middle-aged guy who is fit and taking regular yoga sessions and lessons had no trouble enjoying a physical relationship.I mentioned the settings and backgrounds earlier. That is another thing that just melds so well with the plot. The story takes place in NYC both posh West Side and older East Side. The city is another character in its own right. I loved the ethnic settings that show the diversity of the city. Sidra's Indian-Irish heritages as well as Rick's Jewish heritage added lovely flavor to the story. I didn't even know there were actual blends of Irish-Indian music or that one could yoga to rock.That leads me to say that just as with the past stories, this one is steeped in the music world. Nothing like getting a rocker romance with some solid scene time with the music, tours, recording studio, song writing, business, fans, and playing/singing actual music. The author had a really strong grasp of this world as well as Sidra's Yoga world. That, too, deserves mentioning.It was as if they had both reached their edge, and then took things deeper. Settling into what was. Not worrying about the 'what if' and 'if only'. They managed to soften the steel they'd both girded themselves with, systematically, for so long, and stepped into the process of letting themselves be vulnerable. It was okay to be vulnerable sometimes. It was strangely liberating, and powerful.Loc 2959 Sidra from Softer Than SteelSo, yeah, this one was a rush. Cover to cover intensely engaging. Rock band fans who don't mind getting zen with some yoga, or just general Contemporary Romance lovers should give this series a try.My thanks to Penguin Group for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O114SZGKLVNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R3GARZM#wasThisHelpful","R2O114SZGKLVNK","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series has been building up to something big.  So big, that I was a tad nervous that it wouldn't pull it off, but it did in grand style, no less.  This was a driving, high-def tale for the ages as the heroic group of underdogs took on, not one, but several heavy duty magic users even while searching for a way to restore and heal a few members of their rag-tag group.This is the third in a series that will not read well as standalones or out of order.  They each have a resolution, but also take off right from the one before it.Spoiler alert for those who have not read book two.  It can't be helped the way this story begins and where a large part of the focus is.The story opens several months after the ending of book two.  The time in between was like the calm before a storm.  Two powerful magicians and their followers are in a civil war of sorts with Britain being the battle ground and the ground over which they fight.  One seeks to destroy the country in an act of revenge and the other loves it and seeks to preserve it.  Lines have been drawn and the final battle is in the offing.  Unfortunately, Simon and the other members of their group, because of the cowardly machinations of Ash the Necromancer, one of those engaged in the power struggle, have been pushed forward as her allies even as she stays safely out of the action.  The group resents this, but they can't walk away because all the lives of their countrymen are at stake.They go in courageously weapons blazing when Gaios and the others who escaped the magical prison with him crash the coronation and attempt to abscond with the Stone of Scone, thought to have magical properties and reputed to bless the reigns of the rulers who are crowned in its presence.The opening sally proves that they have heart, but are way outmatched.  However, they must keep Gaios in check and that means keeping the stone out of his hands and locating and freeing the lightning elemental from his grasp.Simon's loss of his runes and his connection with the aether are disturbing not only for him, but those around him.  He has never been without his magic and is having to adjust to this weakness even while holding his group together as their leader.  His special relationship with Kate and her support keep him grounded and on course.  Kate is determined to find a way to help Simon and her sister.  Malcolm is still adjusting to being a team player and part of a unique family of individuals.  Nick is back in the picture and he brings disturbing secrets that force Simon to decide just how far trust and friendship can take them.With each clash with Gaios and his allies, they fair worse and worse.  They can rely on no one, but each other and the knowledge those who went before have left them.  Betrayal, pain, loss, and gritty determination and hope all culminate with several smashing climactic scenes to the end.Alright, this one does the job of series arc finale and does it well.  I was breathless and tense from the excitement and startling twists.  I might have teared up a few times.  And I most definitely let out a chuckle occasionally.  I loved how the authors would put this group in a bad spot and I could only wait to see how they would get out of it.I enjoyed the shifting perspectives between the group members.  There were also a few times when the group was forced to split up and that led to some interesting new settings, situation, tone, and character growth.  While I always love spending time with Simon and Kate, it was the team of Malcolm, Penny, Imogene, and Charlotte that really had my attention.  I loved the dynamics going on there, both the cohesiveness and the raillery.  Malcolm was the defacto leader of this group of mostly females and it was hilarious how they all did their thing and paid no head to his snarls and barks, but when push came to shove they listened to his expertise and direction, sorta.  Just as he respected each of them as people he could fight alongside and trust.Imogene really came into her own in this book as did Charlotte.  Malcolm is finally at peace with his place in things.  And Penny, that gal was amazing the way she was the logistics of the team and got them out of jams with her inventions.  It was interesting to see Nick back in the picture.  He is definitely a dark horse and I loved what he brought to the story.  Simon shows his leadership strength particularly when he is scared to be without his magic.  Kate has become tempered steel at this point.  She is a confident alchemist and she forges ahead in the face of exhaustion and doubt to find the answers for Simon and Imogene.  And the key, yes, it is almost a character at this point, continues to reveal more about itself and about Kate and Simon's fathers.The romance is there between Simon and Kate, but it stayed background for much of the story.  The focus was on ending Gaios' threat and keeping Ash in check.  Although, it was background, in a way it is clearly there in every moment the way they partner and support each other.The Steampunk and Paranormal elements were huge strengths and were part of what I found most engaging about this large cast of heroes.  The stories are rather insular.  By that I mean that the spotlight stays firmly on their activities so I only have a vague idea of the general world around them.  I got the impression that the humans were pretty much unaware that there is steampunk technology, magic, and monsters in their midst.  The two elements are equally present, but don't push aside or slow down the plot.As I said before, I love how the two women heroines both are powerful wielders of their chosen element.  They are not just secondary and afterthoughts to the male part of the team, but hold their own.  Penny is the group inventor and provides all their steampunk technology.  Kate is their alchemist and provides potent magical potions and healing.  As to the guys, Simon and Malcolm divide evenly with Malcolm reliant on his physical weaponry and strength while Simon trusts to his Scribe magic.  The junior members of the team- Imogene, Charlotte, and Hogarth- leap in when needed with their 'monster' sides, or human courage and loyalty in Hogarth's case, as their strengths.My only disappointment comes from several unanswered questions.  If this isn't the end of the series, then I'm guessing I have nothing to worry about and just need to be patient.  However, if this is the end, then I will be seriously perturbed because there is a heck of a lot more I want to know.  Several things were left wide-open.  Because I love this series, I am casting my vote that a new series arc begins and the team keeps going.So, as you can tell, I thought this book and the rest of the series was brilliant.  Those who enjoy the blend of their genres like Steampunk and Paranormal need to give these a look-see.I received this book to read in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16BWL72BCHOSM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P54UVNW#wasThisHelpful","R16BWL72BCHOSM","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw a different book from this series raved about in a review and lately I've been trying more and more Steampunk/Paranormal Romance blends so I took the opportunity when it came.  I found some of the more unique bits like that it is set in the Edwardian/pre-WWI era and that the hero is a necromancer fun additions.  The world building was solid and fascinating like I've come to expect from good Steampunk stories and that blended with the intrigue and action made for a wonderful experience with this new to me author and series.  Definitely going back for more.The story opens with American mercenary, Ardis, after a battle taking a wounded man her prisoner.  She works for the Archmages who hired her as a 'peacekeeper' to stop the rebellion in Transylvania that may lead to world war.  The archmages have used magic to contain some of the weaponry, but it's just a matter of time especially with some nations and powerful people involved on both sides of the equation.Her prisoner is dressed well so he must be nobility and she hopes to ransom him back to his people.  All that changes when the man proves to be a necromancer.  She is disgusted and terrified, but also intrigued by the man known as Wendel.  He sees her reaction to him and he hides his pain of rejection behind a sneer and provoking speech.  She learns throughout their acquaintance that necromancers are as human as the next person with humanities strengths and flaws, but carry the burden of humanities fear-fueled hate.  Wendel was rejected by his own family and blotted out of the family history, even.With Wendel, he is much more than he seems and he may or may not be truthful.  By saving his life, she is stuck with him when he swears an oath to stay with her until he has returned the favor.  He opens up enough to share that he is on the run from of The Order of Asphodel who he would gladly kill the lot.Ardis and Wendel meet up with an archmage who is interested in technomancy and is thrilled to realize that Wendel possesses the magic needed to help him with a secret project.  Meanwhile, Ardis is sent out on another mission.  Her return reunites her with Wendel and they grow close enough to share some shocking secrets.  Wendel sees their situation as temporary especially after the danger of the Order is realized and she is hurt in one of the skirmishes to grab Wendel.  Ardis won't let Wendel push her away and is determined to stand fast at his back even into the heart of the Order.Alright, so this was one exciting rush.  I didn't want to stop reading and I was engaged from the start in this story that was narrated entirely by Ardis.  She was a fantastic narrator.  Even without Wendel's perspective, there was no trouble getting to know him, too.  I liked not knowing what he was thinking since there was always so many secrets surrounding him.  I liked having the secrets revealed a little at a time and having all those twists in the plot as a result.The author did a great job building the relationship between these two.  They start out hostile and enemies, then reluctant partners, and it slowly builds to something much more.  Ardis is the first person to truly accept Wendel- his touch, touching him, his magic, and the complications that come with it.  Not all at once, of course, but over time.  Loved that.  They are a passionate pair and aren't hesitant to grab hold for some sexy times together.Wendel is larger than life in any scene he is in.  He has built up a persona after the years of suffering and rejection.  He is engaging and caustic all at once.  He really stirs up Ardis and forces her to stop and think since she is more one for jumping into things with sword slashing.  At the same time, she works to show him less brutal ways than lethal vengeance all the time which was all he knew.They are a great team and work well together.  There is mutual trust in ability and respect for skills even if they snarl at each other's methods.All in all, a great start to a new to me series and I am eager to keep going.  The ending finished off one story arc, but the series arc is left dangling.  Both Steampunk and Paranormal are well represented and I would recommend this one to those who appreciate that blend.My thanks to Curiosity Quills for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XNGLG1PBA15B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W5X4YTS#wasThisHelpful","R1XNGLG1PBA15B","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading book one, it was no contest that I would be continuing with this trilogy.  Simon the magician, Kate the alchemist, Malcolm the hunter, Penny the inventor, Charlotte the werewolf, and a few others make up a team of heroes determined to keep the true monsters at bay and protecting the human world from great evil.  I love the setting and tone of the series which is a blend of Victorian, Steampunk, and Paranormal along with a strong does of gritty action and intense intrigue.Simon and his team survived the last group of big baddies looking to use magical artifacts for power and now they seek to discover the secrets of the key that his father and Kate's father invented and imbued to be something powerful.  Kate is also working feverishly to find a way to help Charlotte tame her werewolf nature and help restore Imogene to human.  Meanwhile, Malcolm returns to the dark shadows of London pursuing the remaining groups of rabid werewolves that are preying on people.But they all end up coming together when young girls are found slaughtered on ritual altars and the dead are rising.  They follow the clues to that show that someone is interested in unlocking a long-dead powerful magician's binding spell and plans to remake the world based on the prophesies of a past poet and seer.  Somehow Egyptian gods, magic, and artifacts are involved.  They discover that those plotting these things wield a vast deal of power and seem unstoppable.  But to stop the ritual killings and prevent even bigger problems, they somehow must find a way.This book was a refreshing middle book of the series which really should be read in order.  It is a transition book, for sure, but it didn't display many of the typical weaknesses that a reader has to put up with when it comes to the 'bridge' book.  It didn't lag, it didn't have unnecessary angst, and it had its own exciting story arc while still driving hard through the series story arc.  Relationships and loyalty strengthen and realign in this one.  The team becomes a family as they face hardship together.The situations are dire and the enemies are powerful and challenging.  I enjoyed that I couldn't guess accurately what would happen next and I really had no idea how they would come through this one intact.  The sacrifices the team made were huge and I am fretful as to how Simon will cope with his new situation considering there is so much more to come.I enjoyed that right along side the thrilling action was the continuing character and relationship development.  I loved how the team dynamics worked and that each main team member got narration time.  Malcolm struggles with being a team player as well as figuring out who the real monsters are as he fights is long held prejudices.  Kate battles her feelings of guilt and inadequacy when it comes to healing her sister and Charlotte and living in her famous father's shadow.  Simon works through similar issues though the conflict in his life tends to be more external until near the end even as he works to be a good leader and hold his rag tag team together.  Penny and Charlotte are bright spots and infuse light and humor to the situation.  Penny is a crafty and brilliant inventor and I love seeing how something she made will end up saving the day.  Charlotte really came through for the group again and again.  I loved seeing her sweet nature change Malcolm's heart and how she knew how to really push his buttons.There is some little romance in the air even if it isn't the main element in these stories.  It's barely there in a physical sense so don't grab this one if you want a strong dose of passion and physical romance  There is Kate and Simon, of course, but there are a couple possibilities for the others.The world building was superb just as with the first book.  I loved how the Egyptian elements wove in well and kept things interesting.Now, I am glad to have the next installment locked and loaded so I can get on with the grand finale.To sum up, this is one exciting paranormal steampunk adventure and I am thrilled to be along for the ride.  I can heartily recommend this book/series to those who enjoy blending these genres.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R111JOOFAE5KAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345540484#wasThisHelpful","R111JOOFAE5KAF","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"James Bond Meets Pride & Prejudice in this exciting, sultry, and exotic mash up.  I couldn't wait to read it.  Darcy is an assassin, Lizzy's Dad is his target, and a terrorist has them in his crosshairs.  Yep, that made for an intriguing romance and adventure.The story opens with Fitzwilliam Darcy having just completed a job only to get called in for his next ops.  His cousin recruited him and the two Bingley sibs to be the four members of Obsidian a contract company used by the government when they don't want to get their hands dirty to clean up the evil filth of the earth.  Darcy is the stone cold Iceman who does his job well.  He was betrayed by too many people in his life particularly women so now he finds it safer to stay aloof and keep busy with his work of ridding the world of its worst criminals.  Only this latest kill assignment doesn't feel right and one look at the target's daughter has him in a quandary about finishing his job.Lizzy lives with her father on the old, fallen down family plantation.  Her father wants to keep the family heritage intact no matter what he must do to achieve it.  Lizzy humors him just as she enables his depression, his quibbles, his control of her life, and his demands on her future after the shocking way his wife left and her older sister, Jane, moved out and moved on, too.  Lizzy doesn't believe in romance and prefers a quiet, regimented life so she is willing to settle for the boring guy her father picked out who has the money to save their home.  In the meantime, her father partners with a creepy, slimy guy from his Dept of Defense job on some sort of secret project.  Lizzy ignores her sister imploring her not to toss away her life and dreams, but she can't ignore the larger than life man who sweeps her into his arms and dances passionately with her at her dance lesson.  Her heart beats fast even as her head screams that he is dangerous and all wrong for her.Darcy fights the feelings of attraction for the beautiful woman he calls Lakme.  All women are vipers and he can't afford to lose focus now with traitors and terrorists working to destroy hundreds of thousands of lives.  With one swooping event, Liz's world is upside down and danger dogs her heels.  Darcy steps out of the shadows and takes her into his protection though refuses to give her anything else.  This turns out to be the adventure of a life time for them both as they track a captured inventor across the world.  Liz comes to life and the Iceman re-engages his emotions.  Passion soars and danger lurks for them both.I closed the cover on this book and then sat back revisiting a few of the scenes.  The author took me, the reader, on an international exotic adventure right along with Lizzy and Darcy.  I loved gambling in Monte Carlo, ziplining through the South American jungle, tangoing in Spain, and visiting the market in Marrekech.  It was a sensual reading experience.  I needed a cold drink after their dance in Spain.The first half of the book was rough for me because both the main characters started out as people that irritated me in their own ways.  I had the urge to shake both of them at different times.  Darcy in his Iceman 'no emotion will touch me' role and Lizzy acting so un-Lizzy mealy-mouse like with her hide from life behavior and acting so piteous.<i> Vipers, snakes, and serpents- he hated them all...For example, the venomous woman- she was the most dangerous and deadly type of snake.  The sharp forked tongue and deceptive nature of a woman usually came with a killer body and eyes of fire...every woman was a viper. </i>p. 7 Darcy from Denial of Conscience<i> She was lying and she knew it.  Every bit of it was a lie.  She did harbor those secret hopes and dreams of finding the deepest love, but she was terrified at the realization of those dreams, too.  True love usually accompanied a broken heart at the end...At least with Bill, something was better than nothing...She could settle.  After all, she'd done so her whole life. </i>p. 36 Lizzy from Denial of ConscienceThere was also the sense of waiting as the author methodically set up the story and assembled the cast.  Necessary, of course, but I was ready to be off adventuring particularly with the dishy and devastatingly charismatic Darcy.Then things really took off- action, romance, and character growth- and I was sucked into the whole exciting adventure with Darcy and Lizzy.<i>The right side of his body pressed against her when he spoke calmly, placing her hand in her lap.  ""Don't be afraid.  Enjoy this, Liz.  Let yourself feel the ride, not in fear, but in excitement.  Sure, danger is real, but if you allow the fear then you will never enjoy the thrill of the experience."" </i>p. 155 Darcy and Lizzy from Denial of ConscienceThis story is reminiscent of the spy capers of old even though set in modern times.  I liked that atmosphere and tone.  The tension in the story was superb and I loved seeing the various levels of it in the plot.I know I said this was a Pride and Prejudice mashup with James Bond, but for the most part the well known characters have been dropped into a new cloak and dagger situation and its pretty much a whole new story.  And trust me,  Austen purists beware, this one gets hot and sultry and sometimes just plain down and dirty so its more a sly wink and a deliberate nod to Austen's classic.So, I enjoyed adventuring with Iceman Darcy and Lizzy both on their quest and with their tempestuous romance.  I would recommend this one for lovers of spicy romantic suspense who would enjoy a nod back to a classic story.My thanks to the author for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V2EOH35FVJ1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZLTS3B8#wasThisHelpful","R3V2EOH35FVJ1W","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Three things:  hockey player hero, heroine still needing to heal from her past, and home town setting all from a home town author.  Okay that's four things, but whose counting because it was also new to me author and series.  Had to read it!It's New Adult (NA) and it checks off most of the hallmarks of NA including first person POV, angsty and horny characters with broken pasts, drinking enough for alcohol poisoning, night clubs, besties, college, and of course the BIG misunderstanding.  Normally this makes me cringe and run and I admit to having one toe out the door, but the author reeled me in with something in her writing.  I kept reading and was oh so glad I did.  I ended up really cheering for the heroine to get her mess together and adoring the hero who made this book for me.Aleksandr is a minor league hockey player who needs a Russian Translator now that people are noticing his superb playing.  He comes across as arrogant, cocky, and a real jerk the first few times Auden encounters him.  He takes one look at Auden and wants her and wants to be with her, but he bungles it.  He then sets out to change her mind and get her to give him a chance even while he is working hard to make it to the NHL.Auden's grandfather got her the temp job of translating for Aleksandr to help make up for the loss of her soccer scholarship.  She plans to keep Aleksandr at arms' length and keep it professional.  Not that this is much different than the way she treats most people.  Auden either does the leaving or she never lets people get close with the exception of a few childhood friends that way she can never feel abandoned again.  But the true man behind the front that is Aleksandr opens up to her and shows her a guy that understands as no one else does and he wants a chance with her.  She should resist and she does, but he sticks with it and wears away at her emotional walls.Aleksandr and Auden were a good pair and, for a debut story, I thought the author did a bang up job making them and their romance really work.  The New Adult (NA) quirks were a tough sell for me particularly with Auden the Maudlin telling the story.At first, I wasn't very patient with her anger that she held onto from childhood that made her lash out at her grandparents and have a short fuse with Aleksandr.  However, the author gave her other traits that endeared her to me enough to wait until Auden got her epiphany and straightened out.  I should say that she had a very real and sad reason for being messed up so I definitely felt badly for her even though I wanted her to move on and not dwell in the past.  Her dad took off before she was born and her mom died when she was a child leaving her with grandparents who were struggling with grief and not knowing how to deal with a young child's grief.The shining spot in all this was Aleksandr.  And I'm not just talking about his hottie Hockey hardbody though there is that droolworthy fact, too.  He had as much reason as Auden to act damaged and keep himself back from engaging with folks and mistrusting 'forever' relationships, but he didn't.  He plunged into life with agosto.  He courageously chose a woman that gave him no reason to think he would get through to her let alone get her to give him back what he generously gave of himself to her.  He was a beautiful guy inside and out.<""Take yourself out of it, Audushka.  I need to leave for my job, and yes, that means leaving you, but I'm not leaving because of you.  You understand the difference, yes?""</i>Loc 2452 Aleksander from Delayed Penalty<""What are you doing here?""""You needed me.  I came.""It was that simple for him.""When do you have to go back?""  I couldn't believe he'd hopped on a plane just to visit me...""Tomorrow morning.""I nodded...puddles that had been accumulating in the rims of my eyes spilled out.""Please don't do that.""  He took my face in his hands, pushing my hair back, and wiping the skin under my eyes with his thumbs.  ""I thought you would be happy, Audushka.""""I am...You didn't have to come here.  You've got more important things to think about.""""When will you understand how much I love you?""  He tilted my face until my eyes met his.  ""Nothing is more important than you.""And just like that, Aleksandr Varenkov turned my world upside down again.</i>Loc 2886 Aleksandr and Auden of Delayed PenaltyThe romance is on the sweeter end because Auden is inexperienced and she needs Aleksandr to take things slow.  Plus he's really an old fashioned guy who holds doors, respects her grandparents, and treats Auden special.  In fact, this one is refreshingly not one of those where they jump into bed practically the second they meet.  The love scene is late in the story and it took into account that she was young and a virgin.  She wasn't ignorant, but there was just enough lack of knowledge to make it authentic.  I had to chuckle when she started drinking the night she had decided to give herself to Aleksandr. I get that she felt she needed liquid courage, but we all know what a few G&Ts and some vodka shots in just a little time will get you and it isn't the best night of your life.  Ha!The themes of abandonment, child grief and anger, adoption, self-esteem, trust, and learning to accept and express love are all there in this story.  It had depth and heart as a result of Auden's personal journey of healing.<i> ""I don't know how to fix things, KK.  I just know how to run away.""</i>  Loc 3384 Auden from Delayed PenaltyAs to the sports' aspect, its more of a backdrop for the story since the narration is all from Auden's perspective and no actual ice time with Aleksandr.  If you know squat about hockey, you would still do fine just as hockey fans will get a kick out of the references and setting.Speaking of setting, I've called the Detroit Metro area home for the last few decades so I had an absolute blast seeing references to places, names, activities, and overall local flavor that were totally familiar.  Detroit is known as Hockey Town and so to choose it for the setting of a Hockey romance made it feel like it was another well-developed character in the story.So, all in all, I was glad I got to read this one and most definitely want to keep going with the series (Please let Landon be next).  I hope to see more of Aleksandr and Auden.  I would recommend this one for those who enjoy New Adult Contemporary romance with sports settings, slow to build slightly spicy yet sweet romance and characters who slowly heal and grow.My thanks to Entangled Flirt for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NP8JTRMQWS4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S3RK7O6#wasThisHelpful","R2NP8JTRMQWS4R","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This tweeny story was full of humor and holiday spirit alongside an engaging mystery.  I enjoyed the time with Emily, Colin, their little boys, and a surprise guest at her mother's house party with the guests of honor being a maharajah and his family no less.A treasured jewel and bracelet of the maharajah's daughter goes missing and the jewel ends up in Emily's possession.  To avoid a potential diplomatic incident and trouble before the holidays for she and her family, the situation must be resolved.The mystery was a cozy one and the focus was on relationships, family, and new acquaintances as much as finding the thief.  It was enjoyable spending a little more time in the Lady Emily world during the Christmas holiday season.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33CTI09DW117B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LRY2U0G#wasThisHelpful","R33CTI09DW117B","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A masquerade ball, an impostor, a murder, a hunt, and a story from the past gives Emily and her associates a new case to solve.  It was an interesting situation in which the murder was the less important of mysteries to solve.This is the ninth installment in the series.  I suppose it could be read out of order in a pinch, but the regular characters and their situations make better sense read in series order.The story opens with Emily and Colin attending a masquerade ball for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.  An impostor is unmasked as not the eccentric lady explorer, Estella Lamar.  Later the impostor is killed.  Colin is given the authority to investigate the murder and Emily helps, but all the while Emily and her friend Cecilie worry about the real Estella Lamar. Nobody has seen her in years as she travels the world.  The murder has to tie-in somehow so the Hargreaves, Cecilie and Emily's friend Jeremy all work together to follow the trail of hearsay, old clues, and a mysterious red-haired man to get to the bottom of things.The book engaged me and I enjoyed it, but I will admit that the tension and suspense were toned down.  It was like a previous book in that there were two stories going on every other chapter.  There was the murder mystery in Emily's day and a past story thread with Estella Lamar.  Both were equally engaging and left me wondering how the past shaped the present.As I said, the murder was actually not the dominant focus.  That's actually not too tough to solve.  It's the situation with the real Estella that is the true conundrum.  Is she alive?  Is she dead?  Is she alive, but living in captivity?  It was hard to say and I enjoyed the twisty path that led to the truth.In the end, it was a pleasure as always to immerse myself in a Lady Emily mystery.  I didn't feel the tighter suspense of the earlier stories, but it was still a good mystery nonetheless.  Historical mystery fans who enjoy authenticity in their backgrounds and settings and well drawn characters should give these a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VTQHDFL5YPGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125006743X#wasThisHelpful","R1VTQHDFL5YPGN","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Cauld Ane series is about a non-human race secretly living among the humans going about their lives in much the way those around them do not seeming different on the outside.  They have long life, extra strength, and special gifts.  Each spends their life searching for that special someone who is their soulmate.This is only my second visit to the series after reading the book immediately before this one.  I had plans to go back and catch up on the series, but that hasn't happened yet.  I've managed to muddle through with the worldbuilding and the recurring characters and ongoing plot, but yeah, definitely need to get up to speed eventually because I very much had the feeling that I was missing something.  Something good.  That being said, there was plenty I could enjoy in this book and did.  The main plot introduces a new pair of soulmates, Thane and Sydney.The story opens with Sydney Warren learning of her mother's death.  She is devastated, naturally, and turns to the only family she has left for comfort.  She moves from America to England to live with her mother's brother's family in London.  Her family is quite wealthy and she is an heiress in her own right.  Sydney is taking some time to grieve and then will decide what to do with her life.  Into this situation, she has a chance encounter with movie star, Thane Allen.  It is a surreal experience, but even more surprising is that he is interested in her and wants to see her again.Thane is Caulde Ane living among the humans in plain sight.  He is slightly envious of his friends and older siblings who have all found their mates.  He knows sometimes it takes a long time for mates to find each other and it's possible his mate might even be human.  That's when it happens.  He suddenly meets her and he likes what he sees, but Sydney is suspicious and uncertain.  He has the job of not only convincing her that what they have is real, but explaining about him being different.As Thane and Sydney begin a relationship, disturbing revelations come out about her mom's death.  Sydney may be in danger.  Thane and her uncle have the job of keeping her safe even as the authorities work to solve the crime.  Thane is desperate that nobody will take away from him the mate that he has waited for a long time.Alright, so this one took me some time to get into and stay in, but overall it was a light, heartwarming paranormal romance.  Let's start with what I found troubling and then move on to the good stuff.There were a few times when I encountered...well let's call them distracting issues.  They weren't huge ugglies, but they took me out of the story.  The heroine is a newbie to the world of Cauld Ane and she didn't get much of an explanation.  She finds stuff out as she goes and most of it was after she committed to him which happened super quickly.  Went from stranger to I love you in a week.  I found it hard to believe that someone would be that accepting of something so monumental.  She had a harder time accepting that a movie star wanted a date with her than she did that there were such things as near immortals who could communicate mentally and had extra strength and powerful gifts lived among the humans who had soul mates and now she was part of it.  So yeah, fated mates story with not a lot of intro and build up there.Now, as to what worked for me.  The romance isn't isolated, but surrounded by family, friends, love, affection, humor, and a light tone.  The string of gentle, sweet scenes such as family gatherings and events like births and birthday parties, sisterly shopping trips, cuddling over a movie, and double dates were adorable.  For those who enjoy snarky fun dialogue then this will definitely tickle your funny bone.  Thane was quick and flirty, but Sydney was a sarcastic gal with a short fuse especially when it came to his need to protect aka smother her. I appreciated that she understood the danger and didn't pull any stubborn-stupid stunts.And the suspense element, whew boy, did some of those last twists come as a shock.  I had no trouble figuring out part of it as it was foreshadowed earlier, but the 'why' was something else.  I also liked that the struggle with their new emerging gifts made them have to work at their relationship and rely on each other as a partnership.  Sometimes folks are opposites, but in this case these two have so much in common that its double the trouble.  Poor things!  I was exhausted just reading some of it as they worked through it, but was gladdened when they pulled together over it.Oh, and I really loved that nod to the author's other time- travel series with Thane acting in a movie about 'Jamie' and 'Sophie'.  Loved that series so it was fun to encounter it again here.In summary, I got cozy and enjoyed a lighter paranormal that is heartwarming and on the sweeter end.  I am still determined to go back for the earlier books because I really enjoyed the scenes with the previous couples who are now starting families.  I would recommend this one with the caveat that it be for those who can enjoy quick fated mates sweeter romance.My thanks to the author for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZZME8DW16E3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZVN70UO#wasThisHelpful","R2ZZME8DW16E3B","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the first book in this series and was intrigued by Linda's brother, Giovanni, so I was thrilled when I got a chance to continue on and read Giovanni's own story.Successful, Italian businessman, Giovanni Coriola is in London just before the Christmas holidays for his sister's wedding. He decides to practice his gun marksmanship skills so signs up for sessions with a target-shooting specialist and trainer, Sonia Galsworthy. He is impressed by her skill and attracted to her immediately.Sonia is very good at what she does and is slightly defensive when she has to constantly defend her chosen vocation. She is not the domestic sort and can't imagine herself in a situation with home, husband and children. She likes her life and is content until handsome and hot Giovanni not only accepts her as she is, but wants to be with her. Sonia knows he must be popular with the ladies and will want nothing permanent so she accepts his presence in her life knowing there is an expiration date on it when Linda gets married and Giovanni goes home. Only, she's wrong because the man she has come to love claims to love her back and wants something lasting. Now she must decide whether she'll take Giovanni at his word and trust that he cares for her as much as she has come to care for him.It was fascinating how the two stories took different tones and reflected somewhat the feel of the personality of the characters. Giovanni's story was more incisive, heated and grittier with less of an enchanted feel though there is a bit of the inexplicable to it as well when it comes to the amulet. Giovanni's love interest matched him well too. Sonia was independent, capable and somewhat set apart from life until she encountered Giovanni.Their romance sparked and flamed quickly. They were thinking of hearts, love, and long term before several days had passed. Love at first sight and fast commitments are a bit of a stretch for me, but I went with it because I was enjoying the story. These two came together with a great deal of heat and passion reflecting their strong personalities. Things weren't all ease though because Sonia has preconceived notions about what type a person she thinks Giovanni is and Giovanni has to learn that he now has a partner when tough times come.The story was told in two parts with the romance developing in the beginning section giving the story a gentle pacing and then it continued in the latter half as it was no longer isolated, but set into the greater circle of family and daily life. The second half was augmented by the suspense element too that got pretty exciting and picked up the pace with danger stalking them from an unknown source.All in all, I enjoyed all the elements put together in this story: characters, backdrop, and plot.

"I have read this author's work before and liked it so it was with anticipation that I grabbed up this book. This story offers up a unique experience as far as I was concerned. I loved reading a story that was partially set in Romania and was written by a Romanian author. The paranormal aspect was unique as far as that genre goes too. This wasn't about a vampire, werewolf, demon or any other popular paranormal creature. It was about an inexplicable experience. The crisp, clean writing style set the tone for that experience to appear all the more mysterious. The story flows gently with spikes of action, but the crisis point comes unexpectedly. It was an engaging read.Gerard Leon is a Frenchman and a doctor living in London. He works at a children's cancer clinic where he works on cancer cures. He has found a promising method for one type of cancer and the treatment has been moderately successful. One day, he enters the clinic to find a beautiful woman sitting down and playing with the patients. He recognizes her as the famous Italian sculptress and recent divorcee, Linda Coriola. His heart is warmed to see that she really cares about the kids and isn't just making a publicity visit to look good as a big donor for the clinic. She is so beautiful and he is smitten.Linda is gun-shy around men after her experiences with her Ex and growing up with her parents splitting up and both remarrying. She has determined to keep her heart locked away and maintain her independence. But the handsome Frenchman doesn't seem to be taking the hint each time she pulls away. Not that she fights too hard when he takes her for ice cream to a cute cafe and talks to her of his work, when he visits hers home and is eager to know her and seems so appreciative of each moment they spend together.Gerard knows that Linda is holding back and he re-doubles his effort to show her that his love is real. They visit his mother and aunt, he goes with her to her art exhibition where they run into her Ex, and then they share that unforgettable adventure in Romania when she accompanies him to check out a doctor-friend's research idea and end up brushing up against the paranormal. But then a misunderstanding takes place and Gerard is finally convinced to let her go.This was a love at first sight story, but the relationship is not that simple. The hero is open and strong with his feelings and commitment. The heroine is fearful and tentative. I admit to getting frustrated with her several times. I will excuse her a little by admitting that her ex-husband did a real number on her psyche, but only a little because Gerard gave this relationship his all. Not really sure what he could have done differently to convince her.That being said, I enjoyed their love story. I enjoyed that they appreciated each other's talents and shared the same cause when it came to the cancer. The domestic scenes were cute in their homes, his mother's home and his friend in Romania's home. Their passion was tender and sweet. And you know that no matter how slow the relationship took, there was no problem with the physical- not with a Frenchman and an Italian woman as the love interests. It's a little spicy, but not full on description. The author did a good job giving readers a scorching hot hero to appreciate in Gerard who has that attractive French accent, flirty good-nature, smoldering passion for Linda, bold green eyes and dedication toward his work. What's not to love there, right?The paranormal aspect of the story was very enchanted forest stuff taking place in the Romanian version of the Bermuda Triangle. I enjoyed the feeling I had reading this portion.And speaking of Romania, it was fun experiencing their adventure as the scenery, food, history and people were described. It wasn't pedantic because it was all viewed through Gerard and Linda's eyes.To sum up, this is a nice refreshing change for a paranormal romance that I would recommend to those who like a little something different now and then in that genre and don't mind things light on the paranormal and more sweet than spicy on the romance.My thanks to the author for providing the book in exchange for my honest review thoughts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DVSB5NVP4ARC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014Z8T0US#wasThisHelpful","R2DVSB5NVP4ARC","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't believe how long I waited before pouncing on this latest Sebastian St. Cyr mystery.  I usually devour it the day it arrives in the mail.  That being said, I still managed to be glued to it as soon as I started and finishing it quickly.  Jane Austen, folks!  I couldn't believe it.  Sebastian and Jane Austen share a case!This series all pose separate murder mysteries in each book, but there is an ongoing storyline following Sebastian's life both the mysteries of the past and the present with his capable and intelligent wife, his powerful and sometimes brutal father in law, and all his associates that help him solve murders.  So what I'm saying is that it is definitely best to read them in order.  Totally worth it!  Sebastian, as a noble man detective from the Regency period is worth it.Sebastian St. Cyr, Lord Devlin, is called out in the wee hours by his friend and magistrate of the Bow Street Runners to consult on a startling and grizzly murder.  A prominent wealthy gentleman has been killed and his head removed near Bloody Bridge with a Charles I burial strap nearby.Sebastian pursues inquiries into the dead man's life and known associates while his wife, Hero, continues her controversial research into the poor of London.  Sebastian's detecting isn't popular with his family or Hero's anymore than her work for the poor is, but she supports him and he supports her because they understand each other.Soon his work turns up disturbing connections that tie-in to his own past and to some powerful people including a government lord, a former colonial governor, and a banker.  Sebastian goes from not having enough suspects to having a plethora of them and one of them thinks he is getting too close to the truth and turns the hunter into the prey.As usual when I read this series, I appreciate all the work that goes into making them complex mysteries, but also stories with depth.  Sebastian and the cast of characters surrounding him have depth.  Sebastian has flaws and weaknesses to go along with his strengths and in the stories he forms attachments and has powerful enemies.  His relationship with his extended family, his wife, his friends, and his acquaintances are all rolled into the story.But not just the characters get that extra something, the author takes prestigious care over the backdrop and settings so that the overall historical period is painted with colorful detail, but also the particular subject of the mystery which was in this case the world of collectors, royal burials, the climate toward slavery, and conditions for the poor of that time.Then there is the murder mystery which was devilishly tricky as they generally are for me.  I couldn't determine who I thought was the killer or why.  Jane Austen's brother, Henry Austen, was even a suspect and I loved that these real life figures were pulled in and had some good scene time.Sebastian's cases are not just arm-chair cozies and get exciting and gritty.  An enemy from his past keeps him on his toes and unleashes Sebastian's wrath when those he cares for come into the crosshairs of lethal danger.  There is a real loss for Sebastian in this one and I confess to tearing up and reeling from the shock of it even after I closed the book.I have to add that I have a fiendish glee whenever Sebastian, Hero, and her father, Lord Jarvis encounter one another.  The sparks just fly and I love that there is an armed neutrality about their family dynamics.All in all, it was superb and I am sad that I must wait yet again for the next installment.  These are for historical mystery, historical fiction, and even historical romantic suspense lovers who want some authenticity, depth of character, grit and action to their story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LKWKXQ00E0CH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451417569#wasThisHelpful","R1LKWKXQ00E0CH","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading the first book in the Poldark Saga, I was eager for more of the gritty, atmospheric world set along the Cornish coast in the late eighteen hundreds.  The writing, tone, characters, dialogue and setting were of the finest I have read.  I was not disappointed when I continued with the story in this second book of the series which really needs to be read in order.As the title states clearly, this is Demelza's book.  She was a waif and an emerging woman in the first book, but this book shows her coming into her own through the trials of life as friend, lady of their lands, mother, and wife.  She both errs and she grows, but her character does not alter.In the beginning of the story, Demelza desires to show herself ready to be the lady of a gentleman so she uses little Julia's christening as an opportunity to host a party.  But ready to be lady or not, she still has her insecurities and it is up to Ross to reassure her:<i>""Nothing else matters, but you,"" he said.  ""Remember that.  All my relatives and friends- and Elizabeth, and this house and the mine...I'd throw them in the dust and you know it- and you know it.  If you don't know it, then all these months I've failed and no words I can give you now will make it otherwise.  I love you, Demelza...</i>  p. 6 Ross from DemelzaDemelza wants to make those she loves happy so she meddles and schemes even behind Ross' back.  She learns that what she meant for good may have dire consequences even within her own marriage.Ross has his own worries what with the situation of the copper industry, the Warleggan strangle-hold on the financial power in their area of Cornwall, and trouble within his own family and people.  He must find a way to steer his way through it all.  In the end, tragedies and joys come and it is Demelza's sunny nature that soothes his dark Poldark one.This truly is a saga of the Poldark family, but also that of the Cornish people at the time.  The story moves along steadily accumulating plot threads and players on the scene surrounding the key players.  It's not hard to follow the story and very easy to become vested in the circumstances.  I love that this historical is not about the upper classes, but the gentry and the working poor.  Instead of their lives being bland; they are rich and emotions are engaged.Ross and Demelza's marriage and daily life are still center, but the dark clouds of low rates for the copper, tough times for their people, strained relations with their neighbors even family, and most of all, the rising conflict with the Warleggans make for continued page turning.  Demelza's activities strained things and I can see storm clouds brewing as a continued result of what she set in motion.  My emotions were gripped.  I was both saddened and gladdened by events of the story.  I would add that this is romantic storytelling without being a romance.The historical setting of Georgian era Cornwall continues to be a strength.  The author waxes poetic a few times and nearly brought me to tears over a mine closure and later I was thrilled breathless by a shipwreck and a wrecker's party on the beach.  The writing includes strong nods to the distinction of classes and society with local speech employed for miners and workers that is amusing to work out at times.All in all, the strength, depth, and richness of this story kept me reading on even when other claims on my time called to me.  I loved getting lost in the Poldark world and I look forward to picking up the next book in the series.  I heartily recommend this series to those who love historical fiction with drama.My thanks to Sourcebooks Landmark for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EKS20FHTXQXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492622109#wasThisHelpful","R3EKS20FHTXQXF","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sad when the Guardians of Eternity series ended, but there was a silver lining in that there was to be a spin-off series featuring dragons.  Oh yes, excited and eager for that!The story opens with lovely imp, Tayla, contentedly looking about her at her dream home and tea shop.  She has been on the run all her life it seems, but something compelled her to put down shallow roots when she saw the quaint old Victorian house near the woods.  And she doesn't even live alone because she has rented rooms to Levet, the gargoyle for his matchmaking business.  Levet is sweet and harmless, but he is bothered that she wants nothing to do with a love match.  She begs him to leave well enough alone, but Levet doesn't and her life takes a turn for the dangerous and interesting.Baine has been searching for the gorgeous imp that escape him for twenty-five years.  His fiery dragon nature has been on edge since he clapped eyes on the imp when the trolls brought her as a slave to pay a debt to his father.  He bought the debt and now she is his if he can catch her.  Then it is by luck that his dragon scents her through a portal to the earth dimension.  He promptly collects his imp and sets out to seduce her not knowing why he cares that she accept him and willingly take him.  He is distracted by his scheming father's sudden interest in having Tayla back and why there is a group of trolls also eagerly seeking her.  What is it about Tayla?Tayla discovers the truth behind her being taken by trolls and sold to the dragon and is determined to honor the debt, but there is no way she will fall for her captor.  She won't, she really, really,...she did.  But he can't know.  She won't be vulnerable to the arrogant male who must think of her as a possession.This one felt very familiar as it was part of the Guardians world.  In fact, there wasn't much world-building.  I think there is an assumption that the reader is already familiar with everything, but the newly introduced immortal dragons and maybe the trolls.  Not that depth is the strong point.No, the strong part of the plot is the action and the light, but passionate romances.  Things move along quickly or at least steadily.  The story is introduced enough so the reader isn't confused and then its off like a rocket.  The romance is scorching and formulaic like the series before it.  Arrogant alpha male and fiery female who won't be dictated to share a strong attraction and end up in fast and furious fight and love scenes.  This is not a complaint; just an observation.  I happen to get a kick out of these stories feeling familiar in the paranormal version of a cozy read.  I like that the challenges are mostly external and these are easy reads as a result.I enjoyed Baine and Tayla's story.  He is so arrogant and has no idea why she is being so difficult when he went to so much trouble.  And she doesn't seem to realize that his demanding, assuming ways are proofs that he cares and not that he sees her as an object.  He is one hot, powerful, sexy dragon and he knows it, but Tayla doesn't immediately swoon and jump into his bed.  The challenge is good for him and being wanted and treasured is something she needs after her father constantly used her.I loved that Baine's dragon side had several good scenes and was part of the action.  He is a powerful being and I loved seeing the dragon flexing his muscles so to speak.  I do wish that the enemies would have been a bigger challenge, but I guess that would have been tough since he was the biggest, baddest monster in the game.Finally, it was hilarious to have Levet be a crossover character.  And hey, he annoys the dragons as much as he did all the other immortals.  But he truly has the heart of a knight in shining armor and he so wants to prove it.All in all, it was a good start to the spin-off series.  It was on the lighter side though had enough action and passion to keep it interesting.  I would recommend it to paranormal romance fans, but those who enjoyed the Guardians of Eternity series would get more out of it.I received this book from Net Galley in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17UO91YQDL4CH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0986194913#wasThisHelpful","R17UO91YQDL4CH","A3MT311233OHMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MT311233OHMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can not live without this brush!  I do use bare minerals cocoa bean color for eyeliner.  You use the wide flat edge for lining a nice easy way.  Tap your brush in the powder and just touch under (or over) your eye lid.  Wha-la....done.  The long flat line of the brush makes an easy straight thin line. You can drag the brush a long your lid or rock it back and forth but it is effortless to having a nice neat line.  Smudge it a tad and you have a very nice smoky look!  The other side has the traditional small pointy brush.  With that you can wet it and use it in the powder for a bolder look.  I sometimes use that on the upper lid.  This end of the brush gives a very nice line as well.  Worth the money.  I have had mine for a good ten years and its still perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VKBW5P8SS5QT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037MERW0#wasThisHelpful","R3VKBW5P8SS5QT","A2A5C9IQ06CG9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A5C9IQ06CG9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Lovely taste.  I was told to drink dandelion tea to help with a detox / to clear liver.  Dandelion itself isn't all that pleasant but this is very nice. I don't think it needs any sweetener.  It has a nice nutty, slightly sweet taste on its own.  Its an easy tea to stay on that is good for you.  I do bring the water to a boil and let brew for at least 5 minutes but usually 10. It does not get bigger but you can get more than one brew out of a tea bag if you go with the five minute brew.  Its plenty strong enough.  I like a strong tea so naturally if you like it weaker you will get even more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JWW7POEMPMWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C6X6JAO#wasThisHelpful","R1JWW7POEMPMWX","A2A5C9IQ06CG9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A5C9IQ06CG9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finally, after a ton of other mugs THIS is the one!!  First it is a Thermos which says it all so why didn't I start there!  The interior is stainless not plastic so for health benefits alone that is a plus.  It seals TIGHT so there are no spills!  Best part...for HOURS it keeps your coffee hot as when you poured it in there.  It almost keeps it too hot.  Nice problem!  My coffee was still hot, not warm, not after four hours.  The instructions do say to warm the mug up first, as with any thermos. That heats the interior walls which hold heat longer.  I know it does make a difference but I haven't bothered and it still stays hot forever.Do not use any scratchy scrubber on the outside, it will scratch dulling the finish.  The colors are beautiful.  The lid does come apart for super cleaning and very easy to take apart/put back together.  This is the first mug I fell in love with. There is no dripping when you drink out of it.

"Note that this product comes from England.  I didn't realize that when I ordered.  They shipping TO you is more than fair and the coat price was reasonable. However to do a return (which I want to do) is on my dime and is about as costly as the whole coat was. While the company did say they would except a return and a refund, there is no offer for postage even when asked.  Understandable but if the coat doesn't fit you, you will be stuck.I really wanted to love this coat.  The body fits as expected for the size. That is pretty true but the arms are too long. I have average arms.The zipper keeps coming apart (nylon) which is very frustrating.  It isn't because it is too small an pulling. The body part fits fine. It is just a crappy zipper.  It does have a snap overlay over the zipper.  Still if the zipper is unzipped the snap isn't enough.The other annoying thing is the 'duck tail' in the back. I think the design is cute but the ties with the beads on them keep hitting on the back of the leg and drive me crazy!  I would end up cutting them off.The coat itself is toasty warm. The hood is lovely and warm although there is no sting tie to the hood to hold it in place on your head. I use a scarf on the outside of my coat to hold it up.Overall I say skip this coat.

"I visited my friends country home. Its on 100 acres of woodland in the middle of no place..in Wisconsin.  WI is mentioned in the book often.  I know we have a lot of reports in this state.  Still, that is someone else.  Until I went to this place!  The second we got out of the car we could hear 'owls' 'talking' like there were two of them talking back and forth to each other.  At the end of the 'owl' hooting there was a growl.  Ok, no longer thinking its a owl.  Then the rock throwing began. Just here and here and never to hit us but to get out attention. THEN was the very classic wood structures they build showed up the next morning.  To top it all off I found a lot of foot prints.  They were about 18 inches long. They were very active and noisy at night!  Classic Sasquatch stuff the more I read.  I naturally wanted to know all I could about them now. This book makes a lot of sense.  We weren't far from a crop circle.  I haven't been there enough to experience communication ....yet.  I think in our way we did.  We left good and sent love.  They took the food and left a toy (they they took from  the pool some time ago) and some rocks. We keep leaving food when we go there, they take it.  There are zero deer prints.  I have woke up dreaming about them, or was it communication?  I never felt unsafe. Kind of scared of the unknown but not unsafe.This book was like a guild book to our Yetis.  Hopefully you can have an open mind when you read it.  It makes more sense to me than anything I have read or heard.  And yes, the idea of killing one to prove they are real is horrible.  Being part of UFO activity also makes more sense.  They are more advanced than us.  Different in many ways.  Interesting.  NO ONE has put this viewpoint together and I do appreciate the work and the other way of seeing this.  NOW its making more sense.  Well done!

"What I got were velcro closing, fit like a glove to the paddle.  They cushion fantastic and help with blisters. I do wear gloves but sometimes that still isn't enough, so this is a very nice addition to strong paddling.That said, the problem I have with them is that I find my hand position changes on the paddle. Who knew.  These grips then are in the way and no longer positioned where I need them. They won't just slide so I had to un-velcro them and then reposition, then when the hand position changes, there you go again. That is the reason for the one star down. I was fussing with them way too much. Yet, I like the cushion.  I am wondering if I add a second pair to cover a larger area if that might help. The size of the cushions are perfect for most any hand size but not if you change your hand position.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R361Q7D3FPIL7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001MQ7V4O#wasThisHelpful","R361Q7D3FPIL7W","A2A5C9IQ06CG9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A5C9IQ06CG9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had tried Ecoquest purifier and loved how it worked but zero of their products lasted very long at all and cost three times as much. This is very similar.  Looks to be built better.  I LOVE the job it does.  I am currently using this in the basement because in spite of using a dehumidifier there is a musty smell.  I am asthmatic and have had a terrible time getting it in control.  My major allergy in testing was to molds. Well, yeah, especially if there is constant exposure to it.  A normal air purifier with just a hepa filter isn't going to touch it.  I bought this.  I wanted the ozone technology and the different way it purifies the air because it WORKS.  I keep my cleaning supplies on shelves that are in the basement stairs. (yes very old victorian house)  Every time I open the door it just smells fresh now.  Thank you thank you.  My asthma has taken a real turn around.  I rarely need an inhaler now where before I was using it all day (yes I know I shouldn't).I appreciate that the price is 1/3 of what Ecoquest was.  If you use this in your living area space  you don't even need the extra ozone feature. It does smell like 'swimming pool' when you use it.  It is said to sanitize all areas so it could have its uses in a bathroom or kitchen area.  I find that just is normal air purifier mode is magic.I will buy more.  Handling the basement is a huge project but its not a problem at all for this machine. I had the ecoquest in the kitchen and it kept the kitchen smells to a zero.  I loved that.  I will buy another MicroLux to put in the kitchen.The size was not a shock to me because it was the same as the other one I had but I don't find it to be that big or heavy.  Its all relative I guess. It is about a foot tall but that fits anyplace.I can't recommend this enough.  Proof positive to me how much my asthma has improved and this is all I did different.

"I have tried a bazillion shampoos.  This is THE ONE that works. I had three dime/quarter size psoriasis spots that were annoying beyond belief.  I had steroid shots in my scalp.  They worked for awhile then stopped. All other shampoos worked for awhile, maybe a week, then stopped.  This one I have used over a year now and this is what works.Word of caution if you color your hair... it will lighten your hair color.Save money and hair color: I just dab some shampoo on the spots, use that AWESOME scrubby brush that comes with it and rub the shampoo in the spots. I let it sit on my scalp while I brush my teeth first giving this a few minutes to sit there and do its thing. Then I jump in the shower, wet my hair and scrub (with the AWESOME brush) I do lather my whole head and let is set a little  time while in the shower but I use to let the shampoo be the last thing I did so it sat longer.  Saving color, I don't let it sit so long on my hair.  Its not a huge issue but it will lighten your hair over time.My hair is soft, not dry.  Other shampoos (especially prescription!) turned my hair into straw!  Not Nizoral.  Great stuff!!  Worth every penny.PS:  Scalp issues is an indication of something not in balance inside.

"This is a great price for MCT oil. Love the 2 pack. Now company IS pharmaceutical grade same as others promote.I am a huge fan of regular virgin coconut oil which is suppose to help with thyroid and weight loss. I used about three tablespoons a day as recommended.  While I have seen a difference in my skin and  hair I haven't seen huge differences in weight loss as I have with the MCT oil.My first week I have lost a pound a day and now second week I am losing at least a pound every other day. And.. I'm 60.  For two decades I haven't been able to budge my weight no matter what I tried.Here is what I am doing.I have three recommendationsOne: Standard Process Purification and Weight Loss Kit (available here on Amazon) There are a lot of pills in there and it may seem pricey but it works like nothing else has.Two: go see Dr Eric Berg videos on youtube.  He is a wealth of info and also has great products. Dr Berg talks about purification/detox as well.  He said that you have to get well FIRST and then you loose weight, not the other way around.  I found that to be true as well.  Once you cleanse your liver the weight starts to come off.  You may see no results for awhile even months but then all of a sudden it starts coming off.  Depending on what your health was. Have patience. Really keep on doing and eating the right things and it will come off.Three:  Use three tablespoons of MCT oil a day.  I split it up throughout the day.  I can honestly say I have done the same routine with and without the MCT oil and the oil has absolutely made a difference. I was using straight coconut oil in my shake or cooking my eggs in it (well still do that, its so yummy!)AM: Omelet; loaded with goodies such as mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, spinach. (not much cheese right now if any)or have a boiled egg. I have boiled eggs around at all times for my fast food.AM snack:  A Shake.  I use Standard Process shake OR Dr Eric Berg shake (wonderful and chocolate, LOADED with nutrition)In this shake I used the MCT Oil about on tablespoonLunch:  Small chicken salad, loaded again with goodies.  Use a light dressing!  You can use 1 tablespoon on your salad if you want.PM afternoon snack say around 3 or 4pm:  A shake, with two tablespoons MCT OIL.  (or save to put on salads)PM Dinner:  I eat about the palm of my hand size meat. I eat chicken and fish a lot.  Some steak. I am not as big on beef myself.  With that I steam broccoli and cauliflower and eat mounds of it. Dr Berg recommendations is to eat 8 cups of veggies a day. More cruciferous type veggies.  More above ground veggies vs below ground ( such as potatoes)Before bed: This one is just me. They say don't eat 3-4 hours before you go to bed but I sleep better if I do eat something. I usually make it a boiled egg. Something simple.I eat about 3 apples a day (helps clear the liver)There you have it.  It is actually a LOT of food and you aren't hungry and I really don't miss anything.  THE BIGGEST KEY IS TO STAY AWAY FROM WHEAT AND OTHER GRAIN.  Period.  Don't do it. I no longer miss bread and I use to grind my own wheat and make my own bread every week. Talk about missing something. I don't miss it.  My asthma is WAY better, no pain in my body, my skin (eczema) has clear completely up. Read WHEAT BELLY.  Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health by William DavisThe book will scare you straight.  Makes sense and I am living proof it matters.  Who knew wheat is GMO and we can't digest it!Other thoughts...as said MCT oil made a difference.  It is tasteless which helps a lot in using it wherever you want to. It boosts your metabolism.  How do I know.. because it makes me feel 'hotter'. I have no problem with getting the runs as someone was worried about but I think that is because I spread out the times I use it.  Using it before bedtime didn't really keep me awake but it did keep me too hot to sleep.  Its not like you will walk around sweating but  you are warmer.  In air conditioning or cooler days you won't really notice.Increase your B Vitamin intake.  That helped with energy and fat metabolism too. I used Nutritional yeast and put it in my shakes. Now Foods Nutritional Yeast Flakes (here in Amazon)  This is not a requirement but one more thing that gives a boost.The Standard Process products are top shelf.  There are a LOT of pills to take. But for once it mattered and I am dropping weight where I haven't been in over two decades as I said.  If you want to avoid the cost start with just the MCT oil and eating as suggested.  Be sure to eat plenty of food. Less is not helpful at all.  I noticed by eating something about ever three hours I loose much faster!!I have lost an average of 10 lbs in two weeks and I'm still loosing effortlessly between one half to a pound a day.Exercise?  If I can.  I haven't much because of asthma and being seriously out of shape for so long (being sick).  I have tried to ride my bicycle some or walk.  I love the Sunpentown Healthy Swing Machine with Swivel Disc by Sunpentown (here on Amazon $93 currently)  See youtube video on that one.  For those who can't exercise much this works wonders. The down side to the swing machine is it doesn't get your heart rate up or your lungs ( a plus in my case) but I do need to exercise my heart! So it can't be the everything.  It is considered a 'passive aerobic' exercise.  ""Aerobic means -With oxygen"" which does help to burn fat.  You can feel the tingle when you stop. Cool beans!Best of luck! I will stay on MCT oil forever.  Triple the coconut oil benefits?

"UPDATE:  What I have found from the MCT oil is I am WAY more alert and have more energy. I use one tbls twice a day.  My skin is glowing.Weight loss: Well,deep breath here it goes....I started the HCG diet.  HCG 2.0 - Don't Starve, Eat Smart and Lose: A Modern Adaptation of the Traditional HCG Diet And Dr.Zach LaBoube the author of the book is a good source to get the HCG as well. There are plenty of fakes out there.  HCG has had a bad rep for whatever reason but OMG I have been losing a pound a day, zero for saggy skin and I eat PLENTY.  I eat a LOT of food and I'm never hungry. I miss nothing. Even sugar. I am healthier than I have been in decades!! Basically I eat meat and vegetables and fruit. Not heavy on the fruit.  Nothing packaged. I do weight my meat. 3.5 to 4.0 oz. The book is clear and I really don't have a problem following the diet. This is THE best thing I have EVER done!! The diet is specific but I don't think hard. I LOVE the results.  Love it, love it! In 32 days I lost 30 lbs! If you need to lose more, after 45 days on the HCG you have to take a month break so your body doesn't get use to it and then do another 45 day round (or how every many rounds you need).  Seriously, you average a pound a day and I have MOUNDS of energy. Do I know if its the diet or MCT?  Well, I am more alert with MCT I noticed.  I think on the days I used the MCT I noticed I can go all day working my butt off  with plenty of energy. So I have to think it really helps!Original Review:I am a huge fan of regular virgin coconut oil which is suppose to help with thyroid and weight loss. I used about three tablespoons a day as recommended.  While I have seen a difference in my skin and  hair I haven't seen huge differences in weight loss as I have with the MCT oil.My first week I have lost a pound a day and now second week I am losing at least a pound every other day. And.. I'm 60.  For two decades I haven't been able to budge my weight no matter what I tried.Here is what I am doing.I have three recommendationsOne: Standard Process Purification and Weight Loss Kit (available here on Amazon) There are a lot of pills in there and it may seem pricey but it works like nothing else has.Two: go see Dr Eric Berg videos on youtube.  He is a wealth of info and also has great products. Dr Berg talks about purification/detox as well.  He said that you have to get well FIRST and then you loose weight, not the other way around.  I found that to be true as well.  Once you cleanse your liver the weight starts to come off.  You may see no results for awhile even months but then all of a sudden it starts coming off.  Depending on what your health was. Have patience. Really keep on doing and eating the right things and it will come off.Three:  Use three tablespoons of MCT oil a day.  I split it up throughout the day.  I can honestly say I have done the same routine with and without the MCT oil and the oil has absolutely made a difference. I was using straight coconut oil in my shake or cooking my eggs in it (well still do that, its so yummy!)AM: Omelet; loaded with goodies such as mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, spinach. (not much cheese right now if any)or have a boiled egg. I have boiled eggs around at all times for my fast food.AM snack:  A Shake.  I use Standard Process shake OR Dr Eric Berg shake (wonderful and chocolate, LOADED with nutrition)In this shake I used the MCT Oil about on tablespoonLunch:  Small chicken salad, loaded again with goodies.  Use a light dressing!  You can use 1 tablespoon on your salad if you want.PM afternoon snack say around 3 or 4pm:  A shake, with two tablespoons MCT OIL.  (or save to put on salads)PM Dinner:  I eat about the palm of my hand size meat. I eat chicken and fish a lot.  Some steak. I am not as big on beef myself.  With that I steam broccoli and cauliflower and eat mounds of it. Dr Berg recommendations is to eat 8 cups of veggies a day. More cruciferous type veggies.  More above ground veggies vs below ground ( such as potatoes)Before bed: This one is just me. They say don't eat 3-4 hours before you go to bed but I sleep better if I do eat something. I usually make it a boiled egg. Something simple.I eat about 3 apples a day (helps clear the liver)There you have it.  It is actually a LOT of food and you aren't hungry and I really don't miss anything.  THE BIGGEST KEY IS TO STAY AWAY FROM WHEAT AND OTHER GRAIN.  Period.  Don't do it. I no longer miss bread and I use to grind my own wheat and make my own bread every week. Talk about missing something. I don't miss it.

"I was another that read the book nonstop to the end.  I know for many abused children this is their 'normal'.  On some level you know that this is very wrong BUT it is 'your normal'.  If you are locked in a closet and told one and one is three and others will be wrong and tell you its two....then you learn that two and two is three. The part I am impressed with is that she could see past that 'normal' and be strong enough at a young age to stop. Stop the madness for your life and even more amazing is what you did with your life from there.  The story changes you.  There are still many that still think their abnormal like is their fate and there is nothing to do but keep trying to find love from mom/dad.  Or to keep getting in the situations that try to heal it from the outside such as failed relationships after another. Sarahs story is an eye opener.  There are too many closed doors that people don't want to see.  Thank you for making us look at the hard stuff and for those who need to step out of the madness can draw on your story to do so.  Especially the part where you went back to see your mother.  We feel obligated and that ray of hope that things will be different.  You did very well. I'm sure many lives have been changed thanks to this author. Note to author: Thank you Sarah for sharing the hard stuff. You are sooo beautiful in so many ways. I am very proud of you.  I do hope you have a ton of love and happiness!

This is far less of a review of his life than how he was a success.  I know I have sat and watched people at trade shows to see why a person went into this booth and not that one. Why did this one have a crowd and that booth didn't.  Michael did that with everything he did.  What excites people, what movement of that animal or person can he use in his performance.

"How smart and how simple.  Whoever invented this rocks!  There is no good solution as to how to store bags. I am a bag-a-holic.  I admit it. I am also a neat nick. I love everything in its place. This is it.  I have tried shoe holders and putting them on hangers. THIS is the final solution!First the straps on the door hook from the top to the bottom of the door.  If your door is an odd thickness, or too thin they suggest a sticky hook.  There is an o-ring on the top and bottom of a twill tape which is also adjustable.  Having the strap pulled tight from top to bottom there are 'hooks' that you can slide to the place you want.  For long handle bags I just place a shorter bag on the top. It is NOT just for short handle bags. It is so simple, no tools or super powers needed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OO1S51FPA592/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NBV9CO#wasThisHelpful","R1OO1S51FPA592","A2A5C9IQ06CG9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A5C9IQ06CG9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was traveling and forgot my shampoo. Yes, I looked in the cupboards of my host!!  (so ashamed).  Worse yet, all I could find was the dogs shampoo.  Hey in desperate times you have to do what you have to do so I used the dogs shampoo!!  OMG my scalp was fantastic.  I owe them a bottle. I'm not letting it go. I love this stuff. If you have scalp issues this works great for clearing it up and keeping it clear.Oh, and the dog itches less too.Another recommendation for people shampoo: Nizoral A-D Anti-Dandruff Shampoo . That is also amazing stuff. It will lighten your color if you color your hair.  Just an FYI but it does not dry your hair out like a lot of the dandruff shampoos can.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21A112N71X845/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037Z6VK8#wasThisHelpful","R21A112N71X845","A2A5C9IQ06CG9N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A5C9IQ06CG9N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Instructions are to put two coats on your natural nails if using alone.  If using with polish, put one coat on your nails, color, then use almost gel as your top coat.

"I had a kindle before the Kindle fire ( and I waited for the HD version) that I loved but was becoming limited since I also wanted to convenience of checking email and going on the internet, following links in a ebook etc.  I was so in love with my regular kindle and was a reading fool on that thing. I had a relationship with it. Lets face it, I slept with it more than I have any man. Lol.  Giving it up and moving on was not an easy decision.Kindle vs Kindle Fire HD vs Fire HDX.Kindle:  Love the light shining on the book rather back lit.  It is far less stressful reading.  The gray background allowed me to read forever easily.  I loved how easy it was to organize books. However, it had become limited.  I couldnt really surf the internet, magazines and pictures wouldnt work on it well and it was black and white.  Pretty sure you know the rest.Kindle Fire:  I dont by the first of anything because it will improve and become cheaper.  The biggest issue with the kindle fire was it didnt have a reader and I do use that often.  The front page was a bookshelf which is ok but couldnt organize like the reg kindle.Kindle Fire HD:  I hate the carousel on kindle fire HD.  Its a circle of icons in which the last thing you opened goes up there.  Want it or not.  You can delete from the carousel but something else will pop up there that is on your device. It has a set number of icons it wants there and it will keep it filled.  Grrr.  I wish it would just go away.  I liked how I could organize my books on the regular kindle.  That said, there are apps that make that happen so it makes life easier. You know there HAS to be an app for that!  Over all the organization isnt bad. Its simple to use.  My six year old can use it no problem. But then again, kids are born knowing these things today.  Being back lit vs light shining on the book isnt as easy to read as the original kindle was.  The back light can be adjusted way down which is a plus. I dont think this is a big issue to most people.  Im dyslexic and having dimmer light on the gray background rocked!  I could be a reading fool.  I cant read as long on this.  As I said though for most people that probably isnt an issue.  After my withdraw from my original kindle I love this one.  SO much more you can do with it!!  The battery doesnt last like the original but we are doing WAY more with this one than just read.  AND naturally there is an app for that!!!  There are battery savers that shut down what isnt needed and does make a difference in battery life.  Considering with I do however I think the battery isnt bad. I play music and a game at the same time or music and read, music and read.  I am asking a lot! I was use to the other battery lasting for weeks.  One plus is my phone charger works for the kindle.  Im just overall too happy with the upgrade to Kindle Fire HD.HD vs HDX.I got the HD with Ads because I didnt care to pay to not have them. Im really glad I did that.  I like the ads.  There were some movie and TV trailers that I would have otherwise missed.  Product ads you never know but they aren't annoying at all.My son bought the HDX.  He loves it.As far as I can tell the big difference is with the HDX you can have Wifi and cell towers.  Oh and the live help.  I asked if I could upgrade because it came out right after I bought my HD. The answer was no, I would need to sell it myself.  Im glad I didnt. I dont need to use cell towers.  Some might where they live but I dont.  As for live help, once you learn your kindle do you really need that?  I didnt for the price difference.  Last I knew it was a good $200 difference.  Im sure the price will go down, the HD will be priced at peanuts and it will all balance out in time.

"I had a kindle before the Kindle fire ( and I waited for the HD version) that I loved but was becoming limited since I also wanted to convenience of checking email and going on the internet, following links in a ebook etc.  I was so in love with my regular kindle and was a reading fool on that thing. I had a relationship with it. Let's face it, I slept with it more than I have any man. Lol.  Giving it up and moving on was not an easy decision.Kindle vs Kindle Fire HD vs Fire HDX.Kindle:  Love the light shining on the book rather back lit.  It is far less stressful reading.  The gray background allowed me to read forever easily.  I loved how easy it was to organize books. However, it had become limited.  I couldn't really surf the internet, magazines and pictures wouldn't work on it well and it was black and white.  Pretty sure you know the rest.Kindle Fire:  I don't by the first of anything because it will improve and become cheaper.  The biggest issue with the kindle fire was it didn't have a reader and I do use that often.  The front page was a bookshelf which is ok but couldn't organize like the reg kindle.Kindle Fire HD:  I hate the carousel on kindle fire HD.  It's a circle of icons in which the last thing you opened goes up there.  Want it or not.  You can delete from the carousel but something else will pop up there that is on your device. It has a set number of icons it wants there and it will keep it filled.  Grrr.  I wish it would just go away.  I liked how I could organize my books on the regular kindle.  That said, there are apps that make that happen so it makes life easier. You know there HAS to be an app for that!  Over all the organization isn't bad. It's simple to use.

"A fascinating book that is very dry and statistical in places.  This is more a case study in the origins and natures of homelessness and extreme poverty. This is not a down and gritty exploration of homeless people telling it like it is in their own words.  If you don't mind the dry presentation this book is very informative if very dated since most of its information focuses on the homeless situation as it existed in 1985. The book references AFDC many times.  Problem AFDC (Adult Families with Dependent Children) became TANF (Temporary Assistance Needy Families) with the passing of the Clinton era Welfare reforms.This book is a great snapshot of homelessness as it existed in the USA of the mid 1980's. The book accurately gives you insights into the causes and natures of homelessness and life as it existed for the extremely poor.  The book illuminates the suffering of homeless people in a very detached scholarly if abet clinical way. The book attempts to make the case for hyper liberal ""income maintenance programs' designed to help homeless dope addicts \ drunks and rightfully fails miserably at doing so. The book's only comedic element occurred when it suggested giving dope addicts money to live on but conceded that the author did not know how to prevent addicts from using drugs just to get their addicted mitts on free money.Oh yeah I can see taxpayers lining up to climb on board of building a program designed to give drunks and druggies money to stay high, useless, stupid drains on society. This was a fascinating book that was even insightful but when it ended this book is just more of the same hyper liberal air headed ideas that coddles criminals, rewards laziness and tries to humanize pathetic losers. There are some information about deserving poor in this book and what we must do to help them.  Unfortunately much of this book is just more of the same liberal garbage that brought us programs that tap taxpayers to help losers.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34PSWXSAWENQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GX5N2JM#wasThisHelpful","R34PSWXSAWENQE","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed reading this book and while I liked it much of what it suggests does not ring true in reality. Case in point I live in Towson, Maryland just a stone's throw from Baltimore City. Now Downtown Towson Town Center is easily the most walkable area in Maryland outside of Washington DC's suburbs. Go to any of the walkability websites and type in 300 Joppa Road, Towson Maryland, 21286.  You get a walkability score of 92 ""Walkers Paradise!""  Ok so according to this silly book the property values in this walkable area are supposed to be fantastic because; it is so walkable.Now I am here to tell you I call this area of Towson home and this is easily a walkers paradise.  There is NOTHING you could possible want that you can't walk less than a mile to get. No only do you have access to the highest quality food, pharmacy, shopping, entertainment, parks, festivals in summer, a 15 screen movie megaplex, a World of Beer and so much more.  I mean if you can't find what you want in walking distance in downtown Towson it simply does not exist. Yet Towson is dirt cheap. You can find a one bedroom condo in Downtown Towson for just $78,000 in an ok building. You can find a nice 1 bedroom condo in Downtown Towson for just $150,000.Best of all from these nice cheap Towson condos the best of everything is just across the street or at best 2 blocks away.  Heck in just a few years time we will be getting a Whole Foods to go with an already awesome mix of grocers and shopping. There is a 350 Million dollar Towson Row of mixed use Apartment Business Student Housing development being built. Lots of wild investment that is making downtown Towson a killer awesome walkable community by this books standards yet property values here are the best value in all of Maryland. The books so strongly suggests that making a community extremely walkable is so directly related to high rents and soaring property values and that is a bold faced audacious lie.Downtown Towson Maryland is likely the most walkable inner ring urbanized area.  The crime is not super bad.  We have lots of young college students who on average are very well behaved. Towson is the most fun place I have ever lived and it is getting better by the day as new venues are completed. Yet living in Towson remains dirt cheap compared to Montgomery County, Prince Georges County, Columbia Maryland and Clarksburg. Towson Condos mostly date back to the 1970's so you get huge floor plans compared to the tiny little condo boxes that sell for more down in Baltimore's walkable inner harbor. Also Baltimore county property taxes are much cheaper and parking is not hyper expensive because many Towson condos come with assigned, deeded or free parking. So while this book is a fun read it does not track that community walkability is always the road to higher costs of living. Downtown Towson is totally walkable and is still the cheapest quality community on the east coast bar none.  This book is fun to read but its suggestion that walkability equals expensive is just plain wrong.  I invite the author to visit and investigate Downtown Towson Town Center, Maryland he will see walkability done right and it is still a very cheap place to live.  We even have poor people here among the better off how about that!NOW I MUST WRITE A CAVEAT TO THIS REVIEW... Towson Town Center, Maryland only just became a walkers paradise a few years ago so it might not have been discovered yet. Almost every apartment they build nearby sells out eventually. New Towson condos still sell slower. Experts say nice places need to build to critical mass before Real Estate in a walkable area becomes super expensive.  I might just have moved to Towson Town Center very early in its price run up. Keep an eye on this posting.  If this book is right an walkable communities are the coming rage. I'll share my experience with you as the years progress.  The book might still be right. I moved to Towson because; I'm an old coot with cerebral palsy who does not drive so having everything I need less than a block away is a God send.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UWUCIJG3A4HW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008423170#wasThisHelpful","R3UWUCIJG3A4HW","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a normally very dry subject but this author makes the reading extremely enjoyable. My only caution is you MUST know a moderate amount about basic nuclear physics to get the most out of this book.  At least know your basic atomic structure, The Nucleus, The Electron, The Proton and the Neutron and how they relate to the A & H Bombs.  It would help if you also had a basic understanding of the Nuclear Chain Reaction and the difference between fusion (as in the process of atomic joining) and fission the (process of atomic separation).That said if you have the very basics I outline above well understood and you love reading about such things then reading this book will be both fun and insightful.  Building the H Bomb: A Personal History can at times get very technical. While the author does try to make this subject very accessible to the layman there is little this or any author can do to Nuclear science painfully easy to understand to those who lack a love and understanding of basic nuclear physics.Building the H Bomb: A Personal History does a great job of blending his own personal story and those he worked with \ around in a fascinating narrative that kept me reading to the point I lost track of time. I read Building the H Bomb: A Personal History on buses and in my doctors waiting rooms and when reality demanded my attention it was always at the expense of the pleasures I had reading this book.  I was engrossed in this subject matter quite unlike I have been in many books of this type. I really enjoyed the backgrounds that gave humanizing insights to such luminaries as Edward Teller, Enrico Fermi to name just a few.  Hearing about the old primitive computers with all their tubes, airs and graces also gave me many chuckles.  I am a computer guy so I know about the early systems.  The enjoyable thing till reading Building the H Bomb: A Personal History, I never had the insight provided by a scientist that actually used one of these tube driven, hot cable laden ancient computing beasts.On  so many levels this is a well written and fun to read book if you really love nuclear physics and the guys who made atoms for war and peace a reality.  Nuclear weapons are an ugly reality but I must say I am SOOOO happy the USA got the Super \ H Bomb in time to effective counter the then Soviet Union.  As for their being a Moral Nation I don't think there is such a thing.  Man fouls everything he touches simply because; he is not perfect and never will be. I believe in the USA not because; our nation is perfect for we are far from perfect.  I just happen to believe that our form of government allows us evolve as a nation that strives for a more perfect union or society.  The H Bomb is an awesome responsibility. I simply pray that we as a country and a world continue to be worthy stewards of the atom whose power we have collectively unlocked.This book speaks also about the demands the atom made on the moral fiber of those scientists charged with first unlocking then putting to use its secrets in weapons of mass destruction. This book hits all the high points of the development of super weapons from one who was inside that highly select and secret circle.  I have seldom read a book more spelling binding than Building the H Bomb: A Personal History so yes if you love all the things I share herein you will also love this book.  Building the H Bomb: A Personal History earns my highest rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNCHQTZHMMTSR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9814618799#wasThisHelpful","RNCHQTZHMMTSR","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Insights too the dysfunctional family that is North Korea headed by a great leader father figure. This book reveals the contradictions and just plain bat-dung crazy stuff that passes for normal life in North Korea. This is a personality cult that has bested Stalin.  Joe Stalin would have lived in constant despair and died with abject envy of the sick twisted police state North Korea has become.  Compared to North Korea Stalin was but an upstart a primitive novice at building a personality cult driven communist police state.  North Korea could have taught Adolf Hitler a few things about how to keep a people down using brain washing and internal re-education camps.  The loving care of the fatherly leader yeah right, reading this book is almost sickening not because it is a bad book but because it is so good.  This book reveals things about the daily suffering of the North Korean people that would make the normal caring human heartsick.  I'm an old gray autistic werewolf not usually given to the weakness of human compassion but in this rare case even I was moved almost to tears at the suffering of everyday North Korean folks recounted faithfully in this book.This book is awesome because the truth about North Korea must be told.  It is hard to believe the things in this book are true because no one wants to think humans could do such evil to another.  Read this book and you can taste the death and suffering in North Korea, every word has power within.  It is funny the South Korean Flag has the Yin Yang opposites and in reality South Korea is an economic powerhouse a driving force on the world stage.  While North Korea is hardcore Ultra Stalinist communist economic and social basket-case run into the ground by a succession of imbed family nut jobs. In its attempt to get atomic weapons a Pakistani leader said we will eat dirt and grass if that is what it takes to get an A Bomb.In North Korea the government literally made its population eat dirt and grass in its head long drive to get an A-Bomb.

"I'm pretty sure the information in this book is largely spot on because; most everything I read about North Korea is effectively the same.  There are slight variations but in effect the experiences shared by the different are largely the same.  That said North Korea is the craziest place on Earth.  If I hadn't known North Korea really exists, I'd swear the stories I hear about its government, its rulers and its history are the weird over the top fantasy of a kind found in Barbarella Queen of the Galaxy or (Brazil the campy Orwellian movie not the country)The books read almost like spy novels because; every aspect of life in North Korea reads like a James Bond thriller without any of the lavish accompaniments. You must learn spy craft just to live in North Korea because anything that does not revolve tightly around the Little Father Angel Darling Sweethearts or whatever the Fearless Leader of North Korea is called today is treason. For all my lite hearted flippant talk about this book it is compelling and sad to hear of so much suffering by just plain common folk in North Korea. Hearing of people starving to death hurts my heart to a point words can explain. Hearing of people so starved that they don't stand because doing so burns to much energy saddens me greatly.The really terrible thing is in the face of such horrid suffering we in the west are powerless to help North Korea working people because; the government would use whatever it saves to build Atomic bombs. North Korean communism is not the new communism lite like practiced in China and Vietnam.  North Korean communism is full on Brutal Stalinist micromanagement personality cult communism that punishes you if you don't clean the portraits of the North Korean fearless leader angel darling sweethearts past and present.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21HA2HAJ11TRM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BY4HXME#wasThisHelpful","R21HA2HAJ11TRM","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had some raggity old Formica cabinet doors in my living room that were the very definition of word eyesore. So I had the ugly dinning room cabinet doors replaced with awesome looking painters grade natural maple wood doors.  After the pretty new doors were installed they needed a closure system that made sure these rather large doors stayed shut,  A small magnetic closure system would not work because the doors these replaced had a small magnetic catch that never worked well.This very simple and easy to install design magnetic catch on this item did the trick very well.  The metal plate is easy to install on the wood door.  The magnetic body fits easily in the cabinet body and when aligned to the plate the door is held very securely.

"Light coming from the bulb that ships with this fixture is indeed the ugliest least useful brown almost pink light I've ever experienced in all my born put-togethers.  I mean this is some seriously ugly light.  The fixture is awesome I've had one just like it over my sink for what has to be over a year now without issue. This is a true metal fixture not one of those cheap nasty plastic fixtures that turn plastic yellow and get brittle over time The light defuser is cheap plastic but that can't be avoided these days.  This unit creates more than adequate under counter task lighting in my kitchen.

"This watch is a functional awesome machine.  The rubber watch band is a godsend for me because, I have severe metal allergies must be an autistic werewolf thing. ...joke... The watch is both big and heavy by most typical human standards so if you don't like a very big heavy watch then this is not the watch for you. Now I love a big watch and the weight that goes with it.  I don't want a watch so light I forget it is on my wrist.  Also I like a watch that has features large enough for me to see easily.  On those rare occasions when my eyes are doing well I can see the 24 hour clock embedded on the face of the watch.  The high contrast white on black face with a touch of red makes this watch easy to use and nice to look at.  Seeing the date in the bubble takes some training but it was not an issue. The watch appears durable and  having cerebral palsy means I'm not totally easy on any watch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BYYJSFWAT11V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ILN99C#wasThisHelpful","R1BYYJSFWAT11V","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The chair was easy to assemble but the directions weren't all that helpful.  The directions did not have particularly insightful graphics because the angles did not reveal the specific details needed to convey the logic of assembly.  I'm lucky I can look at the pieces and make pretty good educated guesses about how the chair should be assembled.  Trust me this is not rocket science but the assembly directions could be better.On todays scale this chair is of pretty much expected quality.  Lots of molded vaccuform plastic and foam seating. This chair is better quality because the hard (attachment) points in the chair that endure the most stress are a good grade of fairly thick gauge metal.  Remember this is still mainly a plastic chair with better quality metal bits applied so quality could always be an issue.  So far my chair is holding up well but I am a scrawny painfully ugly little autistic dude, I am not a big fat 6 foot 8 inch 344 pound bear like my brother!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MB8QBBUIHR1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ZGK80G#wasThisHelpful","R1MB8QBBUIHR1F","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Geography of Nowhere is a great book and fun to read but it is extremely dated material. If foretells of walkable communities but does not detail them at all.  Walkable communities are here in many older inner ring suburbs.  The Dead Malls this book predicted are here now.  A visit to a Dead Mall website will show in brutal detail the decline of the once powerful beltway exit enclosed mall. Cities as old and problem ridden as Baltimore, Maryland are slowly reinventing themselves as walkable communities in certain inner core areas like its Inner Harbor and Mount Vernon, Charles Village \ Northeast. The idealic world where poor live among the rich still isn't happening. The poor are being shoved out of Baltimore as middle class folk with fat wallets move in. Classic ghetto stores are being shuttered and replaced by trendy coffee shops, specialty stores and high end artisan selections. Ghetto people on fixed welfare and social security incomes alone can't afford a $3 apple or a tin of $6 tuna fish. It's not hate groups that drive poor people out its pure good old USA democratic economic forces pushing the poor out into the suburbs.That's the really funny thing this Geography of Nowhere book has a comedic bent to it that I would have love to see unleashed on the up and coming new urbanism and its displacement of the poor. This book says nothing of substance about the so called new urbanism or its ugly ghetto name ""Gentrification!"" The term gentrification like so much urban slang is both stupid and wrong. The gentry are generally VERY RICH PEOPLE!  The new urbanism folks taking back old cities aren't super rich by a long shot.  Most of the new urban class make about $100,000 a year which is NOT rich I can  attest from PAINFUL experience. New urbanist's want walkable communities and all the other good stuff this book suggests.  However the middle class is spearheading this trend.  The poor are being spirited away to former suburban sprawl areas that are increasingly being abandoned by middle class families. I walk around Baltimore and am frankly shocked at how so much of the city has been taken back by this new breed of middle class urban dwellers. I'm not just seeing white folk either. I'm seeing a mix of cultures and peoples the common denominator is not skin color it is a fat middle class wallet that is the defining factor in the makeup of these new urban communities.  The poor are uniquely and specifically unwelcome based on zoning and all kinds of other arrangements.  I hope an updated version of this Geography of Nowhere speaks to issues of the new urbanism and the hell it causes established inner city ghettos that ""Gentrify.""  For all the reasons this book outlines neighborhoods dating to the early 1900's and older in cities have a sense of built in community that is being taken back.New middle class new urbanites desiring 21st century functionality in a home routinely gut old Baltimore housing shells so old houses that stood for over a century often lose all their antique charm. Outside you have an old 1800's federalist house inside its all exposed brick, drywall and LED lights with the 70 inch LED flat screen TV stuck to the wall.  I wish The Geography of Nowhere had probed this fertile vein of social change gripping the USA social and moral landscape.This book is good in places but in a few of its assertions it sucks so completely that I can't forgive the arrogance aand obvious agenda of this book. The book has a few things right. The fall of the automobile centric society that spawned ugly suburbia has its days numbered indeed. I think in time the new urbanism will take root as energy becomes rediciously high in price. Cities used to be nasty dirty filthy mecca's of heavy industry which while profitable were no fun or nice place to live. Most post industrial urban areas have shed their former grime and smoke for air that while far from clean is not pitifully black with soot and smoke.The book has another prediction spot on that suburbia as built in the USA was and still is extremely ugly. Office parks andshopping strips, ugly fast food places each standing free like a ugly castle surrounded by its own parking lot moat. People crave walkability of the new urbanism. Travelling everywhere by car was fun in the 1950's and 60's because it was cheap and traffic was not all that bad. In 2015 traffic is always horrid and the suburbs have moved further from peoples workplaces. The killer cummute and killer energy prices have made 1950's suburban life unsustainable all these things in the book I agree with totally.Where the book goes horribly wrong is its analysis of the financial crisis, the real estate bust and how it relates to the new urbanism.  The dumbest thing of all is the book suggests we will become a nation of renters.  Everyone becoming renters is a stupid idea because; some people want to own where they live. Some people don't want to be slaves to a landlord you must ask if you can hang a picture ot buy a fish tank.Some people will ALWAYS want the freedom to personalize their living spaces in ways apartment rental will never allow. I wanted a high end luxury bathroom in my place not the el-cheapo crapolla bathroom that came with the unit. Some people want an open floor plan, some people like me have disabilities making typicxal designs unworkable. There will always be free spirits who will want the homes to be reflections of themselves. The book makes the coming new urbanism seem like an post apocolypse in the making. The new urbanism is not a return to Mayberry RFD with its simple stores, town center and friendly Otis the towne drunk.The United States adapts to the new realities of life which is the greatest collective strength of this country and not in any way its weakness. There was a time in the 1970's where every off ramp on the orbital beltway had to have a fully featured enclosed climate controlled mall. Then came the big box stores. The rise of internet shopping like Amazon.com put the breaks on all that old skool economic activity and redirected it.  People are still spending money in retail.  People are still making money in retail and other places. Are there excesses yeap but they will unwind themselves in time.This book chronically underestimates the USA's unique way of reinventing itself as the challenges that face us mutate and grow.  The real problem with this book is not that it is wrong because in so many ways it is right.  The real problem with this book is its perspective is an absolute total downer. James Howard Kunstler seems to have written this book in the midst of a total mind numbing depression where he felt the world was ending.  Yes the world of 1950's era endless suburbia is ending but I feel what will replace it will be awesome, different and better.What makes The Grography of Nowhere a horrible book is that it has an agenda that seems to say salvation can only be found if we return to Mayberry RFD type small towns with locally grown everything. Newsflash Mr Kunstler darling but the Mayberry RFD neighborly town is gone for good. The internet and Ipos, smart phones and other inventions have put the final nail in that coffin. Condos are here to stay for urban dwellers in new walkable communities who don't want or need the hell that comes with mowing grass, shovelling snow and the like.  You also fail to realize that inner ring suburbs will fare differently than far off suburbs that are not close to a vital city center.The peoblem is people have changed from your old village small town bygone world. I've been to meetings where people were sitting right across from each other and instead of asking hey where would you liek to go for  lunch they text  each other. The average person's relationship with others has been made fare more course, distant and inhospitable. What made old neighborhoods function in cities or small towns was we opened our personal space. Today we are paranoid, self absorbed and worried about keeping ourselves and or our families ahead of the rat race. People don't interact with each other in the public space anymore.  We interact with a select group of friended individuals on the private space of our smart devices. Community is not an investment in bricks and motar real community is an investment of time, trust, personal space and caring on a profoundly human level that paranoia and personal security concerns have bred out of the modern US citizen.The book is right about the fall of suburbia but when it tries to suggest a return to the town's of old as a solution I think this book is pure bunk. I gave the book three stars because; even as wrong as I feel it is the book is fun to read and right about the evils of suburbia in the USA. The doom of USA civilization this book seems to predict appears more the product of severe depression rather than scholarly introspection and research!","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIEHYAW8PE4HK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F7OM1HE#wasThisHelpful","RIEHYAW8PE4HK","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The only bad thing about this series is it died without a closing finalle that would have made this Friday the 13th an awesome collectors edition. Unfortunately the series just drops off a cliff with the last episode no closure at all. However that said this is still a set worth owning. Friday the 13th  had some awesome and funny things in it that had to be recovered.  Oh yeah this is not Friday the 13th  that tracks from the movies of the same namd.  This Friday the 13th references a anitique shop was run by what I can only call a satanist. Anyway the shop ower somehow ran afoul of his master and he, his shop and everything in it was cursed. The sick twisted shop owner meets his demise sort of since he makes a few reappearances during the three season run. He returns as the incarnation of evil each time he visits. It appears he becomes one of satans many stooges.Anyways good people inheirit this shop and make it their business literally to recover all the cursed objects sold by mistake and on purpose in the past. Each cursed object does something wonderful at first or so it appears but each object demands a repayment that is far more distructive than the good thing granted.  You get to see how otherwise good people and bad people get corrupted by the cursed objects. Once you see one of these episodes and know the formula the rest of the episodes will never shock you much. A few episodes have what might be called happy endings but most end with the possessor of a cursed object getting their cummupence. Some even richly deserve their vile end.The video quality is generally very good.  Thwe scenes are nice clear and crisp.  The color and saturation is generally very good.  The sound is very good about an 8 out of 10 in both audio and video quality. Packaging is good. Value for price is good.  If you enjoyed this series back when it was new there is really no reason not to buy this because; for its time it was awesome. It is not the X Files but it is nice in its own right.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EDKMR9PAPI3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002FLOTPO#wasThisHelpful","R1EDKMR9PAPI3D","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Tom is a neurotic wuss a man who is almost a loser.  I did not like Tom because; I saw way to much of my own hurt in him.  I've said the very words he does so many times.  I am known as an autistic werewolf.  Due to my autism I often felt exactly like Tom does.  Oh yes I had \ have issues big time and know it.  At first I did not like Tom as I saw ay to much of myself in him.  It was not till the nearly the end of the MY PARTNER THE WOLF book that Tom gave me a spot of hope.The Tom character was made far too needy. Tom makes reading the book a bit of a chore especially in the first 2\3rds of the book.  Tom just needed cheese to go with his constant whine!  These guys Sean and Tom portrayed the gay gym rat stereotypes to a T.  Thank goodness they did not exactly break down into the husband wife roles.  Both guys are real fully developed men Tom only just making the grade of man.  Tom is a bit more the sissy boy than All American Werewolf Sean.Now Sean is a total complete and absolute dream boat. Sean is the kind of man I'd flip so completely over.  If I were lucky enough to snag a guy like Sean I'd never be unhappy again in life. Were I to have a nice big man like Sean who loved me with such total unconditional devotion joy would overflow my ability to experience life.This is a well written book.  The characters are not wooden or poorly developed.  The characters are NOT complex but are written well enough to be ""REAL to me the reader!"" I say the book is predictable because; I know well the werewolf lore which gives me a very unfair advantage over someone who is new to werewolf themed novels. I'm an old gay guy who knows a lot about werewolves, shape shifters and the like so of course this book is covering well worn ground for me.  MY PARTNER THE WOLF almost follows my real life experience with my one and only life partner a big brute of a man who loved me totally.Reading MY PARTNER THE WOLF was like taking a trip down memory lane for me especially the ending.  The only reason I say the characters were not fully developed or complex is because; it focused too much on the details of their sexual life together.  Oh I am NOT a prude and the sexual elements were handled well. The problem is character development is also what gay people are like outside the bedroom and at their jobs.  A lot of your life happens on your job and how you handle life on the clock in time your job reveals more about you than  the bedroom does.  The book should have been more indepth about how these two men grew into a team at work. The real bond these men share is not just sexual it is the love, the trust, the sense of pack unity they share during the most stressful times at work that unite them as one.  The bonds of unconditional love and trust these men must share because of their job is so intense it is almost unreal yet the book does little to explore this rich vein of character development.The wolf pack like trust and loyalty these two men have for each other because of the nature of their work together is a threadbare side story when it should be more center stage. The police station episodes of the book play like a Barney Miller skit you hear station house humor and goings on but rarely anything of substance. I'm not suggesting that the books become detective novels. I'm saying develop the partners worklife relationship with the same intensity as is lavished on every aspect of their sex life together. I had a big 6 foot 11 inch BIG wonderful man in my life and everything thing we did in life was foreplay, every moment we spent together just made our special times together even more so.  This is the critical element that is missing in MY PARTNER THE WOLF.  The partners are missing this one vital aspect of their relationship that would take them from being developed to be complex.I gave the book five stars because; this is a new author a person who took it on themselves to give us an awesome work of werewolf fiction that is well done despite any improvements that coule be made.  This book WOLF PARTNERS is an awesome first effort worthy of reading and priase.  I encourage the author to continue this storyline because; both he and it show unique promise.  His werewolf is a big old lovable sort and yeah while such gentle giant gay men do exist alas they are extremely rare and beautiful creatures and anyone lucky enough to have one is blessed beyond any logic or reasoning this world can offer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HYBE468EHBCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NN6LEDU#wasThisHelpful","R3HYBE468EHBCQ","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like it even if the ending was a bit weird.  The story of Pinky the homeless guy was written very losely meaning his back story was strategically vague.  Pinky was a well edeveloped character but done in such a way that you could almost put yourself in his place.  Pinky is obviously a moderately well educated man.  Pinky was not a low wage minimum wage earner in his hayday according to his back story.  Pinky held a number of different jobs but for some reason just hit a rough patch and was down on his luck.  Pinky was not a crack head, drug addict or junkie.  Pinky was not mentally ill except for some depression.  Pinkie lost his family, his wife, his sense of purpose and his stability when he lost his home.  Pinkie is just a normal guy who fell from having a home into homelessness.  Pinkie is one of those guys living one paycheck away from homeless who ended up losing his paycheck.  Pinkie describes the brutal way his last employer let him go.Pinkie shares with us the day to day grind of being homeless.  Pinkie shows us how much work is involved in surviving as a homeless person.  Pinkie is a great book but hard as it is Pinkie actually does not show the true brutality of homeless life on the streets.  It is hard not to like Pinkie because he is just real enough to form as a person in your imagination.  Pinkie lacks the first hand gritty experience that would fill the pages if the author had really been homeless.There is a Kindle book named Homeless: one American story that is totally heartbreaking, it tells the story of a real homeless man.  It is just 99 cents but it is easily the best 99 cent book I ever read bar none.  Homeless: one American story is a real life Pinkie who speaks of his real life experiences surviving on the streets as a homeless man.  I am not saying Pinkie is not good and is not a must read but if you like Pinkie I'd also strongly suggest reading, Homeless: one American story.  Have a box of tissue near the end because; if you have any heart at all you will cry at the end of Homeless: one American story.I give Pinkie four stars because the experience lacked a certain reality.  Maybe it is because I used to help homeless people that I know Pinkie was a santized and less real version of homelessness.  Actually real homelessness is much worse  an experience than is shared by Pinkie.  Pinkie is a great start for people who want to understand what it is like to be homeless and as such is a MUST READ!  I just hope those with the heart to read Pinkie don't stop when the Pinkie book ends.  I ask that everyone who reads Pinkie please consider reading Homeless: one American story it too is a must read!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPTS1CUFI8VH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001E5CUJE#wasThisHelpful","RPTS1CUFI8VH5","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Joel John Roberts is without a doubt a good hearted man every word in his book testifies to the kind soul he has worked hard to engender within.  The author makes some insanely valid points in this book using a counterbalanced method suggesting how we can effectively increase homelessness.  This book as awesome and truthful as it is has a major flaw.  The people paying for all these awesome programs will not be the richest 1% who already make obscene amounts of money.  The income reditribution needed to finance this huge liberal lets house everyone and clean up all the drunks \ dope addicts and derrilicts campaign suggested in the book will be paid for by the dwindling hard working middle class minority that is increasingly locked in a battle to survive.  I went to college and suffered mightily to break the back of poverty and enter the middle class.  I don't want to pay 70% of my income in taxes so bums, drunks, mental patients and dope addicts can have a comfortable life at my expense and if that is politically incorrect to say then so be it.The guy writing this book is filled with noble intentions and I love him for it but all that admiration stops when he digs in my pockets  for the money needed to give every dope addict, every criminal, every low life with 11 kids and 5 baby momma's a home, supportive care, drug treatment and whatever else  they can conjour up.  Just like Obamacare helped the totally poor while hurting the middle class not the rich.  Obama's lie about if you like your current plan and doctor you can keep them is the biggest lie ever told making Old George Bush's Read My Lips No New Taxes seem weak indeed.No the ground sweel to make sure every bum, crack addict, heroin junkie and low life has a home first is the same way of thiking that got us Obamacare.  This book advocates that BIG government is once again the solution to the ills of homelessnness.  In a number of years the liberals will have so brainwashed people into thinking the big government answer will work we will get a program providing a home for every low life in the USA.  Every addict will be shooting up in a neighborhood near you.

The book makes an accurate casefor what it is like to be homeless in the USA and if you love BIG Government solutions to societies ills you will love this book.

"Ok yeah this is a truly STOOPID REVIEW... I brought this Haboglabotribin'  MP3 file solely because I heard it playing on my fictional car in Grand Theft Auto 5 PS4 edition.

I grew up with the One and Only Rhinestone Rockstar Doll Baby Baba BOOTSY, the master of Funky Things To Play With BOOTSilla.  This Haboglabotribin' MP3 has kept da FUNK I love alive.  Yes I brought this mp3 because I heard it as part of a mix on a fake radio station in Los Santos GPA 5 PS4 version yes I did baba.Yes I gave Haboglabotribin' five stars because; while it is not exactly FUNK it is so close as to render it Funkable add Bootsy to the mix and oh yeah baba it's Funk and nothin but the funk!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SIYSCV3SUOPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008H7RU9M#wasThisHelpful","R2SIYSCV3SUOPA","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Londo Mollari of Centuri Prime was an awesome if imperfect soul and he is well represented in the action figure on offer here.  Ambassador LONDO MOLLARI with Transport of Centauri Republic is a reasonably accurate version of the Londo we all came to know and love or hate and love.  Yes Londo was a complex man part clown, part ladies man, part patriot, part warrior and in the end part wise elder statesman.  This Ambassador LONDO MOLLARI is not a perfect recreation of Londo but it is nice enough and great attempt.  Included is a Transport of Centauri Republic which is a nice little extra with limited detail.If you loved Babylon 5 you will love this Ambassador LONDO MOLLARI with Transport of Centauri Republic because; it takes you back to your heyday watching the show and enjoying Londo.  If you did not like Babylon 5 you might just consider this a cute toy.  I am happy to add this Ambassador LONDO MOLLARI with Transport of Centauri Republic to my collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17CV5OZQMSA3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000B5GUIA#wasThisHelpful","R17CV5OZQMSA3P","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you can still find a copy of this complete set of the Rumpole of the Bailey then you are in good shape.  Audio quality is somewhat compormised by a very mild hardly noticable hum and hiss.  It is as if there is a tiny electrical appliance running during all parts of the program.  The noise is not really that bad.  What makes this Rumpole series nice is the author Mortimer gave little introductions to each episode that gave a bit of insight to the goings on you were about to enjoy.Rumpole was a old Bailey hack who remained always fiercely true to his man of the people ideals. I looked at my entire Rumpole series this set over the recent holiday season.  I was jolted by how much ""She Who Must Be Obeyed"" reminded me of one Hyacinth Bucket.  While our Hyacinth is certainly more over the top than ""She Who Must Be Obeyed"" the bucket woman does not lead by too much in the social climber department.The video quality is easily 8 out of 10 no artifcats on the screen.  The images are not entirely clearbut good enough.  I am watching on a 65 inch Samsung with 240 MHz and image enhancing software cleaning things up a tad.  The images are good even without image enhancing systems.  The colors are rich deep and true.  Flesh tones are fresh and correct.  the bleak rainy London days and nights are properly rendered.  Inside visuals of 3 Equity Court, chambers, court rooms and country side are all done well.  Colors are pretty darn near vivid.Audio suffers in that it is hampered by a slight buzz and hiss combination but I was clearly able to hear Rumpole's side bar comments to himself without trouble.  Rumpole honestly needs higher quality sound if the full awesomeness of his stories are to be enjoyed. The best moments of Rumpole happen when he takes his audience into his own mind for a cozy little side bar.  Rumpoles self talk sidebars reveal to us alone delicious little facts and tidbits about goings on.  I love when Rumpole calls us old darling or other such things.  Rumpole speaks to his audience as if he is sharing with us priceless insightful tidbits that only an old Bailey hack like himself would know.  Rumpole often shares with you the issues and interesting challenges faced by the people he encounters.It has been said that the newest Rupole of the Bailey on offer is substandard in audio.  This version I found had slight audio challenges at times.  For the most part this version of the Rumpole of the Bailey is understandable if you set your TV sound up correctly.  I found this a fun and interesting Rumpole Series Set that while not absolutely perfect was perfectly adequate in video and audio quality.  For sure this complete Rumpole series is superior to the new version on offer if the new Rupole Series reviews are to be believed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FN7K5P5Y5MQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0767088247#wasThisHelpful","R2FN7K5P5Y5MQW","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was going to buy this turkey before I read the reviews.  I even went so far as to play the Demo on Playstation Plus and it was uninspired and disappointing.My brother got duped into buying this Destiny and we found it is nothing but a cash grab.  The game updates making your previously purchased content obsolete.  The upgrades to enjoy the entire game is expensive to the point of being redicious.  This would have been killer awesome had it been developed with a strong solo componant.  If you have every bell and whistle connected to a sony system you will like the online multiplayer game at least until the next money grab requires you to upgrade again to continue playing a game that is not worth the continual upgrades.Destiny comes with certain content and features which are taken away by updates to the game and you must spend $19.99 to recapture functions you had.  Sorry but in my humble estimation this Destiny is the biggest cash grab rip off I have endured since Dead Space 3 which was made by the same company.  It is getting so I won't buy Activision Products because; the game you spend $60 for is more and more just a shell that you must continually plow money in  renewing features of games that are not really that great in the first place.  I know I won't get any love for this review but what I shared here had to be said.  If I lose my top reviewer rank for this I'm cool with that.  I believe gamers should get value when they spend $60 on a video game.  There is no way Destiny is worth the $60 they charge.  Even at $10.00 Destiny would be way overpriced because you are expected to shell out so much more additional money for in game perks and DLC.Destiny put all its hope in being a great multi-player game and the game infrastructure for a robust online gaming experience just was not there.  Add the steep cost of additional Destiny chapter DLC from a game that is not really that good and there is no reason whatsoever to buy this game.  I am really sad Desiny did not come with a solid solo game because; the controls were first rate.  The story was third rate to begin with and you learn nothing unless you go to the Destiny website.  This Destint makes you work too hard to play a game that at best is just a good not great shooter.Destiny would have been a great game as a solo or a online multiplayer but Activision greed ruined this game just like it did in Dead Space 3.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW2XCM765CCAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGA9Y3W#wasThisHelpful","RW2XCM765CCAW","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The sound is not so muddy as is the case with the first version on offer.  The other version is passable in quality but this version is much superior in overall quality.

"In the past PS3\PS4 Plus membership was revelent only if you wanted to play co-op game play.  Today Play Station Plus offers far more than access to co-op play.  I like the ease of storing game stats and progress information online.  I like the free games you get.  You get just enough free games in a year subscription to make the $50 investment pay off in my estimation.  The Sony Playstation Plus membership is not forced on you with the heavy handed big brother threat, fear and fire wall function feature barrier tactics used by other gaming systems.Sony has a better system in the PS4 and it also has a superior incentive driven system that for my money appears more friendly and customer centric.  My Playstation Plus experience last year was so much fun that I gladly re-enlisted in the Playstation Plus army once my first tour of duty was up.  I found a partery $50 a small price to pay for all the fun moments Playstation Plus Membership gave me over the past year.  I don't usually go in for value added services because; they are usually short on value.  I am not a co-op gamer being autistic I have few friends to game with online.  I love video games but, I have cerebral palsy, autism and other disabilities so my game play skills leave me barely able to survive in the easy games.  Hard video games I leave on the shelf forever.  Playstation Plus gives me additional ways to enjoy video games I am able to play.  Playstation Plus gives me games I can play FREE or at steep discounts.  Playstation Plus lets me preview a game which lets me see if it is a game I can play even with my disabilities BEFORE I sink big money into buying the fully unlocked version.Playstation Plus delivers on the one thing I enjoy most.  Playstation Plus promises me fun options and gaming opportunities and it delivers far more in value than the $50 I invest.  The Value of any Investment is determined by its longterm returns.  I must conclude that Playstation Plus is a GREAT VIDEO GAMING INVESTMENT!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OLNIKLWNJNM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RMK5QG#wasThisHelpful","R3OLNIKLWNJNM7","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Old Dogs & New Tricks was an online series that was awesome for what little it was.  I don't call this a series Old Dogs & New Tricks  was more like a lot of interesting and funny little skits.  The comedy was funny and hip but there just was not enough of it.  I can't fault anything about this little series except its tiny bite size episodes.  I give it 3 stars only because; I was left so hungry for more.  This guy knows how to portray the funniest aspects of gay life.  I woulds have loved 85 continuous minutes of this format without all the annoying breaks between the installments.I hope the makers of Old Dogs & New Tricks don't take my three star rating to mean I hated it because; the concept and execution are five stars solid the lack of finished product is a true and honest buzz kill.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29UDH3DDKGJUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3MXSW6#wasThisHelpful","R29UDH3DDKGJUU","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a gay autistic man as such I like watching good movies with well developed gay characters in lead roles.  It does not take much to please me when it comes to gay themed movies.  An interesting plot with likable characters and I will give you a solid nice review.  No Night Is Too Long  was so much more than I expected in an average gay themed movie.  I can't actually use terms like weird or strange to define No Night Is Too Long because; such simple words are wholly inadequate to the task of sharing the unusual intensity and plot twists that make No Night Is Too Long one of the best gay themed movies I've ever seen.No Night Is Too Long is by no way shape or means your typical gay themed movie.  No Night Is Too Long  is not about pretty boys hanging out in gay cruise bars, doing crystal meth or anything stereotypically ""gay"".  Yet do not let yourself be fooled this IS A GAY THEMED MOVIE where soft core gay sex is shown in very good taste.  This movie is not all about the sex.  These are fully fleshed out people who just happen to be gay.  Well one of the teo main characters is is sort-of gay since he seems to be a deeply conflicted bisexual fighting gay urges.The video quality is first rate some sections are dark but it adds to the moody brooding nature of the pacing and action.  The guys are for the most part good looking.  There is one down right ugly man in No Night Is Too Long  but luckily you don't have to look at him too long. What makes No Night Is Too Long  great is that the plot takes the most indirect route to its conclusions.  The plot is almost predictable because; the plot develops its characters to the degree they feel like real people.  Every gay man has likely met dudes like this if they have lived long enough.  I am autistic, gay and my social life is almost non-existant but even I have met or seen men like those in No Night Is Too Long.The sound quality is excellent too matter of fact their were no technical issues with my copy of No Night Is Too Long.  I had put this movie on the shelf because; I honestly did not think it would be that good.  I was ShOcKeD Outta My Socks when I watched No Night Is Too Long become one of the best movies I've ever watched gay straight or otherwise.  This movie took simple themes and made them very real very complex yet still painfully simple.  No Night Is Too Long  took me on an emotional roolercoaster ride I will personally never forget.  I watched No Night Is Too Long twice in a row just because; it woke up lines of thought in my own life I had never explored.  I could say No Night Is Too Long is essentially about a toxic relationship gone tragically wrong but it is about so much more than just that.  This is a must have in my collection movie no matter if I were gay or straight No Night Is Too Long is a total keeper. PERIOD!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8U9N5V0U2YX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GHP8SH4#wasThisHelpful","R8U9N5V0U2YX5","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are some really good cheaper coffee filters out here but not all the cheap filters are better. I happen to have autistic brothers who can detect the nasty paper after taste some cheap coffee filters inpart to the coffee.  You don't have to be autistic to know intimately the taste of a great cup of coffee. For the best coffee everything must be perfect, great water, great coffee, a clean machine amd quality filters. Go cheap on any of the requirements of great coffee and you will have coffee fit for a Barney Miller episode. HA Smile HA! I've never had a paper \ bleach \ chemical like aftertaste problem with the Mr Coffee brand filters. With some cheap filters I can actually taste the chemicals they use to produce the paper in the filter. The paper taste is not horrid but it is noticable enough to take away from the joy coffee and satisfaction great coffee brings me.If coffee is just a tool you use to stay away then you might not even notice the weird unwelcome flavor a cheap filter imparts to your favorite brew. However if you demand quality delicious coffee not just a coffee flavored caffine infused energy jolt then buy a quality Mr. Coffee filter because true coffee lovers will likely notice the difference. There are cheap coffee filters that give you 100 filters for the 50 you get with Mr Coffee.  However a cheap coffee filter can ruin a otherwise good cup of coffee too.  I am not big on spending money on name brand stuff but when I can taste the difference quality makes I willingly plunk down the extra cash without grumbling. Much!Why spend money on great coffee and a terrific coffee maker only to use garbage filters that ruin the coffee.  Some people enjoy saving money so much that dismal tasing coffee is worth it.  I love coffee and I want coffee made the best it can be.  If I am going to cut corners I find something else.  I need my coffee to make it through my day.  A good cup of coffee sweetens my mood and my mood needs all the positive help it can get.  These Mr Coffee 8-12 Cup Coffee Filters, 50 Filters almost assure a great cup of coffee and even the cheapest coffee tastes better after pouring through these awesome filters.I don't know about you but for a great cup of coffee these Mr Coffee 8-12 Cup Coffee Filters, with 50 Filters in every container beat all other cheap filters walking or riding.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34AR2F5HK5B06/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0005YWP5Y#wasThisHelpful","R34AR2F5HK5B06","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My neighbor has this exact coffee maker.  On my visits the answers always yes when I am asked Wolf would you like some coffee.  Their Mr. Coffee makes coffee so good that it just blows me away.  This Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Chrome is cute and small and does not take up lots of counter real estate.  Also I am going to be working from home 2 days a week now so I will need coffee to stay awake during work hours.  My grandparents had a Mr. Coffee maker back in the 1990's and that thing was a tank, that made coffee like a trooper for years without fail.  I think it was fully 9 years old when it died.  If you get a good Mr. Coffee you can expect it to last for years of trouble free operation.  If you get a Mr. Coffee made by the village idiot then you will likely have problems that is the luck of the draw.This Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Chrome coffee maker has so many push buttons and new fangled things but it does NOT seem like they loused up the ease of use functions.  The coffee is kept hot so you don't have to worry about it going cold.  The system turns the warming element off after a few hours.  Two hours is a reasonable sell by date for warmed coffee unless you work in public safety where coffee often grows so old it can stand on its own.  The coffee maker looks good too if you have a comptempary kitchen or decor.The coffee itself is still killer good IF you buy quality beans to start with.  Me I love the house brand where I shop one of them posh uppity stores that grinds your coffee while you wait.

"Great for temporary applications or if you just don't want the telephone people festooning your house with wire stapled to every surface.  Long phone cords can sometimes be the right choice when you need a phone in a location not easily serviced by a wall jack.  I am working from home via computer.  To work from home I also need easy desktop access to a telephone.  Problem is my telephone jack is in the kitchen my internet connection is in my living room.  I don't use the phone at my desk when not remote office working using my computer.This long cord works for the limited role for which it is intended.  This phone cord is also great for applications where you want to roam around the house but without the pain and expense of buying an expensive mobile phone with its custom base.  This long telephone line is an awesome temporary solution and it works fine for me.

"Ben Carson is a great doctor and a good man.  Ben Carson came from hard life beginnings but he had one of the types of mom's that inspire one to make a difference with their lives.  The DVD chronicles the life story of Ben Carson a man who grew up from humble beginnings to become a doctor of some note at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospitals.  The story unfolds nicely in the DVD and some parts are over-dramatized but all in all the story plays out well.In real life Ben Carson has morphed into an ultra conservative mouthpiece. Ben Carson spouts the conservative line which is fine since I value freedom of speech even when I do not agree entirely with what is being shared.  I understand where Ben Carson's values originate because; my grandmother was a hard core republican.  My grandmother also drilled into me strong moral values, personal responsibility and self reliance rather than being chronically dependant.In looking at Gifted hands I saw so much of my own upbringing and you can't augue with success.  My grandmother was a hard core republican as such she taught us all how to play the game of building for future success.  I was taught the the same values as Ben Carson. I was encouraged to dream big and let nothing or no one stop me.  I was taught I could achieve anything I set my mind to doing my race not withstanding.  While I did not do as well as Ben carson, I did do extremely well for a black autistic kid everyone felt should be institutionalized and forgotten.Gifted Hands has a great message that says success is accessible but only if you apply yourself and keep fighting for success even as avenues to success appear few and far between.  the message in Gifted Hands is both powerful and great even IF you don't happen to like Ben Carson's hardcore conservative politics.  The message of Gifted Hands is one of fighting to achieve success even when doing so is a struggle of epic proportions.  Gifted hands inspires those who watch and for that it earns my five star rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BTUH185TYISC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002D755AI#wasThisHelpful","R3BTUH185TYISC","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good but no cigar.  Citri-Strip QCG73801T Paint and Varnish Stripping Gel, 1-Quart is a good product but the results you get vary based on material, tempreture, humidity or lack their of and many other factors.  the smell is pleasant enough but does have a stinging bite to it as well.  Citri-Strip strips in layers so many applications might be needed before you get down to bare wood even if the paint is just a few coats deep.  You need a good quality scraper to get the paint off.  The paint does not just drop off with a light wiping. Using Citri-Strip is a bit messy.  This is an ok solution if you have a small area that needs paint removed.  Also if you are removing LEAD paint please take all the appropriate precautions because lead so easily make its way into the body,I worked and struggled to make Citri-Strip remove pain from one closet door and was tired as sin afterwards.  I looked for a better way to remove old paint.  I steamed the paint off doors and it came off in latex sheets.  The wood below was pristine alomst like new.  Steaming the paint off did not stink and was quick, easy and fun.  Citri-Strip is a must if you have wood fitures or scroll work that have many intricate surfaces that are not all flat.  Citri-Strip is great if you have small pieces you must have cleaned quick.  However for large jobs Citri-Strip is a real chore to use.  Drop cloths, clean up, time spent waiting, serial reapplications and smell just make it a pain to use on a large project.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S6LO6TB886S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QFCP1G#wasThisHelpful","R1S6LO6TB886S","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started working from home and my telephone jack is in the kitchen.  My home office is in my living room a good distance away,  I did not want the phone company stapling wires all over my house to get to the living room. I opted instead to get a very long phone cord to stretch from the kitchen jack to my living room.  When I am working at home no one is here but me so the long phone cord does not get in anyones way.I figured I might have voice quality issues with using such a long cord voltage drop and signal degradation but nope, the audio quality is first rate.  Since I have high speed internet with fiber internet is not affected.  The cord is reasonable durable so long as you don't mistreat it.  The connectors are of standard quality which means they will last forever if treated well.  I love this solution because when my work day is over I just wind the long cable line back into a neat spool and lock it in my file cabinet.

I am happy to order this Volume 2 set since Volume one has went out of print and now people want tons of money for it.  I'll settle for Volume 2 since my memories of Cecil the Sea Sick Sea Sepant are so stetchy at best, I won't miss volume one.Video quality is very good but not excellent on a 55 inch SAMSUNG flat panel screen.  Frame rate is good.  Audio is also acceptable.  Animation quality is good for the time it was created.  The stories are good.  I remember the stories as a kid but as an adult their are subtle adult meanings in some of the banter that I never picked up on as a kid.  You must remember that these cartoons are over 50 years old so you can expect some signs  of age even with remastering.  All in all for the money paid this Bob Clampett's Beany And Cecil, Vol. 2 is a good value for the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PJVE9GR1AJU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002DSP1KG#wasThisHelpful","R1PJVE9GR1AJU7","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pale Wolf is an apt title since it is just a mere shadow of Dark Wolf in almost every way. Actually Pale Wolf earned three stars I gave it four stars because; I plain flat out love Werewolf themed books period.  Pale Wolf has adventure but it is stifled by an overdose of boring family matters oriented domesticity.  Pale Wolf is a sort of what happens if you brought a werewolf home and tried to make it a member of your family kind of book.  It also hurts that the pace of Pale Wolf is slow.  When a book is fast paced details add to the real feeling of the events in the book.  When a book is slow and detailed it gets tedious fast.  Pale Wolf is tedious with details because; it spends a LOT of time in familiar haunts, breakfast tables, coffee shops and bars.Too often I felt myself saying please do something exciting already.  Pale Wolf was almost an anti werewolf book because; the affected lady spends most of the book trying to prevent the change from happening.  Amy who was written as such a strong awesome young woman in Dark Wolf is written to be a weaker sista in Pale Wolf.  Now that Amy hooked up with this loser named Gabby she is nothing but a milk toast follower, frightened and timid letting everyone push her around.Pale Wolf got the title right because; everyone in Book 2 is just weaker and less alive than in Dark Woif.  Dark Wolf fought for, grabbed and held your attention never letting you have a dull moment.  Pale Wolf is one long never ending dull moment peppered with the occassional werewolf.  I hate to say it but I enjoyed Grissom the villian more than any of the good guys because; all the good guys were either stupid or weak.  The Dad was love struck, Amy had been reduced to a dumb mindless follower and worse of all Mendes has been reduced to a weak stupid Nelly Woman who is unable to make a decision and stay the course.  Mendes is allowing the situation to shape her moves instead of making decisions and shaping her destiny whatever that is.It is as if the character development is rewriting the strong characters of Dark Wolf and making them pale weaker versions of their fully fleshed out selves.  The only character worth a darn in the whole Pale Wolf book is Grissom the bad guy.  Even the cop running Weepers was just a shell of a character nothing with bite.  Grissom actually carries the whole Pale Wolf book because; everyone else is so weak you almost don't care what they do or what happens to them.I like Grissom he might be the bad guy but he has a nice hidden agenda, he knows who he is and is at peace with it.  Grissom goes after what he wants and is not deterred.  Grissom uses his heightened Wolf senses to scope out the situation and always seems to be one step ahead of the weakened band of heros.  I like Grissom because; at least he stands for something.  The rest of the characters in Pale Wolf seem to just be ambling around looking for purpose and motivation.  You might think I am being too hard on Pale Wolf and if this were the first book I might have ranked it 5 stars.  Unfortunately for Pale Wolf Dark Wolf was strong, great its characters lived life and grabbed problems by the horns and fought them till they were no more.Pale Wolf is filled with nothing but whiners who smoke drink and do drugs way too much.  Pale Wolf is just a disfunctional family that includes a werewolf as part of its extended members.  Judged alone Pale Wolf is a solid four star werewolf story.  Unfortunately judged against its predicessor Dark Wolf, Pale Wolf is a pale copy of the original that merits only three stars if I am generous.  Pale Wolf is worth reading IF you really like a werewolf themed book but, Lara spends so much time trying to fight the change its like a werewolf's version of a 12 step program for lycanthropes who want to resist the change.  This book brims with WEREWOLF SELF HATE and it just feels psychologically unhealthy.  Denial is a beast no matter what form it takes and Pale Wolf is a book about a werewolf in almost total denial.  Sad thing is the werewolf in denial theme of Pale Wolf denial is so thick it has infected all the otherwise strong characters making them seem like feel good liberals.  The main characters spend most of the book running away from the challenges Lara Mendes poses.Pale Wolf is a Pale story because; all the fun werewolf life is drained from the main characters.  As I said Grissom is the only reason I finished Pale Wolf.  Grissom was the only character worth caring about because he owned who and what he was even if he was the bad guy.  Grissom owned himself and loved himself as the werewolf he was.  Grissom had no denial issues.  I am NOT saying Grissom was a Saint far from it.  But Grissom at lease was his own man and he fought for what he believed in.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NSF9R2SZNOYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APN968E#wasThisHelpful","R3NSF9R2SZNOYG","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Looks like this werewolf just had a true feast on a cold and blustery night.  He sits proudly on a mountain of skulls.  Well one does save the best for last doesn't one.  This guy is so obviously a werewolf and a gentleman.  As for the shirt itself it is standard Mountain High Quality.  It does not shrink too much but I might suggest ordering a size larger so you have room to grow and the shirt can shrink a little without getting too tight.  The quality of the image transfer is awesome beyond words.  This shirt has a strange almost luminescent quality in the right light.  The werewolf is well drawn and the attention to detail is first rate.  This werewolf is obviously young looking at his spiky fur which is too kewl for words.  You can almost feel the chill in the air with the clouded backround.  The copper like hint of blood makes one's nostels flare just looking at this shirt. This shirt is the difference between tee shirt art and ascreen print transfer.  This shirt rises to the height of art its not just some print.  If you love werewolves and I do this shirt is wearable art.  YOU WILL BE asked about this shirt.  It starts conversations especially if you wear it to work like I did.  I would in Info Tech so I can get away with it.  This shirt is not too bad.  The human skulls tend to be an eye popper but its all good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCMQRJTWR7RN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HGREJ2U#wasThisHelpful","RCMQRJTWR7RN9","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice shirt done on the cheap.  The material is thin and shrinks a giid bit after just a few washings.  The artwork is nice but the silk screening is barely adequate.  I brought this shirt because its message ROCKS!  In the land of We The Sheepople the shirt strikes the right note.  I was lucky I read another review that complained about how much this shirt shrinks and I sized up by a factor of two  3 stars for the message and a star off for the so so silk screening and a star off for the huge shrinking problem.

"I enjoyed Silver (The Silver Series Book 1) but its more love story than werewolf rich horror story.  This book would have been a kick but werewolf horror story but its romance theme always got in the way the minute things got interesting.  If you like a werewolf themed love story this is definitely your book. I'd rather my werewolf stories without the smothered in syrup goo this book dwells on.  Also the books variation of werewolf lore limits itself in that these werewolves are all born and never ""turned.""This book had a perfect opportunity to become a loyal buddy werewolf sidekick novel to offset the romance arc.  Had the best friend Brock been turned to become the new alpha's loyal trusted second this would have been a rip roaring werewolf themed romp.  This werewolf themed book is tame in the discription of the blood, gore and horror.  The story is rather predictable once you are one third of the way in. Silver (The Silver Series Book 1) plot reads like a linear video game you pretty much know where you are going but it is fun getting there.The romance scenes drag on and add little of substance and value to the story.  This is a solid little werewolf themed romance but its lite on the horror and heavy on romantic scenes that are in a word boring.  Why did I give Silver (The Silver Series Book 1) four stars because; I buy werewolf books for the werewolf related gore, fun and horror they stir up.  Bad as everything else is in this book the werewolves are an interesting pack.  These werewolves are slaves to uninspired writing but they are still interesting enough for me to care about them.  If the werewolf culture is drawn with enough detail that I care about my werewolf brothers depicted therein then the book is worth the read.I love the werewolves in Silver (The Silver Series Book 1).  I love the culture of the werewolves in Silver (The Silver Series Book 1).  I am not in love with the fact these werewolves are impotent in the fact they can't turn others ino their kind.  I just like the werewolf society in this book.  Oh yeah the one thing I thing is bogus about Silver (The Silver Series Book 1) and warning its a spoiler aleart here.  It's hard to believe the Werewolf council gers wiped out by Mason an ambitious welp alpha want-ta-be come on get real.  It would suggest Elder werewolves are soft headed and gulliable.  The feral nature is not a trusting nature hence everyone, everything and every situation is veiwed with suspicion and is dealt with in measures of caution, cunning or raging violence.  Silver (The Silver Series Book 1) does not fully understand the true feral nature but that said its still a good read despite its many shortcomings.  I'D BUY THIS AGAIN IN A BLOODY HEARTBEAT!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E3HDE7VABXNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006N52WVQ#wasThisHelpful","R2E3HDE7VABXNV","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this book from cover to cover and it is an ok werewolf themed book for what it is.  The best thing about this werewolf themed book is the werewolf is an unappologetically sadistic carnal beast.  So many werewolf books have the werewolf being something akin to social worker and so helpful.  trust me I love all werewolf stories but the werewolf as a politically incorrect hedonist SOB  who kills for fun, food and because he can is becoming more rare among werewolf tales.If you want a story about a modern day werewolf that enjoys killing sadistically and with reckless abandon this is your book.  This werewolf makes no appologies for its blood lust.  This werewolf  goes out of its way to kill  with savage sadistic aplumb.  This werewolf is a true born murderer and darn good at it too.  Another great thing about Werewolf is the book describes the carnage the werewolf creates in rather vivid terms, the narrative is not muted or politically correct at all.  The writer who obviously has a passion about werewolves let his imagination run wild.  This werewolf is not a lycanthrope hence it is not bound to the lunar cycle.  This is ok because; it is well established that not all werewolves are lycanthropes.  Yet all Lycanthropes are werewolves.Without giving too much of the story away this werewolf feasts itself on people from the southwest in States that border Mexico.  This werewolf is pretty much a glutton in that he generally eats what he kills, not always but most of the time.  This werewolf feasts himself on homeless, aliens and others who are not usually missed.  This werewolf has a somewhat narcesistic sense of itself.  This werewolf seems to think eating people is one of its absolute rights as a beast.The Border Patrol \ Homeland security rule book was very well researched which gave the book a real sense.  The entire sign \ tracking is explained in almost too much detail since it often slowed the process of the story.  I can forgive the authors dwelling on the sigh \ tracking too much because; it is obvious the author liked sign \ tracking.  Werewolf the book has only a few issues.  Sometimes the words are not well crafted as if english is the authors second language.  There are some spelling issues but, I don't mark hard on spelling errors.  There are a few places where the message being convayed is so muddled and confused by bad English that, I had to make up my own story to bridge back into the main narrative.  These issues are great but NOT unforgivable.  This is NOT the best werewolf themed book I read on Amazon.com but it is far from the worst werewolf book I read here.The cover art sort of symbolizes the quality of the book.  This werewolf is a true werewolf he is not politically correct.  This werewolf has no redeeming characteristics to recommend mercy for him in polite society.  This werewolf is a monster tried and true  through and through.  However like the cover picture this werewolf story is not fully formed it is NOT half baked but its sentence structure is not tight and realistic as it could be.  The lapses in English threaten to overtake the story but never really do.  Werewolf is a fun book to read for the most part because; this werewolf is just so sadistic and bad.  The characters are just well developed enough to make you care about them.  If this Werewolf book is a first effort it is a darn good one.  Yes the story lacks polish but, this is raw, sadistic gritty werewolf tale that makes your brain go ewwwwe as your mind draws the images the words convey.  If you made this book into a movie you'd be holding the arms of your chair not quite totally frightened but very tense ito the point of being totally on edge.If I could I'd give this book 3.5 stars because; I am NOT sad I purchased this book.  It is not polished, it does move slow from time to time and it has its flaws but everything considered this werewolf book contains an old skool werewolf.  This werewolf is killing, eating people, murdering people sadistically and most of all this werewolf is just totally lovin it.  Don't let the art work on the cover fool you this is no childrens book, unless you have children that are werewolves.  Oh and the page count is wrong.  There are many more pages and they are filled with a good story even if it needs a little work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO2RMX07ELQ6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JAPQ4JM#wasThisHelpful","RO2RMX07ELQ6A","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Best New Werewolf Tales (Vol. 1) was just pure awesome no two ways about it.  Reading these short stories was some kind of painful because; they were so good it hurt.  So quickly the characters developed and almost instantly I wanted to know more.  I wanted the drama the excitement to go on and on.  I was like a fiend.  I wanted more of each story.  The stories are written in a way that is barely abeit painfully satisfying.  The story basically takes you to the point where in each case the werewolf is fully revealed in all it's glory.  The narrative then trails off and allows you to fonish the story using your own imagination.  However each story is unique and intoxicating in its clever detail.  Each character is lovingly crafted in ways so awesome the readiung experience defies words.These are werewolves that have an air of accessibility about them.  I like this because it suggests what life would be like is regular Mr \ Ms  Smith every man \ woman had to deal with knowing or becoming a werewolf in real life.  The werewolf tales are fun and interesting.  I love how Best New Werewolf Tales (Vol. 1) trails off leaving the reader to complete the story in their own minds.  This is another dark horse werewolf book I did not expect to like and ended up flipping head over heels in love with.  These werewolf stories all pose fun what if's and ask what would you do in this situation.  For those who really love werewolf lore these stories are a thrill a minute.It is exactly because; these are story stories that the characters develop quickly and the pacing is both fast and intense.  For those who love a real intense werewolf themed yarn this is as intense a jolt of werewolf action as I have seen.  I found each story in its own unique way satisfying to the extreme.  Did this werewolf story earn its five stars heck yeah! I'd have given Best New Werewolf Tales (Vol. 1) ten stars were it possible because; they were earned.  Again if I had a limited budget for werewolf themed books this would be a must have.  Like I said in my lead in title I am looking forward to the Best New Werewolf Tales (Vol. 2) like a like a CRACK fiend HURTING FOR THAT NEXT FIX!  I'm being as real as it gets on this book.  I'm truly and totally loving it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CHGHX1UB1VPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BJFCN8#wasThisHelpful","R1CHGHX1UB1VPG","A1SDPA1J98UP4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SDPA1J98UP4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I use my Kindle lying down, so it needs to be stable.I have the Kindle 10.1  It fits this case perfectly and feels snug.  The band is easy to open and close and seems like it holds well.  If the band wears out before I upgrade to the next generation Kindle, it's cheap enough to replace.It's so easy to set up.

"Toshiba makes a really nice, lightweight, attractive laptop.Best PC I've ever had, so far.  It's worked well. out of the box.  Wanted to get Win 8.1 before they all come out with Win 10.My first ssd.  It would be fun to watch it work, if there was anything to see.  Pretty much instant everything.The backlit keyboard has excellent touch and huge letters.  Very easy to use.The HDMI port works fine with my Sony Bravia 32"" TV.  Picture is crisp.  Fonts are also crisp.There's a neat little charging feature through a USB3 port that lets it charge off the power cord or the battery even if the PC is hibernating, sleeping, or even shut down, I think.  Not sure if it works on all 4 USB 3 ports, but conceivable a person could get rid of a nest of charging cords.  It adjusts to the power needed for each attachment.The video card is such high resolution, the native resolution doesn't work for my TV-PC monitor.  However, it adjusted to the TV's resolution perfectly after a reboot.  And the card's ultra high resolution is a bit tiny for me to see on the laptop's native monitor.  I should have gotten progressive lenses in this last pair of eyeglasses.  Hasn't mattered to me.  I didn't buy it to manage photos.The included software is nice.  I never used that stuff off my HP PCs.  The movie manager was fun to set up with my video collection.  It even manages multiple-episode TV series collections.  I think one of the included programs will convert DVD videos to the hard drive.  DVDs are often much cheaper than the downloads, so I've bought quite a few.  I've been using WinDVD to rip and code.Can't find a YouTube downloader, but the free one online works fine.The almost terabyte ssd will be adequate for my needs.Update:  Has a couple fun power gimmicks.  SO much more cleverly designed than any HP I've had in years.  The power features have a ""Panel Open - Power On"" setting to avoid continually charging the battery if it's plugged in all the time, like mine is.  ""Panel Open - Power On"" is in the Control Panel power options.  Turn the setting on, unplug and use battery down to 50%.  Then plug back in.  It charges up to 80% and then runs straight through from the power cord instead of the battery.  Runs cooler, too.  I notice that over a few nights, the battery has drained down to 79%.  I'm assuming that the bit of battery drain eventually gets recharged.There's another setting where the speakers can be used with a line in, such as from a phone, even if it's powered off or sleeping or hibernating.  Maybe not more practical than earbuds, but fun.  Also the USB ports can be lowered to USB 2 to save battery.  Another thing it can do is charge phone, Kindle, etc., even if powered off or sleeping or hibernating.  These options can be run off battery or plugged in.  Neat ideas to play with.  What a great sense of humor those designers have.This PC has worked flawlessly for the couple weeks I've had it going at least 16 hours a day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQV00KBNF1CD0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQEXP66#wasThisHelpful","RQV00KBNF1CD0","A1QA8CFOV2I62J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QA8CFOV2I62J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One extra star for the tissue idea, which is just about impossible to find.  There are problems with this bag, but I understand a new model is coming soon.I am using this to hang off a side table by my couch.  Main thing I wanted was a small trash bag for general use and for sewing.  The tissue compartment solves a long-standing problem with what to do with a big tissue box.  I am using the more economical 120-count family size of Puffs.  The box doesn't cram into this organizer without distorting the organizer, crushing the box, and trapping the tissues, but the 120 count pile of tissues without the box fit fine and dispense easily.  If they start to fall out, all I'd really have to do is cut a couple slits and slide a strip of self sealing velcro or something.  I always get annoyed when things are designed for the small, expensive product sizes.  This organizer is obviously intended to be practical.  You can always make the tissue compartment smaller with a liner, but it's not getting any bigger.By the way, Puffs aren't the pop-up style, so they work great when removed from their box.The trash section is perfect for my needs.Trash part stays open, so it's easy to drop stuff in it.Extra pocket is a nice touchBottle holder is another good idea; although, I think it might make the bag hang crooked.The quality of the extra pocket and bottle holder could be better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P60L6AGHCLNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWQRC4O#wasThisHelpful","R2P60L6AGHCLNX","A1QA8CFOV2I62J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QA8CFOV2I62J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The accompaniment is full orchestra and just as beautiful as her singing, and it's well balanced with her voice.

Welds are excellent and blend in smoothly. I use it as a microwave cart, with a dozen or more simplehuman canisters on the other two shelves.

Holds my 60lb microwave-convection oven on top and probably 50 pounds of canisters on each shelf.-Solid top surface holds microwave sturdily.  The oven's feet would have slipped through a wire top.-Impeccable quality of every component - always my experience with Safco.-Very easy to assemble.-It's just the right height.-Condition of every piece was flawless.  I got lucky.  Others have reported problems (see packaging con).-No wasted space.Cons-Casters don't roll very easily on 1/2"" thick rug.  I won't be rolling it, so that's not an issue here.-Packaging could be SO much better.  Even a little styrofoam would help.  The paint work held up well, despite everything wrapped in thin plastic and left to bang around together.

"It's even better than described.  Heavy and sturdy fabric well stitched and well braced.  Good water protection on the roof.  Some reviews mention that the fiberglass poles hurt their hands, but I had no problem.  I did get a splinter from my plywood underlayment...I set mine up on a 3' x 7' piece of 3/8"" plywood.  The plywood is on an outdoor mat that happened to be available.  Ground cover below that is gravel.  Then I got four 2x3 sheets of Brock/Sakrete Interlocking Paver Base Panel.  Found them at Lowe's and HD.  $12 a panel.  Not cheap, but both stores sell them one sheet at a time, rather than that they be purchased in bulk.  I put two panels end-to-end under the tent floor and two on top of the tent floor.  Like a sandwich.  These panels have grooves for any water flow and holes for drainage.  They weigh about the same as styrofoam, but they are much stronger and coated with something.  Anyway, I like them.  On the plywood, I put D-rings at the corners and zip tied the convenient eyelets at the corners of the tent to the D-rings.  I used a strip of velcro to tie to that little tieback attached to middle back wall and hold it to an awning clamp on the side of my RV.  Very stable.My bike is a 20"" Schwinn Loop, but I've added a largish basket to the back rack and a longish mirror to the end of one handlebar.  It fits fine.

The two hooks on the inside back wall of the tent are handy for helmet and tire pump.One thing I noticed is that when the YardStash was in the sun for maybe an hour, it got quite warm and stuffy inside.

"Here is a link from Amazon showing the type of clamp (not necessarily the correct size) I got in the Ace Hardware plumbing dept to hold this mirror.http://www.amazon.com/Ancor-403752-Electrical-Stainless-Cushion/dp/B000NHZZ82/ref=sr_1_68?ie=UTF8&qid=1422999084&sr=8-68&keywords=hose+clampThe clamp I got was a little too large, so I put a strip of rubber spacer.  I can add a washer or two, if the screw starts to slip.  The clamp I bought has a nice rubber coating that grips well and protects the handlebar grip.  HOWEVER, the one I got had to have the holes drilled a teensy bit larger to accommodate the bolt end of the mirror.I've used this style of mirror biking in downtown Chicago for years and really love it.  It twists and adjusts to most any position.  Perfect size, excellent view.  None of that convex stuff to distort the image.  You're busy staying alive along the edge of the street.  There's no time to process a tiny, disproportionate image.I was concerned that the mirror would get in the way when I'm trying to hold the handlebar grip, but I twisted the clamp so the stem is mostly vertical.  The very flexible articulating function of the mirror positions it perfectly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JZE1KREJK9XM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Q40BCO#wasThisHelpful","R2JZE1KREJK9XM","A1QA8CFOV2I62J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QA8CFOV2I62J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My bike shop guy and several customers who saw it think it's a really nice bike.Upgrades, replacements and removals, before first ride:--Upgraded the brakes.  The plastic parts on it would never work right.--One brake cable arrived kinked and had to be replaced.--Changed out the saddle to a Cloud 9 based on the large number of complaints in these reviews.--Folding pedals are on the way from an Amz merchant (who is a SLOW shipper).--Saddle bag for on the back rack.  Just a little one to hold spare tube, tiny pump, gloves, pants leg straps, Y wrench, maybe a multitool someday.--Removed the fenders.--Changed seatpost to a Thudbuster LT (LT is long travel.  ST is short travel.  Can't imagine paying that much money for a short travel post.)--Added a lock and computer.--Got it tuned up at Cycle Mania, the local bike shop.  The guy has it running like a Rolls Royce.--Named it ""Winona Rider.""  Get it?  ""Rider"" instead of ""Ryder?""  And it matches her gothic look, which I've always found amusing.Shifting is the best I've ever had.  All 7 speeds work well.  For me the lower gears are a plus.  I do have hills, and I always use lower gears anyway.  My average speed is about 5 mph - downhill.  I've met bikers out in the desert who stop to offer to help, thinking I'm going so slowly, I must be in trouble.  In the city, I've met people who are amazed I can stay upright at my low ground cruising speed.  But I digress.A plastic bin will hold the bike folded in the car.  I'll cut one end to flap open on the box to make the bike easy to move in and out of the bin and to protect it from other stuff banging into it.  Hope not to fold it much to avoid damaging the cables.Speaking of which, that center fold is a little confusing.

"I use this almost daily.The removable egg attachment is too floppy, which drops a star.  The whole unit gets very hot and takes quite a while to cool down.  A floppy middle section can be dangerous.  It has to sit open to cool off.  Update to this paragraph:  I got the hang of this and don't have a problem with any of the parts.  I keep it on its own silicone trivet.  Close the lid and lift by the back foot and hinge where it's not hot.  Easy to move.  Very easy to remove the middle section and toss in soapy water to soak.

They're so tiny and flimsy, though, they don't hold the egg, cheese, ham well.  I can't find the Thomas sandwich size.  The Thos bagel thins are pretty bad tasting.

"I've used this a couple months now.  I had to buy a dolly with a handle to roll it around.  Glad I did.This machine does its job, but it has lots of shortcomings.  It leaks under the top cover down the sides.  I've felt it leaking while it's working.  It also sprays and leaks water from wash to spin and spin to wash.The manual is just awful.  The drain knob does not need to be on ""drain"" to run water out of the spin side.  So you can wash while spinning.  I load stuff in the spin side.  Shut it up.  Set on 5 minutes.  Spin out the wash water.  While it's still spinning, I turn on the fresh water into the spin intake.  After a few seconds, it usually drains out of the drain hose.  I turn the water off and drain till no more water comes out.  Turn the water back on.  I keep doing this cycle 4 to 6 times during a 5-minute spin until the water seems to come out clean.Lint gets under the agitator.  The manual doesn't tell how to pop the screw cap off.  I figured that out.  However, I can't get the screw loose.  Even under the cap there was lint, so I'm sure a ton more has collected under the agitator.The wash and the spin sides spray on each other.  The lids have to be shut to keep from splashing around the outside of the machine.  I have it on a large tray to catch any drips.  I also have it on a couple pieces of neoprene to prevent it from sliding.  It moves quite violently when it's working.  This is more noticeable when only one side is working, because it throws the machine out of balance.The wash side is nice and spacious, but the spin side doesn't really handle as much as the wash side.  A better balance of capacities would help.The washing agitation is quite vigorous.  Feels like the clothes are getting clean.The drain pump doesn't get the bottom couple inches of water out of the machine.  I roll it on its handy dolly to the back door and drop the drain hose under the back steps and let it gravity drain.  It still has some kind of lower level that holds water.  I can hear it when I move the machine to its storage spot.I bought a garden hose adapter for my kitchen faucet and then cut a 5/8""ID (inside diameter) hose to the length I need to run water to the wash and spin intakes.  A splitter would allow for two little hose pieces, so there's no need to move the hose back and forth.  My sink's too small to hook up so much stuff.I clipped a finch feeder sock over the end of the drain hose, which catches all the lint the useless built-in lint collector doesn't get.I'm having way too much fun doing laundry.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T3ST2NSMLI67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AW04ZMM#wasThisHelpful","R1T3ST2NSMLI67","A1QA8CFOV2I62J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QA8CFOV2I62J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Every once in a while, a book comes along that will stick with you long after you've finished the story. A story that will touch your heart and soul like no other. This is one of those stories--- the kind that'll make your heart bleed for these two wonderful characters while trying to find their way back into the world of living again. That they manage to do it while a slow burning love affair between them burns brightly, makes this story both just that much more heart-breaking, and heart-warming at the same time.The ""Vixen and the Vet"" is a very touching story about a forgotten war hero who has been living in complete solitude for the last eight years because of the massive injuries he had recieved while serving time over in Afghanistan as a medic, and a woman who has fallen from grace because of a man who played her for a fool.Savannah lost face in the world as a serious investigative reporter, but that's not all she lost. She also lost her home, her job, and her fiance' over false information that had been fed to her by none-other than her ex-fiance' and his father. Two men that she could trust to tell her the truth, when in fact, they were the guilty parties and not the colleagues they so thoroughly convinced her of doing the dirty deeds. Savannah Carmichael has returned to Danvers, Virginia to lick her wounds after being sacked from a prominent position at a high-ranking New York newspaper. The life and career she worked so hard to aquire was now in complete shambles. When shes suddenly given an opportunity to redeem her professional career by writing about the slighted town veteran, Savannah jumps at the chance to capitalize on Asher Lees story.Asher has all but given up on living a normal life, little lone finding a woman who can except him for what he's become. After being seriously injured in war, he comes home a year and a half after the incident took place, but not with the hero's welcome like he so deserved, that's for sure. He has no family left that he can turn to, he was an only child and his parents were killed when he was still in high school. Mrs. Potts, a former grade school teacher came to live with him to see to his needs, and when he came home all disfigured...it was Mrs. Potts who acted as his protector. His face is badly disfigued from the burns and broken bones in his face, his left eye droops, and he has also lost his hand and an ear when that IED blew up right next to him when he went to help rescue a downed fellow soldier. Everytime he went into town his looks made small children cry out in fear, and the people in town started to refer to him as a freak. Rather than being continually chastized about his looks, Asher had decided to hold himself up in the mansion on the hill with a life of solitude for eight long lonely years.I am not going to tell the story, instead I am going to say that this is such a beautiful and moving story, one that is full of love, laughter and heartache. It is a story you need to read for yourself to realize just how fantastic this story really is. I have no doubt what-so-ever... that this story will touch your heart, just like it did mine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6GUC9OJOCS57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L19SVQ4#wasThisHelpful","R6GUC9OJOCS57","A3IQ0P3M39IY8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IQ0P3M39IY8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't know why, but this story was so emotional for me. More so than any of Catherine Gayle's other books. The details were so painful to read about, but I DID get through it.... and I'm so happy I did. Razor was so brass in all the other books, but he sure redeemed himself in my eyes, that's for darn sure!!!Tori was sent to the U.S by her father to go to study ballet and also so she could escape a fate no one should have to bear.  Her father knew that that was the only way to keep her safe from the Russian Mob. They were after her and her mother so they could use them in a human trafficing ring they were running. She did escape, but in the process both of her parents were brutely killed. After her father was killed, her funds had had been depleteed, so she had to turn to doing things to survive that no one should ever have to resort to doing. After her dreams of becoming a ballerina came to a halt, so did her other means of survival. She heads off to Las Vegas to become a prostitue, but only because it was the only other way she knew of in order to make enough money to survive on. But the first person she runs into that night just happened to be, Razor, a man who took one look at her and instantly knew that there was more behind this woman's actions than really meets the eye.Razor was so sweet and understanding through this whole thing; he just made me want to melt. And Tallie, I could really kiss that woman for not only not judging her, but also for standing up for her when Tori needed it the most. I also loved Razor's mom, what a woman!!! I loved how Razor kept describing his mother's all business kind of stances....just too funny. But the woman had real back bone to her, probably because she could relate to Tori and what she had been through just to survive. Her and Razor's personal talks on the phone about protection was totally hilarious, too. I also loved Dimas and the way her befriended Tori when so many others turn their back on her. I can't wait to read his story now, because I have a feeling there's really something very deep & dark going on with him, too.As an added bonus, the early scenes in the book take place at the wedding of Babs and Katie, beloved characters from the Portland Storm series, and if you loved that series...then you'll definitley love this spin-off series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VVAB8ZNTBZ4Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012F0TOFY#wasThisHelpful","R3VVAB8ZNTBZ4Z","A3IQ0P3M39IY8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IQ0P3M39IY8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book hooked me right from the start, and the suspense was one of the best I've read in a while. But there were so many loose ends left unresolved by the end of the story. Things like: Did the Connor's mother really kill her ex-lover? Or did Donavon kill his father because he found out what his son was up to? Will busting this ring help find Connor's sisters baby? Who is behind all this illegal adoptions? Did Jessa lawyer really not know anything? Or was he just playing dumb? Did the real kidnapper really act all on his own? Or was there other accomplises they we still don't know about yet? All these loose ends just sort of left me a little disappointed.Now in all fairness, I do realize that this is just the first book in this romance series, and I have no doubt that we will be visiting some of these same characters again in the future books to come. So.... it is very possible that we'll get to see all these loose ends get tied up over time.I did like the tension aspect between the siblings; it's something that I have personally witnessed in real life, so at least for me, that part felt very real. My question is now that they know Liam is really Connor's long lost son, will they keep the little boys name the same? Or will they change it back to his real given name?Overall; I thought this was a really, really good book!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PIS4SS1TB35G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JIHAU9M#wasThisHelpful","R1PIS4SS1TB35G","A3IQ0P3M39IY8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IQ0P3M39IY8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked it, but I really didn't love it like I thought I would. The whole story is basically told in the first person, which I rarely like anyway. The story itself sort of drove me crazy with all of Carrie's thoughts being very repetitive. I couldn't wait to finish reading it - I think I spent more time skimming than really reading. In the beginning, I thought Adam was a jerk for ignoring his poor children the way he did, and I was happy that Carrie finally took him to task for the way he was treating both his children and his family.I did like little David and Oliva, as well as all of the other Fletcher family members.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R56A0ZA7KWXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NMD0Z0W#wasThisHelpful","R56A0ZA7KWXC","A3IQ0P3M39IY8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IQ0P3M39IY8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow! This story was short, but oh so sweet! I spent most of the time either drying my eyes or laughing my butt off, and sometimes I found myself doing both of those things at the same time. Cameron and Will are so, so perfect for one another. The precious few moments spent between Cameron and her father sure made me a blubbering mess. I knew Fred the moose would show up so I anxiously awaited his arrival although I did not know where or when, but I knew the story just wouldn't be complete without him showing up. Poor, poor Fred, I felt so bad for him and just wanted to reach out and give him a big warm hug.The big Abbott family is filled with so much love and support for one another; they are all so warm and big hearted that it makes you want to become part of the family, too.I am so loving this whole series, so far! The whole Abbott family is just as heart-warming as the McCarthy's family in the Gansett series, which I've read many times over.Can't wait to see what Marie Force has in store for us next......","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20754Z64E75A5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013Q700KS#wasThisHelpful","R20754Z64E75A5","A3IQ0P3M39IY8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IQ0P3M39IY8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"O...M...G!!!!!! This book was so FREAKING FANTASTIC! There were so many twists and turns in this story that it almost made your head spin. And truthfully; most of these I didn't even see coming. The suspense alone had me sitting on the edge of my seat, biting my nails right down to the nub. In fact; I think this book---as far as the suspense goes, anyway---is the best that I've read since Dani and McKenna first blew into town, after finally blowing the roof off of a major scandel that involved all those high profile and very powerful government officials. Not that there hasn't been some really fantastic suspense scenes in all the other books--- because there has been some real nail biting scenes in the past books, too--- but this one just sort of set my nerves completely on end, just like it did in the first book of the Bluegrass series involving McKenna and Dani.Of course it was fun to go back and get reaquainted with the town and all of it's residence again. I see the Rose sisters are still a force to behold, God Bless their sweet little meddling hearts... And of course.... just like in all the other books, there were lots of laugh out loud moments, too like: all the usual betting that was taking place at Blossom Cafe, and Hooch who made me smile throughout the whole story, the story line that involved Sienna meeting her mother, Kenna at the court house, and I especially loved the meeting that took place at the Rooney law offices. Kathleen Brooks always seems to outshine most other author's when it comes to having the ability to seemlessly weave a little bit of laughter into an otherwise, very tense moment.I knew there was going to be something very explosive happening between Sienna Ashton and Ryan Parker, after watching the way they acted around each other growing up, but never in my wild imaginations would I have thought it would be this explosive. Wow! These two were so hot together you almost needed to wearing firefighter gear to keep from being scorched from the heat they generated!It was great getting to know more about this whole new generation growing up in the wake of their parents footsteps. I can't wait to read more! And a big 'Thank you' to Kathleen Brooks for always keeping your books so freshing and exciting! You've done a very outstanding job, so far, and I can't wait to see what you have up your sleeve next!!!If anyone hasn't had the pleasure of reading this series, yet, I suggest you try it out now.

"WARNING......For all of you that are used to reading Christie Ridgeway's other more timid books, let's just say this series might not be for you. I loved all of her other books I've read over the years, but....this series seems to border more on the erotic side, especially this one..I wanted to love this book but I think the writer was trying so hard to make us see Bing as a bad boy that she sort of went overboard. Seriously though, all of his internal dialogues are of the sexual nature. So much so that I actually felt like ""dick"" was another character in the story. I also didn't feel the connection between these two at all. Alexa was this good girl, and I couldn't see what the heck she saw in him at all.It was okay if you like all the explict sex scenes, but it's not my cup of tea, for sure.

"I wasn't sure that I liked Samara all that well in the beginning. She just seemed so ungrateful for all the things people tried to do for her, while whinning that she had to do everything on her own because she had no one to turn to. What? Maybe if she wasn't such a whiny, selfish person; she would have made more friends. BUT......I have to admit that she did start to grow on me after a while.As for Jade......it was never mentioned why this child acted the way she did, but having a grandson and two great-grandsons who suffer from completely different stages of Autism---Jade's behavoir reminded me of the boys when they were her age.Logan is a saint in my books and one of the most likable heroes, I loved him right from the very start.

"Not having read anything by this author before, this book really took me by surprise.... but in a very good way. Meri and Trey together made me both laugh and swoon. I love a good cowboy story anyday, but this one was better than I expected. With Meri being a virtual city girl all of her life, I didn't give her much hope when she decided to head to wards her newly inherited mountain ranch in Wyoming, but I would have been completely wrong!!! And while she could be a real fumbling klutz at times, I have to give her kudo's for being strong-willed enough to want to learn how to do things all on her own, rather than letting these big strapping cowboys doing it all for her.Trey....who wouldn't swoon around a big hunky cowboy like him hanging around? There were many times throughout the story, when most men would have given up on Meri and just walked away, but not Trey. But then again; I guess Meri gave him enough laughs to keep him coming back to see what other precarious situations she could possibly get herself into next. Of course those heated kisses they shared probably had something to do with him wanting to hang around, too. lol!I also fell in love with a few of the secondary characters too like: Bandy,Trey's right hand man and ranch foreman, and then there was Meri's close friend, Samantha, and of course last but not least was Trey's sweet housekeeper, Consuelo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROY4E9MBTVRWP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SKCGY8C#wasThisHelpful","ROY4E9MBTVRWP","A3IQ0P3M39IY8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IQ0P3M39IY8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I loved this book! The suspense aspect of the story was a real nail biter, and because of all the twists and turns this story took, the suspense last almost throughout the whole story. It wasn't all intense though, there were a lot of laugh out loud moments, too, especially when Sally was with her over protective, macho brothers. Of course there's the great friendships between both the women and the men, too, and we get to watch Sally continue bamboozle more people into taking on rescue animals from the shelter. Heck, I think this woman is capable of selling ice cream to the Eskimo's! lol!Sally Gray has been surrounded by tall, dark, handsome men her entire life, after all....she grew up with three hulking brothers and a very protective father. So it's going to take a lot more than big muscles and a fondness for Irish Wolfhounds to make her fall for the man from Copper Creek. When she first meets Todd, she's not sure about leaving Max with him. The man is very good looking, but he's also seems to very disturbed by something. She has no clue to why he is the way he is, nor is she sure that she wants to know. But her first priority is Max, and to ensure his safety, she'll have to visit his ranch on a regular basis to make she Max is doing okay.Todd Randall had the perfect life; he had a very successful career as a commercial pilot which often took him around the world. He had a beautiful caring wife and son that he loved beyond words. Then in one terrifying night he was a witness to a horrible crime and suddenly everything changed. That was the night that Todd's whole life was turned upside down; the night that he lost the only two things that matter to him the most, his wife and his son. Todd has never been the same since. Then one day this woman shows up on his doorstep with the dog he has agreed to adopt from the local shelter, and suddenly his quiet, laid back life style is spinning out of control.This book was so emotional for me in many ways, but all of the hilarious antic's pulled by Sally and her friends help to balance this story out perfectly, for me. I really love this series, and all the stories so far have been so different and unique.If you haven't tried this series yet, I suggest you do so now.

"This book was so, so powerful! Two very lost souls who end up in the same town, still trying to heal their wounded hearts. Will they be able to help each other become a whole person again? Or is it way too late for them to ever find peace and harmony in their lives again?After being rescued 3 yrs ago, Dylan Bayliss is still suffering severely from effects of being a torchered POW from the Taliban in Afghanistan. And because of his severe case of PTSD, he can't even stand to have anyone standing close to him, little less touching him.  He feels like a totally broken man and doesn't think he'll ever be able to become a normal man again. And then he meets a woman named, Annie O'Leary.......Annie got pregnant at the age of 16 and married a 31 yr. old man that comes from a family of wealth. But the family cuts him off for marrying her. They aren't married very long, when her husband quits his job and refuses to work again. Right after baby Ruby is born, they divorce and he moves back home with his parents. A few months later, Annie's whole world comes to a stop when a major tragedy takes place. She has never had a normal life, and her parents are basically usless when it comes to supporting her. Five yrs later she has found a new place to live and has found herself 3 really good friends to lean on. And then one day she's introduced to Logan's good friend, Dylan Bayliss.Annie's not sure what's going on with Logan's friend, Dylan Bayliss when she meets him for the first time, but she can plainly see that this man is as broken as she is. What caused him to be this way, she's not sure, but maybe there is a way she can help him, and in turn, maybe help herself. It's worth a try, but is she really ready to open herself up to the possiblity of pain due to failing once again?This story had me laughing so hard at everyone's wild antic's one minute, then bawling my eyes out during all those sweet tender moments the next. I love the camraderie of all the friends involved in this series; every one should have a few supporting friends like these in their lives.If you loved the 'Montana Bride's Series', you will love this series, too!

By having these two meet and then grow from a trust worthy friendship first, and then slowly into a more romantic situation, just made it seem so much sweeter and so, so much more touching, at least for me.Now I can't wait to read about Annie & Dylan; this ought to be very interesting, for sure!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R357FJZSPUZMJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SUN4BC2#wasThisHelpful","R357FJZSPUZMJL","A3IQ0P3M39IY8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IQ0P3M39IY8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I know the author tried to explain his reasons for acting that way, but ...IMO- his behavior just seemed way to extreme. And the way that he treated Chloe everytime she tried to ask about his childhood or his house was so unforgivable, if you ask me.Other than that one point, I thought this was a very good book.

"Wow! I was thoroughly surprised by just how good this book was. I was drawn in from the first paragraph and hated it when I reached the end.  There were so many emotional moments, and I felt every one of them right along with the characters.I loved the closeness and protectiveness of the sisters, but I have to say Willa was my favorite of Thea's sisters. Lord have Mercy, she was such a hoot! I hated the turmoil between Calder and his brother, Peter, but then it's not surprising when you're dealing with a family member who is an alcoholic, but it came as no surprise to me when the source of the conflict in that story was revealed towards the end of the story. Those few very heart-felt, emotional moments between the brothers had me bawling like a baby. And also I loved the relationship between Marie and Peter, too.It wasn't perfect, but given the situation .....it was real.I really liked Calder and Thea together; and the fact that they had become good friends way before starting a romantic relationship, was a plus in my book..

"I'm sitting here in Florida and it's in the 90's, but the descriptions in these stories actually had me shivering. I loved all three of these stories. I think everyone should have the chance to live in a small town just like this one, where people cared about one another as if they were all one big happy family. I, myself, lived in a very, very small town growing up and it was wonderful.I totally loved the three romances from all three of these wonderful authors, they were so sweet and very emotional.

Wonderful job ladies!I would highly recommend this collection to everyone!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VOX91W9HHNW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSX2K18#wasThisHelpful","R3VOX91W9HHNW0","A3IQ0P3M39IY8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IQ0P3M39IY8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked this story. It was so believable, and the characters were, too. There were times this story made me laugh, made me cry, and warmed my heart. The only thing that bothered me was the ending. I felt after all that build up, the ending felt a little abrupt. Other than that, it was a pretty good read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FMX5KI1YUTOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N80T1VI#wasThisHelpful","R1FMX5KI1YUTOL","A3IQ0P3M39IY8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IQ0P3M39IY8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really enjoyed this box set. I had read about some of the San Francisco Carringtons, but I knew nothibng about the Island branch of the family. I thought that all four books in this box set were equally good. The situations and the characters all seemed very real to me, and the author made me feel as though I had been right there with them all. I could see the vibrant flowers, smell their wonderful fragrances. I could also feel the breeze on my face, hear the waterfalls plunging down from out of the mountain top, and see the crysatl clear waters and the bright blue skies.

"From some of the recent reviews, I didn't know whether or not to take a chance on this book, but I am soooo glad I did. I have to admit that  I thought Alexis was such a cold hearted woman, but as the story goes on we learn that Alexis has had some horrible losses and is just protecting her heart. Tyler however; was a total gem right from the beginning. He was tolerant and patient with Alexis, when most men would have just walked away. I wasn't sure I liked Alexis' family, either, but then after a while I realized that they were also hurt by the way their daughter and sister up and left for 17 years, without so much as a phone call or a letter.The only thing that disappointed me, was that I wished the author would have written a short epilogue at the end. I would have loved to know how things worked out down the road for these two.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IH250MOX5TX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OOZ2O7E#wasThisHelpful","R2IH250MOX5TX9","A3IQ0P3M39IY8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IQ0P3M39IY8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't like stories that continue to jump from the past to the present. I understand laying out the history, but to go back and forth with each chapter is just way too much for me.

"I started off reading this all out of order. I got Matt's story free from BookBub, and I liked it so much I went back and found out that there was a christmas book that was also free. So natually I had to get that one, too. By that time I was completely hooked, so rather than by the first few books seperately, I opted to buy this box set, and boy am I glad I did!Every single person in the Alexander Family are so warm, giving, and very lovable, as are those lost souls that they have taken in over the years as one of their own. After having read Matt's story and the Christmas story, I was a little bit disappointed in this set though. Not the love matches persay, but with all the over the top sex scenes. I'm not a prude, I love the Hot sex scenes as much as anyone else, but there were times in the first two stories where I finally started to skip through those scenes. At least we were warned about the story with Trent & Mara, and yes, I skimmed through that story, also.Other than that, though, I love this series!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14WVCRTG9TLRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GK37PIG#wasThisHelpful","R14WVCRTG9TLRW","A3IQ0P3M39IY8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IQ0P3M39IY8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The whole Alexanders family is so dynamic, you can't help but feel like you're apart of the love too! I love Christmas time and all the festivities that go along with it, but most especially, getting to spend quality time with family & friends. Eli has me a bit confused at times. He can help but think & worry about Kaylee 24/7, yet whenever she gets near.... he runs.As for Kaylee? I feel so bad for her because her life has not always been a bowl full of cherries. And that in itself will help you grow up very quickly. So, as far as I'm concerned? The differences in their ages should never have been a point of contention for these two.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5PD4OYWWK032/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GI3EDFQ#wasThisHelpful","R5PD4OYWWK032","A3IQ0P3M39IY8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IQ0P3M39IY8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book had me hooked right from the first page, and it didn't let up until the very last word. This book has angst, humor, sexy times, and love. What more could you ask for? I really like Penny, her character was strong enough not to put up with anyones crap. She knew what she wanted in life, and she went for it. My heart went out to Matt and all he'd been put through, but I loved that he still had the ability to make jokes, or at least keep his emotions hidden from his friends and family. Not that thats a good thing, but when you're somewhere trying to support your friends, it's not a good thing to bring them all down with you, either.Thankfully, Penny was able to see right through him, just as he did her. These two were a match from heaven.

"I loved this book! It's was a clean romance story. This story  also had a little humor added in, along with a touch of mystery and suspense. There were a few very sad moments in this story, but it's not the kind that would leave you feeling depressed for days. I think it was because there were much more happier moments to balance the story out.I loved Louisa and Justin, but I also liked all of the secondary characters, which for me is a big deal. But the thing that really caught my attention was the ending. I would have never ever expected anything like that. It really caught me by surprise, and I totally loved every minute of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQBVPHHH1MC9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E6QFG80#wasThisHelpful","RQBVPHHH1MC9Q","A3IQ0P3M39IY8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IQ0P3M39IY8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Do not bother with this box set, unless you love porno. It's a set of five books about nothing more than sex, sex, and sex.

"WARNING!!!!!!!This is only part of a book, you have to buy the next few installments to get the whole story. I really, really, despise that tacit, and won't be buying anything else by this author.In fact; I don't have any idea why there are so many 4 & 5 star ratings. This book was all about sex, thinking about sex, or talking about sex. Aren't these people suppose to be from a rich shipping conglomerate or some such thing? Funny, I never once heard them talk about their business. As far as I'm concerned, this whole dysfunctional family has got a lot of mental issues they need to seek professional help for.The book just seems to jump all over the place, and nothing makes much sense, except these guys love sex....all kinds of kinky sex with any female they can find. It read more like a porno flick, but even those sometimes have a story line, which was lacking here.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, period!","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PSXM84RGQK0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MT0UR3Y#wasThisHelpful","R3PSXM84RGQK0L","A3IQ0P3M39IY8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IQ0P3M39IY8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved this book! Stack is this big macho MMA fighting machine, who is easily taken down by a little bitty woman like Vanity. I liked the fact they even though she had lost her whole family, she didn't turn into a whiner. And even though she was loaded, money wise, she never flaunted it. I loved Stack's mad dysfunctional family and the network of MMA fighters he surrounds himself with. One of the things I especially liked was the close male friendships that Vanity has developed with some of the fighters. That's probably because I grew up in a neighborhood where there were only a few females around to relate to. Mostly our neighborhood was filled with these kinds of guys, only they didn't belong to the MMA, but they were big ole sports jocks. Being one of the biggest tom boys around, they included me in most of their sporting activities. So even after I had grown into my adulthood years, it was a lot easier for me to relate more to them than with the female demographic.I can't wait to see how the situation between Armie & Rissy works out. The way they were acting in this story, it ought to be very explosive! As an extra added bonus, Tough Love features a novella from Ms. Foster's Buckhorn series. This was also another amazing series by Lori Foster.I would highly recommend this book to everyone!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39O13YHEUO0WO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373788487#wasThisHelpful","R39O13YHEUO0WO","A3IQ0P3M39IY8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IQ0P3M39IY8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All I can say is WOW! WOW! WOW! This book is a little more serious than all of Ms. Graykowski's other books, but IMO- it's the best one yet. And that's saying something because I thought all of her other books were fantastic! This one though, for some reason just seemed to touch my heart much, much more than all the others did.In this book Ms. Graykowski tackles a few very delicate issues, and she does it with all of the dignity and respect they deserve. One of those issues deals with what it feels like for a woman who gives birth to a child, only to end up losing that child within minutes after their birth. Another is issues of both abandonment & self-destruction. And last but not least, is the issue of abuse. Lord knows there are millions of people in the world that has had to deal with at least one or more of these issues during their lifetime.But this story isn't all dark and depressing, far from it in fact. There are plenty of humous things going on, even though some of them happened to be laughing through while they are still shedding tears. The scenes with little 3 yr. old Julia were otut and out hysterical, and she also brought a lot of joy throughout this whole story. And of course there's Sweet Louise, and really....who can get too serious with her around? I love this woman to pieces and want to be just like her one day. She sure has a way of making those big Alpha males cringe like they're just little school girls. We also got to re-visit with some of our other favorite characters in the past books, as well as meeting a few new ones along the way.I can almost guarantee you that this book we have you laughing one minute, and crying the next.Debra Covington was raised in a rich, but loveless household. But one day after defying her hard-core father's wishes, she is sent out on the streets with nothing more than the clothes on her back. And she was pregnant to boot! Who does that to their own child? Nine months later after having lost her baby, the man she loves, the respect of her father, and her favorite Aunt.....she sets out on a life of self- destruction. Over the next 10 years Debra continues to blame herself for everything. I was so engrossed with this character that I felt like just wanted to reach through the pages and give Debra a huge bear hug, as she was going through all of this.I couldn't really blame Warren for his part in all of this. He was young and had the whole world on his shoulders at the time. Besides; Debra's father completely lied to the guy, and more than once! In the end, Warren turned out to be perfect for Debra. Okay maybe he was just a little bit flawed in his way of thinking, but after finding out the whole truth......he really started working very hard to make their relationship work.It's no surprise that Katie Graykowski has become one of my favorite author's. Her stories will warm your heart, and having you rolling with laughter. Her characters are always funny, lovable, and can even become downright awkward at times, but always such a joy to read about.I would HIGHLY recommend not only this book, but this whole series, to everyone!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FUPCS8UT6IW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013994MPC#wasThisHelpful","R3FUPCS8UT6IW3","A3IQ0P3M39IY8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IQ0P3M39IY8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked this book, but I didn't quite love it.First let me list the things I did like:*I thought that Rebecca and Patrick were very likable characters, and I also fell in love with those little kiddo's, too.*I like the fact that Rebecca wasn't some weak whiny heroine. She was a strong, smart, beautiful young woman raising her daughter on her own, and needed no one to fend for her.*Patrick had a very dangerous job as a Navy Seal, but he was also a very dedicated father, who was also left on his own to raise his young son. In some cases with a death of a parent or even when a divorce takes place, the surviving parent usually cuts ties with the other grandparents. But that didn't happen in this case, which was a very nice change.*I loved the undeniable chemistry between Rebecca and Patrick. They were both acted very mature, and didn't make any moves without taking in the consideration of how their actions would affect their childrens lives.Now having said that, this is the things that bothered me:*This book was listed as a Romantic/ Suspense, but as far as I'm concerned the suspense part of the story was very, very weak. It was like it was almost over and done with, before it really even really got started.* And while I loved the story line, the ending left a little bit to be desired. It just felt so rushed. I couldn't believe when I turned the page and it was over. I went back thinking I must have missed a few pages, but nope...it just ended. There was somewhat of an HEA, I guess. It just wasn't what I thought it should be.Over all, though, I think this was still a pretty good read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R47VIP9IQOQIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XLUEMYQ#wasThisHelpful","R47VIP9IQOQIZ","A3IQ0P3M39IY8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IQ0P3M39IY8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been waiting for this book for what seems forever. Ty and Hailey have generated so much spark and innuendos in all of the other books. So much so that you just knew there was something going on between the two of them. But I never expected this book to be so HOT!!!! It was also funny, and at times, very heart-breaking.Ty always seemed so playful and mischievous; the complete opposite of the up tight Hailey, for sure. Therefore, I couldn't figure out how these two characters could ever meld together, but now I do.At first I wasn't too crazy about Hailey, but she sort of grew on me as times passed. After reading this book, she's one of my favorite characters, so far in this series....other than Kathy that is. ;)Kathy, Ty's mother, just cracks me up! She's the kind of mother that never pulls any punches when telling her kids just how it is, but she's the kind of mother everyone dreams of having. The scene on the back doorstep on that first early Sunday morning, had me rolling on the floor with laughter. I guess this woman really had her work cut out for her, after raising those 4 HOT Bennett boys. Whew!!!Loved this book, but moreover; I love this whole series.

"Robyn Carr books are like no other. She has a way of pulling you in, and making you feel like you are part of the story. She seems to really excel when it comes to small town settings, and this series is no exception. She writes about such unique characters, all of facing real-life problems while dealing with all their own emotions and fears. I love all these characters because they all seem to have the same hopes and dreams that each of us can relate to. And in just like her 'Virgin River Series', this series she has once again created another beautiful, emotionally compelling snapshot of life in the close-knit community, only this time the setting takes place in Thunder Point, Oregon.At first I sort of felt so sorry for Lin Su, but when she started playing the ""mommy"" card with Charlie I lost all respect for her. She's just lucky Charlie didn't run away, or worse. So she didn't have the greatest childhood, she's far being alone in that aspect. And I'm sure getting pregnant and having no family support must have been hard on her, but there are thousands of other women in the world that have had it just as bad, or even worse, and they don't act that way.I did however; love the character of Blake. IMO- He had it so much worse than Lin Su ever did. But rather than acting like a crazed person, he not only pulls himself up by his boot strings and makes something of himself, he also starts a program that reaches out to help kids that are living in simular situations.It is always fun visiting Thunder Point again. We get revisited some of our favorite characters from the other eight books in the series, and we were able to catch up on their lives.Now I can't wait for the next book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L891Q2P1AOUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXM1FKA#wasThisHelpful","R1L891Q2P1AOUC","A3IQ0P3M39IY8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IQ0P3M39IY8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This story might have been short, but it lacked for nothing. It was a quick moving story and it kept my attention all the way through. Annamae is a great character, she had an inner strength about her. I can't say I blamed her from running away the way she did. The lack of privacy would have drove me crazy within a week's time, and she had put up with it most of her life.I thought that Wynn was very interesting in his own kind of way.  Being a cop and hiding out in a small town, the last thing he needs is cameras pointed his way. After all; he's in hiding until he has to testify against a mob kingpin. When Annamae had shown up unexpectedly like she did, he realizes the best way to keep everything contained is by keeping her close.The hot chemistry between the two of them was so undeniable right from the very start, so of course it really doesn't take long after that before things heat up very quickly between the two them.I have to say; I fell in love her feisty grandmother. She wasn't afraid to speak the truth no matter what, or who it involved. She was also a very hip when it came to the younger generation.

"I really, really enjoyed this box set. I also found a few really, really good author's that I hadn't heard of before, and will be checking out their other works in the near future. I know some of you have reviewed a few of the books in this set, but I thought I would break them all down for those of you who may be on the fence about buying this box set. So here's my reviews for all the books in this set.Having My Baby---By Theresa Ragan  I gave this story 5 stars, it was just that good!This was such a cute story with a few good laughs along the way. While in college a struggling Derrick Baylor opted to donate his blood to the local blood bank and his seman to the CryoCorp company for extra money to hold him over. Almost immediate afterwards he had huge change of heart and had immediately wrote a letter telling them to remove him from their donor list and had also included the money they had given him. He thought all was well; until he recieved another letter years later stating that the sperm he had donated had been sold.Jill Garrison never expected the annoynous sperm donor to show up wanteing to lay claim to her unborn child, but that's exactly what happened when she was only a few weeks away from her due date. The shock of having a strange man show up at a park where her and her friends were gathered, threw Jill into a tizzy. She passes out and then if that wasn't bad enough, her water broke sending her into an early labor.This story ends up in a battle of wills, but who will win? Will it be Derrick? Jill? Or will they all win in the end?Getting Lucky--by Katie Graykowski  I would give this story a 10 plus star rating if I could, it's just that good!This story is so heart-breaking, but also very funny at the same time. Sounds weird, I know, but you'll just have to read it to see what I mean. Lucky's two long time friends Betts and Charlie, and the woman known as Mama, is so dang hysterical! The three little girls will also surely melt your heart, and if that doesn't peak your interest, I'm sure the sparks that fly between Will and Lucky will do the trick.Lucky Strickland was married to a music star for seventeen years. All she ever really wanted though was for him to love her and raise a big family together. But that didn't happen because she found out that she had Cervicle Cancer and had to have an emergency Hysterectomy. So imagine her shock when she learns on live T.V no less, that her now deased husband had been living a double life since the day they were first married. Not only did he cheat on her with his long time mistress, but they had three daughters together. Then the biggest shock of all came, when the will was read and she found out that she was left viturally broke and all alone. Her cheating husband had left everything they had left---well  except the contents of her personal closet---to the three children he left behind.THE MEMORY OF YOU--  BY Laurie Kellogg--- I give this a 5 star rating, also.For me this was a very powerful story that really hit home. I grew up in the era of the Veitnam War, and several of my friends lives were either lost in that battle, or they came back as totally different people. The soldiers of today don't get the best support from the government or the people, but back then those soldiers were hated by most of the public, and left hanging out to dry so to speak, by our own Goverment officials who sent them there in the first place. Sad I know, but oh so true.For those of us who remember Operation Homecoming, it's a reminder of what our brave veterans endured without hitting us over the head with it. This story was very funny in some places, and very, very heart-rending in others. But the heart-warming tales of Abby, Matt, little Matthew, as well as Little Roury, just goes to prove that  the idea that love can, indeed, conquer all.JOCKEYS AND JEWELS---BY BEV PETERSEN  I give this story a 4.5 star rating.Kurt MacKinnon was a great cop but he has moved on to be a very successful horse trainer. When his ex-partner Connor dies while investigating something dodgy in the horse industry, Kurt tries to find out what went wrong. His knowledge of horse racing ought to give him an inside edge.Julie might have been an adult but she was written as if she were a naive teenager. She is trying to make a name for herself as a rider and so is willing to ride mistreated animals and tolerate abuse from trainers. She clearly has talent but has to fight against gender discrimination to get decent mounts.Pettersen dealt with the serious issue of animal abuse but I found it upsetting that none of the characters reported the abuser to authorities or really tried to stop it. Hence the 4.5 star rating.OPERATION: DATE ESCAPE---BY LINDSEY BROOKES  I give this a 5 star rating, also.After her divorce from a lying, cheating scum bucket, Kelsie Collins has a problem being set up on to many blind dates by both her mother, and her best friend. Each time she went on a blind date, things became worse than they were the last time. Hence the reasn for writing her book of ways to escape a bad date. Then she meets Cole Maxwell, a real hot looking fireman that she wants nothing to do with.  After all; her ex was a good looking man, and look where that got her....she was left with nothing but a big ole heart-ache.Cole Maxwell isnt sure what to think when the sexy redhead hes just rescued from a bad date informs him that hes too perfect to date. Thats a first. Hes had relationships end because the women couldnt handle the risks that go along with his chosen profession, but never because hes too perfect.  But he's too infatuated by this little ""china Doll"", as he  likes to call her,  to  ever give up on her.This is one of the most comical stories I've read lately. The things Kelsie gets herself into is hysterical. Her friend Nanci with an ""i"" is a real character, too. I love the camraderie wth the  men at the firehouse. Her mother sort of got on my nerves here and there, but I think that happens with most mothers. Cole was the perfect hero in this story. He was so understanding, patient, and very caring with Kelsie. He was also very funny at times, too. And the chemistry between these two was explosive!THE GOOD DAUGHTER---BY DIANE LAYNE  I give this a 4 star rating, but only because I felt it drug on a bit too long.The best part about The Good Daughter is that you actually get two romances for the price of one! I really felt for the heroine, who wants so badly to do good but she's stuck in a world of evil with only one way out--to bring down her father. But I was also drawn to the famous (and super hot) soccer player whose wife was being held hostage by the mafia.The story has a number twists and turns, along with surprises, both good and bad. Like I said before, it was a very good action packed story, but it just drug on a bit too long, at least it did for me.SEIZED BY DARKNESS---BY AUTUMN JORDEN  I give this story a 4 star rating also.I would have love to see even a short epilouge at the end, to let us know more about their HEA. To me; the ending just felt too rushed.This is a story that touches on one of the most horrible practices still going strong today. Human trafficking has been a problem since the beginning of time and unfortunately it is still making immoral people a lot of money. It was really hard to read some of it, because it just broke my heart. At the same time I was awed by the bravery of Nicole in getting them all of harms way, and into safety.MEET YOUR MATE---BY JACIE FLOYD  I give this story a 5 star rating.This story was so much fun to read.Annabel Morgan and Max Williams have already met. They have even worked together in the past. Now, when her step-daughter wants to set her up with a hunk of a man before leaving for college, she chose of all people - Mad Max.These two couldn't have more different if they tried. While she was an uptight,  straight-laced woman with practically no social life or sex life, what so ever. Max on the other hand likes to live more on the wild side, and he has the reputation for being a love 'em & leave 'em kind of man.The things that these two get into, and the things they put each other through on their dates, will have you laughing your butts off. This story just seemed to flow so effortlessly. I have never read anything by this author until now, but I love her style and her humor. I will tell you this though, she just earned herself a new fan.LOVE & OREO'S----BY ELIZABETH BEMIS  I give this story a 4.5 star rating.This story was so sweet and heart-warming. It's a story about accepting  people for who they are, not what they look like....but what's inside that person.Quinn grew up as a chubby little guy, but in his junior year of college he became sick of being picked on, so he decided to change his image. He lose a whopping 85lbs and turned himself into a fitness guru. Now he own 6 very successful gyms around town.Katherine had always been over-weight, and had been made the butt of every joke in school. The more she was teased, the more she ate. Then one day at a job fair she met a greek god and couldn't believe he actually gave her a second look. Although...he wasn't quite as honest with her about who he was. He gave her a false name for one, and secondly, the next day she was completely blind-sided when she found out that the man who own Mitchell's gyms was the same man she'd met the day before, and was also her new client.To say that she was upset, would be an huge understatement.  But if they can't put their differences aside, their working relationship would be a total loss. These two were hilarious, and there were more than just romantic fireworks going on between these two. Katherine was nobody's pushover. She gave as good as she got, and then some!MARRYING MR. PERFECT---BY LIZZIE SHANE  I give this story a 4 star rating.This story was sort of cute but also very heart-wrenching, at the same time. I felt so bad for Lou, and who wouldn't? She had been so in love with Jack for what seemed like forever. Yet she couldn't bring herself to say a word or act upon her feelings for him because for one, her fear of being rejected...and two, for fear of losing her best friend.Jack on the other hand, feels guilty about letting his friend sacrifice her own life in order to take care of him and his children after his wife had died. So needless to say; that when another friend comes to visit and tells him about a show she's producing, he agrees to accept a spot on that dating show. But only does so because he feels like he needed to find himself a wife---so he could set Lou free so she could finally find her own happiness in life. Little did he know that the only  love and happiness Lou really wanted to find, was with him and his children.I highly recommend this box set to everyone!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VH7YHWBWL4M2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0103283SU#wasThisHelpful","R3VH7YHWBWL4M2","A3IQ0P3M39IY8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IQ0P3M39IY8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really, really loved this book. The pain and anguish Paul has to go through with his mother, just broke my heart. And then if that wasn't enough, Hope walks into his life and just when he thinks he can have it all....she starts to pull away. It was hard to hate Hope for her actions, because I could see where she's coming from, too. It would be so hard to try to trust someone again, especially after what she was put through.Throughout all the books Marie Force has written to date, her characters have always been about strong, committed people who have strong morals and values. They don't tear each other down, but rather they lift them up when things get tough, support each other and cheer each other on in whatever their next endevour my be. The women aren't catty or the jealous types. The men and women alike; will gladly jump in and help with any project when they're needed.And Marie Force isn't afraid to tackle a few delicate issues, either. This time it happens to be about a mother of two grown men, who is suffering from the effects of Dementia. Not an easy subject, for sure, because this disease not only affects the person going through this horrible disease, but it also takes a major toll on their family and their friends lives, too. I thought that Marie did a good job walking us thru the disease of Dementia. Marie also has the cany ability to seamlessly weave multiple story lines throughout the book while tackling these tough subjects. When you read her books, you can't help being sucked into the story so deeply, that you feel like you personally know these people. Every time I pick up a new book in the series, it feels like going back home to catch up with all my family and friends, once again.Her books are always filled with laughter, tears, joy, hope, and most of all.... happiness. I have read every single book that Marie has written so far, but I think the ""Gansett Island"" series will always be my favorite. Just like Maddie & Mac will always be my favorite couple. Although....The ""Green Mountain"" series is also a very fantastic series, too. I am getting hooked more and more on this series, with every new addition added to the series.I hope and pray that Marie will never stop writing the Gansett series though, because that would surely break my heart! I can't even imagine not being able to go back to visit the McCarthy family and friends ever again..","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U5JNIBINRTRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010TNYKJE#wasThisHelpful","R1U5JNIBINRTRV","A3IQ0P3M39IY8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IQ0P3M39IY8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"IMO- ""The Keeneston Roses"" far exceeds all of the others in this series. If you haven't read all of the books in this series yet, you may find yourselves feeling a bit lost. But for those of us who have followed this series religiously right from the very beginning, this was an amazing treat. The Rose sister's have been abig part of every book in this series and yet, we never had the opportunity before now to find out why they never married, or how they lived their lives were while growing up in the town.This book finally gives us all those answers, and more. We not only get to know what happened to them to make them become the wonderful women they are now, but we also got to see part of their future, and their long over due HEA's, too.And as happy as I am to finally get to see the things that happened to them many years ago, it also made me sort of sad to know that with their advanced aging, we probably won't be seeing much of Rose sisters in the future books. And I, for one; will miss them immensely. I know it won't feel the same without them, but then again I have complete faith in the ability of Kathleen Brooks to pull us through into the next generation. I know that she will somehow find a way to make this series continue to come alive, and keep it just as interesting as she has done in the past. I know that the townspeople will keep the spirits of Rose sisters alive for a long time to come, if only in their hearts and fond memories of times past. I don't think there's one single person in that town, that the Rose sisters haven't reached out touch deeply somewhere along the way.I know that I'll stick around just to watch the fun unfold. It will be very interesting to watch the reactions of these wonderful, but very powerful parents as they deal with the love lives of their children. ::Smirk:: And God help all those children and their love interests along the way, 'cos Lord knows they'll need all the need all the help they can get in they are ever to survive their interfearing parents!

"If you're looking for a good, well written romance series with added humor, this series is perfect for you. After reading the previous two books in this series; it was clear that Mac ""Maverick"" Maven, whose plan to restore the old mountain hotel to its former glory, including hosting top-level poker tournaments with his buddy's several times a year, and Dare's Deputy Sheriff, Peggy McBride have definite sparks flaring between them.When these two get together, it's explosive! They are just as heated with their disagreements, as they are between the sheets. I am really, really enjoying this series. There are lots of laughs, steamy romances, and many interesting and wonderful secondary characters you'll instantly fall in love with, too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZBHGV0VQQ205/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FCZN94C#wasThisHelpful","RZBHGV0VQQ205","A3IQ0P3M39IY8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IQ0P3M39IY8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What I love most about Ms. Chastain's writing is that no matter what she writes, she crafts strong unwavering Southern characters. While Southern Man was contemporary Southern fiction, Love in Smallfoot Alley is a contemporary novel with a dash of sci-fi or paranormal, and it delighted me that I was able to enjoy the same bold and true characterization that was feature in Southern mind. Ms. Chastain writes with the realization that ""it takes all kinds to make a world"", and you'll find within her books all kinds of relatable people from your everyday life. There was a hard-to-win romantic angle as a subplot that kept me turning pages until the end because I simply had to know if a certain heart would be thawed, and I was also captivated by the paranormal subplot. If you enjoy Southern contemporary fiction and Michael Crichton as I do, I don't see how this story could possibly let you down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HW2C0AB9Z3UX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503185664#wasThisHelpful","R3HW2C0AB9Z3UX","A6LEJBP5YOP3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6LEJBP5YOP3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this after my children and I had a delightful experience with the Insect Lore Butterfly Garden. I really wish that I had heeded the reviews on this product and saved myself some cash and my children disappointment. I ordered the ladybugs standard delivery and they all arrived alive and well. We put them in the habitat with their food and placed precisely the amount of water required on the sponge in the top of the habitat. Within 2 days, half had stopped moving--and they weren't pupating either. Within one day, a third more had met the same grisly fate. At present we have two ladybugs that appear to be trying to pupate, but we aren't holding our breath that this experiment is going to pan out. The habitat is poorly and cheaply designed. The plastic top doesn't sit all the way down on the base, and the ladybugs get trapped under the rim of the lid. The sponge for their water dries out way too fast. You are only supposed to add water every day and a half, but that wasn't enough for my bugs. In 24 hours, the sponge was completely dry. The food included wasn't enough to get them to pupate. They ate it all up, and the instruction manual said you could give them raisins after they emerged as ladybugs, but there wasn't enough nourishment to get them to that state. It was like a poorly done terrarium, the Shady Pines of the bug world-- the final home for little critters who won't get proper care.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LI60T479XW1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000099Z8H#wasThisHelpful","R2LI60T479XW1K","A6LEJBP5YOP3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6LEJBP5YOP3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, it started leaking water on the second use. To be fair, I've never owned an iron that didn't leak, but by now, you'd think I'd finally find an iron that doesn't leak everywhere.

"I am a novice when it comes to survival skills and disaster readiness. I bought this book after several word of mouth recommendations and couldn't be happier with it. It covers a little bit of everything from preparing shelters and fires to surviving a lightening storm or recognizing venomous creatures. I disagree with some of the negative reviews that state the information is too shallow. This is a big book, designed to give you in a running start in any situation. An entire book could conceivably be written about any survival skill in the book, and no one needs a set of survival encyclopedias for their bug out bag. This is a thick book, possibly too heavy for your bag, as it is. If you want an excellent place to begin honing your knowledge, this book is it.

"Wolf Dawson is a masterfully told Southern Gothic that will have you turning pages and telling yourself ""just one more chapter"" until you reach the end. I finished this book in about an hour and a half because I was that invested in the characters and couldn't bear not to find out what happened to them. The conclusion left me breathless and it was a real surprise--I'd pegged the crimes on a completely different character.Wolf Dawson is the story of the Dawson and Seaton families, two local families with plenty of reasons for a deep-seated grudge. Wolf Dawson supposedly died during the Civil War, but now he's home and owner of the enviable Seaton home. Juliet Seaton meets Dawson at the river when a marauding wolf is on the loose and sets into motion a ghostly whodunit that offends the sensibilities of the whole town.If you want a suspenseful, dark, romantic story that will keep you up until the witching hour, this is it. The genre of Southern Gothic fiction is incomparable in the hands of Charlsie Russell. She can't write them fast enough for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DUDPAH7J3D1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007OOP3UW#wasThisHelpful","R2DUDPAH7J3D1F","A6LEJBP5YOP3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6LEJBP5YOP3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this book to be engaging, interest, and well-written. Sometimes nonfictional accounts can be too dry and fail to capture the personalities of the people involved, but Into Thin Air doesn't suffer from that in the slightest. The prose is rich and highly readable while the characterization is riveting. The book teaches the reader in great detail about the history of mountaineering Everest without getting too heavy or textbookish. I found myself unable to stop reading until I had reached the end. The only true disappointment to me was the epilogue or appendix during which Mr. Krakauer defends the validity of his book. I didn't realize when I bought the book, that it is highly controversial. It seems that most of the climbers dispute each other's memories of what exactly happened on that disastrous climb. I think they should leave the argument behind and realize that in the midst of a storm of that magnitude at that altitude with that lack of supplies and oxygen that the truth will never be known, they will always be at the mercy of whatever their oxygen-deprived brains concocted at the time. Nevertheless, I intend to read some of the rival accounts.

"I discovered how serious my allergies are after a visit to the allergist this summer, and I began researching all the ways to make myself more comfortable. I was a real skeptic when it came to air purifiers. I bought this one primarily because it releases zero ozone. We have a suspected asthmatic in the house, and ozone can aggravate breathing. I set it up with the suspicion that I had flushed close to two hundred dollars down the toilet. Then after a few hours, I noticed the air was markedly different in the living room and kitchen. It felt easier to breathe. I felt like I was taking deeper breaths, the kind you're supposed to take. That night, my husband who hadn't wanted me to buy it, said his chest felt better. My kids didn't cough as they fell asleep that night. And by the next day, I saw less dust and particles in the air. Before I knew it, I no longer needed Benadryl to supplement my prescription antihistamines. My husband turned it off for a day while he did some work in the living room, and in two hours we were all coughing. I'm a believer. Is it noisy? A little. It reminds me of a box unit air conditioner, but I like the white noise. The front latch is clumsily done as a lot of reviewers have stated. I haven't had to tape it on yet, but I suspect I will. This purifier may not improve the quality of your life the way it has mine. Research shows that air purifiers are tremendously helpful for some and not at all for others.

"Summer in the South was a good read. A Northern girl spends the summer on the Southern estate of her wealthy friend and uses the time to get to know his quirky, eccentric family. While there, the details of family history she picks up inspire her to write a different novel and solve an ages old mystery that has haunted the family.The writing was good, and most of the character development was competent, especially in the older generation. I felt like some of the younger generation was neglected slightly in development because they were so busy trying to ferret out the secrets of their predecessors. All in all, I recommend the book to those who enjoy cozy mysteries or a good Southern tale.

"I recently purchased an older edition Bible that I've had trouble finding at a reasonable price, and when I located one, you can be sure that I wanted to protect it! This is the case it will go in. I feel that the case is only so-so in quality. I think the exterior material looks inexpensive and not durable. I expect it to flake after a while. I do like the handle quite a bit. It seems sturdy. Unlike several reviewers, I am not having any issues with the zipper skipping or being too stiff. There is a little mesh pocket on the interior that I can't imagine being useful for much other than a few hard candies or very short highlighting pencils, but I like the outer pocket on the case. It will easily accommodate church bulletins. The pen/pencil holder is also fine. I think this case is best for someone with a lighter weight Bible or someone who doesn't want to lug the extras of a notepad and other study items.

"I recently purchased two study Bibles and wanted to protect them in a case that would allow me to ""grab and go"" when Sunday morning came, and I have to say with one tiny flaw this one really fit the bill. I use the Thomas Nelson NKJV Study Bible, 2nd edition. My measurements came in at 6.75 X 9.5 X 2.1 inches. My Bible fit into this case with a little wiggle room to spare. I followed another reviewers suggestion to go ahead and buy the XL if you had a Bible that would fit a size L but intended to carry lots of extras. I am blown away by the trifold design. I can accommodate a good sized notepad, business cards, church programs, a pen, and even accommodate my spare set of glasses. My case didn't have a noticeably strong nylon odor as some reviewers had noted, and it looks like the kind of case that will stand up to minor spills and messes (I have two small kids). I do take issue with the Velcro closure. I think it is the only aspect of this case that was not done well. I can see it slipping open if you have loaded the case with a heavy Bible and extra stuff. If Zondervan had put a snap on this case, I would have given it a 5 star review. That being said, I would purchase the case again and may purchase a size L for a smaller Bible.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C4RFMCH68A51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310809177#wasThisHelpful","R3C4RFMCH68A51","A6LEJBP5YOP3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6LEJBP5YOP3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nom Nom Paleo is officially my go to Paleo cookbook. My husband and I embarked on the Paleo journey two weeks ago. We ordered this book and three others. This book scores major points with us for actually being a hardcover with sewn binding and thick durable pages. While I do enjoy my other Paleo books, the quality was the worst of cheap and they all had tattered binding within one week. Short of cramming Nom Nom Paleo down a garbage disposal, this book is meant for the actual, heavy kitchen use.The book is divided into the following sections: introduction (very basic paleo intro); building blocks (like mayo, sriracha, and other meal builders); nibbles; salads and soups; eggs; plants; seafood; poultry; meat; and treats. Amusing and insightful blurbs precede each recipe, and the photography is top level quality. Little cartoons and asides educate and delight throughout the book.I have made mayo, a real keeper and super simple as well as the Peruvian roast chicken with aji verde sauce. I think my husband thought twice about peeling all the crispy skin off the bird and devouring it all in one meal. We are also big, big fans of her Liar bars, a snack/energy bar knock off. Every recipe is clearly explained and well written. I see several reviews bemoaning the lack of protein, but there are twenty something protein recipes and that excludes the eggs and seafood chapters. Paleo isn't a free pass to scarf down all of your calories through meat. A wide variety of vegetables and some fruits and nuts should round you out.If I owned only one Paleo book, this would be it. If you are a newbie like me looking for the cookbook to get you started, I think this should be the book. Most of the ingredients were easily attainable for me in my small town grocery store with the exception of coconut aminos...and Amazon can help you out with obtaining those if you can't procure them. I adore this book, and I have my fingers crossed for another one. I read on the author's blog that she was quitting her job as a pharmacist so here is hoping she'll produce another book soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DX4HBPDK5IJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GA4L9AA#wasThisHelpful","R2DX4HBPDK5IJO","A6LEJBP5YOP3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6LEJBP5YOP3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book rocked, and if you enjoy a trilogy that builds on the merits on character development and suspense rather than weepy melodrama and awkward necking, then this is the series for you. Seriously, if you're picking this up as a ""kissing book"", you'll be disappointed...buy something else. This novel is about suspenseful plot building.Blue Sargent, a charming and self-possessed girl, in a house full of psychics, has always been told that if she kisses her true love, he'll die. She lacks the fortune telling abilities of her relatives but possesses the remarkable ability to sharpen any other psychics' gifts. She is independent and likes herself. She's no shrinking violet, hoping that next year she'll be school beauty.Her world changes when a Raven boy from Aglionby crosses her path. She has seen him on St. Mark's Eve which means he's her true love or she'll kill him. Blue wants neither...especially regarding an Aglionby guy.The Raven boys are headed by Gansey, a strange mixture of modern day wealth and old world charm. He's obsessed with finding and awaking the ley line that he believes King Glendower is buried on. Legend has it that Glendower will grant a favor to the person who awakens him. Gansey's pals: foerce, brooding Ronan; poor, abused Adam; and quiet, mysterious Noah round out the group on his quest to find the king. When Gansey leaves behind his scholarly journal of notes and Blue finds it, their paths converge on an adventure that will adjust everyone's relationships and self-perceptions.This novel is the first in a trilogy. The emphasis is on character and plot building. There is action and fantasy elements but they are sprinkled in as seasoning instead of constantly engaging the reader. It makes the story more believable. As soon as I finished the novel, I reread it, and it was even more fun. The author does an amazing job with foreshadowing and dropping little breadcrumbs for the reader to pick up before a major plot reveal--and she still managed to surprise me several times.Now go buy this book if you enjoy quality more than making out and a novel that builds into a second book that doesn't slump with the dreaded ""sequel slump"". These books are worth the journey, people.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXR6565UUVK7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0096T5P7O#wasThisHelpful","RXR6565UUVK7M","A6LEJBP5YOP3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6LEJBP5YOP3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a newbie to the Paleo lifestyle. Well Fed is one of two books that I purchased to guide me in this new way of taking care of myself after developing health problems that I think, in part, are to be blamed by my previous carbohydrate-reliant way of eating.Well Fed is a paper back book that looks very small and thin. Don't be deceived! This little book is jam-packed with recipes. You could probably get by fairly well on cooking supper for a very long time if this was the only Paleo book you owned. It is divided into the following sections: very basic intro to Paleo; the weekly cookup; sauces and seasonings; protein; veggies and salads; fruits; and resources.Many of Joulwan's recipes are ""hot plates"", meaning a  precooked protein, several cups of  steam-sauteed veggies, and an accompaniment such as cauliflower rice or zucchini noodles that are seasoned with one of several delightful spice combinations and perhaps an accompanying sauce. The spice and the sauce gives a cultural spin to the dish depending on what you pick so you get to eat French one night and Moroccan the next. These recipe suggestions are grouped together on a couple of pages with the techniques for cooking your desired protein, sauce, spice, and veggies on separate pages located throughout the book. If you are someone who does not like flipping through cookbooks to make a meal (and I know you're on here), this book is not for you. I don't mind it at all. Joulwan does lots of prep work one day per week and cooks her veggies and proteins and stores them in the fridge for quick assembly and heating throughout the workweek. This technique may not be for those who are very busy. There are tons of recipes in addition to her hot plates technique, and they will delight.The first thing I made was the Deconstructed Hamburger salad. You better believe it was tasty. I topped it with Joulwan's homemade mayo, and I nearly swooned with delight. I've been afraid of making mayo for years, but it took 5 minutes of my life and was extraordinary. My husband ate seconds of the salad and asked that I prepare it again. I also made the Moroccan grilled chicken plate over cauliflower rice and made the Moroccan dipping sauce. Talk about a trip to foreign country from your dinner table! It takes me a bit longer now to prepare meals, but it is worth it to feel better. One thing the author could do in future editions to improve the book would be to include how long all the condiments/sauces will last in the refrigerator.This book is very poor quality. I have used it heavily for three days, and it is falling apart. I've been nice to it, too. I don't crack the spines on my books. I see a lot of reviewers are having theirs spiral-bound at office supply stores for a few bucks. I will do the same. My recommendation is to buy the book, but take it and have it bound before you use it. In addition to the binding being awful, the pages seem to not hold up well to handling. So spiral bound the thing, use a cookbook stand for sure, and maybe place a clear laminate sheet  across the pages while cooking. It is nuisance for sure, but the recipes are so good that I have ordered Well Fed 2.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OVMQO9UWHOAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083LX1EU#wasThisHelpful","R3OVMQO9UWHOAG","A6LEJBP5YOP3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6LEJBP5YOP3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amazon kept recommending this book to me based on my other purchases. After a while, I read some glowing reviews, and with a sense of caution, I ordered the book. After all, it was only $15, no real tragedy either way.Oh wow! This book is worth every dime! Over 95% of the recipes appealed to me. I immediately made the Marshmallow Swirl S'mores Fudge. It was so simple to make, and everyone from my husband to my children was constantly in the fridge, cutting ""one more piece"". Then I made the Nutella Frosted Banana Cupcakes. The Nutella Frosting has been adopted by our household as the frosting of choice. We were all like cats licking cream from a bowl while groaning pathetically as we ate. Those babana cupcakes would make a fine substitute for a breakfast muffin basket if you leave off the frosting, too! Two whopping successes in a row definitely gets my vote of recommendation.While I recommend the book, I do wish to caution that it isn't perfect. It needs another pass of proofreading/editing. I found a typo or two in the blurbs about the recipes which is technically not a huge deal. However, the recipe for the Pretzel Peanut Butter Cups does not include the use of pretzels in either the recipe or the ingredient list. Any reader should be able to utilize common sense to figure out from the photo that a pretzel goes on the top and bottom of the Peanut Butter Cup, but I've been reviewing cookbooks for years so I can tell you that this kind of omission matters to people.Sally is a gifted food photographer. It amazes me that the photos she takes match the quality of the recipes she writes. The book is well made, and it stays open to cook with without the use of a cookbook stand, if you so wish. The font for recipes is a bit on the small side, but it shouldn't be too much of a problem. You will find a broad range of delicious treats to cook. This book is what you pull out for any occasion: birthday parties, girls' night in, bakes sales, and showers. It is a fun treat for baking from , and I can't imagine many home cooks not being able to glean something delicious from this awesome book. Sally, I hope there's a sequel in the works!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38B7QBX0JQ2Y5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I0DNMRW#wasThisHelpful","R38B7QBX0JQ2Y5","A6LEJBP5YOP3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6LEJBP5YOP3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love paranormal romance, and after reading the positive reviews on here as well as the product description, I thought this novel was going to be a thrilling romance of epic proportions. Let me put it this way: my mom and dad are closer to a great couple than this tired group of characters. The chapters are slowly paced, and when something of interest or note occurs, it's over with in the flash of an eye and you're back to slogging through superfluous details. Maggie and Eran are boring, dull, and lack development. The novel takes too long to explain Maggie's gift. Maggie's housemates (Rufus, Felix, Ezra) are over-the-top domestic and boring; Falter takes their opposing meal (tofu versus burgers) planning too far. It isn't comic-relief--it's bad writing and it detracts from the limping plot. I also don't get the point of setting the novel in New Orleans if the novel isn't going to have a mildly Southern tone. Beyond affecting some ridiculous accents, I didn't understand why she choose that setting. Also, this is the poorest formatted/proofread/edited book that I have come across all year. This is the first and absolute last Falter novel that I will read.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A0SX9E12DT4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00280MFEY#wasThisHelpful","R3A0SX9E12DT4G","A6LEJBP5YOP3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6LEJBP5YOP3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Consuming Passion: A Food-Obsessed Life, by Michael Lee West, is the consummate food writing of the South. West effortlessly blends autobiographical sketches with her thoughts and experiences regarding food, and she rewards your reading effort by tossing in at least a recipe per chapter. To get better Southern food lore, youd have to turn to Craig Claibornebut give up a few chuckles along the way.From making cornbread to crafting sugared violets to seasoning a cast iron pan, you will find an endless assortment of clever ruminations on the Southern kitchen. Wests recipes are basic, delicious, and fool-proof, but her confidences regarding failures, successes, and draws in the kitchen that hook the reader and lure her in. Her anecdotes regarding family and friends will alternate between leaving you howling with laughter and shuddering. The uncles in the family all die young, but the aunts know its really death by butter. When Aunt Dell invites West over for an impromptu roast, the family finds the seasoning has been tainted by none other than weevils. They watch fascinated and horrified as Dell strains the sauce and serves it anyhow. West goes on hot pursuit of a bed supposedly from the childhood home of Margaret Mitchell and walks away with not only the bed but a delicious gingersnap recipe that might have originated from a childhood friend of Ms. Mitchell.Consuming Passions straddles a fine line between witty and informative, leaving the reader to soak up every word and then reread the book. Wests work has since broadened to encompass mainstream fiction such as her popular Teeny series. Yet when I find myself with a craving that I cant identify, be it literary or culinary, Consuming Passions: A Food-Obsessed Life is a regular cure all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VNE9MNPS2V80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000C4T16I#wasThisHelpful","R3VNE9MNPS2V80","A6LEJBP5YOP3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6LEJBP5YOP3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is no secret that I am a raving fan of Jeni Britton Bauer. When people ask me where to go for ice cream, I send them to her shop. When people ask me what ice cream cookbook to purchase, I recommend Jeni's first book. And now she has a second book! I'm telling you that I'm beside myself. Jeni's cookbooks don't make me feel like a rock star in my kitchen...that's just stupid. Jeni's cookbooks make me feel like a professional chef in my kitchen, and that's worth everything.Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream Desserts is the book that you have to buy if you have a comfortable mastery of homemade ice cream preparation and are looking to advance your skills by turning that ice cream into restaurant worthy desserts. The book is divided into three main parts: ice cream parlor, bakeshop, and sundae bar.Ice cream parlor gives you all new ice cream recipes that aren't found in the original Jeni's book. Think black forest cake ice cream, bellini sorbet, and salty caramel Crme sans Lait. Caution: this is not the book you want to buy if you are looking for run of the mill basics! You will not be getting plain vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry. These are inspired recipes with big twists in the flavors, and while they're awesome, this isn't the book for you if you want basic flavors. The French Toast Frozen Custard is incredible.Bakeshop provides lots of recipes so that you can serve cakes, cobblers, and cookies alongside your awesome homemade ice creams. You will find wiseman's chocolate cake, Bauer House biscuits, sauted fruit, and all manner of delicious ice cream accompaniments. Wiseman's chocolate cake is one of the moistest chocolate cakes you can make.Sundae bar will help you put it all together with gorgeous photos of assembled parfaits and sundaes. Somehow Jeni has elevated these humble drugstore desserts into works of art meant to eaten. I haven't made this one yet but the Salty Grahama (whipped cream, salty vanilla custard, sliced bananas, whiskey caramel sauce, and salty graham gravel) is next on my list. Jeni gives you the recipes for every component you need from sauces to gravels in this section.It's a well made book with beautiful photography, but I have come to expect nothing less from this ice cream expert who only uses the best ingredients and tries to locally source them. I have worn out her previous book, and I can tell this book is going to get the same workout this summer. The only problem with Jeni's books is that I have trouble not taking credit for her work when I serve up the end product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R142RFESIEW8DP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1579655920#wasThisHelpful","R142RFESIEW8DP","A6LEJBP5YOP3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6LEJBP5YOP3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is a rare occasion when I can't finish a novel. This novel doesn't boast bold characters; it boasts a cast of clich characters. It changes narratives far too often, and normally I don't mind split narrative novels in the least. Never one to shy away from a piece of Southern family drama, this jumbled mess of a novel is best described as an episode of Jerry Springer whose script is being sold as Southern fiction.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27X6RGUD8L1JZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005H3ZMQ2#wasThisHelpful","R27X6RGUD8L1JZ","A6LEJBP5YOP3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6LEJBP5YOP3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm new to the Beekman cookbooks. I missed their initial heirloom recipes book a few years ago, but I saw this new dessert edition at the local B&N, thumbed through it for about a minute, and decided that I had to order it. This book has become my quintessential winter baking book in a short time.It is a beautifully bound hardcover with a definite heirloom keepsake vibe. I love the plate in the front of the book that reads ""the first generation to own this book is"" with a blank series of lines for you to fill in. There are blank lines at the bottom of most recipes and after each chapter so that you can pen in your own precious seasonal family recipes. This is excellent if you want to give the book as a gift to a loved one and share your own family heritage.The book is arranged seasonally, winter through fall, to highlight the best that each season has to offer. You will find both classic recipes (do it all yellow cake, banana pudding with vanilla wafers, vanilla pastry cream) and amazing twists (chocolate rocky road potstickers, oatmeal cream pie with ginger cream, cinnamon bun bundt cake). I find that the majority of ingredients are readily available with no special searching or ordering. The recipes are clearly written and many can be made by a novice baker who is detail-oriented. I love the one bowl chocolate almond cake.I only have one small gripe with the book, and it isn't enough for my to downgrade my five star rating. The nostalgic pictures of these desserts are breathtaking. I wish there were more pictures. This book is lush with beautiful photography that captivates the reader and hearkens back to another time, but I would rather have pictures of the finished pumpkin jelly roll or banana cake with cream cheese frosting than full page pictures of copper pots, delicate china, and lovely outdoor scenes. There was also one teensy mistake in the well referenced index: all the ""g"" entries were lumped in with the ""f"" entries with no delineation. This really shouldn't affect how you use the book.I think this is one of the best baking books to be released this season. Even someone who doesn't cook well would derive a lot of joy from this just by leafing through the pages. I don't think anyone should hesitate to purchase this gorgeous and tasty book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WW0J80DA7DFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609615735#wasThisHelpful","R1WW0J80DA7DFV","A6LEJBP5YOP3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6LEJBP5YOP3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a confession to make. I consider myself an accomplished cook, but my Achilles heel in the culinary department is pie making. There's something about making a crust that makes me as nervous as can be. I bought a pie book this year, but it seemed a little past the skill level of this novice pie baker. So I decided to buy this book as an early Christmas gift to myself. I am beyond happy that I bought it!The book is a softcover with a durable cover that looks to wipe clean. My only complaint is that you need a cookbook stand to actively cook from it. It is laid out well with a wonderful cross-referenced index, and the pictures, oh the pictures! The pictures are full page for each and every pie, and they make you declare that you will master the art of pies.The book is divided as follows: pie and tart crusts; cream, meringue, and ice cream pies; tarts and galettes; slab pies; pie toppings; classic southern pies; fruit pies; cobblers and crisps; hand pies and fried pies; equipment; ingredients; and crust index. My favorite sections are the pie and tart crusts chapter as well as the crust index. The crust index is a genius two page spread that lets you choose one of the crust recipes and pair it with a suggested filling. This way, you can make a pie anytime by utilizing a crust you re comfortable making and handling. You don't have to be a pastry pro to pull off these recipes--there are a number of press in the pan crusts. I find this very reassuring. If you're a pastry pro, they show you how to make a lattice crust or do a decorative crust edge.You will find a wide array of pies, something to please everyone. There are lots of old expected classics such as vinegar pie, chess pie, and banana cream pie, but you will also find lots of awesome and welcome twists on classics such as red velvet pie, maple chess pie with brown sugar bacon, and mini bananas foster pies. The salted caramel pecan tassies are amazing and a showstopper for company. Be sure to check out the toppings chapter which will show you how to make everything from apple cider drizzle to homemade crme fraiche.I am pleased with my purchase and hope Southern Living produces more books in a similar vein. I will enjoy this book for many years to come and think it would make a nice stocking stuffer for the family member with a sweet tooth who enjoys baking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31B1UWPWT9UIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0848739639#wasThisHelpful","R31B1UWPWT9UIA","A6LEJBP5YOP3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6LEJBP5YOP3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Callie's Biscuits and Southern Traditions is a collection of southern recipes that are easy to pull off, require basic ingredients that you won't have to order, and won't break the bank. It is a well-bound hardcover that stays open on the countertop if you want to cook from it and don't have a stand. The print is mostly easy to read. On a few pages, the backdrop is a white woven dishcloth and the weave of the cloth competes with the small black type. It isn't true for every page but be aware. The book is moderately generous with photographs, but you have to wonder why someone would include a family photograph but not a picture of the sage butter-roasted turkey. There are also fun asides throughout the book to tell you all about everything from grits to bereavement food.The introduction tells how the author came to make biscuits.She also lists tools she finds helpful in the kitchen. Each chapter is given a 2-3 page introduction, and most recipes are introduced with a paragraph or two divulging their history or what makes them special. The recipes are well-written and easy to follow.The chapters are as follows: biscuits; skillet and stove top; roasting and slow cooking; salads and sandwiches; baking; and entertaining. Entertaining is subdivided into sit-down holiday dinner; cocktail celebration; throw-together oyster roast; game day; southern picnic; playdate; and party drinks.Truth be told, I found the organization and content of the author's chapters to be a little odd. Take for example, chapter 1 (biscuits). There are 14 recipes in the chapter, but only 3 biscuit recipes (buttermilk, black pepper, and cast-iron yeast). However, the biscuit chapter includes southern shortcakes (yeah, I know it's a biscuit) along with recipes for macerated fruit, whipped cream, and shortcake trifle (basically, put the aforementioned ingredients together!). Then there are recipes for cinnamon stickies and buttermilk blueberry cobbler in the biscuit chapter despite there being a scant baking chapter later on. While I confess the food is good, this book suffers from poor editing or organization.The salads and sandwiches chapter includes southern favorites from ham salad to egg salad along with coleslaw, potato salad, fruit kabobs, and corn salad. There are a couple salad dressing and four vinaigrettes. The tuna salad is presented three ways: classic, Tuscan, and Soho. Now I know that Southern cooking encompasses all kinds of cuisine, but really? Soho tuna? There is also a recipe for fiery pimento cheese-laced ""naughty"" eggs. The feeling of the recipes being a hodgepodge that don't necessarily fit anywhere continues.You'll find sweet and savory recipes in the baking chapter. The author tells you right off the bat that she finds the art of cake baking to be elusive so don't expect to find a hummingbird cake, red velvet cake or some other beautiful southern cake here. You'll find basics like haystacks, pecan pie, and chocolate chip cookies here.My favorite recipes are the pimento cheese shrimp and grits and the black pepper biscuits. You'll wish you thought of both dishes.My bottom line? This is a nice cookbook with some standout recipes. It won't make or break your cookbook collection to own it. I will probably regift this book. I simply already have enough of these type recipes. I think this would be a basic starter book for the aspiring southern cook.Update 11/22/13 You may also want to try the Callie's Meeting Street Crab Dip as well as the cast-iron pimento cheese dip. However, upon further use of the book I have an additional criticism. The index is poorly done. You'd think the aforementioned crab dip would be located under ""crab"" or ""dips"". It was actually listed under ""Callie's"". Just in case anyone is confused, this is not a negative review. I gave the book 4 stars for great food, but there are aspects of the book that can be improved.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33J4AS9KJN48I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476713219#wasThisHelpful","R33J4AS9KJN48I","A6LEJBP5YOP3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6LEJBP5YOP3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Journey along with Sam and a host of unforgettable characters as they trek along the Continental Divide after the mysterious suicide of a mutual school friend and discover their own marvelous, wounded spirits along the way. Pate does a magnificent job of balancing chuckle-inducing humor against poignant soul-searching as her memorably-crafted characters face the disappointments and joys of everyday life and seek to uncover their spiritual selves. Pate also admirably captures the female friendship on paper, portraying its supportiveness, rivalry, love, and vagaries. This debut novel juxtaposes the physical journey of a lifetime against the mental journey of a lifetime and leaves the reader with the sense that she has made new friends along the way.

"I purchased this basket to go with my daughter's Halloween custom because a traditional pumpkin wouldn't do.This basket is fine for that purpose. The handle is sturdily attached and the basket is secure enough to handle being stuffed to the brim with light weight candy.As far as home dcor purposes go, this is not the basket for you if you desire a pure white basket. The wash on this basket is very thin and a lot of the natural color of the willow shows through so it would be good as a shabby chic basket. The handle can't be positioned up and left that way. It flops over easily due to the design of the hinges on the handles. This is also not a basket for you to carry heavy objects in. It isn't made of sturdy enough materials.This basket would best excel as a prop such as for a costume or a small gift basket. This would be useful to fashion a get well basket out of. It would be terrific to hold a mug and tea or cocoa packets and a packet of cookies.I think the basket is fine for any lightweight purpose and some decorating. I think overall the quality could be better but it is sweet and cute.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S5VAJV4VWSPT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B3W8NIA#wasThisHelpful","R2S5VAJV4VWSPT","A6LEJBP5YOP3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6LEJBP5YOP3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the price and beauty of this product, it simply can't be beaten. I shopped for weeks for an appropriate rocking horse for my youngest. I wanted something that I could hang onto for a while even after she outgrows it, and I truly found it with this rocking horse.The info states that it is for an 18 month to 3 year old child and will accommodate up to 50 pounds. It arrived unassembled, in great condition with all wooden pieces and all hardware. It took my spouse approximately 20 minutes to assemble this horse. The pieces are quality and should stand up to years of abuse from my children. The kit also came with customer service info in case we needed help. Both of my children enjoy playing with the horse and they squabble over it.The horse is terrific. I only have minor criticisms.The horse's mane could have been attached a little better. A few more pieces than I expected have pulled out due to play. Also, the faux leather bridle over the nose slips around quite a bit and has to be put back into place. I also notice that the runners are a little short for good rocking action. The horse rocks but it is not as smooth and fluid as I expected.I think this is a fine addition to any child's playroom. I look forward to seeing my children enjoy it for the next few years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE9GNCM3NZUXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GE8VKQ#wasThisHelpful","RE9GNCM3NZUXD","A6LEJBP5YOP3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6LEJBP5YOP3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been waiting months for Rachael Ray's Week in a Day to come out. The idea is that one spends a day cooking (a Cook Day) to be rewarded with 5 delicious meals for the week ahead. It sounds terrific to this working mom of two tiny children but in actuality, the book doesn't deliver as well as I hoped.The book is divided into 43 weeks of 5 dish menus. Each week has its own theme: five fiesta favorites; meatlover's lane; a chicken in every pot; hearty classics, Thanksgiving anytime, etc. After that comes 4 foundation recipes (poached chicken, parmigiano-herb stock, roasted tomatoes, and pulled pork) that you use frequently. Then the final section is 1 Grocery Bag, 3 Meals in which you are given 8 grocery lists that promise three hearty meals utilizing only one sack of groceries.Don't get me wrong. I think the food is delicious and hearty. I cook everything from Food Network classics to Thomas Keller. I think Ray's food has improved steadily over the years and does deliver. The problem? I can't imagine utilizing many of these menus on a Cook Day to deliver meals later in the week. The recipes all have a common theme but most of the time that theme means cooking lots of different proteins and utilizing new ingredients with each dish. It isn't cost-effective and goodness knows, I don't own enough pots, pans, and kitchen implements to make all five recipes in a day. Ray says she frequently spends a good 5-6 hours cooking up a week's worth of meals. I can't see myself making 5 of most recipes in these menus in under 5-6 hours. The interruption of cleanup between recipes would make it an all day ordeal.I fully realize you have to spend some time in the kitchen to make good food, and her recipes are good. I just don't like the premise that anyone can go in the kitchen and make these menus in a day. It seems to me that you sacrifice too much time with your family to pull these off. I'd rather spend an hour on any given day cooking a great meal than sequestering myself in the kitchen for a whole day to save some time through the week. I choose to think of this as just another Rachael Ray cookbook and ignore the Week in a Day concept.You won't find any grocery lists for each week on the 43 week menus, but there are lists that head all 8 of the One Bag, Three Meals section which I think is a lot more practical for the parenting, working cook of today. There is two page spread of Microsoft tags at the beginning of the book that you can scan with your phone to get bonus side dish recipes and cooking videos. There are some nice full color photographs of the finished dishes in this book.Most dishes taste great. The short rib ragu with drunken papperdelle is a winner as is the Thai ribs and drumsticks and ancho-chipotle turkey chili. I reiterate: you won't hurt for good food in this book. I just don't think the menus were well done to optimize your time at home. More repetition of the same protein or transforming more leftovers into new dishes would have earned this book a solid 5 stars from me. I'm happiest when I ignore the notion that these menus should be cooked in a day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U74UD47VPVAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=145165975X#wasThisHelpful","R2U74UD47VPVAF","A6LEJBP5YOP3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6LEJBP5YOP3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Allegiant, the third book in a promising and much anticipated trilogy, Veronica Roth delivers a novel that wouldn't have ordinarily made it out of the slush pile of any reputable publisher. Her prose barely rises above the complexity of ""See spot run"", and her endless repetition of the same weary adjectives makes me fervently hope someone buys her a thesaurus for Christmas. I am similarly underwhelmed by her ham-handed use of point of view. The previous two books were written solely from the point of view of Tris while this book's point of view alternates between Tris and Tobias. Roth's plain Jane, junior high style prose never achieves a difference in voice between her own narration, Tris, or Tobias. This is especially disappointing because Tobias is such a complex, mysterious character and should have delivered riveting chapters. The finale is the most monotone book I have ever had the misfortune of reading, and if you're perceptive, you realize early on why she has to write from the perspective of two characters. Many people are howling about the ending, and while I maintain it was not the ending I hoped for, my opinion is that Roth is too poor and weak of a writer to achieve the shocking, hard-hitting ending she desired. Never mind all the intricate plots, subplots, and endless revolutions. She couldn't achieve resolution. You could argue that not all dystopian futures will be  or have to be resolved and that her book is actually realistic, but given the scores of weaknesses throughout the book, I'm going to guess that Roth couldn't tie up her loose ends.I'm not sure what happened to the most anticipated young adult novel of the year, but my primary theory is that having released three novels in three years and a slew of forthcoming Divergent-related short stories, Roth was really just looking to cash in big while she could. This trilogy could have been great, and I am sorry a better author didn't come up with it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MZFSEDBNQBJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BD99JMW#wasThisHelpful","R3MZFSEDBNQBJ8","A6LEJBP5YOP3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6LEJBP5YOP3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The America's Test Kitchen Cooking School Cookbook is my favorite cookbook of the fall so far. It is chock full of culinary know how and is an absolute pleasure to leaf through on these autumn evenings. It has something to offer everyone whether they are a beginning cook or an advanced cook.This is one heavy, well-made book. They didn't skimp on binding it either. This 822 page beauty should stand up to years of heavy use in the kitchen. Toss it on the counter and use it as a reference as you cook--it will stay open on its own.The chapters are as follows: cooking basics; how to cook: eggs; vegetables; pasta; rice, grains, and beans; meat; poultry; seafood; grill; stocks and soups; salads; quick breads; yeast breads and pizza; cookies; cakes; fruit desserts; pies and tarts; custards, puddings, and frozen desserts; appendix; and index.I'm going to answer a question that many of you have. Those of you familiar with America's Test Kitchen are wondering about the recycling of recipes from book to book. The answer is yes, they did recycle recipes. I own the America's Test Kitchen TV Show Cookbook 2001-2010 as well as ATK Family Cookbook. The first item I compared in the index is ""eggs"". I came up with repetitions from one book or the other for eggs benedict, some deviled egg recipes, several frittata recipes, huevos rancheros, omelets, quiches, a salad, and scrambled. Next I cross referenced ""sauces"" between the three books as came up with as generous an amount of overlap and then got modest overlap once more when I searched ""potatoes, mashed"" in the index. So why am I giving this book 5 stars?I'm giving this book 5 stars because I feel that it offers something not many other books do. I'm a self taught cook, cooking everything from Rachael Ray to Thomas Keller in a week. No one at my house could teach me to cook growing up, and I will never be able to afford culinary school. There are huge gaps in my cooking knowledge and this book will fill them! When I hold this book and get picture by picture tutorials on recipes, I know that I'm going to learn how to do them accurately from beginning to end. There are 35 pictures to show you how to make sticky buns with pecans. It's hard to get that kind of in depth tutorial just anywhere.The book is set up so that a core technique is photographed thoroughly so that you can master it step by step such as pan roasted chicken breasts and then they present you with a recipe library so that you can practice the master technique in other ways such as in chicken saltimbocca or chicken marsala. Despite 2,500 beautiful photographs to teach you, you aren't going to get step by step photography or even a finished picture of every dish.I appreciate the ""what can go wrong"" charts on all the master technique recipes. They give you a wide range of problems ( fillets overcooked, fillets take longer to cook than indicated, etc) and then give you suggestions on how to cope with the problem in your home kitchen. Most of us have had similar problems regarding a dish that didn't quite want to follow the recipe's directions.Each master recipe has stats to tell you how long to prep, how long to cook, the portion yield, whether you can make it ahead, and the difficulty level. Each master recipe also gives you a comprehensive list of all the kitchen tools and gadgets you will need to make each recipe a reality.There are nice encyclopedic primers for a variety of ingredients that educate the reader all about cuts of beef and cuts of pork as well as the basics of prepping vegetables and what basic kitchen tools do. I could go on and on, but each time I turn the page, there is a new surprise. Tables for conversions and equivalencies, high altitude baking, and meat doneness temperatures reside in the appendix.I love their sticky buns with pecans--talk about a breakfast treat. The chicken piccata is also a dependable recipe that is savory and well-balanced. Their French apple cake can't be beat. ATK consistently produces dependable recipes.My summary after a lengthy review? Buy it. Sure, you aren't getting hundreds of new recipes. You are getting dependable, trust worthy culinary know how. This is the one cookbook I am choosing to stuff in my bag when I go on vacation with plans to cook.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TG7VTLVPTBYZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936493527#wasThisHelpful","R1TG7VTLVPTBYZ","A6LEJBP5YOP3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6LEJBP5YOP3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Come Home to Supper: Over 200 Casseroles, Skillets, and Sides (Desserts, Too!)--to Feed Your Family with Love is Christy Jordan's much awaited book after her surprise runaway hit Southern Plate. She states in her introduction that this is a book about feeding your family on busy nights. She says sometimes we all sit around watching a tv chef prepare filet mignon when what we're really wanting is a new recipe to prepare a pound of ground beef to feed our family. I think that's practical insightful thinking for modern families relying on the drive through.Her book is a paperback and it doesn't stay open on its own. You will need a cookbook stand to use this book at the stove. I don't need a photograph for each recipe but many of you will be disappointed to learn that there isn't a photograph for each one. Most of the food photography is full page and looks appetizing.The recipes are divided into the following chapters: beef; pork; chicken; seafood; sandwiches; casseroles; sides; breads; desserts; and pantry. As you can see, the author tries to deliver on her promise to deliver practical, no frills, everyday cooking to you. These recipes are clearly written and will involve no online shopping to buy obscure ingredients. Most ingredients are probably in your pantry this very second. You also won't have to buy a half shopping cart of ingredients to prepare a meal from this book.Jordan inflects a lot of the same soul from Southern Plate into this book. She talks about reliance on family and spending meaningful time with your children in asides throughout the book that are sprinkled with family photographs. You will also find cooking tips scattered at the tops of the pages that teach the reader about cooking a tender roast, simple weeknight menus, saving bacon grease, and finding a perfect casserole dish. There is an outstanding chart on mixing and matching your own casseroles.While I think Jordan stays true to the theme of easy family meals, some of the recipes seem a little uninspired. Take for example Catalina chicken. It involves onion soup mix, catalina dressing, and chicken. My guess is that most of you have cooked a variation of this already. Ice cream rolls involve self-rising flour and just melted ice cream. Again, recipes like these have been making the circuit for a while. Yet there are also major hits in this book. The chicken fettucine is a tasty treat, and if you love cinnamon, you must get to the kitchen now and make her cinnamon pudding cobbler. It's wonderful. I think Jordan consistently shines brightest in the desserts department.If you are opposed to cooking with canned cream of mushroom, Coca-Cola, soup packets or other prepackaged convenience items, this book is not for you. This is all about getting supper on the table with a minimum of fuss. Some of you will be interested to know that Jordan mixes up her Southern style recipes with a few surprises such as a West Indies Salad and Big Fat Greek Taters.I think this is an overall nice addition to your weeknight cooking shelf. As always, I am touched by Jordan's commitment to families. This is the kind of cooking you share with your neighbor over the fence, at church, or in line at the supermarket. Her Southern Plate is my favorite book of the two. This book will make a nice gift for newlyweds, new cooks, and Southern plate fans with its mix of easily prepared recipes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GDCIAI5K6T5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0761174907#wasThisHelpful","R1GDCIAI5K6T5A","A6LEJBP5YOP3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6LEJBP5YOP3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't waste your money.  First I read through all the great reviews of this camera and was in ahhh of all the features so I pulled the trigger and ordered on.  Prime Next day a Bonus.So to start I am very tech savy.  I opened the box, followed the directions, (by the way there pretty poorly written) to a 'T'Plug power into Camera,  Connect ethernet cable to your router, install SD card.  So far so good.  Then you have to go to there web site and create a user account.  Ok, here is where my Security Concern Meter pegged into the red.  For this camera to function you have to create a user account on a foreign server, and then provide them with your WIFI passcode in order for there software to program the camera.  After careful consideration, and knowing I can change my pass on the fly I opted to go for it because I was curious about this camera based on its price point.After going through the four or five windows to set up an account I was able to access the camera, remember its still plugged into the ethernet port.  The minute I connected for live feed I got nothing but massive mic feedback on my pc, so I had to turn my volumn off.  I was able to do all the functions through the online web browser controls.Well now for the real test, what I bought the thing for Wifi connection.  I unplug the Ethernet and no wifi.  The thing will not connect.  I take the unit and literally plug it in within five feet of my Wifi Router and it will still not connect.  I did the install procedure at least a dozen times and reset the unit several times.  After an hour of wasted time I packed the thing back and off to Amazon it goes.  I am tech savy enough to know there is a huge problem with this unit.Normally I rarely ever go through the bad reviews but on this product curiosity got the better of me. I clicked the one star review and lo and behold countless complaints about the same problem I had, and these were not scattered over years.  I counted close to 50 of them within a few months of August 2015.  A lot of them from individuals who based on how they described the problem were as Tech Savy as myself.  Do your self a favor and steer clear from this product.  And if the Tech complaints don't get you just think about this:You buy this unit, install it, and it works as advertised.  You set it up in your infants room thinking you now have peace of mind.  One problem, everything this camera is seeing, and hearing is being transmitted back to the Foreign servers of Fujikam 24/7.  That means someone can be monitoring your child from a third world country and over time they will know your daily patterns, and of course your Router during setup broadcasted to them your  I.P. address which with the right software on the net will lead directly to your home address. I am not much of a conspiracy theorist but if I was this is the greatest gimmick out there to engage in black market child selling.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXDTO6WB5I0WM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JAJ9U8K#wasThisHelpful","RXDTO6WB5I0WM","A3SR9VQUHQF0GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SR9VQUHQF0GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What can I say, snaps those little suckers dead every time.We have a hoarder that lives a few doors down and the rats that live in this house travel the fence line to find food.  My yard just happens to be the fence highway they travel to get to other neighbors homes that live pet food etc.. out.  I started a few years back using the conventional wood snapper traps.  There good, but man watch your fingers and hands when you set them. Looking at an alternative I stumbled across these bad boys at my local farm supply.http://www.amazon.com/Trapper-T-Rex-Rat-Trap-Traps/dp/B0084X5ONI/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&qid=1438880570&sr=8-16&keywords=rat+trapsThe T-Rex at our farm supply were pricey at $10.00 a pop, but they looked great, seemed easy to load etc..so I bought six of them.  Big mistake.  They lasted about two to three months and would break, in the same place every time.  The latch lip that holds it down when you set it.  Also, my traps are screwed down to the upper fence cross member, so on these units you have to hold the trap open to load the bait.  Fed up with these T-rexes I found these Snap-E's.  Bought a couple of them and could not be happier.  These units are like the Rat Terminator.  They consistently catch em, whereas the T-Rex on occasion they would get out.  I have found rats hanging by their paw, even a couple where the trap nailed them on the snot/mouth. I am certainly going to order more of these just to have them on hand.Biggest pro on these traps is the fact that you can load the bait uncocked and then cock it when your done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38FLBMQIQM0X8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000M2YS9K#wasThisHelpful","R38FLBMQIQM0X8","A3SR9VQUHQF0GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SR9VQUHQF0GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I recently became the caregiver for my 85 year old mother who is bed/wheelchair bound.  Unfortunately our house cannot support a transfer bench to move her into the shower so I opted to try this unit with an inflatable bed/hair wash basin.The material this unit is made off is thick and the seams are sealed very well.  I don't ever foresee any leaks developing at the seams.  There is a support tube that inserts at the top of the bag that prevents if from collapsing while you hang it, also makes it easier to carry it from the bathroom to the bedroom.I would give this a five star mark if it had the following.1. A larger opening to fill the unit. For example something in the size of a CamelBack,  backpack hydration unit.  The opening on this bag is small, so if you fill it in the tub like I do you waste water and with the opening so small the surge of water does not allow for the air to escape easily.  The bab is pretty big so you're not going to get it full using a bathroom sink.  The only other option would be to use a kitchen sink.  Is this a deal breaker no, but something to deal with.2. The water release.  Sorry this is a no go.  They incorporate a hospital I.V. drip stop as the on/off for the shower head.  I would have much rather seen a trigger valve.  Truthfully I would have paid extra for something like this.

"I have owned Food Saver units for around 20 years.  Buying and cooking in bulk and then using my FoodSaver to portion on meals and freeze them has been a life saver.  The only downfall has been the cost of replacement bags.  Ouch, even at Costco they're expensive.I spent countless hours reading reviews on Amazon of various products and finally decided to pull the trigger on these Sure Luxury even though they did not have a lot of reviews.  However the ones they did have were all favorable. I got an 8"" and an 11"" roll.  This review is for the 8"", however I see no difference in product between the two.The shipper got high marks for the product showing up in two days using Prime.  I spent a few hours yesterday bagging a variety of foods.  Sausage links, Kings Hawaiian Rolls, (Secret to bagging bread - Freeze it for a few hours so its hard and then vacuum bag it) Fish and some other items.  All in all around 40 bags.  Considering over the last twenty years I have probably vacuumed over 5,000 items in FoodSaver's I can honestly say these bags perform better than the originals.  There approximately the same mil size but for some reason the indented pattern that allows the air to be vacuumed seems to work much better.Two thumbs up for this product,  all probably order a few more rolls in case this vendor in the future does not supply them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G720D83XW9GD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKXMT7A#wasThisHelpful","R2G720D83XW9GD","A3SR9VQUHQF0GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SR9VQUHQF0GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We had a similar model to this unit which dated at least thirty years that finally fell apart from weather exposure.I figured I would just buy one of the more popular units on Amazon that had a good price point.  For a fruit picker it comes down to being only as good as the operator.  However there are some points that I think may be helpful to others.Pros:1. Deep basket, on smaller fruit you can usually harvest several before having to empty basket.  Avocados we can usually pull two to three at a time.2. Foam insert is a nice touch for soft skin fruits like peaches.3. comes with a hose clamp to attach the unit to your pole.  Nice addition so you don't have to run to Home Depot, however be warned the pole we used the clamp was too small.  Luckily we had larger clamps.Cons:1. If you have extremely large fruit you will have a problem as some will not fit in the basket.  My grapefruit tend to be around 1 1/2 larger than a softball and some will not fit in this basket.2. The bent prongs at the end of the picker that are designed to catch the fruit as you pull them off have a tendency to bend.  This occurs with our Oranges as the the are pretty well attached to the tree.  Our Avocados, Grapefruit, Tangerines, Mandarins etc... no problems.3. The pole we used is a Mr. LongPole.  Most common fiberglass extension pole out there.  You find them at almost all brick and mortar hardware stores.  There are issues using these poles and properly attaching the basket to the pole.  (note we did not want a permanent attachment as we use the poles for other things.: These poles use a plastic coupler that attaches the male thread used at the end of the pole to the actual pole.  The coupler is actually a larger diameter than the inside diameter of the basket neck.  The only way to properly attach the basket to these types of poles, using the Hose Clamp is to slide the basket down so the middle of the neck is roughly at the center point of this coupling and then clamp.  Remember the clamp that comes with the unit will not work here.  Fully expanded it will not fit.  If you pull the neck of the basket below the coupler, you could use the hose clamp that came with the unit, however about four inches of your pole would be sticking into the basket.  See the pic I attached which explains all this.Overall for the money its a decent product.  I give it a couple of years of use before it needs replacement.  I think next time all opt in and buy the Phoenix model with the bag and stem cutter.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VQ9IJU38FFNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UGM6YW#wasThisHelpful","R3VQ9IJU38FFNS","A3SR9VQUHQF0GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SR9VQUHQF0GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this battery to replace my almost three year old Samsung that came with my S3.  First the packaging was a cheap little cardboard box with a bubble wrap envelope to hold the battery.  Packaging was obviously previously opened, and there were no Charging/Break in instructions.The Battery had about 63% charge when I installed it. It drained down to 5% within a few hours after installation so I gave it a complete charge to 100%.  That charge drained down in about six hours.  Again repeated the charging......Move forward two weeks of using this battery.  I get about 30% more usage time with this battery compared to the Samsung.  Frankly I see this as pretty poor considering its suppose to be a 3800mah.  It compares to the Samsung when the phone was brand new. I have not gotten a full 24 hours of usage out of this battery.  I was hoping that with the 3800mah I would have at least seen 36 hours before needing a charge. I am still in the window of returning this battery and try another brand.In my humble opinion this is just another knock off battery made in a factory where 30-40 percent of the faulty batteries make it through QC. Personally I would not buy this again.Edit:  Well a few days have gone by since my first review.  This battery is junk, plain and simple.  Had it on a 2a. charge for almost six hours and it did not get past 15%.  Replaced it with the Samsung and no issues charging so I know its not the charger.  Sending it back for a refund.  As I said in my original post this a cheap knock off from a factory that has no QC in place.  I drew three x's on the original box that I am going to ship it back in.  I am curious if someone gets it down the road and if they do they read this post.  Final Comment:  Don't waste your money on this junk battery.  Run, run far and fast.

"In 2011 we switched to Smart Phones.  Anticipating the need to be able to charge at multiple locations I bought several of these in both the 3ft and 6ft range.  I assumed with the Amazon Branding there would be some additional quality control involved, WRONG.Every one of these cables failed within 18 to 24 months.As others have noted, and someone posted a pic of it, the Micro Side of the cable is cheaply made where it goes into the body.  We had several of them pull out, some bent with very little effort and the majority of them failed due to the little friction tabs that are suppose to help keep them in place lost their ability to stand up.At the time we bought them I do not recall if they were designated for 2a power.  I can say that none of the cables at that time were able to support 2a charging, and data was extremely slow.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EIZ3DEE12PXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C28L6EW#wasThisHelpful","R2EIZ3DEE12PXH","A3SR9VQUHQF0GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SR9VQUHQF0GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am an industrial contractor so our phones can get pretty beat up at times.  When we Dropped Nextel years ago and switched to Smart Phones I did a lot of research into cases.  I know one of the big issues would be phones being dropped, bumped into while in a belt clip etc...  Our first Smart Phones were the HTC Evo and I outfitted everyone with Otter Box Defender cases.  After two and half years of in field use we never had one broken screen or failed phone due to being dropped.  After the useful life of the HTCEvo we moved on to the Samsung Galaxy III.  Again I outfitted all the phones with OB-Defender cases.  Two and half years later no broken screens or phones caused by drops etc...Some things to note:  When we had HTC Evo phones I ordered the black cases.  The rubber on the case seemed to be pretty soft and over time the flap for the earphone and power cord began to tear off.  We did not warranty this as it was over one year.  When we switched to Samsungs I opted for colored cases per everyones preference.  The colored cases seem to have a much heavier rubber, however my daughter has the light gray for her Samsung V and it is falling apart.  The rubber on the back of the case seems to be delaminating and where the earpiece and power cord go in the flaps are tearing away.The other nice feature of this phone is the fact that third party companies make Dash and Rear view mirror adapters which when mounted the Otter Box encased phone snaps right into.  A nice feature when you live in a hands free state.I give these covers a four star for only one reason.  The belt clip holster has an issue with the tab that holds the phone in place.  They constantly break off.  To the best of my knowledge OtterBox actually does not make these as we have found the same identical design on AliBaba for other phones.  The plastic used needs to be more of Noryl and not composite injected plastic.  I believe that would help with the tab always breaking.  The good part is OtterBox warranty.  They cover every issue we have had with these holsters no questions asked and even have replaced broken replacements.  Also, we had one or two issues over the years with the front clear screen coming unglued from the rubber case.  We contacted them, sent them pictures as required on the warranty and they covered the flaw with no questions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IT8L0T2JZSK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085JRQPK#wasThisHelpful","R3IT8L0T2JZSK8","A3SR9VQUHQF0GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SR9VQUHQF0GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this just prior to Xmas 2013 for the specific use of monitoring Fry OIl. (I can't judge it's merits on Candy making).From day one the unit made a very slight buzzing sound. (I was too lazy to warranty because of this)  Within the last few weeks the LCD screen started flashing.  Half not visible and finally it went blank, although the unit seems to be working even though the LCD cannot be seen. I have replaced the batteries and still no change.  I emailed Maverick to find out what the warranty on this unit is and if I am still within it how they handle it.  (I will follow up when I here from them)July 2015:  Just wanted to follow up.  I am changing my rating from two stars to one star.  I attempted to contact the seller of this unit multiple times and never received a response.  Poor customer service and very disappointed in the performance of this unit.Pros:: The unit has a long probe and adjustable pot clip, which for my use seemed to grip with no problem, (frying in a dutch oven): Preset temperature for both Candy and Frying nice feature and the ""Reach Temperature"" audio signal for the most part was loud enough.  (I read some complaints where people said they could not hear it in another room. My response: Why would you leave hot oil or hot sugar on a stove and leave the kitchen, just my two cents): Easy clean up of the probe and the flip down cover over the LCD screen provides protection if you store it in a drawer.: LCD head rotates up and down for easy viewing.  Nice feature.Cons:: If you need dead on +/- 1 or 2 degree temperature monitoring this is not the unit you want.  From Maverick's website FAQ page:------I tested my thermometer in boiling water and it reads 208F instead of the expected 212F. Is there anyway to calibrate my digital thermometer?There is no way to calibrate our units. All of our digital thermometers have a tolerance of +/- (3-4) degrees F so it is normally for the temperature readings to be off by a few degrees.--------: A few people complained about the size of the digital LCD display being to small. I agree its hard to read, I measure it to be almost like a 4 or 5 font, so if your eyesight is not that of a Steely-eyed Rocket Scientist you're going to be squinting a little bit to read the display.All in all it is an ok digital thermometer.  Would I buy it again, probably because it is so cheap.  However I may try a Poland if Maverick does not warranty my current unit.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NNSUDYI8OXRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000AQL25#wasThisHelpful","R3NNSUDYI8OXRZ","A3SR9VQUHQF0GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SR9VQUHQF0GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this shredder two and half years ago.  I have always owned Fellowes shredders and for the most part have never had any real issues with them and when we did, Fellowes was spot on regarding warranty service.The primary reason I bought this unit is the micro shred which meets all the legal shredding requirements mandated for the type of work I do.  I would give this five stars accept for the crappy bag holder design, and this really goes for every Fellows Shredder I have owned.  The bad holder should have some way of attaching the bag around the rim and then holding it in place.  Also who ever designs these things need to put a full bag in one and then consistently pull the bag out to see where all the sharp edges are.  We use the fellows bags and they tend to rip or get caught on the upper portion of the holder.Overall a great shredder and we have had no issues in the 2.5 years we have had it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F5E9DUJ3YRRC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JEBYDE#wasThisHelpful","R3F5E9DUJ3YRRC","A3SR9VQUHQF0GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SR9VQUHQF0GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have found references on other forums about this problem with the twin cuisine so buyer-be-ware.Although they are warrantied for life the hassle is you have to send them in one at a time to Henckel, which frankly I have not taken the time to do, and it can take them up to eight weeks to deal with the warranty.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LNQ11HDMQVQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00066EOVY#wasThisHelpful","R2LNQ11HDMQVQB","A3SR9VQUHQF0GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SR9VQUHQF0GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I rarely ever write reviews on products unless they truly stand out as superior.  The Zojirushi rice cooker is one of those products and I speak with experience as an owner of one for over five years now.Five years ago, fed up with cheap rice cookers from the local Big Box stores I went on a quest to find the perfect Rice Cooker.  I started by going to Asian markets in my area to see what appliances they were selling.  Every store had a variety of Zojirushi rice cookers.  So back to the Internet to learn more about Zojirushi.  Site after site praised these units, so I pulled the trigger and got the 10 cup, induction heating unit. (I recommend the bigger unit as opposed to the 5 cup unit)Since owning this unit we have cooked several hundred batches of rice and every time the batch comes out perfect.  The multiple settings for different types of rice could not be more dead on.  Don't know how they do it, don't care...it's just nice to have a kitchen appliance that does what it is suppose to do over and over without one flaw.I have used the timer and again, product came out perfect.We have even cooked Gaba Rice in this unit.  The setting it has for it takes a couple of hours but the overall product is superb.We buy a variety of bulk wild rices from our local grocery store,creating our own wild rice mixture.  Instead of water we substitute homemade chicken stock as the cooking liquid. The finished product is to die for.Oh, and yes you can cook any grain in these units including hot cereals like oatmeal.If your looking for a rice cooker and can look past the price then don't think twice.  The Zojirushi Induction Rice cooker will not let you down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36JFV9BPOZRN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MAIW1C#wasThisHelpful","R36JFV9BPOZRN1","A3SR9VQUHQF0GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SR9VQUHQF0GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not going to go into detail on how great this product is.  I think the majority of reviewers have hit it dead on.However, for those posts that complain about the unit not charging all give you a heads up explination.The USB connector that is installed in these units is a joke. It becomes loose from its interior mount and pushes back into the headset to the point that the USB cord when pushed into the headset will no longer make contact with its male counter part.  It still has a snug fit, but it won't charge.We switched all our corporate phones at the first of the year to Evo's and bought Voyager Pro+ headsets for each one.  We have returned so many to our local Sprint Store where we purchased them that they will no longer counter-warranty them.  We are now having to go through Plantronics online warranty.Besides the way they mount the USB port in the headset, I think what happens is the natural human instinct to hold the headset straight forward with one hand when you go to plug in the USB cord.  The problem with this is the USB port ends up being at close to a 45 degree angle, (headset design) so you have tendancy to offset the USB cord when you push it into the unit.  That offset angle causes pressure in the wrong place and eventually allows it to break away inside.  Its the only theory that I can come up with for the number of headsets we are returning for warranty.  If it was just one person I would say abuse, but several, that points to a design flaw.For the most part the units are great, if you use it daily, buy a second one and leave it in the drawer.  Believe me your going want it when that USB breaks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P9ZRQJ7XNWDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043EV20G#wasThisHelpful","R1P9ZRQJ7XNWDR","A3SR9VQUHQF0GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SR9VQUHQF0GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought my first food saver unit over 15 years ago.  This is my fourth unit and my last from Food Saver.  Seriously we got better use out of our very first unit in 1997 then we get out of this latest version.  The last unit prior to this one lasted about two years and I doubt that this latest model will last that long.  This latest unit has been in service for around 16 months.Pros:-Looks cool on the counter and takes up less room with its new vertical design.-Stores a full bag roll nicely, and the bi-directional cutter is a nice feature.-spring loaded vacuum hose, again a nice feature so you don't have to root around trying to find the hose attachment when you need it.-Touch buttons give you a lot of control.-Cleaning is fairly simple for the tray and lower gasket-you have unlimited length, so if you want to vac. a full salmon filet you can do it.Cons:- forget vacuuming anything with any moisture content. For example Shrimp, Fish, even some chicken.  The unit sucks the liquid into a holding tray, which has two metal sensors that shut the unit down.  You have to open the unit, (all go into that next) and then wash out the tray, oh and dry it completely because it won't operate unless its dry.- When you go to open this thing it actually folds open so your going to need counter space to do it. Cannot be done one handed, you need two hands to release push the release buttons.-As others have posted its almost impossible to re-use bags.  The used bags don't seem to trigger the sensor inside the unit properly so it will go through the motion of clamping down on the bag and just when you think its going to start vacuuming it releases the bag.-Again as others have noted when this unit seals you loose about one inch of the bag. So forget trying to get maximum use out of a bag.  Just add an inch to what ever you used to use when bagging.-soups-liquids: First get your video camera out because your going to want someone to tape you doing this for laughs later.  I figured out the perfect way to bag liquids years ago.  I open up our dishwasher and pull out the top tray and place my liquid filled bag on top of that and then place the bag in the old style food saver, and got a clean perfect vacuum every time.  This new style its almost impossible to achieve.  Reason.  You have to shove so much of the bag into unit and when it vacuums, you have to be quick to force a seal, because the tray will instantly fill up with fluid and shut the unit down.  In reality for liquids you have to almost double the size of your bag from the amount of liquid you put in it to make it seal properly using this method.-Finicky operation: Lately the unit will have fits of not wanting to seal.  It will go through the motions and then release the bag.  We shut it off, turn it back on and it will work one time.-Cleaning of the upper portion is difficult, none of the parts come out so you have to really make sure you clean everything otherwise your going to wake up the next morning with a nice funk of a smell, oh and its easy to forget to clean out the tray.  My wife forgot a few weeks ago after vacuuming a bunch of Shrimp.-Pop out bag cutter.  Seriously what were they smoking when they came up with this idea.  A bag cutter located at the bottom of the unit.  The only way you could use this thing is to bring the entire unit to the edge of your counter and then run bag through it, and if your lucky you might get a clean cut.Conclusion:If you do occasional vacuum bagging then these units are for you.  If you bag weekly, like we do in our house, these are not the units to buy.  The cost of the bags/rolls alone, even buying them from Cost co, or online defeats the purpose of having these units.  The best option is to buy one of these units. VacMaster Pro 112 Chamber Machine found here[...]Yea they are a lot more money, but when you research how they operate, vacuum and seal you will understand why you want to go with one of these style units.  The bags in bulk are less money then the FoodSaver Units and will offset the price difference in about a year in our household.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GPH393Y76GI3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001E42R8O#wasThisHelpful","R1GPH393Y76GI3","A3SR9VQUHQF0GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SR9VQUHQF0GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A note of warning to all those that have bought the Twin Cuisine.I purchased multiple knives from various vendors three years ago to make a complete Chefs Set.First Henckel makes a great product, as long as you buy there upper end line that is made in Germany.When I purchased the Twin Cuisine line I went to various restuarant suppliers I work with and tried out varies knives for feel.  I have to say that the Twin Cuisine had the overall best fit for my larger hands.  The weight was there and over course the Henckel name.Last winter I was taking some time to stone sharpen all the knives and I noticed cracking on the plastic molded handles.  Not just one knife but every single knife.  From Steak to Carving.  Every single handle had cracks in them.  After researching this on the net, it looks as if the Twin Cuisines all have this problem after a couple of years.I have yet to send them back to Henckel because they informed me it can take up to 12 weeks for them to warranty them.

"I have been a Sorel user since the early 70's when they were first introduced in the States in the Lake Tahoe area.  Introduced my wife to them in the mid 90's and she instantly fell in love with them.  I bought my daughter her first pair two years ago. Youth Yoot series.  These were great boots, although when I got them I was dissapointed that the upper was all vinyl and not leather.  Before I bought her next pair I vefified that the upper was all leather, just like the adult series.My daughter loves her new Sorels.  (Just Like Mom and Dads) They were great, get the job done in the harshist and coldest conditions.  Easily dried out at the end of the day, (Sweat from her feet getting so hot in them)If your a fan of Sorels you cannot go wrong with this boot for kids.One recommendation that was taught to me back in the 70's by Sorel personel.  Even though the boots have a water proof upper and stitching, I make it a habit of every pre-season applying ""Snow-Coat"" to all our Sorels.  I use an old sock, and and an old hair dryer to melt it into the leather and the stitching.  Keeps the leather soft and the seams water proof.I have tromped through ice rivers for miles and never once had a leak in a Sorel.Just to show you the longevity of Sorels.  My first pair, from around 1975 lasted until around 2003.  The only reason I replaced them was there was no more tread left on them.

"If your going to buy one of these units make sure it's the newer version three blade.  At some point in the last year or so the design changed slightly and they added a third blade.  Home Depot carries these in both the new three blade version and two blade version.  Same model number and SKU#.  The older vs has a tool box located on the left side of unit, looking at it from the entry side.  The newer version the tool box is located under the exit tray.  (Heads up)We have had one of these for about four years.  Only used on a couple of projects. The unit works great as long as you use dry wood.  We bought some Premium 2x6's at Home Depot and on the third to fourth pass the motor on this unit fried.

"Been a fan of Pelican products for over twenty years.  From lights to cases.I started using the 2400 Series Stealth Lite years ago because of its rugged design, approvals, (we are a military contractor), and of course the legendary Pelican Warranty.  Although the 2400 is a great flash light, it sometimes is a little to Bulky to carry around.  (Works great as a Hard Hat Lite, though)I started researching lights several months ago and decided on the 2390.Pros: The first thing out of the box is you notice the rugged construction.  It's weight.  It's compact size. This truly feels like a military grade compact flashlight.The touchy feely ends when you throw in the batteries and turn it on.  Wow!!! This is one bright, long throwing flashlight.  Like an idiot I actually turned the light and looked at the illumination.  Instant blindness for a few seconds.  I could see this being a major assist for a Cop or Military person wanted to stop a bad guy in his tracks.In fact my neighbor and good friend who is a cop and officer in the military came over and checked out the light at night.  As he said, ""Hands down the best flashlight he had every used.""  I had a hard time prying it from his hands when he went home.The ballistic belt holster with extra battery compartment is a big plus.  Easy access to the light and you always have a spare set of batteries on hand when you need them. May not seem like much but when your crawling around in complete darkness and your light starts to go dead those spare batteries can be complete life saver.Finally the truly great feature of this light is how bright it is.  I have been forced in the last few days to use my StealthLight 2400, (see cons below) and to compare the difference, well its like illuminating a room with the sun vs. using a candle.Cons:The Lithium batteries that come with the light,.... A joke.  They lost the Lumens Ummph... at around twenty minutes of operation.  (That's not continuous.  That's my estimate of actually usage time)I did a lot of battery research when the lumen value dropped.  Turns out that others have done the research for us on batteries.  Surfire seems to be the hands down winner on Lithium CR123 battery design and manufacturing.  Cheapest place to buy them... Direct from Surefire.Bought a box of twelve for $21.00 from Surefire.  On the net the same box runs from $28.00 to $34.00.  The Surfire batteries work great in these flashlights.  What ever you do, order extra batteries on the net.  Lithium CR123 batteries at the store will run you around $5.00 to $6.00 apiece, Ouch!!!  Trust me you don't want to be in a jam and need batteries at the last minute.This light has no approvals, for example; CSA- Class I, Div. 2; Gp ABCD, T3C; Class ll; Div. 2; Gp G,; FM- Class I, Div. 2; Gp. ABCD, T3A.; MSHA 10C-633-0; ETL - Class I, Div. 1, GP.D, CL.I, Zone 1, GP. IIA OPERATING TEMP. CLASS T3 CONFORMS TO STD.This probably stems from the Lithium batteries and the heat generated from the bulb more then anything.  It can be a problem for certain industries when these approvals are required for use.  For example Fire Fighting.  Combustable confined areas, etc....The Big Con.I dropped my flashlight from around three to four feet in height directly onto a concrete floor at a job sight the other day.  The light hit at a perfect angle on the corner of the lens hood.  The hood split from its machine threads that screw into the battery compartment base.  Looking at it the threaded portion of the hood is very thinly machined aluminum.  Big bummer because I have gotten used to the flashlight, and now I am forced to use a 2400 Stealth light while I warranty the unit.  Like I said earlier its like using a candle vs. the sun.  Thank god for Pelicans Warranty!!!Conclusion:After getting this light and using it for at least four months, on an almost daily basis I would not trade it for anything.  In fact as I have done with Leatherman products in the past all buy an extra one or two as backups when something breaks.All get some of the tactical Accessories for example the gun mount.  I see this light as a great tool while hunting at night.I will also be buying these for my service guys.  Frankly if the thing did not come with a belt holster I could bet one of my guys would have conveniently borrowed it by now. ;)","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R86S90WD8XNJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00275LPWS#wasThisHelpful","R86S90WD8XNJ0","A3SR9VQUHQF0GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SR9VQUHQF0GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got a good chuckle out of reading some of the negative reviews on this unit. I own an industrial water treatment contracting company and it always strikes me as funny how uneducated people are with water, something they use every day.  I figured I would take a minute and clarify a couple of things for people that use or are planning on purchasing one of these humidifiers, (Oh and yes I actually own one)Humidifiers have been a part of our family for around fifteen years after I read a study on how they can reduce the usual winter ailments, colds and flu's.First how these units work.If you take the humidifying unit apart, you will find two probes.  I believe they make them out of Carbon and other materials.  They are round and about "" thick, and approximately four inches long.  These probes are then connected the electrical cord.  When you plug it in and the probes are immersed in water, they create an electrical current between the two probes.  This creates water that boils, and thus creates steam.Some key facts about water.  Pure water will not conduct an electrical current.  This is why the instructions recommend adding a pinch of salt if your unit does not produce steam.  The salt when disolved increases the TDS, (more on that in a minute) thus creating a conductive in the water.Water is considered the Universal Solvent.  In other word's water pretty much will absorb and dissolve anything that we submerge or add to it.  Sometimes instantly. Sometimes over time.  Two key things are in water that effect these humidifiers.  One is the hardness of the water.  Hardness is measured by checking how much Calcium and Magnesium is in the water.  The other effect is Totally Dissolved Solids, or TDS. (all the other minerals that actually dissolve into water)When you boil water, (essentially what these units do), the vapor that they produce is considered pure water or close too pure.  So in essence as the water vapor escapes the unit what is left behind are the residual minerals, (tds) and the hardness, (magnesium and Calcium).  Generally the Hardness cakes on the probes and creates a cement like residual. TDS usually fall out of suspension as clumps.  Gray/black sand/rock formations.So when you read comments in these reviews about residual inside the tank, or that the unit stopped producing steam, what these people are referring to is the residual left over after the water is boiled off.  Depending on the water quality of their tap, the residual can be a lot or very little.Ok, before you purchase one of these units, just remember.  It's $15.00. (Wal Mart has them for a few bucks less) Your not buying an ultra fancy $200.00 BrookStone humidifier/vaporizier.  These are generally one season, low maintenance, throw them away when you're done. (depending how many days out of the year you fire them up)  So keep that in mind.If you want to make one last, you can get some plain white vinegar.  Find a jar or container that the Humidifying unit will fit into.  That means something that the bottom portion that sets in the water not the top part where the cord goes in. (Edited this to better explain it) and fill it with 3/4 vinegar and the rest water, creating a mild acid solution. Set the probe portion in it and let it soak for a day.  Repeat as necessary until the unit operates to your liking.  Note the probes inside the unit do wear out, and hard water deposits do cake up pretty thick on the probes which increase that Wear and Tear effect. (I've taken enough of them apart to know)Bottom line - If you want a cheap way of creating warm humidified air these are the unit for you.  Don't expect anything more then what they price them at, and if you don't plan on maintaining them, ie using vinegar to keep the probes semi-clean of hardness deposits, then expect no more then one to two years of use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQU5MZ8UN1Z23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000TN7ME#wasThisHelpful","RQU5MZ8UN1Z23","A3SR9VQUHQF0GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SR9VQUHQF0GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now THAT'S a tricycle!One of the latest incarnations of the Power Wheels family, the Harley differs in its cool quotient!  ... As in, it's *very* cool.  (Though I have to admit the Jeep Wrangler is pretty cool, too.)It's not apparent from the picture, but the Power Wheels Harley IS three-wheeled.  Like any tricycle, it's possible to tip, but it's pretty stable, in my opinion.This is going to be a HUGE hit with any child lucky enough to get one.  I also think a sit-on vehicle like this is likely to have longer use than a sit-IN toy as a child grows.  The slower speed is fast enough to be fun while being easy for a parent to keep up at walking speed.  When the child is older, you can allow greater speed.This is the best Power Wheels to-date, I think.  It looks good, works well, and is a blast!A few wishes: That the wheels were a LITTLE bit softer and quieter.  The Power Wheels continue the legacy of Hot Wheels trikes in that the hard plastic wheels can be noisy.  And while the HD Cruiser arrived intact, the box took a pretty good beating in delivery.  A beefier box would be nice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BJF4LD5RJ0SI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T2T2UUS#wasThisHelpful","R3BJF4LD5RJ0SI","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eh - just another rolling pin ... right?WRONG!  I was *amazed* at the quality of the Epicurean rolling pin when I opened the box.  The finish is exceptional, and the shaping is dead perfect.  I almost passed this item over because I assumed, despite owning other Epicurean items, that this was just an overpriced, prosaic item.  I also thought that because of the solid construction (i.e., the body and handles are one piece) that it would be hard to use.  Absolutely NONE of this turned out to be the case.  This rolling pin is a joy to use.  It positively glides under your hands.  You don't grip the handles, the pin simply rolls under them.  The shape of the handles is such that you have perfect control.  I also like the pin's heft.  The composite construction makes it heavier than most wood pins, which is a very good thing while rolling.  That it is dishwasher safe is just icing on the cake.  Though to be honest, I would prefer hand-washing it anyway.The Epicurean Rolling Pin is a great example of good design and updated materials improving the most common of items.

"Right up front, I should say that I LIKE Lenox. We have a Lenox holiday China set that we just love as well as other Lenox pieces here and there.This trivet, however is not worthy of the brand. It is indifferently made and indifferently finished. We willlikely use it this season, but it will not remain as part of our  permanent holiday decor.Please see the attached pictures. This is a simple cast piece. It obviously comes from a rough mold and requires both surface grinding (plus polishing for the top) and some handwork to remove the flash in the cutouts. Problem is, the polishing and grinding doesn't remove all the pits, a lot of flash remains, and the cast-in feet are so rough that they don't properly fit and are actually splitting their rubber caps.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G3VUR60RT9ID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TV5HTJ0#wasThisHelpful","R2G3VUR60RT9ID","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Philips Fidelios are quite refined - in construction as well as sound.  Surfaces are textured just so.  Controls move and click with exactly the right pressure and with excellent positive feedback.  They are comfortable (well, as comfortable as possible, given that they are on-ear) and the cushioning is a nice medium soft with no hard or soft spots.  The band initially felt too tight, but lightly springing it outward took care of that.  No cheap wire or metal band extensions here - the band extenders are engineered tubular sliders with a fit and finish that matches the rest of the set.  Even the carrying bag is a step up from the usual.  I'm not sure if it's laminated or a single piece of material, but it's a smooth microfiber on the outside and has a satin interior.The sound is superb (hence the review title).  The Fidelios have an extended range - down to 7 hz and up to 23k hz, and I can't detect any any undue bumps in the spectrum.  Maybe a slight bump in the upper mids, but that's it.  Nothing tinny in the top end (which would drive me around the bend) and I was impressed by the clarity of the low end.  These nicely separate simultaneous low tones and sound/instrument artifacts.  Nothing lost, no mud.  The clarity also adds to their dimensionality.  They are exceptionally quite.  The ambient noise suppression works very well.  I can't detect outside sounds until I have the volume almost off.  It's a pleasant listening experience.I'm not a big fan of on-hear headphones.  I have owned a lot of over the ear headphones over the last 30 years and only a few on-ears.  These are the first on-ears that I would consider the equal of some of my over-ear sets. That they are Bluetooth and fold flat for travel just adds to the attraction.Well Done, Philips!

"When I received the roll of Block-It, I instantly cut a piece and held it under running water.  No penetration at all, regardless of force or time (up to several minutes).  Then I immersed it, crushed it under water, and took it out.  First, I snapped it dry.  It left a barely perceptible dampness on the film side which dried quickly, and a slight dampness that lingered for perhaps 15 minutes on the fabric side.I tried ripping it.  Very tough.  I cut it with a knife.  Point penetration takes a litte effort, but then it slices fairly easily.  Even leaving a ragged cut edge, though, it was still VERY hard to tear.  Cuts can be torn - made to run - with a little less effort than the factory edge, but it will not freely run or tear out on its own.  It will deform quite a bit before the edge finally starts to give.  It does not leave a lot of stray fibers sticking out the edge like some wraps.As mentioned above, there is a film side and a fabric side.  The fabric side is pressure-imprinted with a dense dot pattern, in turn making the ""channels"" on the film side.  ""Fabric"" (as Kimberly Clark calls it) it isn't really.  It's a dense, thin mat of very fine, non-woven fibers.  It presumably provides the surface area to enhance the breathability and self-drying performance of the barrier, the film side being vapor permeable only.Block-It is softer and nicer to work with than other wraps.  I liked it immediately.Among other things, I use house wrap as pattern material for outdoor products-related sewing.  Need to mock up a tent ... house wrap is just the thing.  It has enough strength for the purpose, comes in large sizes, can simulate weather performance, and comes in sizes for things like tent panels.  Block-It happens to stitch really nicely on a sewing machine.  I think it performs for this purpose better than typical wraps and it appears to be FAR less likely to tear on a stitched seam.I'm not quite sure how it would perform as a ground cloth for camping.  It's tough enough, no doubt there.  It's waterproof enough on the film side.  I just don't know how the fabric side might perform, or whether it might hold too much dampness for too long if it were subjected to an extended rainstorm.All-in-all, a superb product.  A distinct step-up for construction purposes over its most common competitor, and a better alternative for some of its non-traditional uses.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8PNDNOFWL54V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0169O364C#wasThisHelpful","R8PNDNOFWL54V","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the second Lucien Piccard Watch I've received for review and I have to say that this brand continues to delight me with its quality.  AMAZING quality for the street price, in fact.  Very finely-finished and best quality stainless, and finely-fitted face.  Contrary to the description (black dial), the watch matches the picture.  The pearl face is quite pretty and the lines radiating from the center are understated and add - you actually can't see them from all angles.  Similarly, the effect of the crystals is understated.  They give just a little more pop on the pearl face, but this is a great watch for anytime wear.Unlike many brands, you can expect to receive a Lucien Piccard in perfect condition.  I've never seen a watch so completely covered in tight (and thick) wrap.  It covers every bit of the watch, with some parts having more than one layer.  It a bit fussy to get off, but the reward is flawless, polished surfaces.One reviewer commented that you need to get a finger between the band and your wrist to open the latch.  No need ... just lift at the connection point to pop it open.The face is 36mm - very common, mainline size for a woman's watch these days, especially for day wear.Please do note that this is a timepiece only.  No day/date.  No rotating bezel.  No complications, etc.Great materials, excellent (Japanese) movement, perfect fit and finish.  Adaptable to multiple uses and circumstances, short of formalwear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22SGVLDL6QCBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JXJAQY#wasThisHelpful","R22SGVLDL6QCBM","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like small humidifiers and have had others of this type and size.  Although they are targeted at small spaces - typically bedrooms, or even bedside - I find they work quite nicely for wintertime use in larger spaces.  I've used them for full winter seasons in quite large spaces, including a great room space that included the kitchen and eat-in area in addition to the family room, plus an office.  It's enough (run on full) to take the edge off the dryness when it's really cold outside, and without saturating the air to the point where it's condensing on windows and sills.  (This was in NH.)  Small humidifiers also don't take up much space.The compromises?  Well, size for one.  It works for you in taking up less space - but it means you have to fill it more often.  It can mean that you run it on high more than you would a larger unit.  Plus these small humidifiers aren't really meant to be run 24x7.  I've worn them out ... typically by not descaling often enough.  But offsetting THAT is low replacement cost.The Vicks unit is an improved version of a bubble style humidifier sold by a number of companies.  Vicks adds the projecter functionality, which is terrific for kids, and the capability of adding vapor pads.  They include a sample of their own Vicks brand pads (menthol).  This is a distinct improvement on adding something directly to the water.  The unit is quiet, starts quickly, and is VERY easy to fill without spilling a drop.  The entire bubble top simply lifts off, you open the fill cap on the bottom, fill, replace the cap, then plop the bubble back on the base.  That's it.  No latches, no fittings, no twist locking, no fuss.  An occasional descaling with plain white vinegar is all that's needed for maintenance.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P9WKZZRXLUZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014P0LJSW#wasThisHelpful","R2P9WKZZRXLUZ6","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are a lot of things to like about this shaker, several of which improve on basic shaker design.First is the integrated juicer.  Obviously irrelevant to a bar setting, it's PERFECT for at-home use where you don't typically have fresh lemon or lime juice.  Not only that, it's stout.  I didn't expect the plastic to be as strong as it is.  The juicer lifts right off without fuss, exposing the strainer top into which it fits!  Very nice integrated design.  The strainer top - the black part in the picture - isn't the usual shaker friction fit that's a pain in the neck, nor is it a fussy screw top.  Plunk it down in the right spot - it's marked, and a quick twist of an inch locks it down.  Leakproof, too, as it's sealed with an O-ring.  The top is plastic, also tough, marked at the 1 and 2-ounce levels, and pops easily onto the shaker top.  It's *also* leakproof as it has its own gasket in the strainer top.  Finally, the tapered main body is really nice to hold while shaking.  Pours nicely, too.A very nice shaker, and one that keeps the mess to a minimum.

"Looks good.  Feels great.  It pretty much stops there ...Belkin puts out some nice products.  This isn't one of them.  I liked it when I opened the box.  Attractive design, and it's made of a combination of hard and soft-touch materials that look and feel great.  While not completely non-slip, the soft-touch plastic on the bottom will prevent outright skidding.  It's also pleasantly weighted.  It promises stability and support.It delivers neither.  The phone is perched awkwardly on an oval pedestal from which the Lightning connecter projects.  You would expect the phone to rest against the raised back - but it does not unless you press the pedestal (and phone) back to do so.  The phone is easily rocked in any direction.  A little push to the side and it will fall off the dock entirely.As MANY reviewers have noted, this ""case compatible"" product is not, in fact, compatible with a great many cases on the market.  I suspect it's not compatible with the *majority* of cases on the market.  I have a very common non-Apple silicone case available at your local big box electronics store and I cannot use the Belkin Mixit without removing the case.  That's a complete deal klller.Disappointing really.  All Belkin needs to do to fix this is to dump the pedestal and provide some adjustabiity for the connecter in the base itself.  Zero to hero.  1 star to 5.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R341TZ7A0CZ26Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E965FGK#wasThisHelpful","R341TZ7A0CZ26Q","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought Ultimate Navigation at the same time as Burns' Wilderness Navigation.  The coverage on compass navigation BASICS is similar in both, with a touch extra depth in Ultimate Navigation.  Beyond that, Ultimate Navigation takes things as far as most will care to go.  More coverage in ""special environments"" (desert, mountains, etc.), more technical detail, more (and sometimes more esoteric) advice.My concern at the time I bought the two books was that Ultimate Navigation would be too much, perhaps confusing.  The slight European cast to the contents didn't help that impression.  I should not have been concerned.  Reading through both at the same time (not literally, of course), I quickly found I preferred Brotherton to Burns.Both Brotherton and Burns have the experience to be regarded at authorities on the topic.  Burns come at it from a hiking/camping point of view, while Brotherton's is rooted in search and rescue.  Even though my interest is the former rather than the latter, I found Brotherton easier to read.Finally, Ultimate Navigation covers topics not included at all in Wilderness Navigation, celestial navigation being the biggie.Highly Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39SPBCPOZU1W4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IH021M#wasThisHelpful","R39SPBCPOZU1W4","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought two Rollypolys, one for my pack, one for my wife's.  These things are little gems.  When rolled up, they are a fraction of the size of most competing dump pouches.  The construction is very stout, too, and the bag stays open on its own beautifully.  The included clip for vertical webbing mounting is a nice touch.  While the Rollypolys have a belt loop, it doesn't seem to add any floppiness when Molle-mounted, as the thing is so compact when rolled up.Ours are mounted on the sides of our packs, low, so that when open you can reach directly into the pouch without fussing with the pack.This is a Swiss Army sort of pouch.  Useful for all kinds of things you wouldn't think of until you have the need.  Anyone who hikes or camps will find uses for it constantly.One reminder applicable to the dump pouch concept, no matter what the brand:  With any MOLLE-mounted dump pouch, you will have to remove the pouch to carry it full or conveniently dump it.  Leave it mounted on your pack and you have 3 options: empty it an item or handful at a time, turn the pouch inside out to empty it, or turn your pack upside down.  Yikes!  Obviously not an issue if you're using it to carry a water bottle or something.I used Blackhawk! 3"" Speed Clips to mount mine.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R292L151880EW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019OSA30#wasThisHelpful","R292L151880EW8","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently bought a couple of Maxpedition Rolypoly dump pouches.  I really don't care for their Tac Ties and I'm not too fond of some of the other strap alternatives on the market either.  So I grimaced and bought the Blackhawk! Speed Clips.Wow, these things really hold!  I had my doubts.  Would the clips at each end slip off the PALS webbing?  Would the pouch feel secure?  Could it be knocked off ...The clips not only hold, but are somewhat difficult to get over the webbing until you get the hang of it.  There is no shaking or bumping off of the pouch.  These are as secure as conventional snap straps.  While those may be permanently attached to the pouch at the top, snaps do pop open, and it is somewhat easier for a soft strap to work loose if it does than for the Speed Clips to come off on their own.  But that's cutting a fine line, I think.  The point is that the Speed Clips hold very well indeed.""Speed,"" however, may be overstating things a bit.  I'll grant that you can get them off pretty quickly, but getting them on still takes a bit of time.  If you really need rapid off AND on, perhaps you're better off with something like Vanquest's molle sticks.  The Blackhawk! Speed Clips are best viewed as an excellent alternative to the several other semi-permanent strap options out there.Recommended and available in several sizes and a couple of colors.

"This is a humongous watch.  Some automatic chronographs are this large to incorporate a lot of complications ... but this is a quartz watch with only the most basic chrono functions.  Reviewers seem to have received different watches.  Mine DOES have the 21446 Pro Diver tag on it, does have the typical 3 embedded chrono dials as well as the dedicated start, stop/reset buttons, and does have a rotating bezel (counterclockwise only, as is often the case).  Note that the bezel is VERY stiff when new.  (That's OK.)Stylish?  Opinions differ.  Gold isn't my cup of tea, but the styling itself is classic diver watch, with big number markers, easily read bezel marks, and nice, big crown and buttons.  Mine came with a stainless steel bracelet, not the band pictured.  As a fashion accessory, big is in!  So it actually works for the ladies for certain kinds of outfits.  Otherwise, think big guy.  6'4""+?  This is your watch.  I can almost guarantee the band or bracelet will be big enough, too.So, whether as a user or a fashion accessory, it works.  As long as you like gold.  As long as you like BIG.  Purely from a ratings perspective, I gave it three stars because I think the overall quality is OK, but it's just a bit much.

"This is a very nicely-made and finished watch at this (street) price point.  It is competing with everything from aluminum, plastic, and pot metal cases with cheaper straps, to a lot of lesser stainless steel models.  The back of the LP, if not the rest, is 316 stainless.  The entire watch, both case and strap, is just beautifully finished and polished.  The quartz movement is Japanese (usually a pick-up over the more common Chinese movements on watches in this price range.There is exactly nothing rose or rosy on this watch, despite the model name.  And despite it being described as a woman's watch, it leans a lot more toward being a genderless sports watch design than feminine.  The only nod to the latter is really the outsized Roman numerals on the dial.Please note that the dive-type bezel is stationary and there is no sweep second hand.  I.e., the bezel is a decorative element.  There are no secondary functions on this watch - including day/date.  It is time only.  The watch is water RESISTANT only.  It is NOT waterproof.  All of this is informational.  Lucian Piccard is not posturing this watch as something it is not.  It is a timepiece and a dress accessory.  I include these comments for anyone unfamiliar with watches who is looking for a functional sports watch (dive, chronometer, etc.), perhaps as a gift.Minor criticisms are that the case is bit thicker than I would like, given that it's a timepiece only, and the crown, attractive though it is, is small and shaped in a way that makes it a bit hard to turn.In it's price class and for it's intended purposes, I think this is quite a bit better made than many.

"I really like this pack a lot.  It has compromises in size, organization, weight, construction, and so on, but every pack does.  For my uses - bug-out, survival, daypack, compact weekender, etc., it excels.  The organization of the admin compartment is superb.  The external PALS coverage is exactly what I wanted.  I wanted a strong handle.  It's tough.  And it's comfortable for both me and my wife (I bought two), i.e., no anatomy issues.Leaving aside the ""normal"" compromises, there are only a few things I'd like to see in addition.  The biggest of those is some PALS webbing on the back panel of the main compartment.  I understand why they are not there, of course, given the panel material, and that I could use a standalone panel, but still ...  Second, It would really nice if the admin compartment were a detachable bag.

"Absolutely 5 stars ... but you really, really, really need to know its best use, and why THAT'S what drives the rating.The ""nots"" first (as applied to best use):It's not for learning knots.It's not for knowing their applicability.It's not for knowing alternatives or limitations ... even, in some case, their dangers.It's not for comprehensive tying instructions.It's not for perspective on cordage, as applied to knots or otherwise.What it IS is a compact, limited, reminder reference.  Like many other reviewers, I could pick over which knots to include or exclude.  I have decided opinions on being cautious with some of those included.  I don't NEED the reminder for all of them ... which represents unwanted weight and bulk in an emergency pack.But still - as a reasonably chosen set, in a very compact form, waterproof, and crystal clear (I obviously disagree with a few reviewers on this), it nails its best use for me.  I.e., in that aforementioned pack.If you need a good knot learning reference, I highly recommend the Grog Knot app and website.  This is one instance in which apps are better than books for learning.

"Review preface - I'm the enterprise data architect in one of the largest financial services firms in the US.  My comments pertain to such environments.I found this book ... conventional.  Perversely, I suppose, I found it too data-centric!  Data does NOT drive the organization.  Data - or better, information - informs it, and the difference goes a lot further than subtleties.  The author takes things a bit far, IMHO, when it comes to suggesting C-level roles for data and analytics.Data management issues are legion and getting more complex all the time.  You cannot fix, solve, correct, or compensate them for them in the ways suggested by the author.  Mind you, that does not obviate the need to take many of the steps covered in the book.  After all, if you have a need for mastered data in a particular context, you have the need.  Addressing data quality, especially narrowly focused on an issue, will always be necessary.But none of the data management topics in the book, and that's what they are, will really address the information needs of a large, complex, modern corporate environment except at the margins.  The goals, beyond simple monitoring mechanisms like dashboards and KPIs (the bane of my existence) are sometimes put in an analytics framework.  They might be articulated as descriptive, prescriptive, and predictive, for example.  Reporting strategies.  Models.  Etc.  All of these are a house of cards built on assumptions of ownership, control, quality, security, and enforcement that are increasingly irrelevant.  Want hardening of the company data arteries?  Put modern ""data management"" in place.  If it doesn't consume your company's entire budget or drive you to the bin, it will leave you holding, in a few years, a figuratively unoccupied leash wondering where the dog went as everyone, every business process, every vendor system, every legacy situation, every new technology, and every bit data freely available everywhere and anywhere undermines and obviates your strategy.Here's the heart of it.  State.  We increasingly need ALL of our data in every conceivable state, in motion or at rest, even temporary and error-ridden, in infinitely possible combinations.  Oh, and the rest of the world's data too, in the same way.  No matter what your data management activity perspective, the problems just became insurmountable.  The fact that most data forms don't carry sufficient state or sematic information complicates things further.Doubless, I'm preaching to the choir here.  But wait, you say, how about the more limited usages mentioned earlier?  Doesn't that validate the need for data management structure?  Well, yes and no.  I'll stipulate the value of (data) control and definition within the context of a business operational process.  But recognize that NON-operational data use, process-bound or not, is made more difficult by those controls and definitions.  I'll note in passing that non-documented and unofficial processes exist (sometimes properly) WITHIN the boundaries of a larger business process ... and it is often the data in THIS context that is wanted by someone over yonder!  (Just ask your nearest auditor.)Finally, consider how any particular data is becoming increasingly irrelevant.  (Again, all of this in the context of a very large organization or corporation.)  An insufficiently appreciated phenomenon of truly vast data availability is that data compensates for data.  What if you had, as a vendor who recently presented at my firm has, 30,000+ data points per person, tracked within thousands and thousands of tiny geographic boundaries?  Don't have this or that data?  This bit is old or of suspicious quality?  Don't have access to yet something else?  Guess what ... you can impute that data with astounding (and known) statistical accuracy.  Um, your PII data policies aren't gone - you're going to be held to them, possibly to criminal violation levels, but it's now security theater and better viewed as a cost burden rather than a control.By all means, have at the activities in ""Creating a Data Driven Organization.""  It is well-written and clear (hence the 4 stars).  You really have to to be able to operate.  Just don't expect it to actually rise to the title's promise in the modern world.Parting shot - expect ""the organization"" to fragment, too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36U1GMKF7TWXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1491916915#wasThisHelpful","R36U1GMKF7TWXX","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I cannot tell you how many sets of drills, bits, ratchets, and so on that I've purchased over the years.  It seems like half the time I go out to purchase a drillbit, I wind up with a set because the pricing is so heavily biased toward sets. I.e., I can buy a single bit Or an entire set for a couple of bucks more.So in several respects, this Bosch 91 piece set is no different.  It has the usual assortment If larger than most.  Screwdriver bits, flathead, Phillips, star, and Torx.  A ratchet handle. A small assortment of nutdrivers.  And several types of drills, including masonry, general purpose, and brad bit.  The last is a nice addition. They can be hard to find in the big box stores, and are much, much better to use in wood then the general purpose bits most people use.At the proposed sell price (this set is pre-release as I write this), this is a LOT of set for the money.  I have a few minor complaints, but the set is so well priced that I cannot in good faith give it less than five stars.The complaints are these: I don't like the cheap, blowmolded case.  Cases of this type of  ALWAYS wind up unable to hold some of the tools firmly.  The way Bosch has implemented it, I'm not sure if they have addressed the problem or made it worse. Rather than mounting the bits and drills directly to the blowmolded surface, they are placed into soft plastic holders first.  These feel almost like the soft, white plastic erasers you used in school.  A couple of them had already slipped out of place in shipping.  Second, the ratchet handle is serviceable but not terribly high quality, either.  Good enough for homeowner use, but I look on it as an eventual throwaway.  The quality of the various bits remains to be seen.  I like Bosch tools quite a lot but I don't expect best quality bits in these sets anyway.So the rating leans heavily toward value for the money. Sure, a ""better"" alternative is a nice selection of, say, Excelite or Wiha nut drivers and screwdrivers, and some top quality drills,  but a) that's going to cost some serious coin, and B) that's not what most people really need anyway.  I guess this is another way of saying that if you keep finding yourself buying set after set like me, perhaps a better alternative is to go for broke and buy top-of-the-line tools ... hopefully once.  But if you are in the typical homeowner category, this is a well appointed set for the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZQ6HVEC1HTDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015SR9I02#wasThisHelpful","R2ZQ6HVEC1HTDF","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are clearly better alternatives to the gloves found in the big box stores, supermarkets, etc.  They are a bit more durable. They seem to fit better. And the very light texture helps without being too much at all.

"When my wife first started using airbrush makeup, we did not have a cleaning station.  We thought that since everything she was using was water-based and that the cleaner was water thinnable besides, that simply spraying out into some paper towels or perhaps the wastebasket would be fine.Oh my God, no!  Trust me, the last thing you want is to get a good lung full of airbrush cleaner mist!  So we quickly and I mean quickly acquired an Iwata cleaning station.Like all Iwata equipment, the cleaning station is very nicely made indeed.  It has a well shaped, weighty, frosted glass jar, heavy duty lid with replaceable filters for the exhaust port, a heavy-duty chrome airbrush support, and a matching chrome loop handle.  The port for the airbrush tip is rubber grommeted.  The whole thing may be taken apart and stored in its own jar!Functionally, it is perfect. It's dead simple to use and filters beautifully, besides catching excess cleaner and paint (or makeup) in the jar, of course.  It is also aesthetically nice, which was something of a surprise given it's utilitarian nature.We have since acquired another, as we have added airbrushes. There was no question as to which cleaning station to buy after the experience with the first.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6YULL5EUIOEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VADIVC#wasThisHelpful","R6YULL5EUIOEQ","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We recently re-did our bedroom closet,  in the process adding a third tier of shirt hanging rods  near the (10') ceiling.  At first, we thought we would use a stepstool that we keep in the closet. That got old fast!  Looking into hanger hooks, we found a variety of rigid and telescoping types.  We decided to go with the commercial quality, rigid, one piece hook. I'm glad we did!  The quality is really, really good. One piece, chrome steel.  Nicely finished wood handle.  And the book is generously sized. Surprisingly, it is lighter than we expected.  It works beautifully and easily.  When done, it hangs  dead straight  on the end of the middle tier hanging rod.  So no fussing to find it in a dark corner or having it get tangled up in things.This was an inexpensive, easy win for us.  Highly recommended over the gimmicky, multi-piece and consumer grade alternatives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L0TFQ733MESN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0027Z02ZY#wasThisHelpful","R3L0TFQ733MESN","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this knife for my wife after she saw the ladybug version. She wanted something slightly larger than that knife and thought the dragonfly knife a bit nicer besides. When the knife was delivered and she opened it, it exceeded both our expectations! This is a beautifully made knife.  The fit and finish on her example is about as close to perfect as I have seen in this price range.  Every bit of it is well finished. The knife arrived shaving sharp.  The lockup is really strong.  (lockback-type)  She even commented on the quality of the clip and its attachment.  Unlike other knives she owns, this one stays in an organizer next to her living room chair, where she keep it at hand for constant use.  As a fine craft object, despite being machine made, I see her pick it up from time to time to simply look at it and enjoy it, too. The Dragonfly is Japanese made.  As with many Japanese Spyderco knives, it uses VG10 steel.  It seems to be a good choice for this knife.  It holds an edge well for the household uses to which it is put, is easy to sharpen, and is a nice step up from the run-of-the-mill stainless types used in cheaper knives.The knife was a bit stiff when new, but is breaking in quite nicely. I'm happy to report that the thumbhole is usable for one-handed opening of this knife, though I had my doubts before it arrived due to the knife's small size.  As a lockback, of course, it requires both hands to safely close it.Recommended!  And though I have never been a huge fan of Spyderco knives, this one has notably piqued my interest in them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I87FI4CZNZOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002YWVUC4#wasThisHelpful","R1I87FI4CZNZOG","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are as well made as the other jewelry in the Amazon curated collection.  Good detail. Good construction.  The materials, of course, have been either downgraded from fine jewelry or upgraded from costume jewelry, depending on your point of view.In this case, you get sterling silver, man-made white sapphires, and processed (though genuine) amethyst.  That combination at this price is a very good value.I'm giving these earrings only four stars, however, as I thought they came off a bit flashier than elegant.  They are of a (larger) size that lends them best to dress wear.  I believe they would be too much, too large for every day wear, unless perhaps you work in a rather formal environment, simply like to wear a lot of jewelry, or like larger pieces.  Don't take my size comments too literally though!

Tables are provided - inline with the content where you need them - to size conductors, boxes, compute loads, etc.This is usable as a desk reference, but its small size, clarity, durability, and instant access to information makes it perfect for homeowner use where the work is being done.

"The Cuisinart CSG-900 setup is quite nice.  Range is SUPERB, with monitoring up to 300' away.  I REALLY like that it takes two probes. One monitors the grill's temp itself, and the package includes a grill/grate standoff, and one probe for the food.This setup is about as good as it gets for my Big Green Egg smoker setup. Smoking/barbecueing things like pork shoulder, brisket, etc. can be a bit of a pain from the standpoint of maintaining smoker temp within a few degrees over as long as 15-20 hours.  I'm accustomed to going outside frequently to check and adjust.  A remote monitoring solution is going to save a lot of trips.I don't have to worry about internal meat temps when smoking meat all day.  But I do for barbecuing and grilling larger items with shorter cooking times.  Enter the Cuisinart's food probe.  Not terribly useful to have a remote for a quick grill item, of course - but something like a 2"" filet or a whole chicken?  Absolutely.Although the CSG-900 seems well enough made, I'm unsure of the longevity of the plastic.  I would have preferred something tougher and perhaps even rubberized, particularly for the outdoor unit.  The latter, by the way, is weather-sealed, with a gasket on the battery compartment door.  You have to use a screwdriver to open the compartment, unfortunately, but the machine screws thread into brass inserts, not the plastic, so no problem there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MDI87TVLXQEX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013TR2E7M#wasThisHelpful","R1MDI87TVLXQEX","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like these quite a bit. They are frankly better constructed then I expected. The steel is a decently thick gauge without being too heavy. Nothing flimsy here at all. The tips are thicker than the body, as they should be, and are well shaped and perfectly aligned.  I like the soft touch coating. It appears to be well adhered, where I was concerned that it might come off as a cheap dip. The benefit to the extra width is that you can adjust your grip easily. It doesn't do anything for you except the final third near the tip, however, the rest is really styling and only adds weight. At a slightly lower price point, I might give these five stars. As they are at a price where they are competing with really high-quality professional tools, I will knock them back one star as they don't quite rise to that level. As nice as the soft touch feature is, for example, I'm not sure you would want to autoclave these if you have that sort of usage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DONO6F4YGJ7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005TD24UW#wasThisHelpful","R1DONO6F4YGJ7E","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As with my prior review of these labels in another format, these are truly stellar quality.  I particularly like their matte surface,  as it readily takes most pens and markers, besides being printable.  Glue adhesion works just as you would like it too. The labels stay put when you want them to and come off when you need them to.  They ARE waterproof.  Well, I wouldn't soak them in a bucket of water permanently, or anything like that, but they are going to resist getting wet quite nicely.  Do not get the glue wet before you stick the label down, however!  It won't stick! Once it's there, no problem.  The larger format of these labels is really convenient if you have a lot of text or graphics. Just be aware that the cost per label is quite a bit higher, too.  There are several hundred more labels per pack in the smaller format.

"The DLL apron has an interesting mix of qualities.  Mostly good.(Preface - I'm a 5'8.5"" male.)The apron body itself is larger than usual.  It extends WELL over my sides into the back a bit.  Full side coverage!  The top of the apron (chest, blouse, or upper) is similarly generous, bordering on too large.  Why too large?  Because I have to tighten the neck strap to keep it from sagging to the point where it's hard to slip over my head.  It likely would work better on a woman as many aprons are defiicient in this regard.The straps are asymmetic.  Longer on one side than the other.  As I like to tie an apron in the front, they are barely long enough, but do work.  Because they are asymmetric, the tie ends up on the side (which is fine).The fabric is THIN.  Hold it up to the light and you can see through it. Washing will shrink it a little.  (I'll return to this review after more use.)  That includes both the body of the apron as well as the straps.  Besides concerns over bleed-through, it is hard to get the apron to lie completely flat - not quite enough body for that.  The rings holding the neck strap are smallish and light-gauge steel.  That turns out to be a Good Thing, however, as they hold the strap tightly and do not slip, unlike many others on the market.Well constructed.  Well sewn.

"(This review duplicates one I posted for another Wrangler pair in the same line, though different sizing and slightly different design.  Same quality.  Same fit.)Frankly, much better than expected! I mostly gave up on Wrangler years ago. This pair of pants, though still a lower-priced, minimally-designed, mass-market item, is nonetheless excellent in several ways. The fit is spot on, waist to ease in hips and butt, crotch, and thighs to hems. Detailing, such as it is, is good, from zipper and studs to stitching. A substantial, jeans-like button/stud closure. The material is lightweight, but tough. I appreciate that as an alternative to jeans, as I currently live in the South.

"This is my first plastic ACME whistle - I bought a yellow 660 also. (I'm a huge fan of their metal whistles, having owned them for 50 years.) I kept a couple of other plastic whistles, having tried and tossed them over the years. One is a Fox 40. Until now, I thought that was about as good as you could get with plastic. The ACME 660 blows it away - pun intended. It is incredibly easy blowing, light, tough, and LOUD. Loud and high-pitched ... higher than an ACME 60.5. In fact, it is just short of shrill. It WILL get attention. Any reasonable blow on the 660 will give a classic pea whistle sound, which differentiates it from pea-less warbling-type whistles with multiple holes, which have different sound qualities at different pressures.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MXX5YD3S4JGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000633LQG#wasThisHelpful","R3MXX5YD3S4JGX","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was quite dismayed on receiving the mount box.  It was tiny!  OMG, I thought, this is going to be some ungodly conglomeration of small parts engineered to fit in small, flat package, ala IKEA.Nope, this mount is a robust chunk of heavy-gauge steel.  It's *beautifully* made (as well as designed), smooth in operation, though stiff when new, and dead simple to put together and mount.  I particularly appreciate that you have some leveling capability after the mount is up.  I also didn't appreciate, until the TV was up, that there is a good amount of side-to-side positioning available, as well as tilt and swing, due to the way the support arms work.The finish on the mount is as flawless as the design.  It has a really good coat of paint (may be powder coat - not sure about that), and not a burr, bit of flash, or sharp edge ANYWHERE.  Everything is smooth, radiused, surface finished, and painted perfectly.All fasteners are included, including lag bolts for the wall.  They are packaged - wait for it - in a compartmented strip of heavy plastic bag ... each type of fastener in its own compartment and labeled!  I've never seen anyone else do that.  The quality of the hardware appears good and it, like the mount, is painted and matches.  Machine screws and spacers are provided to match a wide variety of TV fastener needs.The only thing that extended my installation was the discovery that my walls are steel framed (this is an apartment).  So I needed to use anchors and not the provided lag bolts.  No problem, just took a run to the store.  I had a brief scare after opening everything up thinking my TV wasn't compatible, but quickly figured out there were hidden mount points under a piece of the table-top mount that I hadn't removed yet.  When I called EchoGear support, I had someone on the line within a couple of minutes.  Terrific service.I couldn't be happier with this mount.  Stellar quality at a world-beating price.  I almost bought a full-motion mount at Best Buy for nearly $200.  And the EchoGear mount is a far better product for a MUCH lower price.  It simply cannot be beat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUOPRVEF4IYQK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VMJEK2C#wasThisHelpful","RUOPRVEF4IYQK","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like these.  They are well-made and fit my Z-Racks (with cover supports) well.  These are a good alternative to vinyl if you need to block light.  My only complaint, hence the 4 stars, is that I find them over-priced for what they are - a fairly simple, lightweight nylon cover with 2 zippers.  It seems like it should be possible to sell these for a fraction of the current price.  They are almost as much as a decent, basic rack!The Garment Store was terrific, by the way.

"This is my first plastic ACME whistle.  (I'm a huge fan of their metal whistles, having owned them for 50 years.)  I kept a couple of other plastic whistles, having tried and tossed them over the years.  One is a Fox 40.  Until now, I thought that was about as good as you could get with plastic.  The ACME 660 blows it away - pun intended.  It is incredibly easy blowing, light, tough, and LOUD.  Loud and high-pitched ... higher than an ACME 60.5.  In fact, it is just short of shrill.  It WILL get attention.  Any reasonable blow on the 660 will give a classic pea whistle sound, which differentiates it from pea-less warbling-type whistles with multiple holes, which have different sound qualities at different pressures.A great whistle in modern materials - and still in the Thunderer family of tones.  The 660 is an excellent choice for a keychain whistle.  Light and in a bright color, you won't mind carrying it, and it's easy to find instantly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R7W11Q2P48VD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LQMOFC#wasThisHelpful","R3R7W11Q2P48VD","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Frankly, much better than expected!  I mostly gave up on Wrangler years ago.  This pair of pants, though still a lower-priced, minimally-designed, mass-market item, is nonetheless excellent in several ways.  The fit is spot on, waist to ease in hips and butt, crotch, and thighs to hems.  Detailing, such as it is, is good, from zipper and studs to stitching. A substantial, jeans-like button/stud closure.  The material is lightweight, but tough.  I appreciate that as an alternative to jeans, as I currently live in the South.  These are stretch pants, but that has been done *minimally* and just right (5% spandex).  Just enough to ease movement.  These are not the stretch poly pants of decades ago.I'm wearing them to work tomorrow.Nicely done, Wrangler!

"Most of the details in the build of the CM57 are quite nice.  The body material provides a nice grip - well-shaped, too.  The LCD is excellent.  Big, bright symbols and numerals.  No pixellated nonsense here, and the backlight is just right.  The battery door is solid and sealed with what appears to be a neoprene gasket.  It screws closed with a very small philips screw.  I'm not fond of compartments like that, but the CM57 at least has a threaded brass insert, and the screw itself is captive.  It is NOT screwed directly into the plastic body of the meter.  The flexible loop itself is covered with a very tough material and should last a long time.  The points where the cable plugs into the body seem a little flimsier, and I find the twist-lock mechanism to be a little fussy, but it works.  It just doesn't give the same confidence as the rest of the meter.  The built-in (LED) flashlight function seems gimmicky at first, but is well-integrated (when the meter is on, the on/off switch is used to control the flashlight) and is handy.Meter operation is dead simple.  Loop goes around the conductor of interest.  Turn the meter on - it defaults to auto-ranging.  Change the range with a push of the range button if you want.  Inrush has a dedicated button.  Bluetooth is built-in and works with the FLIR app.  I didn't test this, as I have no need for it.  I did verify that Bluetooth works, however, and it's easy to turn on.  Hold and record functions are accessed with a long push of the relevant button and turn on an indicator in the LCD when you do.The ""instruction manual"" is 1 page.  1 page for every language on the planet, that is. (OK, to be fair, it's a ""getting started"" doc.)  It comes with a CD containing 15 PDFs, however.  Each is a separate language version of a full manual.  19 pages, but that's all you need.  One bit of detail of importance to many:  Inrush detection is 100 MS after pressing the Inrush button.  Thresholds are by range and non-adjustable.  They are: A) 30A range - minimum triggering threshold is 0.5A, B) 300A range - minimum triggering threshold is 5.0A; and C) 3000A range -  minimum triggering threshold is 50A.Boxed, and no case, unfortunately.

We have about 80 of them in our storage unit and have been writing contents on the original factory labels, as we haven't found any until now that were really suitable.

"We have owned several Foodsavers over the years.  The oldest - bought perhaps 25 years ago - lasted the longest.  It finally gave up the ghost a couple of years ago.  We bought several others (also Foodsaver), but none lasted very long.So I did some research and bought a Weston commercial sealer AND two hand impulse sealers.  Perfect!  You can seal bags of liquid without bubbles with a little care with an impulse sealer.  (Ours are AIE with 5mm wide seals.)  And the Weston vacuum sealer is incredible.  Fast and powerful, economical with bag rolls, and it has a clear sealing cover so you can see what's going on ... important when packing moist and juicy items (like meat ...).  This current setup, which works very well indeed, is the standard for testing Foodsaver's Gamersaver sealer.As others have pointed out, the Gamesaver is BIG.  Really big.  Too big, and frankly, I don't see a reason for it.  The Weston can seal bags as wide, and that unit is quite a bit smaller.  The motor is powerful enough to pull a decent vacuum.  It isn't as fast as the Weston, nor the vacuum *quite* as good, but it's close, and it's more than good enough.  The Gamesaver has a progress indicator consisting of a series of LED lights.  Nice, but not necessary.  Sealing is somewhat slow, but is VERY good.  The double seal is nice - worthwhile when sealing for longer-term storage ... and a reason we bought our wide-seal impulse sealers for bag-making (among other things).  It is one of the Gamesaver's best features.  I dislike the solid seal cover.  You can't always count on pre-freezing items, nor is it always desirable, and that means you're sealing wet items blind.  The Gamesaver has a decent setup for handling this, using a removable/cleanable liquid catch tray and suctioning UP (through the cover), rather than down, which has a better chance of getting into the motor.  It's an improvement, but a clear cover works better in that you can not only avoid pulling liquid into the pump (which is what the Gamesaver setup addresses), but can hit the manual seal at the precise moment that the bubbles are gone and BEFORE there is a lot of liquid across the seal area.  Liquid in the seal can compromise the seal!  Finally, I really don't like the excess bagging required to seal.  While we usually DO use extra-long bags when sealing large quantities, that's so we have enough bag to cut and re-seal after using a portion.  The Gamesaver requires excess *beyond* the seal, which not only negates that approach, but would use extra bag inches on re-sealing.Bottom line is that the Gamesaver improves on the standard Foodsaver machine in several ways: bag size capability, seal quality, double seal, vacuum power, decent cutter, stainless steel exterior, cord storage, etc.  But it competes at this price point with machines that are its equal or better.  All-in-all, the Gamesaver is a good machine ... as long as you can get it at a good discount.  Perhaps it will come down over time to a more competitive price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JY2O05O5S7OH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARW34TA#wasThisHelpful","R3JY2O05O5S7OH","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm of two minds on this product.  It does work - quite well, in fact.  It closes slowly, gently, and quietly.  It is very lightweight, though.  Molded plastic instead of the solid construction of (typically) higher-end products.  I'm not sure how well it will last.  On the other hand, it's not terribly expensive, either.

I also wouldn't use these for production-like uses (e.g., cutting jump rings for maille) - even on a small scale, but they are perfect for the occasional hard wire snip, in addition to small (thin) nails and brads, pre-made chain, and the like.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N4YX65UTBK3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LHM2POO#wasThisHelpful","R1N4YX65UTBK3W","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Over the years, almost every cable failure I've had has been shorts or breaks at or near the connector.

"I've really taken my time with this book before submitting a review because it's so unusual.  You will see it variously described as for experts (or ""not for beginners""), difficult to wonderful, not a pattern or project book (completely true), focused on menswear (well, sort of), etc.  The author himself finally characterized it in a blog response in a way that made sense to me:  He called it ""a catalog.""Bingo!  Not a catalog in the sales sense, of course, but a catalog of variations applicable to shirtmaking.  I.e., after presenting basic shirt blocks, the book covers HOW various details (collars, cuffs, plackets, etc.) work and what they require from the pattern or block itself.  So it will show how a collar type is cut, assembled, folded, stabilized, and attached to get the desired effect or look.  WHY does such and such a collar curve or stand in the way it does?  WHY does a certain detail require modifying the base pattern in such-and-such a way?  Etc.  ... All without dimensions or patterns per se in the book itself, as again, it is NOT a pattern book.  Someone *really* skilled, of course, could draft their own from the descriptive information and pictures.In essence, the book give the reader a really fast and easy way to reference the look - and work involved - in adding the details they would like in a given shirt or blouse.  This is an excellent resource for people who work from base patterns (or slopers), which describes many advanced sewers.  I think most home sewers would find the material interesting, but frustrating to use.  An advanced sewer who is used to adjusting, re-drafting, and creating series of patterns and even test garments isn't going to be troubled in the least.Like some other reviewers, I find access to the online materials really frustrating.  I'm not really a fan of supplemental online information anyway.  You KNOW it's going to move or disappear at some point in the future ... maybe 2 years, maybe 20, but eventually.  I also agree with common review complaints about some of the details in the book being a bit spotty (references to drawings, and so on).  The book could be organized better, too.All-in-all, I would characterize this as a must-have reference for serious sewers, despite the minor flaws in content and any online content issues.  It's use as a catalog, as the author called it, along with the descriptions of WHY the detail construction works as it does, isn't unique, exactly.  But having it in such compact form, fairly comprehensively for a single garment type, is terrific.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REC94QZ10D453/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1589238265#wasThisHelpful","REC94QZ10D453","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are well-made utensils from a materials and construction standpoint.  From a design point of view, not so much.  My immediate reaction was that they are chunky, i.e., thick and, unfortunately, somewhat clumsy to use as a result.  Spatulas and spoons need more of an edge than these to work effectively.  A pasta fork needs finer tines.  Second, these utensils are somewhat small.  While I have room in my kitchen for a few shorter items, I would not buy these as a primary, or everyday use set.  Finally, they are just too flexible.  That won't get in the way of stirring a thin sauce, but you'll definitely notice when dealing with heavier dishes.  We make homemade hash, for example, which we make to put up in large batches.  Ours requires browning in a cast iron pan and the DII spoons and spatulas won't do the job lifting and turning, and won't do the job scraping.

"These are not sunglasses!That might seem obvious, given the description, but a lot of reviews talk about the V50s as if they were sunglasses.  They are bright environment (usually outdoors, but not always) *safety glasses*.  Do they share some things in common with sunglasses?  Sure, but their primary role is physical protection of the eyes, not fashion wear.  Safety glasses have to meet various specifications, confirmed by testing, have to function in harsh and dirty environments, and have to be usable by a lot of people whose physical characteristics differ.The Jackson V50s are excellent safety glasses.  I don't know about you, but I've had to use my share of crappy generic-looking, mega-oversized, square-lens, wing-on-the-temple-pieces safety glasses that never fit, barely work, and scratch if you sneeze.  The Jacksons are reasonably styled, robust as all get out, come with a headband to replace the temple pieces when needed, have ventilated foam eyecup liners, and are optically decent for a safety glass.  These are really well-made with a lot of attention to detail.  They also come with a drawstring storage bag - keep the scratches away during storage won't be a problem.Criticisms and other comments.  The temple pieces aren't adjustable for either length or fit.  They have a decent spring to them which will keep them in place comfortably for most, but if you have a very thin or very wide face, they may not work well for you.  They do not hook over the ear (that's my preference, actually).  They cannot be used over regular glasses.  Because the V50s are pretty dark for a safety glass, I suspect some people are going to try using them for light welding.  That would be a serious mistake for anything involving an arc, and not a great idea for gas either.Recommended over many, many alternatives in the market ... the safety glasses market, that is, not the sunglasses market.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L7ZBDBRDZLLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EAYXO46#wasThisHelpful","R1L7ZBDBRDZLLQ","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm giving this knife 5 stars despite having a few reservations.  Those are (and I'll detail them further): the Axis mechanism, the blade when unlocked, the blade's finish, and the blade's recurve.  Why, if I have reservations?  In short, because I chose this knife knowing them - and would do so again. It's a terrific combination of utility and carryability in a folder under 3"", feels great in the hand, is tough, and is light besides.  It is my 3rd Benchmade, and my first Benchmade folder.  It replaces a much lesser EDC knife (Buck).On to my issues with the knife:Axis - I'm not a fan of this mechanism.  It requires openings between the scales and liner in order to accommodate the springs.  That's GUARANTEED to accumulate lint and grunge over time - and requires taking the scales off to clean it out if it's stubborn.  Second, I find it's easiest and smoothest when you grip the studs on both sides of the knife.  Yes, it's ambidextrous, but it's not quite as sure using just my thumb.  I expect this will get somewhat better as the pivot wears in.  It's nearly as fast to just use the thumb studs on the blade itself.  Finally, even a slight bit of pressure on the blade makes it very difficult to actuate the mechanism.  So ... both Axis studs and a free blade - instant release.  Anything else, not so much.  And keep it clean.The Blade Unlocked - Ah yes, that same lack of continuous tension that you get in something like a lockback, the free-swinging blade that allows you, once unlocked, to flick it open instantly and effortlessly, can become rather dangerous when you go to folding it again.  I like that I can do it one-handed.  I caution against flicking it closed, though, and have a wonderful cut to prove it.  (I don't have any doubt as to how sharp the blade is from the factory, either.)  The knife flicks open to its lock position, without fail, every time, with the barest flick of the wrist.  Closing it this way is more of dance and not as reliable.I love S30v steel and have several knives made with it.  I also like the tumbled satin finish on this knife.  I don't like the machining marks left before tumbling, however.  You can both feel and see them on every surface of the blade.  At this price point I expect better, even in a production knife.The Recurve?  For me, that's a sharpening issue.  It's hard enough to sharpen this steel.  The recurve just adds to the problem.  Looks good, though, and it's understated.Other comments and quibbles:  Apart from the lack of pre-polish before tumbling, this knife is very well-made.  No gaps, nothing mis-cut, nothing out of alignment.  It is delivered to design, sharp, and ready-to-go out of the box.  Part of its lightness comes from the partial skeletonization of the liner.  A bonus is that the knife balance just at the point of the index finger cutout.  There are some jimping-like cuts in the liner at the back half of the knife.  Pointless, really, as they are *below* the level of the scales.Summary - great knife.  There are compromises, but all knives have them, and I bought the North Fork knowing exactly what they are.  Your mileage may vary, but I would buy it again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38H91EEJSIE8L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IB00C68#wasThisHelpful","R38H91EEJSIE8L","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although not *exactly* what I was looking for (which was a multiclamp), I got a REALLY good price - $14.00 - on one of these at Guitar Center (sorry, Amazon), as it was the last one in stock, so I made it work.I just love DW hardware!  My rack is a mix of brands: Gibraltar, DW, Pearl, etc.  All of it is very functional, but the DW stuff is by far the best built. Better machined, better finished.  Little things like the springs on the connectors make life easier.  Hinges are smoother and tighter.  And DW appears to use better materials.  It's satisfyingly solid.If only DW produced the range of connectors that Gibraltar does!  Nonethless, that's irrelevant here.  This is a basic 1.5"" rack tube to vee clamp.

"I grew up in a large family.  Middle child with older sisters and younger brothers.  Born in the mid-50s and really coming of age in the mid to late 70s, the events at the center of Days of Rage were at once familiar, yet somehow more a part of my sisters' lives than mine.  They were involved in the causes of the time - protests to SDS to Woodstock, no less - but were far from radical.  Perhaps because of that, I always had the impression that the radical and so-called revolutionary groups of that period were never truly a major threat, that their views were simply too extreme for most people, however they might sympathize with some of the causes nominally rooting their philosophies.Another reviewer notes something similar when citing thousands of bombings during this period, and people weren't unduly alarmed.  Call it cultural warfare or criminality, a lot of people ultimately rolled their eyes, dismissed these groups, and, in the end, condemned them to the distant margins they wound up inhabiting, in turn to be progressively eliminated by the political and law enforcement machinery.  Few of us with these impressions have been surprised when some long-lost radical resurfaces after having spent the better part of life in a middle-class existence.  People like Bill Ayers notwithstanding, most of the so-called radicals faded into ordinary life.  I had a Sunday School teacher who was a former Weatherman.Burrough's book only strengthens my original impressions.  The stories, interesting though lacking some energy somehow, never persuade me that the influence of any of these people extended much beyond the weeks most of the events hit the news (noting in passing that this is the author's premise).  They carry me back, but don't describe or project their impacts into the present in any compelling way.  It's like reading about the labor riots of decades earlier.  You know they were real, they had their time and context, but they have become footnotes.  And so it is with the extremists of the 60's and 70's.  The cultural impacts of the period itself are undeniable.  That of the most hardened radicals?  Not so much.  The subtitle reads, in part: ""America's ... forgotten age of revolutionary violence.""  Forgotten indeed - and well-titled.It was a terrible waste then and still is.A well-written book, but nonetheless mostly simply descriptive.  Worthwhile for the added details of the people and events, but no real insights.  Perhaps best for those who did not live through the period.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R127TT645N1BJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594204292#wasThisHelpful","R127TT645N1BJ","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like D'Addario strings and use them currently.  They're well-made, consistent, and sound good.  To be perfectly honest, I can't hear a lot of difference between these and the lights I usually use.  The action is somewhat stiffer, of course, but the sound is quite similar.  Sound depends on picks, technique, and the banjo itself, but nonetheless I would recommend choosing between the D'Addario Lights vs. the Mediums on the basis of playing style more than sound.Excellent life, lively, and playable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M36CPH267LOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXRH9Z8#wasThisHelpful","R2M36CPH267LOI","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not quite as stiff as the picture suggests, the InterDesign Bin nonetheless has sufficient body to stand on its own and support a reasonable load.  It's best used for stuffing with objects that aren't so heavy as to collapse it.  So filling it with socks, for example, would be perfect, while marbles would not be.  The knit is loose enough to be able to see through the holes in the fabric here and there, so tiny objects or those with poky parts might not be a great idea either.The material is polypropylene, so should hold up and be easily washed, if necessary.Best as a closet or bureau stuffer, I think, and good for the price.

"Accurately cut for length and cross-sectional dimension, these bars go together easily and hold well without racking, once the canvas is secured.  While the outside surfaces of the bars are well-finished, the cuts where the bars interlock are left somewhat rough.  That's fine, as far as their inner surfaces go, but splinters and whiskers of wood are left sticking out, which can snag you, if you are not careful or do not remove them.

"I bought this rotohammer to chip ice!  After the horrendous 2014/2015 New England winter, having had my house closed down for months while away, I had ice sheets ranging from an inch thick to as much as two feet thick in places around the house - walks, decks, steps, in front of the garage, etc.  I always have some thin ice.  No problem.  I get out there with a long-handled steel ice chipper and away it goes.  Hit a tough spot, scatter some ice melt and come back the next day.  Not this year!  The ice was hard as a rock, very cold, and tightly adhered, having built up and been protected by an overblanket of several feet of compacted snow.  I was having trouble even with the blade of a mattock (pickaxe) and couldn't find anyone to take the job on for me.So I checked out rentals at the two big box home stores.  $180 for two days for an SDS Max hammer with a long scraper.  Not a whole lot less for an SDS plus with a tile scraper.  So I looked at purchase instead.  I found the older model of this hammer on sale as well as this one at the regular price.  Made an offer to the manager for the same $$ off as the old model, which he took.  And went home to chip ice.My God, what a difference.  I chipped ice for 2 solid days.  All.  Day.  Long.  The thinner ice, up to 2"" or so, mostly came up fairly easily.  The thick stuff I had to work more like a jackhammer.  I worked the tool HARD and got the job done.  And still have the roto hammer to show for it.  I was concerned about damage to bricks and deck surfaces from the tile scraper I used.  It was not a problem in practice.  A slower speed with just enough pressure skimmed the bottom bevel of the scraper JUST off the surface.  The little bits of ice left behind mostly disappeared in a day.I would have appreciated a trigger lock or speed limiter, but the trigger is at least easily actuated and controlled.  The front handle is easily and quickly rotated, greatly appreciated as I had to work at all kinds of weird angles in some places.  Working down on a ground-level, horizontal surfaces, I had it vertical most of the time.  The straight line of force from the D-handle through to the bit is perfect.  No tendency to leverage away or wander at all.  I didn't have any use for the hanger, so can't comment on that.  I have NO complaints about vibration with this tool, even after day-long use.  No fatigue or buzzing feeling in the hands like I would get from a reciprocating saw after a while.This is a really well-designed and well-made tool.  I agree with other reviewers that the case is somewhat flimsy.  It's a hard plastic and not very thick.  Spacious, though.Highly Recommended","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MEV1O1N18LYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006030DQM#wasThisHelpful","R1MEV1O1N18LYO","A3KDRLIBWILPMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KDRLIBWILPMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is awesome!Summary:Modern, cool pictures.  Includes many girls and people from all cultures.  Fun information for young people to learn, presented an engaging way.  I highly recommend this book for anyone probably around 2-5 years old.Longer version:I bought this book for my daughter because it is very different from all of her other books.  She is almost 3 years old and has been interested in tools a little bit, curious about screwdrivers and hammers, and she is starting to understand the idea that different people have different jobs, so I thought this would be a fun way to teach her a bit more about that.  It is.  It has just the right amount of new information, and it is presented in this fun way where it shows you the tools (cute drawings of them) and then you can guess what person uses the tools.  When you see the answer it shows a picture of a couple people using the tools to do their job.For example, the first pages say:""To build a HOUSE, start down low.[on a sign] WHOSE TOOLS ARE THOSE? Do you know?""[and on the opposite spread there is a cute picture of a chalk line, chisel, jointer, float]Then you open the right page from the middle open to the left and it shows a spread that says:[on a sign] ""the MASON'S!""and the mason is saying ""I smooth the cement until it's flat!""So the tools and occupations included in this book are:1. chalk line, chisel, jointer, float --> mason2. hammer, level, square, saw --> carpenter3. utility knife, snips, nail gun, ladder --> roofer4. screwdriver, drill, linesman pliers, wire stripper --> electrician5. adjustable wrench, pipe wrench, pipe cutter, pipe tape --> plumber6. brush, roller, roller tray, masking tape --> painter7. (and it ends with the completed house that has more building going on: kids building with blocks).The pictures are very modern and fun.  The tools all have little faces and legs drawn on them, so they are very engaging, instead of boring.  The text is well-chosen.  The borders of the pages also give a clue about what the answer will be.  The pages that reveal the answer have a lot going on in them, so there is plenty to talk about.  We like to find each of the tools in the picture.One of the things that I really like about this book is that it includes a lot of girls. It is also about as diverse as a book about this stuff could possibly be: half of the main characters are female; all ethnicities are represented; there are chubby people and slim people; people appear to be varying ages.Princess books are cool too, but I really enjoy sharing books like this with my daughter, that show girls are DOING something instead of being silly and sitting around waiting to fall in love with a stranger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15OFYM9UJX628/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1419714317#wasThisHelpful","R15OFYM9UJX628","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was okay, and I felt confident going into potty training as a result of reading this book.  It seemed like a good method.Except that it didn't really work for us.I really thought my daughter was ready for potty training--she is two and a half and she talks really well, and she was sometimes asking to use the bathroom...but...we have been doing this method for almost two months, and she is still not potty-trained.  She is dry at night, and poop always goes in the toilet (which makes the whole thing worthwhile anyway, maybe?)...but she went from having about one wet accident a day after a few days of this method to now, she stays dry if we are not home but otherwise it is just one wet accident after another. And she has stopped helping me clean them up, so a few days ago I finally just bought some Pull Ups and she is wearing those half the time. Not the result I was expecting.  I started out very patient, but after so many weeks of cleaning up pee several times every day, I am out of patience and enthusiasm.I think maybe the candy lost its appeal; at first I let her have princess chocolate coins but it seemed like she was having a LOT of candy each day. So we switched to gummy worms, and then pez and jelly beans...but now my daughter is still not potty trained and went from eating almost no sweets to eating tons of candy every day for several weeks. I was kind of expecting it to be a week of m&ms or something, but she doesn't like those, so...?I may reread this and see if I am forgetting a next step or something...if things turn around, I will update.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37FIZM679FODU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0074LAMXI#wasThisHelpful","R37FIZM679FODU","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 2 year-old daughter loves this book.  After we first got it it was her favorite, and she wanted to hear it many times every day.  Now, we just read it occasionally.  A few minutes ago she was feeling really mad, so I pulled it out and started reading, and she instantly calmed down.  Other times without reading it I sometimes ask her, ""what feelings are in your heart right now?"" and that helps her sort it out better.  Feelings can be a little hard for kids to identify and understand, but this expresses them in a new way.  The pictures are modern, interesting, and engaging.  The heart cut outs kind of add to it.  Prior to this we used to read Walter Was Worried fairly often, and that is also a good one (very different from this).  I will probably start including this with second or third birthday gifts for my friends' kids.

"I ordered these because the last time I ordered organic vanilla beans I got the starwest ones, and they ended up not being from Madagascar.  Although the other ones were good, I wondered if I was missing out on something by having ones that were not from Madagascar.  This time I ordered these, thinking that they were organic and from Madagascar, and therefore the best of both worlds.Well...these are sticky, and they are long.  They're fine.  These are kind of bland in flavor compared to the other ones, though.  These come in a sealed plastic package with an address-label type sticker that says they are Madagascar vanilla beans.  The other brand came much better packaged, in a foil type pouch instead of just a little plastic thing.  I don't know if that is part of why the flavor was better?So, I don't know if the difference in flavor is due to where it was grown, the packaging, or the organic (or not) nature of the product, but I don't like these as well as I liked the other ones, and I'm planning to go back to the other ones next time.These beans are fine, so if the difference in price really matters to you a lot and you just want something that will work, these are okay.  If I couldn't buy the other ones I would substitute with these, definitely, because they're not hard like the ones in stores sometimes...I'm sure they would be fine for making vanilla extract.  The other beans are definitely superior, though, so if you're looking for a premium product, I would go with the other one.Another thing about these ones.  I brought them with me to Uruguay, and I've been using them very quickly, but after a few weeks of being wrapped in their own package they started to mold.  Mold is an issue here, so I should have thought that something so moist could have a problem, but if you're not planning to make vanilla and use all of the beans right away, especially if you live somewhere where mold is an issue, keep them in the fridge after you open the package!","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D7VKGIRBOBWW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NZVYF2#wasThisHelpful","R2D7VKGIRBOBWW","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have tried several of Amano's chocolate bars (Dos Rios used to be a favorite) and chocolates from many other artisans.  Last year my husband and I even toured an organic cacao farm in Panama to learn about how chocolate is grown and processed.  This was not my first bar of good chocolate.I discovered Amano Chuao about a month ago, and of all of the chocolates I have tried, this is definitely my favorite.  It has such a symphony of flavors!  Unlike many other fine chocolates, this does not have a strong leather or raisin taste to it...and Amano has such a smooth texture to it that it just melts in your mouth and leaves such a heavenly aftertaste.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FTO85HGEMA2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OYB7MC#wasThisHelpful","R1FTO85HGEMA2E","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this to leave with Grandma when she was going to be watching my daughter while my husband and I were away for a day and a night.  They did the red one, and I did the other two with her later.  I thought it would be a fun activity that they could do together without my mother-in-law needing to come up with something really creative that was at her (toddler) level of development.  My mother-in-law didn't mention how it went for them, but it was fine for us.  I did feel like it was a GREAT option for something to leave with a babysitter so that they have something new and interesting to do, without relying on the babysitter to be creative.  The pieces are all there, and there isn't a big mess, so it is great for that.This isn't the most exciting activity of your kid's life, and it isn't a reusable game, or anything like that.  It will take a little while, either all in one sitting or we did it in three sittings because my daughter was 18 months old when she did these, and her attention span is not very long.I had been thinking it would be fun to do color collages because my daughter is obsessed with what colors things are, and this was nice because it made it so that I didn't have to go find or buy a bunch of stuff.  There were some fun textures, and there is a mix of stuff like papers, stickers, buttons, and just a variety of little things of different colors.Could you do the same thing cheaper on your own?  Eh...maybe?  If you were buying in bulk and getting a bunch of stuff for a bunch of kids, you might be able to.  But you would end up with a lot of extra ""stuff"" and it takes time to find items that will work well, and the sticky back is so much cleaner than trying to work with glue.I would recommend this, especially as an activity for with babysitters, since on my own I don't mind taking the time to be creative and come up with crafts for us, but this is nice and simple without requiring much from the adult who is helping.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IN2VF2OKZR5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B4F8ZE8#wasThisHelpful","R3IN2VF2OKZR5T","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For us these definitely don't work 36 hours.I started using them on my daughter (1.5 years old) and myself because we are doing some extended travel and where we are now if we do nothing my daughter wakes up with 6-8 new bites each morning.  Poor girl!  I don't feel great about her/us breathing chemicals all night long, and the bracelets that we have right now are not working, and they are so huge that she won't leave them on.So, a friend recommended these patches and we picked a few boxes up when we were back in the US for the holidays.At first they were great!  No new bites!  Then, I left one on two nights instead of one and it was more than 36 hours and she got eaten up, but I assumed it was my fault for exceeding the time limit.  Then we started putting a patch on right before bed, and leaving it on for the next night also.  That is less than 36 hours but for us it doesn't work.  When we do that (if she is uncovered at all) she gets bitten just as much as she would without the patch.  For the first night with a fresh patch, it still seems to help, but she often does get a bite or two even with a new patch.  We've been using these most nights for a little over a month now, so maybe the mosquitos who don't like people with patches, or they're desperately hungry by now or something, I don't know.The other thing is, they leave a big sticky residue along the border of the patch.  It takes some scrubbing to get it off, which is not terrible if you're an adult removing it from yourself, but it is much harder to get cooperation from a young toddler...so my daughter has little outlines of patches usually for 3-5 locations at any given time, until I gradually scrape them off during showers.  Which reminds me of something else...if you leave a patch in the same spot too long, it causes a rash.  I think it mentions that on the page that comes with it, and it kind of makes sense anyway, but it is a downside, because it sometimes happens in less than 24-36 hours.  It usually goes away within a day or so, though.So, I'm still glad we bought them.  A net would be tough because I'm in and out of her bed all night, so we need to do SOMETHING and this does seem to make an improvement.  They are not a perfect solution, though.If you're going somewhere for a short amount of time, these are a great option; just definitely plan to change them more often than every 36 hours, and you will probably be happy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQQ57WDKKFI1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RTJCL2#wasThisHelpful","RQQ57WDKKFI1G","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have read about fluoridation much before, this movie is a treat to watch because it includes video footage of people you've already read about, and lots of interesting pictures and video clips.  If you have not studied the topic, then you really, really need to watch this right away so that you can be made aware of this important information and what to do about it before you are affected any more than you already have been.I worried because of the introduction and some of the reviews that this movie might not have scientific sources for information.  Not true!  This film is full of interview with experts on the related subjects, plus clips from news and other media, excerpts from journals, letters, and articles, and even an experiment where they measure fluoride levels in different items.  The sources are not listed or highlighted in an easy to access format--in some cases they are pictures of letters from regulatory agencies, or things like that, but they are legitimate sources.  It isn't just a bunch of extreme opinions, it is good scientific information.The experts included were: Dr. Doris Rapp (whose book on Amazon has overwhelmingly ""excellent"" reviews), a guy from Natural News Mike Adams, Dr. David Kennedy DDS, Dr. Paul Connett (chemistry professor at SLU), James E. Rota (eco-dentist?), Dr. Charlie Goetschel (eco-chemist), Gary O. Pittman (supervisor at chemical plant), Dr. Laura Pressley (chemist), a couple activists (Mary E. Moore and Gianlucca Zanna) and video of Dr. Phyllis Mullenix.Some of the topics that stood out to me:- Two main reasons why a lot of countries do not fluoridate: not right to force it on people who didn't want it, and not all of the health issues were sufficiently resolved. @ about 20 mins into the film.- Fluoride stays in our bones! (Could be contributing to problems of arthritis and all of the hip and knee replacements.) @ about 44 mins; and the amount of fluoride in water has no difference in the amount of cavities. @ about 49 mins- Blacks and Mexicans are even more susceptible to effects because of a gene that they have that causes them to absorb more; other susceptible people include lactose intolerant people (calcium deficiency leads to increased absorption); babies (they drink a TON compared to their body weight); low-income people who can't afford to buy other water.- Problems because Fluoride is actually a drug. @ about 1:01- Fluoride causes neuron damage and has been proven to reduce IQ. @ 1:04-1:06- Cool testing experiment is @ 1:11- In other country labels show how much fluoride is in bottled water @ 1:15.- After about 1:16 there is a wrap up with several suggestions for ways to protect yourself from fluoride.The only thing I really didn't like about this film was the introduction.  It starts out by saying there is some recommendation to kill off a bunch of the population, and asking how will it happen, and this movie is the first of a three part series (the other parts are about food and air) to explain how it is happening.  Even though I was already convinced before watching this that fluoride is not safe to consume, I don't think it is all part of some big elaborate sinister plot, nor is any evidence given in this film to show that it is part of such a conspiracy.  But, the truth is, fluoride is still a poison, and after those first kind of off-putting few minutes of the movie, the rest of the film is quite good, and well worth watching.  If the filmmakers are motivated by something that seems kind of dumb to me and might make many viewers more skeptical, well, that is just fine if it leads them to interview key people and assemble good data for the public to digest in an interesting format.Also, even though this film is not rated, I did not notice anything offensive in the film, aside from the fluoridation scheme itself!  But what I mean is, if a family wanted to watch this, I didn't notice any swearing, there definitely isn't any nudity or violence; a fertilizer plant supervisor talks about some of the injuries that occurred at the plant for about a minute, but there are no pictures.  I think it would be totally appropriate for about ages 10 and up, and younger would be fine except that it just might be boring for them.I really enjoyed this film.  We had already been using a Berkey filter with the extra fluoride filters, but we are currently traveling, and this gave me the idea that it would be really interesting to get a fluoride tester so that we could test tap water in different countries and regions that we visit.  They don't try to sell us on fluoride testers in the film, but it looks like Amazon has them for about $300-350, and I didn't realize it was something that could be easily done outside of a lab with microscopes or very expensive specialized equipment.I look forward to the following films in this series.I highly recommend this film, and if the first few minutes seem kind of extreme and over-the-top, keep watching because it gets a lot better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRBIIAKMZ194A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HJ1KOJA#wasThisHelpful","RRBIIAKMZ194A","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cute little color wonder coloring set.  It is kind of hard to find color wonder stuff that doesn't feature characters from Disney movies and tv shows, but this is a nice ""generic"" set.  Pretty.  Of course, since it only includes 5 markers we also use markers from other sets.  But my daughter doesn't care what colors things are anyway, so five are plenty for her.Some of the pages at the beginning seemed to take a few seconds longer to show the color, but now that we are well into the coloring book the color shows very quickly.

"Our bag is now broken. We are using it as a cover.July 2013 - flight to Panama from US (1 connection).  Arrived ok.Sept 12, 2013 - direct flight from Panama to Uruguay.

Bag now has a gash that is several inches long.So, now we're primarily using it only as a cover.

Our broken bag makes car seat transport even worse than it already was.Padding on the straps is almost non-existent, and not comfortable. Bag seams are weak. Zipper sticks sometimes.

"I have had enough bad experiences with fally-aparty luggage that I knew I needed something more reliable before my husband and I set out on our world travels.  I was right.His luggage is falling apart, and mine is just awesome.  When I first got this Eagle Creek 25 piece I wished I would have just gone with two of the larger size because this couldn't be carried on but yet it has less space than the 30...and I was feeling kind of sore about it since they cost about the same amount...but now I am quite happy to have both the 25 and the 30.  Having both is a lot easier to manage with than having two large pieces.  When we take smaller trips, I can choose between one slightly larger piece or one slightly smaller piece.I maybe wish I would have chosen the smaller size so that I could have the flexibility of using it as a carry-on sometimes if I wanted to.Overall, though, this is wonderful.  The fabric is good, the zippers are good, the way the pockets are is good.  The handles everywhere make it so easy to lift and move.  The telescoping handle works well and isn't flimsy.  The wheels are good.  This is easy to travel with.My only recommendation is that you make sure you know what size you want, but that isn't a problem with the luggage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJKZSC6R11F69/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0048CRGQ2#wasThisHelpful","RJKZSC6R11F69","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really excited to buy Meet the Colors because my 16 month old daughter is obsessed with colors right now.  I saw a preview of it and I could understand why it has won so many awards: it mimics what we do all the time, by pointing out stuff that is each color, and saying only the color name (which avoids confusion).  It is slow paced, so there are probably not the same TV issues that some other programs have.  Sure, it may be annoying to listen to, and I was prepared for that, but as parents we can handle minor annoyances for the sake of enriching our kids' learning experiences.  So many reviewers talk about their kids loving these programs, so I was excited to let my daughter watch it.Yeahhhhh, so much for that.  My daughter is totally bored by it.  She rarely watches any media, so it's not that she's used to more stimulation from TV, either. The first time she watched this she got about halfway through.  We've tried to get her to watch it a few more times since then, and she won't sit for it for more than a couple minutes.  It is kind of pathetic watching her try to watch it, even.  She yawns a lot, and then starts looking around for something else, and then she starts to close my computer.  I'm done trying to get her to watch it.  If she is so uninterested in this program, I don't think I should push it.Instead, we're doing basically the same thing in real life: pointing stuff out that is different colors, and talking about it. So far she LOVES yellow, she knows blue, green, red, and purple, and sometimes she knows pink and orange.  That's good enough for a 16 month old baby, anyway, and I'm sure as we continue talking about colors she will continue to get better and better with them.  She talks about colors ALL DAY every day right now, as she is constantly pointing them out everywhere, and also pointing out plaid, stripes, and dots, so we'll get there.I don't know why I kind of hoped she could just watch a little TV program and learn them all instantly.  It's not so bad to be personally involved in her learning.  It's kind of fun to help her figure things out.So, the best thing about this movie for us is that it helped me decide not to spend any money on the other similar shows (I was thinking about doing lowercase letters and phonics, plus Spanish ones).  It's not terrible, but it is very boring, and I can't in good conscious pressure my baby to watch more tv than she is interested in.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MGZ2TDRHHJH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006U7Y09Y#wasThisHelpful","R3MGZ2TDRHHJH0","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We bought this book yesterday and now we've read it a few times.  It's really cool!  Each spread has a type of animal, what the male is called, what the female is called, and what the babies are called.  So, for example, the cow page shows a bull, a cow, and a calf.  All in Spanish, though, of course.  Then there are little voice bubbles from the animals making the sounds that they make.  The sounds they make are in cursive writing instead of printing.  As someone who is still learning Spanish the sounds are kind of hard to read for some of them, but to someone who actually knows Spanish I'm sure it would be very obvious what they say.One neat thing about this book is that it is the size of a board book--it is a board book--but it has a TON of pages.  The pages are thinner cardboard than the cover.  I think there are maybe 40 types of animals included.  The pages are colorful and the pictures are in the same style as the cover...I think they are pretty engaging, although there are so many that my 15 month old daughter does not have the patience for all of them at once, and definitely not all of them in Spanish and English, so we read parts of the book instead of reading the whole thing every time.I hadn't ever seen anything like this before, so I thought it was really cool!  I think it would be interesting to a wide variety of ages, from very young babies (the pictures are often fairly high-contrast) to adults (especially those who are studying Spanish).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A4KKSAFQUM46/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8484702650#wasThisHelpful","R1A4KKSAFQUM46","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We got a copy of this book in a Cheerio box while we were living in Panama, and although my daughter is just over a year old, she LOVES it.The words have a nice sound as you read them; on pages where the balloon is going farther away, the sound of the words sounds like a balloon floating far away, and on kind of the climax page where the balloon is coming down and someone is about to get it the text says ""Sand box. Shoes and socks. Sun hat. Orange cat.""  It's very short, very short, and it just adds to the excitement about the balloon being about to be found.There is little enough text that it is not boring to my daughter.

"This book is really cool!  We bought it a little while ago, but my daughter has recently taken more of an interest in it.  She is now 14 months old. Also, she has recently started identifying colors, and I think maybe this book is partially responsible for that.So, there are a few things we especially like about this book:- The Spanish is a little repetitive (nice in books for kids), but not at all obnoxious, and different enough (because of the colors and the little plot) that it maintains my daughter's attention and I don't mind reading it whenever she wants to hear it.- The Spanish and English are well integrated, so you don't feel like you have to choose between reading one language or the other or awkwardly repeating the same text in both languages and trying to keep a child's attention while you do so.- The illustrations are very carefully designed, so, for example, on the yellow page where they want the yellow book the pages have mostly yellow items, but of the books the only book that they need is the one that is yellow.  This is visually appealing, and it creates a ""sense"" and a feeling of the color discussed on the page without being obvious about it in a boring way.- The pages also have different themes--so, when they're looking for the red jacket you can talk about the colors of the other jackets, or discuss winter clothing items, or when they're looking for the green flute you can talk about different musical instruments, or different green things.  There is a lot going on and a lot to talk about on each page.- The brother and sister are playing together in a natural, friendly, respectful way, and it is unclear who the main character is so whether the book is being read to a boy or a girl and whether that child is an older sibling or a younger sibling (or an only like my baby, they can relate to the perspective of whichever kid (like them) is being the leader.- Normal household things are going on in the background, which you can watch and talk about...for example, on the title page the mom is doing laundry on the clothesline and you can see that the kids get the idea of having a tent from that laundry.  There is a cat that is hanging around the mom, the way that cats hang around their people, and you can notice the cat behind things, or ""find"" the cat's tail, etc.- The mom does not participate in the plot, but she is seen as present or available (if they DID need her) and paying attention to them while she is doing her own tasks (for example she checks in on them while they're having their siesta).- There is good continuity between the pages, if that makes sense.  For example, with an older child when you're talking about the specific items that they're looking for your child could ""find"" the item with the kids (the kids are never touching the things on the page where they're going after the item) and on the next page their guess would be confirmed because one of the kids is holding the thing from the last page.  There are also subplots in the background, such as the mom watering plants, and you see her take various steps towards that (filling water and so on) in the background, and there are previous activities that you see the kids are doing or have done.- The teddy is a ""magical"" character (he is anthropomorphic) and that adds creativity to the story, but his role is just a play on the imagination--he does things that inspire creativity, kind of, without being the leading character.  The teddy is kind of cool because he makes it so it isn't the kids being forced to take a nap, or needing to take a nap...they're just ""helping"" their tired teddy take a nap.  I think this is really good, because kids I think sometimes know they are tired but want to resist naps, and if a child is ""helping"" their toy take a nap and just happens to take a nap with the toy, that gives the child a healthy amount of power (kids feel powerless a lot and want to feel empowered) because they're guiding the activity, but it also meets the child's need for sleep.  So, for this reason, I sometimes will encourage this book before my daughter needs to take a nap; it gently and indirectly encourages sleep as a ""fun"" activity.- Also, kind of neat, I was just looking at the other books available by these authors and I see that there are items from the other books in this book, so if you were already familiar with those books you could notice some carry-over from the other ones.Sorry if this review is oddly theoretical, of if my ideas about children are uninformed--I only have my one daughter--but these are some of the things I think about as I am reading this to my daughter.It is a simple but complex story that is fun and beautiful to read.  And, I think beginning readers could learn to ""read"" it aloud also since there is not just a ton of text.We really like this story and I want to get the other ones by these authors as soon as we are able to!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VSRAAV2C0NLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061688843#wasThisHelpful","R3VSRAAV2C0NLG","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my daughter's second pair of Robeez, and we love them.  She just turned 14 months old, so they are a little on the big side for her.  The way that Robeez are sized it seems like there is a little time where the kid's feet are either kind of tight in the smaller size, or they have too much space in the bigger size.  That's kind of where we're at with these.I ordered these because I thought they would stay kind of clean--previously we had the dog shoes and the suede picked up dirt SO fast, so I wanted ones without suede and not too light of a color.  They DO stay pretty clean.Also, she has a lot of ""girly"" outfits that are pinks and purples, and these shoes always seem to match.  Either the pinks are main colors in things that she is wearing or they highlight accents of things she is wearing.  But, it's the kind of shoe where even if they don't really match, they don't seem like they don't match, kind of like her baby-carrier thing doesn't match things we're wearing.  I don't know if I am explaining that well, but she has two other pairs of shoes and it seems like they often do not match (one pair seems like it often does not match because the style is a little too dressy, whereas these shoes work with dressier or very casual outfits, and the other pair seems like it often does not match because the colors are too light and pastel-ish whereas these shoes match with light clothes or bold colored clothes).The fit is fine, even though they are a little big still.  She has been learning to walk, and she is more steady when barefoot (as to be expected with any shoes) but she doesn't really stumble while wearing these either.Great shoes.  Well made.  I'm glad we bought them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R60VNCWETBGSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009X4X2T0#wasThisHelpful","R60VNCWETBGSB","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this a week after another reviewer wrote not to purchase the $58 kit because it is incomplete, and I worried that some of the items would be missing, but I wanted Prime shipping so that it would arrive before our trip, and I figured that worst case scenario I could just replace whatever was missing with items from the grocery store.My kit (the $58 one) was totally complete.  The zippers had a zip-tie closure that had to be cut open, and there was a list of all of the contents, which I verified to be correct.  I wonder if maybe the other reviewer had some confusion about how items are listed?  For example, on the list it says that it has a certain number of something, but sometimes there are two per pack (one dose).  I don't know.  Mine was totally fine, though.Also, we have been away for almost a month now, and I have had a few opportunities to use the kit.  It is great, because it turns out when you're traveling sometimes you have different problems than you do when you're home, so I have appreciated having things that I may not have thought to pack in a homemade kit if I had tried to do that.  We are about 35 minutes from a town down bad roads that are sometimes impossible to drive during monsoons, with bad cell reception, in a place where we don't speak the language, so I feel safer knowing that if we had some kind of more serious emergency we would not be completely on our own with whatever we happen to have.It is large enough that it is not something I want to carry around in my purse, but it was space well used in my luggage.I think I will try to add some more Tylenol and some kid band-aids, but otherwise, so far so good.If you're considering this, I definitely recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIA4NVDMGUD6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026MRZSK#wasThisHelpful","RIA4NVDMGUD6T","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought four of these locks, and used them.It took a few seconds for me to figure out how to set your own combination, but once I looked at the instructions it was easy.  Practiced locking and unlocking.  Memorized my code.  Left on our trip.We arrived, and none of the little red tabs were showing, so I thought the bags must not have been opened.  NOPE!  I unlocked one of my bags to find a TSA page inside informing me that my bag had been checked.I highly doubt they sat around trying to guess my combination, there is only one way to access the main section of my luggage, and supposedly the zipper on my luggage is a secure one, so it would appear that they unlocked my bag as usual and the ""instant alert"" feature did not work.None of the other bags had notices inside or red tabs, so I guess my one bag was the only one they opened.Kind of disappointing.  I will keep using them because now our travel is international so they are the same as any other locks anyway, but I bought these because of the alert feature, so I would have chosen a different product if I knew that the feature didn't work.  But maybe it is just the one lock?","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R376QC89IW2XHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002V9WPMO#wasThisHelpful","R376QC89IW2XHY","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for $15 at Deseret Book for my daughter (13 months) to expose her to Book of Mormon things in a fun way, because she loves books with flaps.Well, this book does have a lot of flaps--most pages have 2-3 flaps.A bunch of the items that they used for letters are kind of stupid, though, in my opinion.  C is for Curelom (with a drawing like an elephant and a little rhyme about them being extinct).  H is for Hagoth (who ""was curious and liked to roam.  He built many ships and sailed for from home"") and I is for Islands (""where Hagoth's people might be"").  Most of the rest of them I like better.  My best guess is that the authors wanted this book to appeal to a wide range of kids and they thought that the trivia would make it more interesting.  Or maybe they thought they had everything else covered well enough?  I don't know.The other thing is, some of the flaps are cool--the ones on the Jesus page, for example, where one flap folds out so that a kid is jumping out of mom's arms to run to Jesus and the Jesus flap folds down and Jesus kneels down for the kid.  Or, there are flaps where people are burying their swords.  Those are great.  Some of the other flaps are silly, like ones where people's facial expressions change, or on the F for family page, a flap opens a banner that says ""I [heart] FAMILY NIGHT!"".  Those are fun.  But a bunch of them are of the animals from the front cover (a goat, a lizard, and a bird)...you can open the flaps to find silly animals in the Book of Mormon scenes.  I don't really like those.The back of the book says it ""will have young children learning their ABCs--and Book of Mormon names, places, and things.""  Well, there are not really places in it except for ""islands"".  There are a bunch of names, though.  And several Book of Mormon things.Overall, it's a fun book.  I don't love the extremely cartoony style of drawings, and I don't love all of the letter choices, but there are not a ton of choices for LDS board books about the Book of Mormon, and even fewer have flaps to lift, so eh, this will work.  My daughter likes it.  My guess is that it would especially appeal to primary age kids.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VF4AJZS6FWH2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1598114581#wasThisHelpful","R3VF4AJZS6FWH2","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 stars - I mostly love this bag.  I tend to kind of use my purse as a diaper bag, but I am also very picky about purses and I've been needing a new one.  I saw a PPB Touring Tote at a local store and loved the size and shape but I didn't care for the pattern that they had, so I came on Amazon and found this.I do love this color and pattern in person.  It just kind of matches everything.  I was worried about all the white--I thought maybe it would be more likely to get really dirty.  It hasn't gotten dirty at all, though, and I have used it a lot and set it in plenty of places that could have caused problems.  I think it just has to do with the glazed texture of the fabric; I think that keeps it really clean.I leave the short strap on the purse, and it typically works well for me.  Sometimes when I have too much stuff in the bag the short strap is awkward to use.  At those moments it seems like the longer strap would be a better choice, but I don't carry all of the straps with me (because that would be heavy and take up space) so I just end up out of luck and awkwardly trying to carry it too full with the short strap anyway.  Not a huge problem.The pockets on the exterior sides are less useful than I thought they would be, because the fabric is so stiff that stuff inside the pockets is somewhat hard to retrieve--not terribly, but it doesn't seem natural, if that makes any sense.  The pocket with the snap (by the PPB logo and the green embellishment) is the one I rely on most often for keys and other small things.  I recently tucked the wipe container into the changing pad zippered pocket on the other side of the exterior.There is a really small pocket inside another pocket on the inside and it seems like it is supposed to be for something, but I don't know what.  Keys, maybe?  My keys are too big to fit well.  A pacifier?  I don't know.  I don't usually put anything in that pocket.  It would be nice if one of the interior sides had a zippered pocket for my stuff so that my stuff and my daughter's stuff didn't all float around together in the bag, but I just put what I can in the four interior side pockets and whatever gets mixed together gets mixed together.  Maybe I need to start using zippered luggage organization pouches or something.The handle looks like seatbelt material.  People comment on that, and I think it's kind of embarrassing.  The metal latch on the short handle is sometimes squeaky.  I think I should apply WD40 or some metal lubricant, but I worry that if I tried to do that I would end up with stray drips of WD40 coming off on my things inside, or on the diaper bag itself, and I don't want that.  So, I just haven't bothered to figure that out yet, but I probably will eventually since the sound is really obnoxious.  It doesn't do it all the time.It may sound like I have a lot of complaints, but that's just because I'm listing them all.  The truth is, I use this bag all day every day, everywhere, and it is a great size, and I love how it looks, and although there are a few things about it that I would change if it were up to me, I am still glad I bought it, and if I were to go back again, I would definitely buy the same thing again.  If you use your purse as a diaper bag, this is a good choice.  If I had two kids, I would probably have gone with the boxy backpack style, but with just my daughter this is working out very well for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVDVFQJ4PBG3R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BDPOOQM#wasThisHelpful","RVDVFQJ4PBG3R","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had planned to buy one of these, but then we received a battery operated aspirator at my baby shower. It was fancy, but it didn't work, and my daughter hated it.  The bulb syringe worked better than the battery operated one, but I've seen pictures of how moldy and nasty they get, so I didn't like using that.  So, for the past little while, I kind of try to use a tissue, and end up sort of picking her nose to try and get her boogers out.  Not ideal!She's been sick lately, though, so I wanted to be able to just help her out so she could breathe better.  We finally went and bought one of these locally so we would have it right away.Oh, gosh.  It's so easy!  My daughter didn't really like it the first time, but then she realized it's much better than the other ones, because it works.  So the battery one I kept pushing in her nose, and it wouldn't grab the snot, so I would try to help it, and it just always took way longer than it needed to.  This is quick.  You clear it, and maybe repeat, and you're done.  That's it.  No rooting around, listening to a tune, while a machine tries to do it.  It just works.  We didn't even have to change the filter, either, because it just sat in the bottom of the bottom compartment, and it rinsed right out.Super easy.  I'm glad we have this now.  Kind of a weird product, but also a totally awesome one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XHPFVA6DJAMW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00171WXII#wasThisHelpful","R1XHPFVA6DJAMW","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband and I are preparing to do some long-term international travel.  I bought this book to help us prepare for the trip.A lot of the information is very practical.  I'm glad we got the book because it has started some good discussions there are some useful lists of things to bring or not bring, and see, and be careful about, and so on.If you're on a tight budget and you're planning to pinch pennies everywhere you can, you'll like this book a little better than I did.  My husband and I are not rich or anything, but we are planning to rent houses and cars in each of the cities that we visit...so the ongoing focus on saving money is sometimes interesting, but not as useful for us as it would be for some other people.  Also, things that would be more interesting to us, such as topics related to everyday living--how to choose houses or cars or doctors, etc, are totally absent.  When I read the part about not bringing jeans because they're too heavy, my husband actually laughed.  We're not going to be living out of backpacks, and he wouldn't even consider leaving jeans behind.I can't honestly say we're really doing anything different because of this book, at least so far.  The information about places is general enough to be interesting, but not specific enough to eliminate the need for other research.So, overall, a fun book for getting excited about travel, with a whole lot of information that may or may not be very useful to you, depending on what you're looking for.  Even though we didn't feel like this was written for us, we have enjoyed reading it together, and I will continue to look back to it for ideas as we continue to prepare.  I haven't decided whether it will come along with us.UPDATE 3/13/2015: We did end up bringing this book along with us, and we used it occasionally as we were planning where to go next.  During our travels, the sections about places were more useful than the beginning parts.  I finally quit carrying it with us when we stopped off in the US for a visit after a year or so of traveling.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11FAJ066AB0A5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1409363821#wasThisHelpful","R11FAJ066AB0A5","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was wanting some of these for my daughter because I remember when my sisters and I used to wear them back when we were growing up.These are basically the same as I remember--rabbits, dots, bows...I remember us having other shapes too (like, a violin or fiddle or something? and different flowers?) but I thought these were great.  The bow shaped ones don't stay in my baby's hair well, but the others do.  It's nice because even though they do appear to be assorted designs and colors, they are in matching pairs, so there's no problem matching if you want one on each side.I love these.  My sisters noticed them when we were visiting, too, and they were excited to see this little blast from the past.  It's also fun, because they're something different than the flowers and bows that I usually put in my daughter's hair.  A lot of the baby hair accessories are kind of similar styles--ruffley bows, or boutique bows, flowers, etc, but this is just totally different--plastic? with a picture?  Feels good to mix things up a little.This is a six-star product, definitely.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NJ3ASQML0NW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ACMHJY6#wasThisHelpful","R2NJ3ASQML0NW5","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mine actually came in retail packaging, not the boxes pictured.  That's fine, though.I love these batteries because they are so reliable.  I recently ran out of them and tried to use regular batteries since they are so much cheaper at my grocery store.  What a frustration!  Every time I took pictures, or sometimes every other time, I needed new batteries.  A little ridiculous, really.  The whole package lasted less time than a pair of these lithium batteries would last.  So silly, too, because that box boasted that the batteries would last almost a decade without losing their charge...for what?  Five minutes of taking pictures in 2023?  Not really worth saving those batteries, if you ask me!Anyway, these lithium batteries are awesome.  I am not a photographer with a fancy camera, just a regular person with a regular point and shoot type camera and for me these last quite a while, even though I like to take a lot of pictures every day.  It's nice to have 24 on hand, because as I go through them two at a time I don't have to worry about running out and choosing whether to pay so much for these at the grocery store or not.  Right now, they are $1.46 each on Amazon, and my grocery store sells them for about $3-4 each.  At $1.46 these are a no-brainer.If you're really reading reviews deciding whether to buy these or not, oh gosh, you have no idea, your life is about to get so, SO much better.

"My daughter really likes this.It's kind of nice because it is a similar weight and has similar dimensions to my smartphone.  When my daughter goes after my phone, I offer her this!  I don't know if she realizes that it looks the same as a phone or not--she is 9 months old and I don't think she understands how phones work...she just knows that mine has the screen that lights up, and obviously this one doesn't.  So, if she were to have the choice between my phone and this, she would of course choose my phone.However, the weight and shape of this are a nice change from her other teethers which tend to be similar to one another.  I think that makes it an attractive option for her.  It isn't one of those toys that she just can't put down.  She isn't crazy about it.  But she does like it all right.  And, it gets a good reaction from adults who notice it and get a kick out of it.  I think it is clever.  I love buying girly colored things for my daughter, but I think maybe she would have been more convinced that it is her phone if we had ordered the black one.  If I were to order this again I would probably order the black.Anyhow, this is a fun novelty, and a so-so substitute for real phones that you don't want chewed up.  Very cute idea.

"I always gravitate toward bath salts that are lavender scented.  For me, lavender is a relaxing scent, and I really don't like flowery, perfume type scents, not to mention artificial fragrances, which I would never even consider for bath salts.Anyway, I wanted to mix it up a little, so I bought this and hoped that I would like it.Actually, I just finished the little shaker of it and I loved it. It is a little oily, but not bad. Just enough so that you actually notice that it makes your skin softer, and not so much that you feel really oily. The smell is wonderful.  It is still as relaxing as lavender always is, but the mint makes it refreshing, too.  It's a perfect combination.The biggest problem that I had is that it seems like this is a generic shaker, not really intended for these bath salts, since they are not really dry and totally free flowing.  It works okay with the pour hole on the top, but the little shaker holes really don't work well at all.  That isn't a really big deal, though.  It's not like you have to break the top out and scoop the salts out...so, whatever, it's fine.If the idea of this scent seems interesting to you, I recommend trying it!  I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this.EDIT: Oh, I see that there is only one picture of this product.  On the other sides it has the info currently posted on the Amazon page, plus it says it is good for ""approximately 8-10 euphoric baths"".

"We got these because of the good reviews on here, and they arrived today.  I went around and stuffed them into all of the outlets that my daughter can reach.  She has become interested in outlets now that she is mobile.  Tonight I went to charge my phone, and I can't get the plug out!  I guess that's what the little spaces at the top and bottom are for--I think maybe I'll need a flat screwdriver to pull them out.That's fine by me, though, because for the minor inconvenience of needing to find some tool to remove these, I feel totally convinced that my daughter will not be able to accidentally hurt herself with an outlet for her entire toddlerhood, and that was the point of getting these plugs to begin with.  I think even a kid that is coordinated and big enough to pick at a plug would struggle to get these out.We're happy.

"My sister bought this for my daughter and sent it up to us a few months ago.  We've been doing swim classes, so she wears it every week.First of all, we have gotten a ton of compliments on this suit!  It is very cute in person, because of the ruffles and the colors.In ours the size is ""small"" and it says that it is supposed to be for 12.5-18 lbs. I think that would probably be correct for most babies...but my daughter is tall and skinny.  She's 9 months old now and she only weighs just over 15 lbs, but she is tall for her age.  I've noticed over the past couple weeks that this suit is getting to be a little tight.  It's time for us to go up a size. So, we didn't reach that 18 lb upper limit, but she's worn it for several months anyway, and we have really enjoyed it.  I also see that a couple stitches have popped where one of the front straps connect.  It isn't noticeable at all unless you're really looking at it, but I guess that's just further evidence that it's a little too tight now and it's time to move on.If you're looking for a girly swimsuit, this is a great pick!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31ARYTXEGG0L7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087OVSGQ#wasThisHelpful","R31ARYTXEGG0L7","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EDIT 7/8/2013: Just a final note that my daughter has thoroughly worn these shoes out.  For the past month or so she LOVES to talk to me about the dog on her shoes---all day long!  It was kind of funny when she finally realized it was a dog, because she loves dogs so much and she had already been wearing them for a while...Anyway, these were fun shoes.  The dog washes up moderately well with a bit of dish soap and a toothbrush.  The middle piece of the dog's bow came off.  The soles are still fine, but fairly dirty.  The dog is filthy.  We didn't have any more problems with stitches coming out.  My daughter is almost 13 months and these shoes (size 6-12 months) are just now starting to look like we're ready to move up to the next size.EDIT 5/24/2013 (Also reducing from 5 stars to 4):  Okay, now are you ready for a real review from someone who actually knows about these exact shoes?  I originally reviewed these about 6 weeks ago, and now I have more that I would like to add.  My daughter has been wearing these as her only shoes.  She goes barefoot around our house (most of the day) and when we go outside she wears these shoes.  She is still only crawling and cruising--she doesn't walk on her own yet.  So, she probably wears these on average maybe 30 minutes a day or less, but occasionally we'll go out for several hours and she'll wear them all or most of the time.  When it seems safe for her to be barefoot she is, and a lot of times she is in our Boba 3G carrier (I'm wear her) or in her car seat as we drive places.  So, what I'm saying here is that she wears these shoes regularly, but not anywhere near all day every day.  The actual amount of time that these shoes are walked in or crawled in is usually outside (or in places that I wouldn't want her to wear socks out of concern that whey would be dirty), but that is probably an average of 5 minutes a day.  Usually a few seconds here or there, and occasionally half an hour here or there.  So, that gives you a very clear idea of the use these have seen.Structurally, these shoes have held up fine.  They are still cute.  BUT, they're quite dirty.  I don't know what the washing instructions are (if there are any) so maybe I need to look into that.  Here are the issues with these shoes:- The dog is made of light suede.  It seriously started getting dirty like, the day after I wrote my original review.  I've rubbed it with a wet washcloth a couple times, but that didn't make a much of a difference.  For kids that are not crawling (ie new babies or little kids that are past crawling and on to only walking) that material is probably fine, and even cute.  For crawling kids, I would not pick something with light suede again.  I wish I could post pictures on this product, because you would see what it actually looks like.  It just looks dirty.  And, if you're only using the shoes once in a while (like, to go with one outfit that is worn only occasionally) that would be more likely to be fine, too.- The bottoms of the shoes are also pretty dirty. I would kind of expect that, though, and that's not a big deal.  It's size 6-12 months, and she's a month away from 12 months.- We had another problem with stitching that started to come out.  On the bottom of one of the shoes the stitching started to come out by the inner edge.  There ended up being a thread hanging from the shoe that was about an inch or maybe a little longer.  It was really only a few stitches.  I trimmed it, and it isn't super obvious, but it looked a little bad before I trimmed it.  The dog's eye has not lost much more of the stitching, so I'd say it is still 80% there?The sizing has still been about right.  My daughter will be one in almost a month and these shoes fit her just right.  Which means that if we go up in size for her next pair, they will probably be a little big...or if her next pair is the same size they will last for a little while, but I don't really know how long.  I think I'll probably get the next size up for her next pair...but these will definitely be fine at least for the next month.Anyway, I think I will try to wash these, and hopefully they will clean up well.  If you're buying for a tiny immobile baby or a walking baby these may still be a good pick.  If you're buying for a crawling baby that has many pairs of shoes, these may still be a good pick.  If your crawling baby received these as a gift, don't worry, you'll still really like them...but if you're choosing a main (or only) pair of shoes for a crawling and cruising baby, I would pick a different style of Robeez without the light suede.Hopefully that is helpful to someone!  I noticed when I was comparing the different kinds it seemed like most of the reviews are either non-specific to the style you're looking at(eg. ""WE LOVE ALL ROBEEZ!!!"") or they are from people who haven't used them, usually because they ordered a size too big (eg. We got these and they are the best!  Can't wait for my baby to be born so she can wear them!) So, this gives you something more objective to consider.The shoes are super cute though.  We have gotten tons of compliments.--- ORIGINAL REVIEW from April ---I ordered the 6-12 month size because my daughter is 9 months old.  I had considered ordering the next size up so that they would last a little longer (I expected to get 3 months of use), but I'm glad I didn't!  If anything, these shoes are just a little too big.  My daughter is just starting to cruise around rooms holding onto furniture, and when she wears these she trips more.  But, I think she's getting used to them, and I'm sure she'll grow into them better.The shoes are great!  The sole is just a piece of leather (with the dog picture stitched on the bottom), so it's relatively thin, and I think she can still feel the ground better than if she had a rubber sole.  I had heard that Robeez stay on well, and that is true.The stitching on the dog's eye started to come out.  I worried a little that we would end up with a blind dog, but I pulled it a bit more and was able to get it to a point where it stopped coming out, and despite losing 8 stitches or so, I think it is just not as thick, because the eye is not messed up.These shoes are a nice color of brown, and they match a lot of my daughter's outfits.I highly recommend these, with the condition that if you're buying for a 9 month old, 6-12 months is probably still the right size!  If you go up, you'll most likely have shoes that are too large.  But that's a feature, not a problem with the product.  (Correct sizing!)","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R66SQBG3OVXCC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009X4W3E0#wasThisHelpful","R66SQBG3OVXCC","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At our last house we had a shower filter to reduce the chlorine, so when we moved to a rental just a couple minutes away that didn't have chlorine filtration, I immediately noticed a difference.  I knew I wanted to filter bath water for me and for my baby, but since we're only at this rental for a few months I thought it would be great to use this bath ball because it's easier than trying to remove a shower head that has been attached for 20+ years, and I don't actually know if we're allowed modifying that anyway.So, I was expecting a little bit of a hassle, because I knew I was going to have to swirl this around in the tub before I got in the water, and I felt okay about that commitment.When it arrived, my husband laughed at me.  There's no way that is going to make much of a difference, he said.  I told him there had been good reviews online, and I pointed to the package insert that claimed that it could change ""up to 100%"" of the chlorine.  But when I read that, my husband laughed, and I knew why.  It would have been one thing if it said 96% or even 99.9998% of the chlorine, but really? 100%...that doesn't sound like a very scientific figure for such a rudimentary filtration method.  And, ""up to"" is such a suspicious term--of course, it is going to vary depending on whether you swirl and swoosh it around enough...but, if you've ever stopped into a store that's having a sale UP TO 80% OFF and found that most items are full price or 5% off and only a couple ultra-clearance items are actually very discounted...you understand that ""up to"" doesn't mean much of anything.Still, the reviews were good, right, so I was expecting to have positive results.  I write lots of reviews and I trust other reviewers, so I had a lot of faith in that.  So what if I didn't have a 100% experience, or even a 85% improvement.  If the water was noticeably better, say, 25% improved, I would have to consider that a success, since any reduction in the amount of chlorine that we're breathing and soaking in is a good thing.  I expected at least that.So, I faithfully followed the instructions.  I swooshed and swirled, for longer than the package even said to, and let it toss around in the bath too, for the enhanced results that it promised in the information that came with it.I did this for 4 or 5 baths.Nothing.I did not notice any difference in our baths at all, except that I felt kind of awkward hanging out by the tub nakedly wanting to climb in my bath and doing the boring exercise of swishing.  So I tried filtering while clothed instead and found that small splashes got my sleeves wet, which was even less comfortable.The vapor still smelled like chlorine.  The water still felt bad and left my skin extra dry.So, I tried some other things.  I tried a couple baths where I dangled it under the faucet (not recommended!) while the water was running, because some reviewers had mentioned success with that.  Nope.  I tried removing the ball cage so that the mesh bag could come into more contact with more water and maybe potentially filter more.  Nope.I have to conclude that there is really no difference.I told my husband that it turned out that it didn't work.  He wasn't surprised.  I was disappointed that my experience didn't prove him wrong, and even more disappointed that our water is still totally chlorinated.I'm not bothering to use this anymore.  It isn't worth the hassle and it doesn't do anything.  I'm embarrassed that I thought it would work, because it seems like kind of a dumb idea if you think about it.  How many tiny tiny particles must be in the water, and what is the mathematical probability that they will come into contact with the metal scrubby pad inside the mesh?  Pretty unlikely, I would guess.It seems like it would be nice to have a non-shower solution that works, and I know chlorine is bad for us...but don't waste your money on this!  Sloshing it around the tub for as long as you are supposed to is not as convenient as it sounds, and I cannot report even the slightest improvement.  I think the best option may be to fill the bath with a shower that filters, unless you can get a reverse osmosis system.(I almost never return items or give items 1 star, but I wish I could return this, because otherwise I'm just going to throw it away.  Do places accept used returns?  I've never done that before.  Maybe I'll check.)","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VQWBJJN0L93O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015TIEEE#wasThisHelpful","R1VQWBJJN0L93O","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I heard about these on one of Alejandra Costello's organizing videos (which are awesome, if you're getting organized), and then when I saw them at a local store I picked up a package of them thinking they might help me organize my accounting stuff as I am getting business documents organized for taxes.This is one of those products where as soon as you start using it, you realize you really needed it all along.I have used them to divide big statements into quarters of the year, and to combine things that belong together but are not the same thing (like my Broker's ledger, statements from my Broker, and my own communications with him about our account transfers).  It's kind of like having paperclips that don't get caught on things or accidentally fall off, and little tabs on the side that make it obvious what it is while it is still stacked up with other things.I'm so glad I started using these!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M6DCQV1709FR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GE2T8W#wasThisHelpful","R3M6DCQV1709FR","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cute little board book with pictures of a mama polar bear and a baby polar bear.  Basically, they both start out together, and then the baby gets just a little bit away from the mom to be on its own and do the things that it is able to, but then soon returns back to the mama bear again.This is basically a model of ""secure attachment"" as described by John Bowlby in his book ""A Secure Base""--babies (humans and in some other species) initially need to be close to mom a lot, then gradually go slightly farther away and stay gone for slightly longer between times when they check in.  That's basically what is happening here; the baby bear is being ""independent"" in a safe way, near mom.Anyhow, my daughter didn't think about that as we were reading it.  She is 9 months old, and she just kept saying ""Oh! Oh! Oh!"" on each page because she gets excited when she sees animals.  The text is good because the bear does things that babies are learning (eg, rolls, climbs).  And the pictures are nice.I noticed that the other reviewer recommend this for younger elementary school kids.  I haven't had kids that age, so I don't know about that, but I do know that this book is even appropriate for babies.  My daughter loves it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21PML77E73EMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0688164528#wasThisHelpful","R21PML77E73EMT","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this book to read to my daughter (she is 9 months old), and we like it a lot.The pictures are not extraordinary, but they are happy, in the style of the cover picture.  Each page has two words, an adjective and a noun (such as ""warm sun"" and ""soft sand"") and the book goes through a bunch of different beach and summer-type things.My daughter was born in June, so it is nearly April now and most of her life that she can remember has been winter, so I thought it would be fun to help her get ready for summer by including this in our rotation.  I like reading books about seasons with her.  It is nice because it doesn't have too many words.

"We love this outfit--my daughter has worn it to bed as a sleeper though the colder months, and also sometimes during the day.It is made of microfleece? I think.

"I really liked this sleeper.  My daughter looked adorable in it, and although I don't usually care for pink and orange together, in this case it looks great.It's nice because it snaps down both of the legs instead of just one.  That's nice because I don't have try to get my daughter to put one leg in one side that is closed up.  Snapping both sides is just easier.The only thing about this sleeper is that my daughter is tall and skinny, and although other Carters 9 month outfits still fit her, this seems too short (it is a little tight down at the feet and around her neck).

"I love how the only two five star reviews are from people who ordered it to give as a gift and have never even seen the toy in use!  Uh...does it help anyone to know that it looks like the picture?  We received this as a gift, from someone who thought it looked fun.  It does look fun.This toy doesn't work, and it never has worked for us.The idea is cute: fill up the cup on top, and it will trickle down causing the top section to whirl, the middle section the move little balls around, and the final section to spin.  On ours, only the penguin part works.  Our penguin stays up pretty well, so it can collapse if you want it to, but you can also watch the interior twirl.  It does twirl a little, kind of slowly.If you fill the middle section, it has trouble filling, and then it has trouble draining.  The balls do nothing.  It does rattle when empty, but...this is a bath toy that doesn't do anything special in the water.If you fill the bottom section, it drains out the bottom.  The thing in the middle does not spin.If you keep the pieces connected, on ours, the top twirls minimally.  Nothing else happens at all.  If you separate the pieces, the starfish part in the middle drains with a pattern.  Sometimes.  If the water doesn't get stuck.  The fish on bottom still does nothing.I think we're probably just going to throw this away.  If you're considering buying this (for your kiddo or as a gift) save your money or buy something else.

"I ordered this because my daughter (8 months old) was having a tough time getting to sleep, waking frequently, and having trouble going back to sleep.  We wanted to develop a better bedtime routine.I asked my Facebook friends if anyone had tried the Tranquil Turtle Sleep Machine and nobody had but someone recommended putting this oil on the soles of my daughter's feet at bedtime.I decided to try both.  So, now we 1. go potty; 2. change into jammies; 2. rub a drop of Serenity oil on each foot (or if she is wearing jammies with feet I put it on her wrists); 3. read stories, always ending with Goodnight Moon; 4. say goodnight to Dada and Chalcy (the dog); 5. turn on the Tranquil Turtle; 6. lay her down on her floor bed and nurse until she is almost or completely asleep.When we first started using the oil the smell seemed too busy to me...I felt like I kept trying to figure out what the scent was (which, it's a blend, so it's a lot of things), and it had kind of an overly sweet smell, I thought.  I didn't really care for it.  We've been doing this for almost a month now, I think, and now I like the scent.  It just smells like ""bedtime"" to us.  I think my daughter likes it too.  Bed time is not a LOT better...this didn't magically help her go to sleep and stay asleep all night, unfortunately.  But it is better than before.  She wakes less.Overall, I don't know whether it calms us or not, but it is pleasant, and a nice addition to our routine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GSW2NK3E4V60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004NJXW1I#wasThisHelpful","R2GSW2NK3E4V60","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I almost, almost bought this from Amazon several times, but the price was usually about $10 with shipping, and that seemed like too much to pay for this.  I'm just used to buying almost everything from Amazon, though, so it seemed like a real hassle to have to go to a store for this toy.We were at a local store the other day and they had these for about $4.  So we bought one.  And we got to choose the color, too. But, I let my 9 month old baby choose what color she wanted and she picked orange.  Hm.  Oh well.I noticed that some reviewers mention sloppy construction with glue left on the toy (making it a bad idea to chew on).  Ours does not have any glue that is visible.My daughter loves this!  It is currently one of her toys that we keep in the car to entertain her while she is in her car seat.  She likes it because if you shake it or hit it against things it rattles.  Also, the spacing of the holes make it very easy to grasp and it is just perfect for chewing on; she already has 8 teeth, and when she puts this in her mouth she can teethe on the sides of her mouth very effectively.  So, she likes that.Ball was her first word, so it's always fun when she plays with this one, because she sometimes chatters about it ""Ba. Ba. BaaahhL."" etc.Great toy.  I'm glad we bought one.

"We're trying to expose our daughter to Spanish from a young age, so I've been reading a bunch of books to her in Spanish.  We borrowed ""Buenas noches, Estados Unidos"" from the library and LOVED it, so I decided to buy this one for us, especially since I am also from California.Eh, it was okay.Although my daughter used to like the Estados Unidos one all the way through, this one is not as engaging to her, for some reason.  I think older kids would probably enjoy it more.I felt like the things they picked were a lot of times kind of similar...for example, there are several pages about the beach, which, okay, I get that that's a big thing in California (and it is), but it seemed a little repetitive.  There are a few pages about other things like computer scientists, farmers, and vineyards.My Spanish is not the best, and I understood more of the United States one.  This one it seems like more of the pages have a lot of words.  I think that's part of why my daughter loses interest.  The illustrations are also not as nice as in the United States one.Overall, though, it's fine.  If I hadn't loved and enjoyed the Estados Unidos one so much, I probably would have given this 5 stars.  So, if you're choosing between those two, I would go with the United States one and not the California one.  But, we're not going to send it back.  We don't hate it.  I'll buck up and go learn the words that I don't understand, and my daughter will grow (and so will her attention span), and it will be fine.The series is nice.  Maybe we just need more places, and that will just increase our vocabulary more and invite a broader variety of places on the pages.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TU5JCV9XZ71G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1602190704#wasThisHelpful","R1TU5JCV9XZ71G","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We're interested in exposing our daughter to Spanish from a very young age, so I've been reading Spanish board books to her.  She is almost 9 months old.This book is fantastic!!It's really different from the other Spanish/bilingual little kid books out there, which are often pretty similar to one another, and tend to have the same problems.  Spanish books for kids are either in Spanish only or Spanish and English.  I know enough Spanish to be able to read books for kids just fine, so I don't mind when they are in Spanish only, but this is nice because it is also in English, so in case you couldn't tell what was happening in the picture (or maybe your original language is Spanish), it is also in English.The things I like the best about this book are:- Modern pictures!  This style of pictures is totally different than the other Spanish kid books we've bought and borrowed from the library.  That's fun!- Engaging content.  My daughter doesn't care a whole lot about this yet, but I can imagine a 2 year old boy thinking this book is AWESOME.  It has kids do things like sit down and stand up, and pick their nose (we just pretend).  I can imagine that being hilarious to a little boy, though.- Original.  Often when I like a book in English we read the Spanish version, and I am almost always disappointed with the way they chose to do it.  In this case, I'm not comparing this to something else, so it's just great on its own.- Nice binding.There isn't anything that I don't like about this book.  Maybe it would have been nice if it were more colorful?  I don't know.  It's really fine the way it is.  Check out the ""Click to look inside"" option here on Amazon to see an example of the book.Highly recommended, especially for little kids (although babies find the activities interesting too).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDHH67F5X4ABX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8493727393#wasThisHelpful","RDHH67F5X4ABX","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My daughter is 8 months old and she has 8 teeth...so you might guess that she has been teething a lot.  And you would be right.She also wants to be held constantly, so I love to wear her in my Boba 3G.  Unfortunately, she's been teething on the carrier.  I decided to search for teething pads because I saw another brand of carrier that had them, and I discovered these!So we got them, right away.They are quite nice.  Easy to put on and take off.  The fabric is soft.The only thing I don't really like is that they are white.  I have the montenegro Boba 3G...so...my whole carrier is black, and then there are these white pads.  It looks a little weird.I think I get why they do it, though, because we once had to wash our carrier (not just spot clean) and the dye just poured out of the carrier.  If they used the came dye process for these pads the babies would get color EVERYWHERE.  Still, in my opinion, that just means that maybe for the teething pads you could dye them with more colorfast process, and/or use safe dye, and then they would match a little better.  White is basically the last color I would have chosen to go with this carrier.But, anyway, my daughter is no longer chomping on the actual straps, so that's a win.If you have a Boba 3G and a kid that's teething, these are essential.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF22BYOBGXY53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083KG3BY#wasThisHelpful","RF22BYOBGXY53","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, I'm really disappointed.I bought this for hanging my purse (which weighs 1.5-2 lbs).  I read other reviews mentioning things falling, and when I saw that following the instructions is kind of a pain (you have to clean surfaces with rubbing alcohol and press for a little while), I figured maybe the other people didn't follow the instructions closely.  I thought that by purchasing a hook that is supposed to hold 5 lbs (more than double the weight that I was using it for) and following the instructions very closely we would be fine.I carefully followed all of the instructions--I wiped with alcohol, pressed the hook on for at least 10 seconds, removed the hook and pressed the base for at least 30 seconds, then put the hook on and waited overnight before I put my purse on this hook.  (I even saved the instructions because it said to.) My purse doesn't hang there all the time, even, maybe every other night...and yesterday when I went to look for my purse it was on the floor.  The hook fell!Not only that, it took a big chunk of paint off (almost 1"" square).Seriously??  I bought this because we are renting.  I didn't want to damage the paint.  That was the whole point.  So, it bothers me that this didn't work.We are using the Command picture strips for our pictures, too, so I hope those don't fall.I don't recommend this product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OEAVE7SV8KMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FKDEIA#wasThisHelpful","R1OEAVE7SV8KMN","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can see why some people would like this, but I don't really care for it.We're doing kind of natural things as far as parenting goes--I'm breastfeeding, so we don't carry bottles or formula.  I wear my baby when we go places, so we don't have a stroller to attach this to, and consequently nowhere to put this while we're out and about; I would just have to carry it in addition to my daughter and anything I have bought while we are out, etc.  It's just way too big to bother with.We have left my daughter with her grandparents while my husband and I have gone on trips, oh, 2 or 3 times, and this bag is what we use for several days worth of her clothes, milk, bottles, the bottle warmer, and a blanket.So, I noticed that one of the other reviewers mentioned being able to carry her laptop in this bag (and she considered that to be another feature!).  If you want space for your laptop, yeah, that would definitely fit.  You may be able to fit a desktop computer in here.  Well.  Maybe not.  I don't know.Anyway, it is a very large bag, so if you're carrying stuff for multiple kiddos, maybe you'll be into that.I also felt like the interior organization of the bag didn't really work for me.  The interior pockets kind of flop this way and that for me, and get squished.  The times that I have used this, I'm always digging around to try to find whatever I am looking for.  God forbid I toss my keys into this bag, I would probably never get into the house!So, yeah.  This is a large, very open bag.What I usually do is make my regular purse into a diaper bag.  I put like 4 diapers in my purse, a baggie with a few wipes in it, depending on how long we're going to be gone, I sometimes have a onesie or something simple to change her into in case we have some kind of diaper blowout or throwup disaster...a small toy to keep her busy if she needs a distraction...sometimes I've had a pacifier in my bag, but she's not very interested in those, so I don't think I do anymore.  And that's it.Another thing I don't really like about this bag is that to me it looks cheap.  Well, okay, it is cheap, so what else was I expecting??  I don't know.  The exterior, well, and the interior, are plastic-y.  I thought the style would be modern with a hint of baby (because of the light pink), and when it arrived, it seemed more baby with a hint of modern.  If that makes sense.  Maybe I'm a diaper bag snob.Really, though, in the times that we have used this it hasn't been a bad bag.  Nothing has broken or seemed like it would break.  It does seem to be pretty well made.  So, if you're looking for a large diaper bag, this may be exactly what you need.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15C725TARL8C8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008N1PP4E#wasThisHelpful","R15C725TARL8C8","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just wrote a really long review and my page refreshed and I lost the whole thing.  Too bad.  In short:We're doing a trial of 9 different kinds of cloth diapers (mostly all-in-ones and all-in-twos) and these are our favorites.Some features: the elastic is adjustable in the legs so it fits all babies well (which is awesome since my daughter has super skinny legs).  The velcro is better than the velcro on most other diapers, and it seems like it will last longer.  These diapers dry very quickly.  They are super trim, so they look nice on my daughter instead of making her look like an insect (with a huge bum) like other cloth diapers do.I just ordered a bunch of these yesterday and I found an article online about the company.  Softbums was started by a lady and her husband helps run the company.  They invented the diaper based on their experience cloth diapering their own kiddos.  I kinda liked that.Also, about this particular color: Softbums does a ""calendar"" thing where they make limited edition diaper prints every month.  Berry Owls was one of the 2012 limited edition prints.  It is very cute.  I know all computers display things differently, but on my computer the coloring looks like little girl pink.  It isn't.  Berry is a better description.  The color is pink, but it's kind of a blend between girl pink and raspberry color.  It looks really great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JR27SADI6U3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009Y9WSZ8#wasThisHelpful","R1JR27SADI6U3S","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These socks are a little thinner than the other Luvable Friends socks 8-Pack Newborn Baby Socks that we have used before.  These also go higher up on the baby's leg than the other ones.  My daughter is really skinny, so they don't cut into her leg at all; they fit really well.  They're stretchy, too, so average-build babies will probably also find that they fit very nicely.My favorite thing about these socks is that they stay on really well.

"I was kind of curious to see what I would actually receive, since some other reviewers mention expecting four castanets and receiving two.  Also, I could find no mention of what these castanets are made of.  I hoped they would be wooden, but decided it would be fine either way.I received one yellow plastic castanet.  It makes a very castanet-y sound, and seems to be easy to use, which is great since it is for my infant daughter to play with.  At her Kindermusik class they have a box of various instruments (including castanets) and I had the idea that it would be fun to have some more instruments at home for her.It does seem pretty durable.  It is made by Hohner Kids, actually, and my yellow one has a bright purple elastic piece connecting the pieces.Aw, now I feel kind of ripped off.  I just searched and found the same product available at nearly half the cost.  Heyyyy.  Don't buy this.  Buy THIS instead: Plastic Finger-Size Castanet(color may vary)For $4.95 (which is what the other link charges for the same thing) this is a 5 star product.

"We just moved into an apartment.  We're not planning to stay for a very long time, so we didn't want to make bigger changes (like an accent wall), but we're still trying to feel like we're home.I found these decals at Walmart and decided I would see if this worked in our living room.It's something.These are not made out of the nice kind of vinyl that is popular for walls (and cars) now.  Instead, it's basically clear stickers.  I didn't put them on a wall that gets direct light, so mine don't look shiny.  They're kind of matte stickers anyway, so I don't know that shine is going to be a problem for most people.The stickers are fairly large.  I think the tall ""L""s are about a foot tall, the ""ive"", ""augh"", and ""ove"" are maybe about 5"" tall, and ""WELL"", ""OFTEN"", and ""MUCH"" are maybe about 2"" tall.I had trouble spatially understanding how large the entire thing would be, and knowing how I should put them on my wall.  I just copied the picture, and added a few extra diamonds.  There is also nothing to help you get the words straight.  This was a bit of a problem for me, and I still don't think I have them perfectly straight, but it says on the package that they are repositionable, and that is true--I removed ""Love"" probably half a dozen times before I decided it was straight enough.  I think the only limitation with repositioning them would be if your fingers were dirty, or you somehow got stuff stuck to the sticky part.  That would wear it out pretty quickly.It is also sometimes a little tricky to remove the decals from the backing. You have to hunt for a spot that will peel just the part you want.Overall, I was happy enough with the experience.  I think when we buy a house I will probably go with custom vinyl...but this is all right for now.  I think it makes our apartment look a little more lived in.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VZMJN9SZB09X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WRGZ0S#wasThisHelpful","R2VZMJN9SZB09X","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My mother-in-law gave this book to my daughter for Valentine's day this year.  (I think she gave it to each family of grandkids, maybe?)So, my daughter is only 7 months old, but I read this to her today.  She was actually kind of into it, I think because the pictures are kind of busy--a lot is going on on every page.I LOVE this book!First of all, the story is really sweet.  This man's life completely changes because of something simple and sweet.  It shows that small things that we do can really affect other people.Also, I have been reading a lot of books about gentle parenting and good communication lately and they all emphasize the importance of empathy and relating to people (including kids) empathically.  This book shows people who are acting empathically--Mr. Hatch notices how people around him are doing, he asks them about it, and then he responds to help them.  Then, at the end of the book, the people in his neighborhood respond to him with empathy as well.  So, I think kids (and adults) of all ages can benefit from this dialogue and also the examples of characters behaving well.The illustrations are excellent!  The tone of the story is really evident from the illustrations.  For example, before Mr. Hatch receives the valentine, the illustrations are brown and gray, that kind of projects how sad and boring his life is.  Then, after Mr. Hatch receives the valentine, the illustrations are colorful and bright.  The actions of the picture also match the mood--before the valentine everything is really still and plain (I'm thinking of a picture of Mr. Hatch eating lunch at work and there's a prune sitting on the table...).  After the valentine, the pictures are really busy, with people and motion.  There are also a couple transitional pages where there is a moderate amount of action and color.  Goodnight Moon is kind of this way, with the color--the pages dim as you go through the book.  I think kids pick up on that type of subtle change.This book claims that it is for ages 5-8, and maybe the difficulty of the words matches that, but it's really very pleasant for all ages, I think.  And it's nice and appropriate for any time of year, not just Valentine's Day.Fantastic book.  I highly recommend this!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG70FW9P5SJSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689718721#wasThisHelpful","RG70FW9P5SJSS","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just got through my package of French Lavender bath salts.  I plan to buy this again.The lavender scent was enough to be relaxing but not overwhelming.  It does smell like essential oil and not like ""fragrance.""  That was important to me because fragrances and perfumes often bother me; I buy unscented laundry soap and deodorant, etc.  This was just right, though.It fizzes up a little and puts kind of a foam on the surface of the bath, then that gradually dissolves.  I found that a couple handfuls is all I really need to have a nice bath.  I have't timed how long the foam lasts, but I love a good bath so I've tried many different brands of bath salt before and this is very comparable (in foaminess and amount of time the foam lasts) to other kinds I've used before.These salts are not too oily.If you're considering these bath salts, I highly recommend them.  Actually, even if you're not considering them, I highly recommend them.  I would think life was pretty awesome if someone gifted these to me.  ;)","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NLPY9QQ4AEEO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004L94XA4#wasThisHelpful","R2NLPY9QQ4AEEO","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many other parents, I am trying to expose my daughter to music (and several other things) from an early age, to help her develop into the best little person she can be.  So, we got her this little piano for Christmas, and she has been using it since then.Sometimes she gets really into it.  She is now 7 months old, and she's little, so this is just the right size for her to sit down in front of it.  I set her down at the piano toy and she will play with it for a little while.  She thinks it is interesting to try to pull the keys up instead of pushing them down.  That feels funnier, I guess.  Sometimes she presses the keys, and I tell her how great it is that she is ""making music.""  Of course she does not use the song book at all.  She has not noticed that the cardboard strip of notes is a separate piece.  If she had, it would be destroyed by now, but I don't think that really matters.I am glad that this is not an electronic toy...but...the description says it is hand tuned.  By who??  Monkeys??  This toy is so out of tune it is comical.  It also sounds more like one of those xylophones than a piano.But, whatever, she's 7 months old.  She's understanding that a piano has white keys and black keys and that you can push them down (or try to pull them up) and when you push them down they make different sounds.  That's kind of what I was hoping she would learn.  The recommended age range for this is 3 and up.  By the time she is 3, we plan to start Dogs and Birds with her and she will need something that plays the real notes...but...in anticipation of that...this is acceptable, and kind of a cute toy.If you're hoping to purchase a musical instrument, this is not very good.  If you're buying it for a baby or small child and you don't care too much about whether it is in tune, go right ahead.  We're happy that we bought this, although I got it as part of a Black Friday sale.  I don't think it is really worth the list price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K9QDJCH6CB3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00020V59S#wasThisHelpful","R3K9QDJCH6CB3T","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

No extra stuff added!This sampler comes with a great variety of different baby foods.The only thing that is a little weird is that the packages are quite large for stage 1.  My daughter doesn't eat this much solid food before it has been a few days and we're supposed to discard the rest.  Seems like it would make more sense to do a bit smaller portions.

"I worked at a grocery store for a year or so, about 10 years ago.  At the grocery store we always had box cutters around to use for so many different tasks, and I got into the habit of using one often.Simple box cutters are hard to find, though!Since my time at the grocery store I've tried buying cheap razor blade scrapers (which work well but not for cutting) and razor blade cutters (which cut well but don't scrape, AND they are usually bulky enough that I end up not using them because they're too big to be comfortable to use).  I haven't ever found simple box cutters like this in a store before.More often than not I just try to use scissors to cut things.  Scissors are a poor substitute for a good box cutter, though!So, I was happy to find these, and even happier to have them around.Some people seem to care a lot about the colors, and their reviews reflect that.  The colors are assorted; mine came 1/3 white, 1/3 yellow, and 1/3 orange.  Orange and yellow are not my favorite colors but...it's a box cutter!  What difference does the color make??  Would the people concerned with that be as particular about the color of their scissors or bottle of toothpaste?  I doubt it!  If you don't like the colors that you get, here are a few ideas for you:- Use a Sharpie to write names on them (in case you wanted a wider variety of colors for identification among different cutters);- Wrap the sheath in duct tape.  If you want to be extra-fancy, buy several different colors of duct tape and you can have a rainbow of different colored box-cutters;- Spray paint your box cutters in whatever color you prefer.Be assertive, people!  You are only limited by your imagination.  If you want hot pink box cutters, make it happen!Anyhow, these box cutters are extremely useful.  We just purchased new couches a few days ago and they came in large cardboard boxes that we needed to break down.  I happened to have one of these in my purse and MY, OH, MY, what a difference!  It was so quick and easy to cut the boxes down.  It reminded me of the time that I lived with my sister and we bought a Christmas tree and I used the ""saw"" on my pocket knife to trim a bit off the bottom of the trunk.  My pocket knife worked so well compared to our steak knives!  Annnd, then a couple years ago when my husband and I bought a real tree (which needed to be trimmed) and I used a real saw.  It was a difference of night and day.  If you are cutting boxes with scissors, it's as if you're trying to use a pocket knife to trim the bottom of the Christmas tree!  Live large!  Get box cutters!  But don't use them to trim the bottom of your Christmas trees.  I don't think these box cutters would work well for that.Highly recommended for anyone!

"What Babies Want is a documentary that explores the truth that babies are conscious beings, and the implications of that fact.  The film is divided into many chapters: the first several are about birth and bonding (or not bonding), and the later chapters are about how the birth experience affects people and society.  There are a variety of experts that participate in the film, including doctors, a midwife, psychologists, a ""ritual keeper"" from an African tribe, parents, and others, and they each share their knowledge and/or experiences related to the topic.I really enjoyed the first half of the film and the end.  At the beginning of the film they talk about how the goal is to help our children grow into their authentic selves and ""keep the spark alive.""  I liked that.  They showed how science has found a lot of evidence that babies are molded by early experiences, and that even if they are not totally aware of those experiences, they play them out later.  A lady named Sobonfu Some (a ""ritual keeper"" from an African tribe) was featured a lot, and I liked what she had to say.  Sobonfu Some told about different traditions that her people in Africa have, including telling the babies ""We thank you for the gift that you are going to bring.""  In Africa the people prepare a lot for a baby to be born.  At the end of the film Sobonfu Some said that they have young children in another room when a baby is born so that when the new baby cries out the children can respond--the new baby is basically crying, ""I'm here, is anyone out there,"" and the kids are saying ""You're in the right place and you're wanted!""  I don't know if babies would think of that, but it seemed very nice to me.  I think our culture misses out for not having rituals the way that tribes and older societies did; I think rituals give us something that I don't really understand.There were a couple quotes that I especially liked.  One was by Wendy Anne McCarty, and she said ""When we come from the belief that babies are conscious, every way we are with our babies changes.  We include them, we know that they're taking everything in, it is imprinting, it is the course of what is life here as human being like?""  In the film they talked about all of the routine hospital procedures that are not very welcoming to new babies, and that those things partially came about because people thought that babies were not really aware anyway.  The thought occurs to me often that my daughter is a real person, and she is feeling her feelings as strongly as I feel mine.  I also have the strong feeling that everything I do for her now, and the way that I treat her now as a young baby is forming the foundation of her life, and I feel like it is critically important that I do things the best that I can.  I take that very seriously, and I felt like Wendy Anne McCarty's quote matched up with how I feel.After the first half of the film there was a portion that I didn't really connect with, in which various people discussed how non-ideal birthing affects people.  They discussed people acting things out--an example was of a girl who had a cord around her neck when she was born so she put a string around a doll's neck even though she didn't know why.  To me, that seems a little unbelievable and weird.  Although I do believe that all of the hospital routines that do not encourage bonding have an impact, I doubt that single specific moments ""replay"" like an elderly man mentioned; he said that because his head was pushed back in he felt rejected and the same thing played out over and over again in his life.  In my opinion, there was a lot more going on than just that one moment.  If he felt rejected over and over again, his family had more serious problems than just an untimely birth experience.  I think my thoughts on this are somewhat influenced by my reading of Ina May's Guide to Childbirth.  In Ina May's book she mentions times when labor may stop because of some reason or another because we don't feel safe or ready or we lack privacy, or for whatever reason.  So, I think that the birth experience is a fluid experience that may set the tone for a particular way of living, but when this film said that mothers should apologize to babies for things that didn't go right with a birth...I don't know how that could make much of a difference except maybe subconsciously.  A segment of the movie about a lady who was dealing with her birth seemed really weird to me.  They were lighting candles, and I didn't connect with that part of the film at all.1The film ended with a great, uplifting message about children seeking a place of belonging.  I liked that.Overall, I enoyed the film quite a bit.  It made me want to go wake my daughter so that I could hold her!  I think it is important to make birth as gentle as possible and to encourage bonding.  I liked the ideas about helping children feel like they belong and welcoming them.  There was a quote about how in the early years you need to connect with children to learn who they are and what their purpose is, and I really liked that.I think this would be an especially fun movie for parents to watch while they are expecting.  It shows several birth scenes that are very sweet, without being preachy, and I think most moms would enjoy that, and they would enjoy feeling the importance of the baby they are carrying and the importance of having the best birth experience that they can.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIPB82XCWZBMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FDK73C#wasThisHelpful","RIPB82XCWZBMI","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, the colors are a little different than they look on my screen, which could be just my computer's display, but it's worth mentioning: this set is not neon pink, it is hot pink, kind of like a darker Barbie pink color.  On my screen it looks like more of an electric pink, which it isn't.The top is a tunic.  In some ways, it is great because it fits my tall, skinny daughter well, and it would also fit chubby babies well.  The sleeves are kind of funky, though.  I can't decide whether it is a fashionable thing that I like, and it's nice to have variety, or whether it just looks strange.It isn't as cute as I thought it would be, but we tend to like classic styles.  If you wear peasant tops yourself, and tunics, and those sorts of things, maybe this top is awesome?

"I bought this set for the kitty print sleeper.  It is SO cute!  It kind of reminds me of the Japanese print fabrics that you can get for sewing.  My daughter loves our cat so ""we"" talk about kitties when she wears this stuff.One thing worth mentioning: although Carters clothes usually have pretty thick fabric, this set is fairly thin.  It would be great for summertime.  It isn't super thin, where you have to worry about snaps tearing off when you unsnap, but it isn't toasty warm, either, if that makes sense.  My daughter is wearing this during winter and she needs blankets, etc, to keep warm enough.Although I bought this for the sleeper, the other outfit is also GREAT!  My husband said ""she looks ridiculous...but in a cute, baby way."" Adults don't go around with a kitty on their head or feet, so to him some baby clothes seem silly.  And they kind of are.  It was a compliment, though.We love these outfits!Highly recommended for any little ones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YO3MCCZ739W8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008PVHCRA#wasThisHelpful","R1YO3MCCZ739W8","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is such a wonderful book!I love it.My daughter is 7 months old now and she loves it too.  She tries to pick the little boy off of the pages, and she loves a shirt that the boy is wearing in one of the pages.Anyhow, the illustrations are very sweet.  It's kind of cute to see what the teddy bear is doing in each of the pictures; sometimes he is doing what the boy is doing, and other times he is reacting to what the boy is doing.I want to explain how I feel about this book, but I don't really know quite how to say it...before our daughter was born, I thought crying babies were obnoxious.  Now, when my daughter cries, I feel sorry that she is sad, and I want to help her feel better.  Even though my daughter is a baby with very strong emotions, I seldom lose my patience with her, because I'm just crazy about her.  I feel like she is the best baby in the world.  This book, to me, puts that feeling into words--as I read the book I'm expressing to my daughter that I just love everything about her, because she's a great little person.  I doubt that my daughter understands much of it now, but I plan to keep it in our book rotation for a very long time.  I think it would be great to hear this kind of book as a little kid!  So reassuring and comforting.Something else that is really nice about this book is that it is a little poetic.  It rhymes, but not awkwardly...it's just right.  As I read it aloud, this book has a beautiful cadence.The only thing I would change about this book is that the pages are kind of thin for a board book.  Usually board books have thick cardboard for the cover and each of the pages.  This book has a slightly puffy cover and pages that are more like a thicker cardstock.  I would have preferred all thick pages.This is definitely, definitely worth buying!  I'm so glad we got it now.  Every little kid should have this book (and someone to read it to them)!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R330CQ2O3IXN4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0439673631#wasThisHelpful","R330CQ2O3IXN4P","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I accidentally ordered the 5 pack, which I realize is not the best deal for price.I'm still very happy.These Post-It notes are very pretty, and I like having the bright colors.  The green doesn't really look like the mint green in the picture (at least on my monitor screen); it is more of a neon green.  Also, the yellow is not as golden.  I actually already had Post-Its in the standard Post-It yellow color AND a golden color and this is kind of in between--more golden, but not orangey.  If you've bought ""ultra"" specifically, you may already have these precise colors, but it you have a different set, you may get a slightly slightly different color.  I love getting as many different colors as I can, so this was a pleasant surprise.These notes work best with markers, I think.  I used them with regular pen and only some of the colors show up well; yellow and green do.  Purple is dark enough that the pen writing is nearly lost.  That kind of defeats the purpose of having a bold color note somewhere...if the writing is not immediately obvious.I see that some reviews complain about 1/2 size pads.  They didn't order this product.  These pads are the normal thickness.  Also, these are not ""super-sticky"" pads, they are the regular adhesive, and they work great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBB8RXZUGRLW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006JNN7#wasThisHelpful","RBB8RXZUGRLW4","A2AVYSXICESSTK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVYSXICESSTK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well it's that time again to restock the old sock drawer and this time I decided to plop down a few extra bucks and get something nice. I chose these.Pros1. These are really nice socks. They fit my feet like a glove and actually kind of hold them. Never had socks feel like that before so I like these.2. These breathe really well, the tops appear a bit thinner to help moisture escape and fresh air to penetrate.3. The bottoms are cushioned a tiny bit which feels nice.4. They look nice. Neutral colors means I can wear these with anything.5. I can't speak for everyone, but these rest right on my ankle which is about the perfect height for me. I wear a size 9.5 shoe and my feet are of average width.6. They feel well made. These don't give the impression that they're going to get holes or stop being good anytime soon.Cons1. None so far although I am a tad weary of how thin the tops are. I'll update my review if anything goes wrong.Overall, these are some really nice socks. A tad on the expensive side but I feel like I got my money's worth for right now.

"I bought these so I'd have a nice, reliable, and comfortable pair of slippers to wear around the house and occasionally out to get food (like drive thru where I don't plan on leaving the car)Pros1. They look nice. I bought the coffee brown pair and they just look good.2. These are comfortable. There is some cushioning although I don't expect it to last for years and years of use. They fit my feet very well and don't fall off.3. The bottoms are rubber soles which adds a non stick element. I also feel comfortable wearing these outside because they do have a ""sort of feel like shoes"" feel to them.4. The inside is fuzzy which makes these comfortable to wear with socks or with shoes.5. Good for squashing bugs on the wall =P6. They seem well made. I didn't have any loose threads and the stitching feels secure and we'll done.Cons1. None yet but I'll likely update my review if things go wrong.Like other reviewers have noted, these do squeeze your feet a little bit so they're probably not for people who need wide slippers. They also provide little arch support but I knew this buying them. They're slippers, not running shoes =)Overall, I love these things and I finally feel like I have a comfortable pair of slippers that's going to last me a while.

Easy controls.4. Decent length cable.Cons1. None yet.Like other reviewers say, this delivers  crystal clear audio with subtle distortions because that's what radio does sometimes. Usually distortions lastly only a few moments and don't happen overly frequently.The challenging part is finding a station that's open enough for this to sound good.

"I bought this for my pair of Sennheiser HD 558 headphones. I opened them up and removed the locking mechanism so I can use any old 2.5mm cable and decided instead to go with a 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter (this one) and then your standard 3.5mm male to male cable to connect my phones to stuff.Pros1. Works at least for audio. I don't use a microphone so if you do, I would defer to other people's reviwes...although some say it does and some say it doesn't so I wish they'd put like the product name of the equipment that does and doesn't work so we'd know.2. The adapter is fairly long which is good for me because the headphone jack is tucked up in my headphones a pretty good ways.3. It's cheap.Cons1. I guess it doesn't work for microphones on some devices.I got this solely for listening to audio and for that purpose, it works great.

"Warning: Before you buy these, you REALLY need to Google ""open vs closed headphones"" if you don't already know about them. Don't worry, you're not dumb for not knowing, but you should know the difference before even considering buying these. Open headphones leak sound and don't cancel out noise. They are designed that way for a reason. These are open headphones and a lot of reviewers don't seem to have realized that when they bought them. Please, please Google it before buying.The short version: Closed back headphones are, well closed on the backs. These are made for noise cancellation and noise reduction for those around you. They also add a bit of ""edge"" to the sound of the music you're listening to and are generally found in headphones that laud bass (such as the Audio Technica ATH-M50s or the Beats by Dre brand).Open backed headphones are open in the back. This adds a little more softness and to your sound and gives it a wider sound stage (as though you're listening to speakers in the room, not headphones. The effect is subtle). The Sennheiser 558s are open backed headphones, thus should NOT be purchased for noise cancellation or noise reduction.Okay now on to my review! =)Wow these are incredible. I've long been wanting to upgrade my audio experience and after reading tons of reviews, commentary, and forums threads, I decided that these were the perfect fit in my price range.A few things to note:1. I'm not a ""bass head"". I like a nice, even sound. I want to hear the bass but I don't necessarily need it to punch me in the ear holes.2. My equipment includes a Xonar DG soundcard on my computer which provides way more than sufficient power to drive these headphones. Smartphones/tablets/etc will work very well, but I tested these on my computer.3. I am NOT an audiophile. I'm a normal guy who listens to a lot of audiophiles talk.Pros1. The soundstage is incredible. I've been a life long purveyor of the ""less than $40 headphones"" market and this is unlike anything I've ever heard out of that range of headphones. It's very clean (of course, source pending, if the recording is bad, the sound will be bad) and very even. The instruments have a good ""separation"". It's very easy to pick out every individual instrument and listen to it. This is not something I could do with my Sennheiser 419s or my Koss PortaPros. The highs are high, the lows are low, and the mids are mid. It's very clean cut and crisp.2. The headphones are very comfortable. The cloth ear-cups and headband pad are soft and feel great. I could wear these forever and be happy with it. The earcup pieces also pivot to help fit on your head more evenly. It's all very nice.3. These can get very loud before any distortion sets in. In fact, I've yet to hear any distortion out of these. I'm sure it can happen if you push it hard enough, but at that point, you're risking an ear injury.4. I like that I can take the cable out and replace it if need be. Good call Sennheiser.5. I like the design. They're not like ridiculously high-end-looking, but they're definitely not eye sores.6. I'm going to dedicate another pro to the sound here. They really do sound incredible. I do want to address the ""open ear"", ""lack of noise reduction"", and ""sound leakage"" everyone's complaining about. These are open ear headphones. You don't buy these for noise reduction and sound containment. That's not what they were built to do. You don't buy a Corvette to pull a trailer. You do not buy these for airplanes, subways, or noise cancellation.Cons1. The 558s are made entirely out of plastic. They feel of high quality and such, but we all know what happens to plastic when accidents happen. I don't worry about them breaking on their own (through normal wear and tear) but I'll definitely be extra cautious if I'm over a hard floor or concrete.2. The mesh that covers the outside holes on the headphones are cloth. I feel like they're gonna rip someday. Not someday soon, but someday.3. These squeeze your head quite a bit when you first open them up. They require a couple of weeks of wear before they loosen up a bit for optimal comfort. They're great out of the box but if your head is sensitive, these may give you a headache on day one. Don't freak out, put them on something that's roughly head-sized and let them sit a day or two to loosen up a bit :)4. The treble is a bit high on these with a flat EQ and the mids are a bit heavy. I used the EQ that comes with the Xonar DG sound card (some cute little Asus app) to turn the treble and mids down a bit and I boosted the bass a little bit. I don't believe these are the fault of the cans but rather my music and set up. Just be warned, you may have to make minor adjustments to hit that sweet spot for you!5. The cable is removable but it isn't a generic cable. It's a 2.5mm with a special twist latch that is specific to Sennheiser cans. That means replacements are a bit harder to find and cost a bit more money. That is particularly troubling considering that this thing comes with a quarter inch jack with a 3.5mm converter. The two together are larger than some brands of cigars. Not great for mobile use.I do want it noted that my cons are nitpicks, not major concerns (hence, no stars off). When you start spending into the 3-4 digits in price for headphones, the little things start to matter more.Look, here's the thing folks. These are far and away the best headphones I've ever owned without question, period.. Obviously if you already have a pair of $120+ headphones, you are taking a side step or maybe even a step down. However, if you're reading this and you have a $5, $25, $50, etc pair of headphones, be aware that you're stepping up to a wholly different music experience and it's one that is intensely subject to personal taste.For instance, if you love heavy, hard-hitting bass, these aren't for you. I didn't list that as a con because it's not a bad thing. These things aren't designed to sound like a pair of Beats by Dre.If you need something with more noise reduction (to shut out the world around you), these are not for you. These were not designed for that purpose.When you start getting up in to the ""low end of the high end"" headphones and higher, you gotta start doing a little soul searching and figure out what kind of sound you want because up here, it varies a lot between headphones. Once you figure out what you really want, you can find headphones that match that profile.Do your research and enjoy yourself. If you like a nice, even sound where the bass is present, but not thumping and an open, airy sound-stage, these are utterly fantastic at this price point.**Update**I've now had this for roughly 4 months. The sound is still amazing, the fit is still tight enough to be comfy but not so tight as to cause headaches or issues.I have performend the ""foam mod"" on these, which entails taking the rubber foam from the backs. The soundstage does get a bit wider and the bass gets less edgy, but I prefer the sound like this overall.I have also performed the mod that removes Sennheiser's proprietary lock ring for the headphones. I can now use any 2.5mm cable (I use a 2.5mm-3.5mm adapter with a dual sided 3.5mm headphone cable). This has opened my possibilities of replacements and I'm very happy with it.These are still the best headphones I've ever owned and I've no intention of upgrading to anything else anytime soon :) These are monsters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10Z4Q2HG64GHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FEEY9A#wasThisHelpful","R10Z4Q2HG64GHS","A2RI4QE6EO29CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RI4QE6EO29CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this as a second controller for my Xbox One. The controller that came with my Xbox One purchase has been fitted with a Play and Charge kit so I wanted another controller with that set up.Pros1. Charging solution + controller in one package. Don't have to worry about buying both separately and it costs roughly the same either way.2. The Xbox One controller is a fantastic controller. Comfy to hold, easy to use..3. Connecting to the Xbox One was easy (instructions included)4. Charing cable works and plugs into any USB port. This could theoretically be used on computers as well as the Xbox One.5. Officially licensed by Microsoft. That's always a pro when it comes to gaming accessories. Officially licensed by any company (sony, nintendo, etc) generally has higher quality than third party. Not always, but most of the time.6. The cable is very long. Sufficient for most set ups.Cons1. There really isn't much of a price break for buying the whole pacakage as opposed to separately. I think it's like $5 less (at least what I paid). As I understand from having this in my wishlist for 3 months, the product goes in and out of stock all the time so I guess that probably affects pricing.2. The micro-USB port on top of the controller has always felt a little wobbly and flimsy to me. I've had my Xbox One for 6 months and my original controller hasn't broken and doesn't seem like it's going to, but it's a long-term concern of mine. Not much I can do about it.Overall, this is the controller package you want. Wireless, charging enabled, and officially licensed. About the only other charging solution I'd recommend is the Nyko charging dock.

"Like his other work as of late, Stuart Woods seems to have slowed down a bit. He's pushing 80, it happens. That said, I found the story fun. Not like 1991 Stone Barrington ""fun"", but still fun nevertheless.Pros1. The story isn't bad. Bringing back some old bad guys and revolving around some old concepts. Woods is trying to find Stone some consistent enemies in the later part of the series. It works in some cases, not in all cases.2. There is actually some ""oh no, I gotta hide because people are trying to kill me"" in this one. It removes Stone from his wealth and power for a bit which is actually refreshing to see.3. People actually shoot people. More than once. Not as ""polished"" as his other later novels.Cons1. Like many, I find myself ready to skip pages that are heavily political. I don't find it annoying or ""bad"". It is his books, his art, and so he can do what he wants with them. But still, a little toning down would be nice.2. Like his other later works, Stone becomes a bit less relate-able in every new novel. He is, after all, super wealthy and one gets a bit tired of the weird food names and expensive alcohols.Overall, I would only really recommend this to people who don't mind Stone's new life. Yes, it doesn't have the grunge anymore but he's rich and partially famous, he doesn't need to be grungy anymore. I just hope Woods at least works on his story pacing. It seems like he did a bit in this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP2ECTMJ71BSC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOE4KDM#wasThisHelpful","RP2ECTMJ71BSC","A2RI4QE6EO29CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RI4QE6EO29CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's true that Stuart Woods has lost his edge a little bit. He's pushing 80 years old and Stone Barrington has been around for going on two decades now. It happens. You can't expect a mind to stay sharp forever. That said, the book is okay (3 stars on Amazon means ""okay"").Pros1. The story moves briskly. The late 20's in the series were a lot of words without a lot of movement. Even if the story isn't as captivating as it once was, it at least moves as quickly as it used to.2. I found it actually a bit interesting to see Stone try to manage all these political friends and enemies.Cons1. Like many, I'm not all about pushing political agendas via creative works. Unlike many, I understand that it's his art and therefore can express whatever views he wants. I'm actually a liberal-minded moderate, but even I'm like ""okay Mr Woods, tone it down a bit.""2. I miss the ""grunge"" feel of Stone's life. It just seems so polished and proper. Everyone's eating foods with french names and bottles of wine that costs more than my entire life. I guess it's the whole ""can't relate to me because he's a poor guy trying to make it.""It's an interesting book and I managed to finished it without problems. I'll probably buy the next one because I'm lazy and don't feel like finding another series. I don't regret my purchase, but I would only recommend this to people who don't mind the changes in feeling in these novels.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B4ZVIY8EMA31/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWG5V1A#wasThisHelpful","R2B4ZVIY8EMA31","A2RI4QE6EO29CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RI4QE6EO29CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing is quite possibly the nicest can opener I've ever owned. I bought this after my cheap, dollar store can opener broke.Pros1. It's heavy and feels very well made. This is not some lightweight POS you can buy at the dollar store.2. The gear-driven mechanism turns very smoothly. It just feels smooth and nice, even if it makes the cans turn a little slower.3. the handle is well constructed and the turning handle is large which provides a lot of leverage. Very well designed.4. Cheap, at the time of this review, it's under $10. I didn't think you could get things this nice for under $10.Cons1. None that I can think of so far. About the only thing that may bug me long term is that the handle is still ""plastic covering metal"". My last can opener broke when the black plastic handle snapped and it became barely usable thanks to the metal being difficult to hold. Assuming these don't do that, then there's nothing wrong with this can opener.Overall, this is a hand-crank can opener. It's made in the USA and it's surprisingly well crafted for a $10 item. It's worth a shot.

"I bought this for my mouse after a 6 1/2 inch wheel was too big for him. He's a smaller field mouse (I think).Pros1. Good size, he was able to move it easily.2. Attach on the cage or free standing, your choice.3. Good color and design.4. Silent for now, but I'll adjust the review if it ever changes.5. Mouse likes it.Cons1. The tension of the wheel changes depending on how tight it's screwed it. The yellow bit in the center doubles as a screw that holds everything together. When it's really tight, the wheel is a bit harder to turn. I loosened it a little bit, no big deal.Overall, good little wheel.

"I have a desktop PC along with a podcast set up, speakers, and dual monitors. I'm also a tech blogger so I always have an assortment of mobile devices laying around. I needed something to plug them all into.Pros1. 12 sockets! This makes life better.2. The fact that some sockets are on the side allows for large brick plugs that would otherwise take up multiple spaces on the power strip due to its size. With this, that's no longer an issue.3. It's wide and heavy. Wherever I put it, it stays.4. Feels well made. Not some cheap plastic thing like many cheaper ones. Those still work obviously but this feels more sturdy.5. The coaxial Jacks on the back are a nice touch. I'll never use them but it's good to know they're there.Cons1. According to other reviewers, I guess there's a safety issue with these and electric surges. I always unplug my desktop set up during severe weather (I never risk it) but you may want to read some of the negative reviews before trying this out. It doesn't sound like much would survive a direct lightning strike and I'm impressed there are so many people who have lightning strikes that affect their electricity and own this power strip (really, what are the odds?) but better safe than sorry when dealing with thousands in electronics. Also, read the warranty before buying. It's available on Belkin's website.Overall, I needed something with more sockets and this provided me with what I needed. I'm a tinfoil hat kinda guy when it comes to unplugging things during severe weather so I don't have to worry about safety.

"I bought this because of peer pressure. Two of my friends have Ruby and that means I had to get Sapphire. I also bought this for my girlfriend.Pros1. Classically long Pokemon story. I haven't played one since the red/blue/yellow days but I can already tell I'm going to spend way more time in this than I did on those.2. There's a lot to do. On top of the main story there are a bunch of Pokemon to catch and train. There's also online battling and trading. You can also a with your Pokemon and train them to make them stronger. I'm at the third gym leader and I'm already overwhelmed by how much there is to do.3. The game is large and beautiful. The graphics aren't like Final fantasy 15 good, but they're colorful and cartoon-like and fit the theme and atmosphere of the game perfectly.4. The various dexes make for a fun experience. Way better than just having the plain old Pokedex.5. The music doesn't suck.Cons1. The Pokemon sounds still sound like it was done in 8 bit. Seems oddly out of place with the Polish of the rest of the game.2. The story isn't much different from the first Pokemon games. Catch all the Pokemon and be a great trainer. It's not unenjoyable but it's definitely like ""oh here we go again"".3. The menus seem unnecessarily tedious. There always seems to be one click more than is needed to do what you need to do but then one less click when needed. Like in the computer, when you back out, it asks if you want to back out even if you aren't in the middle of something. But then in battle you can't confirm attacks, they just go. This is maddeningly inconsistent and took some time to get used to.Overall, this is the best Pokemon game I've played. It's world's above the originals and it's awesome to not have to trade with a link cable anymore. Worth it, especially if you can get 4 or 5 friends to play it too.

"I bought this because the desktop mic stand I was using started taking up too much space thanks to its tripod-style stand structure.For comparison purposes, here is the mic stand I was switching from: http://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Nu-Era-Tabletop-Mic-Stand/dp/B003VYBD58As you can see, the legs are so wide on that model and my desk is pretty thin so I wanted something with a heavy, rounded base to use instead because it's more efficient and saves space. That's why I bought this one. I do podcasting along with voice overs and YouTube videos.Pros1. Nice and heavy. I have no fear of my mic or stand tipping over.2. Variable height. I keep it on the lowest setting but it's nice to know I can extend it if needed.3. The threading fit my microphone clip (whatever came with the GLS ES-57)4. Takes up so little space on the desk. The base is 6-inches in diameter and can be easily moved out of the way.5. My Nady pop filter fits the stem.6. Cheap and solid. It's all metal.Cons1. The one I got actually wasn't the one pictured and I could tell by the tightening handle. In the picture, it's shiny black plastic and kind of short. On the one I got, the tightening handle is larger and actually better. No complaints but just be warned that there are at least two variants of these floating around.Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.

"I want to start this review with the observation that most people rated this game before all the patches. If you see any reviews from before around December 27th, disregard them because those people were judging a game that hasn't had the patches released to fix errors and add features. That makes all those angry release day reviews wrong and you shouldn't pay any attention to them. Anything updated or written after December 27th is probably okay assuming it isn't an angry, dejected fanboi. Okay, so my quick review.Pros1. The multiplayer does, in fact, work. It's a little wonky here and there but it does work and it works about as well as prior Halo games (which have always been wonky). I don't know if people are mis-remembering ""the good old days"" or if they simply didn't play that much, but matchmaking always took 3-5 minutes on a good night and 5-10 minutes on a bad night to get into a game. That hasn't changed at all from any of the online Halo games. I've had matchmaking do its ""search loop"" twice since I started playing it and a quick ""exit and re-enter"" fixed it both times. It's not nearly as bad as the angry mob of 1-star reviewers make it seem. Some people like to just be angry.2. The 60fps makes these games look intensely smooth. It's most notable during Halo 3 because it is so much smoother than it used to be. 60fps ftw.3. The graphical enhancements are awesome. Especially for Halo 2. The ability to turn it on and off is not only amazing and impressive, but also tactically useful. When I need the textures turned down to differentiate from landscape and bad guy, putting it down to the old graphics settings with the older lighting and textures makes it way easier to see bad guys at a distance and in low-light scenarios. Cool!4. Halo 1, 2, 3, and 4 campaigns in all of their glory for under $60 is glorious.5. I like in matchmaking that any game could be any map from any title. You could play Blood Gulch one game then Valhalla the next. Halo 2 mechanics one game and Halo 4 mechanics the next. That's really fun and a good way to shake things up and keep matchmaking interesting. I think it would've been an inferior experience if playlists were done ""by game"".6. Halo 5 Guardians preview until January 15th = win.7. The ability to customize controls, armor suits (colors, etc), and more for each individual game was a good touch although I generally just leave everything the same from game to game.Cons1. The matchmaking stats don't report right. I went 5 kills, 17 deaths in my first match (I hadn't set the controls yet and kept tossing power drains at myself...oops). I came right back and went 13-10 in the next game, and then 17-9 in my third game. Despite winning 2 of 3 games, the game reports my wins at 1 and my Kill/Death as 5-17. This hasn't changed much in the week I've been playing it. The same goes for campaign. I've done 2 Halo 2 missions and it says I've done 6...and I even got some achievements I definitely didn't do.2. The customization is about 50% there. You can change your armor colors but you can't actually see the change in the menu. In the later Halo games, you could pick your individual pieces of armor (especially Halo 4) which you can no longer do. Either let us customize or don't, but don't give us half of it...and not even the cool half.3. There are small graphical glitches here and there. Parts of the menu kinda bug out (they still work) every now and then. I suspect future patches will fix this and it doesn't affect game play so I'm not overly concerned.4. There is one ranked playlist on multiplayer and I don't like the game type. Lame.5. I bought the game and the next day they announce that they're giving away ODST to people who bought it before I did. Lame.6. No Halo: Reach online playlists, maps, or mechanics. Lame because I really liked Reach's multiplayer7. After matches, the game bounces you from the lobby in matchmaking. Given that it's much harder to see who you've played with recently (compared to the Xbox 360), that means it's harder to find the people you just played with and invite them to a game. It's essentially anti-social unless you're already in a party with friends. This is as much Microsoft's fault as it is 343's because the Xbox One's menu system kind of puts the ""social"" aspect in the background for some silly reason.Overall, this title has had a lot of problems. However, I bought the game anyway because even if multiplayer was broken, there are still 4 Halo games worth of campaign and that alone is worth the $60. As it turns out, 343 has been doing a LOT better than the reviewers here would have you believe. Multiplayer feels like a Halo game and the minor issues don't affect the game play very often. Given that 343 has announced that they're holding back work on their next Halo game (due out in Spring of 2015...and no I'm not talking about Guardians, I'm talking about another side game) to fix this one, I have confidence that the game will be more or less what was expected.Yes, it sucks that the game was released in the shape it was in. Sometimes budget constraints and deadlines are a real pain. Anyone who has ever worked in a deadline-driven environment can tell you that sometimes you release things you didn't get to finish all the way. At least 343 is doing something to make it right. Take a lesson, Ubisoft, because Assassin's Creed Unity still sucks.I would recommend this game to Halo fans who have dealt with ""those Halo issues"" through the first 4 Halo games (and those who believe those issues didn't exist are wrong or stupid, it's always taken several minutes to get into a matchmaking game). Casual gamers may want to wait a few more months for 343 to sort out the remaining issues...but there really aren't all that many.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BQ18MPBAPJXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSQHX1K#wasThisHelpful","R3BQ18MPBAPJXG","A2RI4QE6EO29CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RI4QE6EO29CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Square Enix wanted to get back to their roots and Bravely Default was the result. As someone who has been playing those games since Final Fantasy 2 on SNES, I was curious and excited.Pros1. A fast paced story that takes you across the map before chapter 4. You get the airship quickly. There's a world map. The story and setting of the game are flawless old school Final Fantasy.2. The graphics are phenomenal. The 3D effects are subtle and enjoyable but even in 2D mode the hand drawn graphics look exquisitely old school while still being modern and pleasing.3. The job system is extensive and upgrades quickly as you progress. They're earned by side quests given throughout the game which makes them worth doing and they're actually relevant to the story.4. The Brave/Default battle system is genius. It makes battles fast and adds some much needed depth to the old school ATB style combat while not warping it into something convoluted. I'll also add here that you can fast forward battle animations by 4 times which makes grinding so fast and easy.5. Engaging characters with distinct personalities. Tiz is a little boring when it comes to dialogue but let's face facts, Chrono didn't even talk and Chrono Trigger was still great.6. The Norende rebuild, summon friends, abililink, D's journal, and the tutorial quests add some really fun depth and give players something to do.7. You can increase and decrease the random encounter frequency by a fairly wide margin. Crank it to grind, tank it to enjoy the story. Love it.8. The soundtrack is amazing. It's catchy when it needs to be, epic when it needs to be, and highly varied in tempos and instruments. Hands down one of the best video game soundtracks of the last decade. The guy who is doing Bravely Second has some mighty big shoes to fill.9. The ability to pause combat at any point and act using SP is awesome. Yes, you can buy it but really you don't have to. Just leave the game on and close the 3DS lid and you'll earn them pretty quick. A good night's sleep gets you 1 SP and the work day or school day gets you another. You can only have 3 total so it really doesn't take long to get it without spending real money. Also the functionality is wicked awesome when a battle is going South.Cons1. While the characters are billed as 18 year old adults, their Chibi appearance gives them a much younger look. This makes certain parts of the game feel awkward and a little creepy (Edea's bakini scene, the old sage drooling over Edea and Anges, Ringabel's personality in general). Word is that Bravely Second will feature more adult looking characters which will be better.2. The stat system is more in depth than they explain. It takes things like job level into consideration for things like weapon damage so even if a weapon seems powerful, they're still kinda pathetic when in the hands of someone low level in their job (even if the job is suited for it). This isn't bad, it's actually great for strategy but I wish they'd put more focus on it. Don't ever go into a boss battle on a fresh job change. Revert back to a class and equipment set that's been developed.3. It's really easy to get over leveled and it takes a lot of the challenge out of it. For those who want a challenge and not just enjoy the story, you may want to take advantage of the ""turn experience off"" function in the Settings to keep it tough.4. It's hard to get the AR cards working if you're a noob at it like me.Overall I love this game. This is what I always imagined the jRPG genre would evolved into and it's great to see that Square Enix is still capable of releasing a game with this much charm and enjoyment. If you liked the older final fantasy games or jRPGs in general, you'll probably love this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F45JX41CZGPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GV4V8XC#wasThisHelpful","R1F45JX41CZGPX","A2RI4QE6EO29CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RI4QE6EO29CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this because I live in an apartment complex with a shared backyard and no fence. I own a chow/retriever mix who weighs roughly 35lbs and thought this would be good for her.Pros1. The one end has a spring built in so when my dog tugs on it, it lets her bounce instead of choking her.2. Seems of solid construction. The various parts feel sturdy and the cable is heavy enough to feel reliable but no so much so that it weighs the dog down.3. 30 feet as advertised, more than long enough for the pup.Cons1. None yet but I'll update my review if anything goes wrong.Overall, I'm happy with the purchase. I haven't owned it long but this thing has been out in the weird, awkward weather of Ohio during the winter so I'll know if features like the rust resistance work soon enough. It holds the dog in her area and doesn't choke her.

"I bought these after my 4 year old pair of C1RCA's finally started falling apart. I wanted to go for something a bit different so I went with these (in the cream/black/acid because my girlfriend insisted that I can ""totally rock them""...I don't think that's the case but I bought them anyway). I'm used to the huge, padded skate shoes so transitioning to a cloth-style shoe was an adjustment.Pros1. The shoe fit well. I wear a men's 9.5, that's what I ordered, and that's what I received. Shoe fit with about a thumb's width of room to spare which is what I wanted.2. I like the design. I got the tie-dye ones. I have no intention on trying to keep these sparkling clean. Thanks to their messy, but fun design, I can spill pretty much whatever I want on these and it'll just blend right in. Ultimate lazy shoes ftw.3. They are comfortable and they fit well. I keep mine looser so I can slip them on and off like slippers and that works for me even if my foot comes out of the heel a little bit when I walk. When tied tight, they're very snug.4. Reasonably priced. I bought these for under $30. A name brand shoe for under $30 is uncommon. It also makes me less concerned about destroyed them because I can more easily justify destroying a $30 pair of shoes than a $60 pair of shoes.Cons1. They are not for wide-footed people. I have a medium width foot and they are comfortable but I can definitely feel a bit of a squeeze on the bottom of my feet. I wore them for 12 consecutive hours when I first got them and didn't experience any pain or discomfort but if my foot were even a quarter of an inch wider, that would not have been the case. If you need wide shoes, these aren't what you're looking for.2. These are not for walking, running, skateboarding, or any other physical activity. They're ""fashion"" shoes meant to be worn to places like a movie theater, out to dinner, or going to parties/bars/etc. They give a skater look but are not a skate shoe. Since I don't skate, that works for me but athletes looking for an athletic shoe need to look elsewhere.3. In cold weather or when there's precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, etc), you might as well be outside wearing 2 pairs of socks. They don't keep your feet warm or very dry thanks to their cloth design. Not a deal breaker (I knew this when I bought them) but just pointing it out.Overall, I'm happy with the purchase. If I'd bought these for, say, $60, I probably would've dropped it to a 4-star rating so price was definitely taken into account here. They are comfortable for ""goofing around"" which is good because that's what I was looking for. I'll likely get a second pair of the thicker skate shoes for those days where I'm talking around somewhere and need the extra ankle and arch support. I would recommend these but only if you have medium to thin feet and just need a shoe for goofing around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NWGYTA1FO7ZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HASP1LI#wasThisHelpful","R1NWGYTA1FO7ZM","A2RI4QE6EO29CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RI4QE6EO29CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for my brother for a Christmas present.Pros1. It's thicker than I thought it would be. It'll probably last a long time.2. The outside of the wheel cover has various grips which I liked. It definitely helps improve grip. The design is a little tacky but not unpleasant.3. It's inexpensive, which was nice.4. As advertised, there is no stench or anything untoward about it. I don't think I would've really cared if it had a smell ""Cons1. It was a little big for my brother's steering wheel. We ended up using some double sided tape to make up for it. Make sure you measure your steering wheel! Since this was a ""my bad"" thing, I didn't dock a star but learn from my mistakes.Other thoughts1. This ships from China. The free shipping was nice because shipping overseas is really expensive for some items and I did, in fact, receive the steering wheel cover. However, it took about 3 weeks to get here and the shipment tracking was kind of useless. It said it had left China then just showed up one day without any tracking updates. This is not a con, simply the ""usual experience"" of dealing with sellers through China so I wanted to put that out there so you can plan accordingly. If you're buying it as a gift, order it well in advance. I bought this in mid November and it made it here for Xmas with a week to spare.Overall, my brother is happy with it. It matches an orange/black seat cover that I also bought him (link at the bottom) so it helps make his car all themed and such. I don't regret the purchase and I would recommend this to my friends as long as they measured the steering wheel first. It's not the world's best steering wheel cover or anything, but it does what it needs to and it's cheap.Here's the link for the seat covers I bought with this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009ET14E4/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_4","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CEJFSJKF51WY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPOU8RM#wasThisHelpful","R1CEJFSJKF51WY","A2RI4QE6EO29CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RI4QE6EO29CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this to keep me going until I buy a second controller and one of those Nyko charge docks.1. It's simple. A charging cable and a battery. That's it. No weird parts or confusion at all.2. It works well. Every part worked as expected.3. Battery keeps a charge for a good long time. No issues. I don't have exact estimates, suffice it to say that I've forgotten the last time I'd charged it a few times.4. Lithium ion battery.Cons1. Kind of expensive for a battery and a cable.2.

"I bought this to protect my Nintendo 3DS XL Nintendo controller edition (I have no idea what it's actually called). I was going to get a Nerf one but found out that the XL versions have a history of scratching 3DS XL's and I didn't want that at all so I searched around and bought this instead.Pros1. It covers the top and bottom to satisfaction. The design on my 3DS XL is protected and most of the surface area is protected. The parts that aren't protected aren't parts that touch a table or anything.2. It's easy to put on. The top slides on. The bottom slides on and hooks into the two square holes at the top which makes it feel secure.3. All the ports, holes, and other things are accessible including the buttons, stylus, game cartridge, lights WiFi slider, 3D slider, volume, headphone jack, and lanyard hole.4. It's clear enough to where I can still see and enjoy the special design on my 3DS.5. It's inexpensive.6. The plastic of the TPU makes it easier to grip the 3DS XL.7. As a fun, unforeseen benefit. When I hold my 3DS XL, I consistent (on accident of course) turn the volume up with my palm as I'm holding it. Thanks to the case, I now hold my DS slightly lower than before and I no longer accidentally hit the volume slider.8. I also like that the inside of the DS is protected by a lip. When I close the DS, the lips of the case meet instead of the inside of my 3DS.9. It still fits my AmazonBasics 3DS carrying case so I don't have to buy another one of those.Cons1. It provides more scratch and dirt protection than drop and shock protection. You'll need to pick up something with a little more girth and bulk to protect from drops. This case also doesn't protect the bumpers or hinge at all so if you do decide to drop it, at least try to drop it on any other edge or side than the one with the hinge and bumper buttons.2. It is more of a frosted clear. This isn't a huge deal because I can still see the design on the 3DS clearly but it is not ""crystal clear"" or anything like that. It's definitely frosted.Make sure you wipe your device down really well before sticking it in there and do make sure you take the case off and dust/clean the 3DS and the case every now and then. Since it is so open at the top, dust can still get in there over time and mess with things. It's not a huge deal but it's something to keep in mind.I've never owned a limited edition of a game console before so I wanted to make sure I protected this one at least a little bit. At the very least the design on the front (the original NES controller) from getting messed up. This case does that and that's what I wanted so 5 stars out of me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D3H1GIL55FDB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GX330XW#wasThisHelpful","R3D3H1GIL55FDB","A2RI4QE6EO29CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RI4QE6EO29CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My roommate bought me one of these for Christmas because a local game shop had it on sale and he wanted to get me something awesome.Pros1. The screen is huge. Easily the largest mobile gaming display I've ever played with. It's gorgeous. Especially when playing graphically pleasing games like Bravely Default.2. The 3D slider has an off switch. I guess, according to my roommate, the regular 3DS has a slider but no click to turn it off (I guess sliding it down eventually just turns it off). The extra click is nice.3. Holds a charge for days.4. SD card slot let's you expand your memory which is nice.5. The design is wicked. It's not like a sticker or anything, it's painted on like the rest of the color. Feels very high quality. The back is a darker gray which makes the front stand out even more. The retro NES controller design just looks so cool.6. The buttons all have a very satisfying click. The joystick feels smooth and wonderful.7. Still plays regular Nintendo DS games. My copy of Chrono Trigger isn't useless yet!8. The peripherals all work well. WiFi connects without problems. Speakers work fine (that other guy seems to have gotten a dud, that sucks and he should've had it RMA'd before posting a review). 3D screen works. AR stuff works. No real issues in the software.9. I love that I can buy (most) 3DS games online and download them. Digital downloads rock.Cons1. The hinge wobbles ever so slightly when holding it up and playing it. Being a long time DS owner, I knew that was coming. They all wobble just a little bit but it's not a big deal. Not enough to be worried. If you don't treat it like garbage, it'll never break. Just don't be surprised if there's just a bit of wobble.2. I'm torn because I never want to cover this baby up but I want to save it from fading or scratching so I can't decide whether or not to buy a case for it.3. Nintendo just released ""The New Nintendo 3DS"" otherwise known as the Nintendo 3DS LL (Google it). It'll be in the United States in 2015 which means these bad boys will be out of date in the next 12 months. Here's hoping that most 3DS titles moving forward still accommodate all 3DS models and not just the new one (which features some extra buttons and slightly upgraded hardware). Would be unpleasant to have to upgrade next year for Bravely Second or some other game.Overall this is a great system and an improvement over pretty much every prior DS. The retro design makes it feel unique and fans of old school video games will enjoy that. Make sure to let the speakers burn in a bit (leave it at half volume for a week or two) because that allows them to go louder without blowing them out. Also never set the game sound to max and you'll avoid burning it out.I would buy this again if my first one broke someday. Can't wait til they have more themes!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HTHRHIMOYN7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NAXECXK#wasThisHelpful","R3HTHRHIMOYN7R","A2RI4QE6EO29CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RI4QE6EO29CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What's weird about this one is I enjoyed it more than the last few Stone Barrington novels and in this one, Stone really plays more of a side character rather than a main character.What I liked1. Advances the stories of Kate Lee and Ed Eagle. Stone is just kind of there but it's still actually oddly enjoyable.2. The Barbara Eagle storyline was fantastically done. Especially the end. It was the first time my eye brows shot up reading Stuart Woods in a while.3. I hope Woods keeps Ann around for a while. I really liked her character.What I disliked1. As per the norm, these characters manage to pull off some dramatic stuff without much effort. If these books were D&D games, I'd be calling the dice loaded.

"Carnal Curiosity is another chapter in the fascinating life of Stone Barrington and, personally, i feel like this is about as much as a ""callback"" to Stone's earlier life as Stuart could possibly do.What I liked1. Stone actually does some of the same stuff he used to do as a detective. I'm not a hater of ""the rich and powerful Stone"" but it's nice to see him call back some of those intimidation tactics and such from his cop days.2. The story in this one is actually pretty good. A little more mystery than many of Woods' more recent Stone books. Of course, it's fairly obvious who the criminal is but finding the evidence to prove it feels like a callback to the ""Stone was a cop"" days.What I disliked1. Stone's ridiculous luck. A part of an armed robbery and didn't even take a gun-handle to the noggin.2. Also, Stone's women for this particular book really didn't try all too hard.Overall, not a bad book. I would read it again and my nit picks are small issues and not things that ruin the book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JCHQK2OI93MG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FX7R5TE#wasThisHelpful","R2JCHQK2OI93MG","A2RI4QE6EO29CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RI4QE6EO29CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first 60/70% of this book was phenomenal... man I was hooked into this beautiful story of first love. But, for whatever reason the story took a huge turn in the end and just lost me. If the entire book had held onto the humorous/entertaining relationship they had in the beginning, which was my favorite part of the book, this would have been an easy 5 star read for me. It just got a little too ugly for me towards the end and the beauty of the story got lost in all of the unnecessary drama.I loved Ben!  He is one of my favorite male characters I've read in a long while. And Fallon, I loved how much her character grew as a result of their relationship. Just wish the book had kept the tone I felt in the first half all the way to the end.There are plenty of glowing 5 star reviews for this book so probably just another one of those books that for whatever reason I am in the minority!

"This is such an entertaining, erotic and suspenseful series! I would not recommend reading these as stand alones. It is best to start with book one because you will want to be able to follow the mystery that is slowly unfolding surrounding the death of the Sloan family's father, the gang they think is responsible and their mother who is in prison. This third book definitely revealed some big surprises in the mystery/suspense plotline. A new character is revealed that totally changes the game!Elle and Colin are definitely one of my favorite couples so far in this series. Not only are they pretty good at the off the charts sexy time, they are both just very good people. Colin has a past that he is ashamed of and it haunts him. He pours himself into his physical activities as a way to control his addictive urges. I love characters like Colin who have found a way to stay on the straight and narrow path in a way that is positive. I also love that instead of hiding from his mistakes, he uses that knowledge to help others not make the same ones. This makes Colin: The.Most.Awesome.Guy!I love that the relationship between these two revolves around the youth center and that they both feel strongly committed to helping young people. I guess that's why this couple stands out for me, because it's something that I believe in doing in real life. So, it helped me to connect with them a bit more.Watching these two move from the ""friends with benefits"" to opening their hearts to something more was a refreshing story indeed. Both of them were guarded for their own reasons, but as a couple they were stronger together when they broke down those protective walls. Sometimes you just have to take a chance even when it's risky... that's what they both had to realize.Great installment to this series... one more to go! Can't wait for the next book so we can see how the mystery unfolds so the Sloan family can finally put away the ugly past and move forward to a better future.Lauren Blakely is my favorite erotica author... no one does it better!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34PHQNVW1AP2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1517224179#wasThisHelpful","R34PHQNVW1AP2K","A2PWCLHSY97X3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWCLHSY97X3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are a lot of hooks to match together and it takes a bit of work to get them all linked together but once it's done it fits really well.

Some other wigs she owns we have paid between 40 and 50 dollars for and this is of a similar quality and standard as those.We received this as a free sample in exchange for honest feedback.

"We requested this wig in pink...  there are pics below for you to see the color and style.  It's a very light shade of pink.  The wig is trimmed in such a way that it is in various lengths around the bangs and the back so if this is the look you want then this is a good choice!  This does tend to shed quite a bit so be careful in how you handle the wig.  It needs to be combed and cleaned very, very gently.  Rough handling of this wig will quickly ruin it so bear that in mind.  Great wig for the price for quick dress ups.I received this as a free sample in exchange for my honest feedback.

"Fantastic conclusion to this series!  I was intrigued with book one, blown away by book two and well, totally invested in the finale with book three. :) Great PR series and an author that I've grown to really love as one of my favorite in the PR genre.

"This is a sweet office romance that is all about getting a second chance at love. I really liked how the story revolved around the 12 days of Christmas. This warmed the heart and put a smile on my face... what more do you need to cheer up the holidays?? :)This novella can be read as a stand alone but it is also part of the Blue Moon Lake series.  I LOVED the first book in this series called Share the Moon and can't wait to read the next full length book which is releasing soon.Wonderful and talented author...  looking forward to more of her work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPLSGK7DN02VN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z3DZ2XY#wasThisHelpful","RPLSGK7DN02VN","A2PWCLHSY97X3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWCLHSY97X3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My love affair with these characters all began with Silver Nights With You... and then, it continued with the second book Desert Sunrise. Needless to say, I was waiting to dive into book three with great anticipation AND the author not only did not disappoint me, she blew me away. I just can't recommend this trilogy of books more to the lover of Western Romance. Wonderful characters and a heartfelt storyline that is laced with humor, romance, suspense and even a few tears.Each of these books can be read as a stand alone but, I think the reason why the third book touched me so much was because I had grown to love Marlena aka Ruby, Dalton and all of the other characters in the previous books. This made their story so much more engaging. So, I do recommend starting from book one because they are all equally as good and it will help you understand the emotions of the characters and how they ended up where they are now.This last book of the series is just something special. The way the author built this story around the Ruby... the symbolism behind it all was very touching. The way she tied Shakespeare into the story in such a way that offered not only a touch of romance but also added an edge of suspense was very clever and such a nice way to enhance and enrich the plot. I also loved how the plot was so cleverly tied together with the title. Ruby's Song... yes, indeed... she did sing her song beautifully. And there was one point in the book towards the end when she was singing to an audience with a few little helpers that just had tears rolling down my cheeks. Oh man, I love it when that happens, when an author can so successfully bring on tears of happiness and joy and put a big smile on my face!This is a book that weighs heavily on the concept that love has no barriers. It doesn't care about age or where you fall in the hierarchy of social class. And, sometimes the heart just wants what it wants even when it's under impossible odds. But, love also makes the impossible possible if we just let our hearts guide us. There are times in life when we set out on a particular journey only to find that it's not where we belong. And, that is very much how I felt about both Marlena aka Ruby and Dalton. They were both on very different paths but once they followed their hearts desire they ended up exactly where they belonged. It was quite the journey for them to get there, but worth the trouble!This author is so very talented. There is just something appealing about her voice and writing style. As I mentioned in an earlier review, I used to sit and watch the old western romances with my mom when I was young. Reading these books took me back to those days. Felt like I was sitting on the couch again with my mom eating a bowl of popcorn. Perhaps that is why I enjoyed this series so much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J5HQ2ZHUFGDJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017HIHTTC#wasThisHelpful","R1J5HQ2ZHUFGDJ","A2PWCLHSY97X3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWCLHSY97X3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not a stand alone... part 7 of an on-going series!In this installment, we have yet another Dragon King fall into the mating trap... yep, this time it's Thorn and he falls hard for the determined and spirited American southern gal Lexi. Lexi is out for revenge and Thorn has stepped in to make sure her need for revenge doesn't end up getting her killed. What follows is an undeniable passion between the two while at the same time the Kings are in neck deep with the beginning of a war with the Dark Fae. It is a fight to see who will control the human realm. The humans are unknowingly caught between a delicate balance of peace and safety under the rule of the Kings, or their demise at the hands of the dark Fae.This was a really great installment, the action has stepped up a notch and hopefully we will be moving soon into a grand finale. I've made it no secret that my favorite character in this series is Rhi, the light fae. I love the direction the author is going with Balladyn and Rhi which is why this installment truly struck a chord with me. Balladyn is one of those characters that has me bouncing back and forth between love and hate, but right now I'm leaning more towards a growing love for him as we learn of his conflicting emotions towards Rhi. I have my own predictions of how this story will play out for them and if my predictions are true I will be really, really happy with the outcome.As much as I've been enjoying this series, I am ready for it to be drawn to a close. It's time for all of the kings and their allies to come together and put an end to the impending takeover by the Dark Fae, as well as coming to a resolution for the growing angst between Con and the banished dragon king Ulrik.I was worried that I was losing interest in this series all together since the last two installments didn't resonate with me as much as the beginning books. But, this installment changed my mind. I like that it seems like all of the pieces of the puzzle are finally starting to come together. And, I have to absolutely know what is going to happen to Rhi. This story ended in such a way that definitely has my curiosity peeked. So, yep, I'll be sticking around for more.Great series for the lover of dragons!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J46Z6XAT7THL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250071941#wasThisHelpful","R3J46Z6XAT7THL","A2PWCLHSY97X3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWCLHSY97X3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another great installment... this series is still one of my favs! Felicity Heaton has a talent for keeping us on our toes and leaving us wanting more with each book. This one has me waiting in anticipation for the Incubus/Huntress storyline... are we getting one?? I hope so...AND... I CAN'T WAIT FOR BLEU'S STORY!!! I know it's coming soon... the author has promised us it will. I'm positive that the wait will be worth it... :)This book is bringing us back to the shifter world again and we follow the story of Harbin, brother of Cavanaugh who me met in a previous book. Harbin is now living a life on the dark side after being banished from his pride many years ago. He is now an assassin and his new mark is about to change everything and set him on a path he had not expected. Aya is his mark, and as the story unfolds he finds that they have a connection that had been long forgotten, but is now finding it's way back to the surface. This powerful connection that forms between them has Harbin doubting his ability to fall through with the task he's been hired to fulfill.One thing I love about this series is the clever way the author ties in previous books and characters in a way that puts small pieces of puzzles together which helps me to make sense of things that have already happened. You get glimpses of characters and scenes you've read in other books but get to experience them from the perspective of another character. She also always finds a way to introduce new characters that leaves us wanting to know more about them which for me works in keeping me anticipating further installments.This is a great series for the PR fan because you get a little bit of everything... witches, elves, vampires, shifters, demons all mixing with the human hunters. There are plenty of characters to keep you entertained along with a really engaging storyline and lots of steamy romance to make it all worthwhile. And my FAVORITE part of the series... the strong, kick your butt female characters! There are no female doormats in this series. These ladies can fight and they always manage to drive their potential mates a little cra cra which adds a little bit of amusement to the pairings in each book.Great PR series and one I highly recommend... :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23XKJ3T5FFG4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016OOAQOA#wasThisHelpful","R23XKJ3T5FFG4X","A2PWCLHSY97X3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWCLHSY97X3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great product for anyone with dry or frizzy hair.  I have extremely dry hair due to the medications I am taking and it's a constant uphill battle.  I love the shampoos that this company sells and have been immensely pleased with how well they restore moisture in my hair.  This product is a nice compliment to their shampoos.  After I towel dry and comb out my wet hair I pour a little of this into my palm, rub together and work it through my hair starting mid-way down the head through the tips of the hair.  I let it settle for a bit and then follow up with a blow dry...  LOVE it...  :)  It's not heavy at all, very light and easy to use and smells very nice!  I also use this again sometimes later in the day when my hair is getting a bit frizzy...  so yes, you can also use it on your hair when it's dry to tame the frizzies.I am really glad I found the company...  they really do make great products for anyone struggling with dry skin or hair.I received a coupon for a free sample of this product in exchange for my honest feedback.

"I have extremely dry skin due to the medications I am taking.  Regular lotion was not doing it anymore.  I was asked to review this product and thought...  why not??  I do need some help and I will try anything at this point.  This is a very light and gentle oil.  It has a nice smell that is not overwhelming.  I lather this oil into my skin every night about 10-15 minutes before bed to allow it to soak in.  I was worried it would get my sheets oily but nope...  my skin drinks it up!  By the next morning it's worked it's magic and my skin is so much softer and smoother and less flaky.

"This product is designed for someone who is bed ridden and to help reduce or prevent bed sores.  I am a cancer patient and even though I am not currently bed ridden, I am struggling with extreme discomfort at night due to spine and rib metastasis from the cancer.  After using this product on my regular bed I have to say that this has truly been an exceptional product to have to reduce stress and pressure along my spine and I have been sleeping so much better.  I have stage IV breast cancer so my care is long term and my symptoms and care will have me in bed occasionally for long periods of time.  This is definitely going to come in handy.Even though the picture shows this being used in a hospital bed, it also works really well on a regular bed and that's how mine is being used right now.  I don't have any trouble with slippage of the mattress because of the type of sheets I use.  It has long flaps on both ends of the mattress that you simply tuck in for extra security.  You will need to place something underneath this to keep it from slipping about on a plastic mattress which is what we usually find on hospital beds.  Any type of slip proof cloth or mat will work.The other thing I really love about this product is that it is very portable.  I took this with me when I went to visit my daughter to keep me comfortable on the hotel bed.  For my occasional stays in the hospital...  this is going with me!  I hate hospital beds and this will help make the stay more comfortable.It takes about 10-15 minutes for this to fully inflate.  The pump is very, very quiet and gentle.  The only noise it makes is when it's adjusting pressure and it sounds a bit like a ticking clock.  It is not loud and annoying but very subtle.  As the mattress is adjusting it produces a gentle vibration that is very relaxing and it helps me relax my tense muscles and ease the tension around my spine.  It is very stimulating and I can see how this would be very beneficial for someone who is in bed all of the time.I love this product and would definitely recommend.

"I love this shampoo and conditioner!  Very nice...  :)  Smells really good.  I am testing several shampoos and conditioners for this company and so far I am really loving just about all of their products.  I'm on a lot of medications that severely dry out my hair and skin.  These shampoos/conditioners are working extremely well for me in helping to restore moisture, bounce and softness to my hair.  I've been using three types for the past three weeks, The coconut oil, the argan oil and the keratin...  my favorites for every day use are the argan and coconut.  The keratin I am finding is good for using a couple of times of week as it seems to provide more moisture than the other two.  After several days it makes my hair feel flat.

"I am a pistachio fanatic!  I eat them just about every day.  I also normally kept two bowls out all of the time as well.  One for the nuts and the other one to dump the shells.  I was the perfect reviewer for this item because since it arrived in the mail I have used it every single day.  I love the two in one feature because it does make it easier to dispose of those little shells.  It's made of a durable plastic, easy to wipe out and clean and small enough for your lap.  Great for kids who love to eat anything that has seeds or shells that have to be disposed because it's light, and unbreakable.  Our entire family eats pistachios and I would happily purchase this bowl in a larger size to accommodate the household.  I keep this one in the kitchen on the counter and just re-fill it when it empties.

"This is a really great wig for such a low price. It came very well packaged so it was perfect when we took it out of the box. Shipping was fast and efficient. My daughter is really into costuming/cosplay and she has a big collection of wigs. Her opinion on this one is that it is a great wig as long as you are wanting to keep the style of the hair as pictured. She would not recommend trying to re-style because the fiber/material the wig is made of would make it difficult. But, she loves it as is and is very happy with the way it looks.  This is a wig that will stay in good shape with proper storage, cleaning and care.  When you are cleaning and combing it has to be done so gently.  Rough handling of this wig will ruin the style and it will be difficult to get it back to the original style if it gets tossed about wrecklessly.

"This is not a stand alone! You must read Volume One first...This second book concludes the story and what a fantastic conclusion!  I've been waiting on the edge of my seat for months to read this... but it was totally worth the wait!  That ending...  just beautiful...  could not have been happier with the way this author tied everything up and pulled all of the pieces of the puzzle together.  This duo of books is definitely one of my top favorite PR reads this year.  It's original, engaging, sexy, mysterious, suspenseful..  a little bit of everything I love in a story.Once again I find it impossible to review this book without revealing any spoilers. And, because it's part two I really don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't read part one so that makes it twice has hard. But in summary...The overall story revolves around Denieve who came into the Frost world to investigate the mysterious Dr. Braeden Frost and the deaths that surround him.  Her best friend, who was one of those mysterious deaths, brought her there and yes, she is a ghost.  Dr. Frost has a twin brother named Xavier and Denieve finds herself mysteriously attracted to both men and she is conflicted as to why. They are complete opposites in every way and the two of them just don't make sense.  This is where the author truly showed her talent.  The way she resolved this triangle of love is one of the most original storylines I've ever read.  Two men... two sides of the same coin... sharing one heart... one soul... but also completely divided and conflicted.  My heart was torn between both of them.  As book one ended I was totally team Xavier because he was such a delicious and sexy bad boy.  But when I learn the truth about who they both are, I was just as divided as Denieve...  and, I was in love with both of these mysterious men.  An impossible situation that the author so successfully pulled together in a way that will make EVERYONE happy.  :)  Just a beautiful and unique love story that had me all smiles at the end and maybe even shedding a little tear or two.I really can't recommend this series enough for the PR fan!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B1X8IN0FGTOJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013OCC36E#wasThisHelpful","R1B1X8IN0FGTOJ","A2PWCLHSY97X3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWCLHSY97X3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first time I have ever used coconut oil and I have to say...  I am a fan!  My main purpose for this oil is for popping popcorn.  I love oil on my popcorn and decided I needed a healthier alternative.  This is perfect for that and it makes the popcorn taste really good.  Add a little sea salt to the popcorn and that makes it even better.  This is a very generous amount of coconut oil and smells really good when you open the lid.  I expect it to last a really long time.  It does come in a plastic container, but that doesn't really bother me to much.  I know some people prefer glass.  But, just pour it into a glass storage container and there you go...  problem solved.I received a free sample of this product in exchange for my honest feedback.

"I'm not an athlete but I am a woman going through menopause and get hot flashes on a regular basis.  This product is great to have around when you need a quick cool down.  Especially at night.  The nice thing about this towel is that it isn't drippy when you wet it down.  It stays cool for a long time.  So, when you wake up in the middle of night with a hot flash you can wrap this around your neck and keep it there to help stay cool.  It's also very portable.  I have a friend who also used this same product as a cancer patient.  She had lost her hair and would wet this down and wrap it around her head when she had a fever or when she was hot in general.  It really worked well for her and it's not something I would have thought of so just thought I'd add that in for others.

"This glove does have some benefits but heat resistance is not one of them.  It is not insulated and when I used it to take my baking dish out of a 375 oven it only took seconds for me to begin to feel the heat coming through the glove.  A piece of the glove got snagged on the edge of one of the racks in the oven and that one snag spread quickly into a really big hole in one of the fingers.  The cloth just started flaking away from the tear.  So, also not a very durable glove.  I would not recommend using this glove for extreme heat...  especially for something that you will need to carry or hold for longer than a few seconds.  I just feel like it's not safe.

"This is a nice set.  We have one of those really nice egg grills that can be used as an outdoor oven and we use it to make pizzas.  It gets really hot so having a large spatula is a must.  This is our second set, we have one similar to this one in another brand.  They are both great except the handle on the spatula with this set tends to loosen and we have to tighten it up every now and then.

"I was first introduced to Tanya Holmes when I read Within Temptation. It was one of my top favorite books last year. So, yes, I was looking forward to something new from her and she did not disappoint! This book blew my mind... I LOVED it! Another one to add to my top favorites this year.This is a book that you must go into blind. Stay away from those overly descriptive reviews that reveal anything about the plot. The element of surprise is what made this book so good. This story is incredibly engaging with a refreshingly original storyline that left me panting for more by the end! I seriously need the second part of this book right now... I can't believe I have to wait! It's killing me...Dr. Frost is such an incredibly complex character. He is mysterious, sexy and intriguing. The forbidden relationship that develops between him and Denieve has me both on edge but at the same time trying to figure out how the heck things are going to work out. There is a surprise character that steps into the picture that has me completely conflicted. Love/hate, love/hate... two emotions that has these characters so completely divided... and I mean that literally! Just read the book... you'll see what I mean. :)Yes, this book ends on a cliffy but I absolutely don't care... it's such a well developed storyline and I can see why splitting it into two books is necessary. But, if you don't want to be left hanging the second part comes out in the Fall and you can read them back to back.If you love Ghost stories, Paranormal Romance and suspense then you can't go wrong diving into this book. It is all those wrapped up into one well written story that definitely had me glued to the pages.Do I recommend?? Of course I do...  :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K4NS0V07ZAIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692441719#wasThisHelpful","R3K4NS0V07ZAIM","A2PWCLHSY97X3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWCLHSY97X3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tiberius was the star player in this book! He was an awesome guy with such a touching back story. I really loved his character a lot. He had a tough childhood with an MIA father but somehow he managed to defy the odds around him and find success. He was determined to be the type of man his father wasn't.Tingly had to grow on me a bit. I didn't like the way she treated Tiberius for a good portion of the book. Tingly is a runner on the track team. And, perhaps that was why she spent so much time ""running away"" from him. :) It was okay at first because she is a little gun shy when it comes to men now. But it got to the point where I felt like she was just being overly dramatic.Tingly needed a guy like Tiberius to come into her life. He was patient, caring and liked to take things slow and easy. He wanted something real and whether she believed it or not, she needed that too. She was always taking things fast and because of that, she was missing out on an important part of forming a true relationship, which is friendship. I liked the way Tiberius was able to help Tingly actually stop and take notice of the little things that matter between couples. I think that was my favorite part of the story.This is a type of New Adult romance I had never read before and I thought it was refreshingly different. And, I love that it was an interracial romance but the focus wasn't necessarily on race. It was more about their attraction to each other.Very well written, engaging, heartwarming... pretty good NA... it ticks all the boxes!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H5UFRRXTEW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZM532HG#wasThisHelpful","R2H5UFRRXTEW3","A2PWCLHSY97X3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWCLHSY97X3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those series that starts off with a trickle and ends with a bang!  Each book in this series just got better and better as these four gifted sisters slowly evolve into the powerful beings they were destined to become.  Watching them finally coming together to fulfill their purpose by the end was everything I hoped it would be and more.  They had traveled a long journey together, each finding their destined mates but they always held strong together and unified as sisters.  This series is sexy, engaging and suspenseful with a cast of characters that not only entertain, but also has you rooting for their HEA.  If you love Paranormal Romance, you can't go wrong with this set.  It ticks all of the boxes that we've come to expect from good PNR.  This is one of my favorite series and one I would highly recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CCH3QMHFINC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZD6T83G#wasThisHelpful","R1CCH3QMHFINC2","A2PWCLHSY97X3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWCLHSY97X3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was my first go at a mnage themed book. Even though I am not a fan of mnage, I thought the author handled the subject matter in a way that made me re-think the idea of what mnage can mean for some people in very unique circumstances. I think what made this work for me was that the mnage was more of a healing process for this couple's marriage. Jake feels he is less of a man now that he is paralyzed. He misses his once very spontaneous sex life he enjoyed with his wife. He hates that she has suffered right along with him. He gets this crazy idea that he could feel whole again by bringing in a surrogate lover for his wife. He approaches his best friend Chad, self-proclaimed bachelor for life, to be said surrogate. Chad and Jessie were hesitant to comply, but finally agreed in the hopes they can somehow help Jake heal. The journey that they began started off with rules in place and emotions in check, right?? Well, not exactly... :) They learn fairly quickly that emotions cannot be controlled and things kind of spiral in a direction that none of them had planned.We've all heard the expression that two halves make a whole. Well, in this case three parts made a whole. They seemed to complete each other in a way that I thought was truly exceptional and for all of the right reasons.This story is mostly about the power of friendship and that sometimes there is room in your heart to love more than one person. It's also about sacrifice, taking chances, and going the distance for those you care about most.It was very engaging, and for someone who really isn't a fan of mnage, I thought that this particular story portrayed a unique situation in which mnage can sometimes help fill in the gaps between three people who were all broken in some way. They were stronger together.I really liked it and if you're curious about mnage then this is a great book to start with. Even though it does include some very steamy sex scenes, It is not written only for the sex! It's meant to make you stop and consider the possibility of both the consequences and beauty that can come as a result of such a relationship.Lots of room for discussion with a book like this... it had me on edge for the entire last half. I was hurting for all of them.Sexy... suspenseful... emotional... a pretty darn good read for a book I wasn't even sure I was going to like! Glad I took the chance and gave it a go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I7M1TZNJV02N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQFQGLM#wasThisHelpful","R2I7M1TZNJV02N","A2PWCLHSY97X3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWCLHSY97X3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using these for several weeks now and I have to say I am impressed by their durability in the kitchen.  I wasn't sure about the silicone and when I opened the box I was sure they would melt in high temperatures or hold stain.  But, they are quite sturdy, easy to clean and the blue is very pretty!  I have a blue themed kitchen so they look nice in my utensil holder I keep next to the stove.  I used these with spaghetti sauces, chocolate and other staining type food products, and I have washed them in the dishwasher multiple times and they still look new.  I am satisfied that this is a good product for the price.If I notice any changes in wear and tear over the next few months I will stop by and update my review.

"This is a very useful gadget to have in the kitchen when you want to chop up something quickly and you only need a small amount.  It has two blades that are easily switched out by popping them in and out of the top.  The container that catches the pieces slides easily in and out of the device.  One blade chops the food into small strips and the other chops into small squares.  It does not mince...  so, if you're looking for a garlic mincer then this is not what you want.  The grater works well enough for quick grating...  it's small so don't expect it to handle large tasks!We found this very useful for stir frying and making homemade pizza.  Those times when you sometimes want the slightly chunkier pieces of garlic.This is dishwasher safe and fairly easy to clean.  The only problem I had was that the top part of the lid gets food debris caught in it so I had to use a scrubber that can get in between the rows to dig it out.  Not a big deal but just throwing that out there for knowledge sake.I like this product and it will be useful for those small chopping jobs when you just don't feel like pulling out the cutting board and knife!I received a free sample of this product in exchange for my honest feedback.

"A few tears, a few giggles, a lot of sexual tension! I do love this series and I was happy to see Ryan open to finding happiness again. LOVE the kiddos... kids always make stories a little more interesting don't they?? :)My heart went out to Ryan as he struggles to take care of his three children on his own. But, he is a wonderful father and wants nothing more than to protect and safeguard his children. The death of his wife is surrounded by unfortunate circumstances that will always haunt him. I love how he always puts the children first, even putting his career on hold to find something that works around his now full time job as a single father.When Holly strolls into town to work on the movie being filmed, this kind of throws a kink in his plans. She wakes up longings and urges that has him struggling with feelings of guilt and worried about the consequences of bringing a new woman into his children's lives.Holly is very attracted to this rugged, sexy but simple living mountain man who sees her just as a regular person. Always being the center of attention as a successful actress doesn't always lead to trusting relationships. She sees something potentially real with Ryan for the first time in her life. What started out as a hello, leads to many nights of getting to know each other on his front porch steps. Except for one thing... Ryan is unaware of her fame. His need to protect his children just might become the one thing that keeps them apart.I loved the slow pace of this relationship. It made sense considering the emotional struggles of Ryan. It wouldn't be easy to open yourself up to a new relationship when the wounds of his loss were still so fresh. He had to make peace with his feelings of guilt.I loved the easy way the children accepted Holly. Sometimes we need to look at life through the eyes of a child before we can see what's right in front of us.Great installment to this series... great couple with great chemistry and of course we get to re-visit the Pine Harbour gang and get an update on how everyone is doing! Lots to look forward to in the future of Pine Harbour.This is a great series for fans of Small Town Romance who also like a little steam thrown in for good measure. Heartwarming stories that continue to win me over with each installment.You probably could read this as a stand alone but I would highly recommend starting with book one and going in order so that you know Ryan's back story and the History of his relationship with his wife.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7KHU992FIF78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W2SGZIE#wasThisHelpful","R7KHU992FIF78","A2PWCLHSY97X3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWCLHSY97X3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a very quick and easy read. Lots of laugh out loud moments but also very heartfelt and sweet. Kate and Trevor were a really great couple with some amazing sexual chemistry. At times I forgot that these two were older and in their thirties. They were behaving like teenagers when it came to the sex. I guess you're never to old to be young! :)Kate is a widow just trying to find her way after the loss of her husband. My heart went out to Kate and how she struggled with his absence from her life. It's a hard thing to overcome, losing someone you connected with so well. She eventually writes a best selling novel which leads her to a talk show where she meets the very famous and sexy rock star... Trax aka Trevor.They have an instant attraction that was very entertaining and amusing. They were an unlikely match being so completely opposite in every way, but at the same time so very perfect for each other.Kate is a small town, easy living girl who lives in quiet Montana. Trevor is the big city world traveler rock musician and his world is very loud and large. Being with Trevor is a bit overwhelming and Kate struggles with her need to stay in her safe haven of Montana or take a risk at second chance love. Being in the public eye all of the time is something she will have to accept if she wants to be with this guy and she's not sure if she can handle the pressure.Trevor really is an AMAZING guy... he has a dirty past but he doesn't lie about it. He is always upfront, honest and he is ready for something real. He's at that point in life where it's time to move on from the fan girls who only want him for his fame and fortune. My favorite part of the book was when he went to great lengths to show up in small town Montana to see her. It showed a softer and very real version of him that was hard not to love.Sometimes fate brings people together, and that is how I looked at this couple. They had both traveled down difficult roads and had arrived at a sort of crossroads where it was time to take a new path. They each needed something that the other person was able provide so they could take a chance at happiness. So, they both took a risk and took the road less traveled.One of my favorite characters was definitely Kellan. He was her fashion consultant and a bit of a stinker... lol... the Fashionista/Matchmaker! He was definitely a very colorful character that provided some very entertaining comic relief.My only complaint about the story really is that I was a little put off by all of the constant sex talk. It got to be a little over the top. It seemed like every conversation they had led to that and it was a little irritating.I also did not like the way Kate just couldn't seem to find a way to communicate with Trevor. Her feeling uncomfortable with the idea of moving on was justified, but leaving him hanging in the air all of the time was not okay. I felt like she over-reacted badly in the end. She's thirty years old... she knew that was bound to happen. Shutting him out without talking to him was cruel. Thank goodness Trevor was a patient and determined man.Other than those two minor grievances, this was overall a great story with great characters and a very enjoyable read.Yes, I would definitely read something else by this author... really, really good for a debut novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPRCU0TUDB2F6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1OK6U#wasThisHelpful","RPRCU0TUDB2F6","A2PWCLHSY97X3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWCLHSY97X3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a PR series that I've seen floating around for a while but just haven't found the time to start. So, when netgalley was offering copies of book one for review I thought... why not see what all of the fuss is about. :)I think what I liked most about the book is that it is a very unique storyline involving a new type of species I haven't read before anywhere else... The Psy. They reminded me of the Vulcan race in Star Trek. All logic and no emotion. The only difference is that they were not designed this way, they were taught to conform to this lifestyle through a movement called the Silence. Emotions and feelings are now considered ""flaws"" in this race and any sign of it means you will end up in rehabilitation. In other words, you are destined to become a vegetable because your mind will be stripped. It's a very cruel and confusing world that had me wondering why they went to such great lengths to eradicate emotions from their people. Sascha knows that she is flawed and has spent her entire life pouring all of her energy into masking them because for her rehabilitation is a fate worse than death.Sascha finds herself in the company of Lucas as business partners. An unusual partnership but a necessary one for him because they are desperate to find out who is killing changeling women and they are certain that the Psy are involved. He is hoping to gain entrance into the Psy-net through Sascha so they can gather information to help them find the killer.Meeting Lucas has sent Sascha spiraling into a world of feelings and emotions that she can no longer keep under control. Lucas introduces her to a world of passion and desire. She becomes a slave to the sensations she has always been denied. It also means certain death for her because this type of behavior is not tolerated in her world.There is a lot going on in this story between the Psy and their desire for control and power and the inner workings of all of the different changeling groups. So, not a book that you can breeze through quickly. You have to read it carefully so you are able to figure out this complicated Psy-net.My only complaint about this story is the direction things went when Lucas finally realizes that Sascha is his destined mate. He became a little bossy and overbearing for my liking and I was a little disappointed that this suddenly took precedence over finding the kidnapped changeling girl who they KNEW was being tortured. Not really the best time to be claiming your mate. Sascha was way too independent to cower to his demands so easily. So, I thought that was a little far fetched. I think I would have preferred a slower coming together of Sascha and Lucas and more time spent hunting for the kidnapped woman. It just took way too long for them to resolve the case. So, the last half of the book I found a bit frustrating. I lost a lot of love for Lucas at putting this young woman's life in danger and allowing her to be tortured longer than necessary because he was being all alpha male. I know, I know... he's a changeling and they are slaves to their instinct to protect their mate.. yada yada yada.. lol. It still bugged me...Having said that, I love the Psy World and yes, I'm definitely on board to continue with the series. Now I just have to find time to squeeze in 13 more installments because this series has been out for a while. Wish me luck! :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35YHNYGLYM5MI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0023EF9H0#wasThisHelpful","R35YHNYGLYM5MI","A2PWCLHSY97X3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWCLHSY97X3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""They say time heals all wounds. But does it close the gaps too? Maybe it can. Maybe in a year it turns an eight-year time gap into dust. Maybe it turns a girl who didn't know what she wanted into someone who became certain. Maybe it turns twenty-one stolen kisses into endless given ones.""And that pretty much entails the struggles that Kennedy and Noah are having with this sweet, forbidden, beautifully written romance!  This is probably my favorite Lauren Blakely book to date! I loved this story so much. The author pegged the conflicted emotions of a 17 yr old young woman perfectly. What a conflicting age, anyone remember being seventeen?? :)This is the first time I've read anything outside of LB's erotica series. I will admit that I was worried that I wouldn't like it, but she has now proven to me that she is indeed a beautiful and talented story teller.Kennedy is a girl who has grown up surrounded by shame and lies because of a mother who is in denial of her sex addiction. She would use Kennedy as her scapegoat and it is now beginning to weigh heavily on her conscience. It has given her a warped sense of love and whether or not it is actually something people can truly have. In fact, Kennedy is obsessed with love. She looks for signs of it everywhere. Her collection of hearts was very symbolic of her hopes and dreams that love can be something tangible and real. This was my favorite part of the book. It became a sweet and romantic game between her and Noah. I loved it... :)Noah works for Kennedy's mother. They have a very close relationship. His closeness to the family is what sparked the seeds of interest between him and Kennedy. He never set out to fall in love with her. But, the heart wants what it wants! They were perfect for each other. Noah wasn't blind to the age gap, in fact, he was very conflicted about it, but she completed him in ways he never thought possible. Sometimes time is your enemy. And, these two just fell in love at the worst possible moment in both of their lives.Noah really was an outstanding guy. He never pushed Kennedy. He was always very patient and understanding but at the same time hopeful they could find a way to love each other openly and freely. My heart went out to both of them. I was rooting for them and hoping they could find a way to be together. But, at the same time I was thinking... ""She's only seventeen!""... so, yes I was totally empathizing with Kennedy's father. What parent wouldn't be concerned about an 8 yr age gap when your daughter is only 17. But, love is love and it doesn't care about timing.Kennedy's relationship with her mother really got to me. Even though she hated what her mother was doing, she still loved her. But, she could no longer allow herself to be defined by her mother's actions. She had to make a very hard choice at the end and I was very proud of her for the decisions she made. Sometimes, you just have to save yourself.I'm not sure why this book spoke to me so much. Perhaps it's because I have 3 daughters of my own... or, maybe it stirred up a lot of familiar emotions. It's kind of hard to put into words. But, this book will definitely be going into my top favorite reads of the year so far. It's a book I plan to read again and again...","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24EPV163D174H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQSOQMK#wasThisHelpful","R24EPV163D174H","A2PWCLHSY97X3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWCLHSY97X3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is such a fun and clever series... lots of giggles... I really liked book one, but I liked this second installment even better than the first. Aphrodite cracks me up... Love Goddess aka Vampire killer!Aphrodite and Loki make a really fun couple as Gods trying to cope with living in modern society. Aphrodite is now a love columnist and Loki is working as a supernatural Private Investigator. Since Gods are no longer worshipped in modern times, they do not have the same powers as they once had. Loki's big plan is to solve crimes for those in need in exchange for loyalty so he can gain back some of his lost powers. Aphrodite, still pretty well known as the goddess of love, isn't as powerful as she used to be but still has more power than Loki. He hates that he needs her but what choice does he have?? They have a very lustful relationship that is also quite entertaining!This is very well written, definitely entertaining and has me looking forward to the next installment... can' wait to see what kind of trouble these two find next...","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A7BIX8NFGVEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFKJ8F4#wasThisHelpful","R3A7BIX8NFGVEB","A2PWCLHSY97X3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWCLHSY97X3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful digital scale!  5 stars for appearance....  looks really sharp in my bathroom.  :)My favorite feature of this scale are the three weight settings:  Pounds, Stones or Kilograms...  I've never had a scale before that calculated stones so that's a really nice feature. This has a power save feature as well...  it will automatically power off when not in use for longer battery life.  The scale will give you an error prompt of Lo when it's time to replace with 2xCR2032 batteries.  Does come with a warranty as well.This is made of tempered glass which makes it very attractive but also more delicate than a metal scale.  So, handle with care!  We've been using it for 2 weeks and it's holding up well so far.  If you were to drop it on hard tile I imagine it would crack.My only negative about this product is that I can't find a way to calibrate the scale.  I generally use a dumbbell to measure the accuracy of the weight.  On my old one, we have a way to adjust when it's a little off.  Can't do that with this one.  It's about .4 higher than it should be...  so, I just have to know to subtract .4 from the weight.  This might seem a little petty but some people really need an accurate weight if they are keeping up with their weight loss or gain.Overall, this is a great product and I would recommend it.I received a free sample of this product in exchange for my honest feedback.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16LFYZRCD36WL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SNLZ2PQ#wasThisHelpful","R16LFYZRCD36WL","A2PWCLHSY97X3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWCLHSY97X3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I collect tea pots...  I have them in all shapes and sizes.  There are some tea pots you buy for every day use and others you pull out for special occasions.  This would definitely fall into the special occasion only category because it is very delicate.  The lid does not lock in place so you do need to hold the lid when pouring so that it doesn't fall off and break.  The infuser that goes inside the pot is also glass so it is important to handle this pot carefully through the entire process of brewing the tea.It's a BEAUTIFUL tea pot...  I have another one almost exactly like it but it's very plain compared to this one.  I've attached a picture of the two of them together so you can see the difference in size and appearance.  This is a perfect pot for the flowering teas because you can actually see the tea brewing.  And, because this is such a pretty pot it's nice to use when you have a single guest over.  It measures out to around 2 cups of water....  so it will fill either one large mug of tea or two small.So, a lovely item to have...  but, not ideal for every day use.I did receive a free sample of this product in exchange for my honest feedback!If you're looking for something sturdy and long lasting for every day use, I would not recommend this pot.

"I had no idea what to expect when I decided to dive into this book... the title definitely makes you think... oh boy! But, what I got was something really different from other books I've read lately. Hailey, our heroine, is a little chubby and doesn't always feel comfortable in her own skin. She has a crazy wealthy family that makes her life difficult and she doesn't really fit in with their reckless lifestyle. Due to unfortunate events involving her self absorbed sister she finds herself under the watch of a bodyguard that she hates but is also undeniably attracted too. Utter misery right?? Or, not... I don't think she knows how she feels.Cole is a man that I can already tell is a bit damaged... he is drawn to the very sexy and curvy Hailey even though he knows she is off limits. Not just because she's the daughter of a client, but because she's a woman that he might not be able to walk away from and he doesn't want to see her get hurt. I get the feeling that he doesn't feel as if he's good enough for her.These two have gotten off to a shaky start together but I find myself really hoping they can find a way to sort out their differences!They have a an unpleasant relationship outside the bedroom, but when they do come together... we see a side of Cole that just makes me melt and want for more. I already love this guy...Anyway, this story took me by surprise and I really liked it... a lot...This is part one of a three part serial... can't wait for the next installment!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QWI60J6NK4B7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZJWF2Q#wasThisHelpful","R2QWI60J6NK4B7","A2PWCLHSY97X3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWCLHSY97X3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a novella... short & fast paced... it gives us a little romance, a little steam, a little action and a nice fulfilling HEA. This was a nice addition to the series but I'm not as big a fan of the shifters as I am of the Elves, Demons and Hunters. This short addition is focused solely on Cavanaugh and Eloise and their coming together finally after 5 long years of separation. Most of the book is them traveling back to his village and re-connecting with each other as they make the long journey home. The action comes in at the very end when Cavanaugh finally challenges the Alpha!I love this series immensely and I'm anxiously awaiting for the upcoming novels such as Taken by a Dragon and Bleu's story... yep... I need those like right now!","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28V683GEXFB3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RS3GF9W#wasThisHelpful","R28V683GEXFB3P","A2PWCLHSY97X3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWCLHSY97X3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Felicity Heaton... you have made my day! I am so excited to head into the dragon shifter world now... :) Big surprise in this one for fans of the series! Nope, not gonna' tell... but I am giggly excited about it!Cait is one delectable hellcat and unfortunately she's lured the attention of an unwanted male. She happens upon Owen in a bar after a slim getaway and she hires him to help rid her of this pesky stalker. It doesn't take long for them to realize that their attraction to each other is definitely more than physical. It didn't seem like a match that would be able to work at first with Owen being human, but... he had a few surprises and so did she. They both got a little more than they bargained for in this relationship but by the end I don't think anyone was complaining.As with all of Felicity's books you get a story that is edgy, action packed, steamy and full of a little surprises. Add to that some very creative characters and there is always something to look forward to in future installments.This book definitely sets the stage for the future and it's always nice to see a guest appearance or two of some of our favorite characters in the series. Can we just make it a mandatory requirement that Bleu makes an appearance in all of the books?? Yep, I always like it when he shows up.The book I've been really, really waiting for is up next!

"This was hot, steamy and oh so delicious! Great start to this new erotica series by Scarlett Avery... :)I love the relationship that is slowly developing between these two. They seem to be a perfect match for each other and they have great, great chemistry together. Ciara certainly got more than what she bargained for with this casual encounter! The gorgeous, wealthy, dirty talking Nicolaj definitely won her over in the passion department. Now we'll have to see if he can win her heart and break down Ciara's emotional barriers. He has his work cut out for him if he wants to win her trust. I have a feeling that he isn't going to give up. I think she made an impact on him that he just can't walk away from.

"What an amazing and beautiful story... loved every word! This is one of those books that makes you stop and think about all of the little moments in your life that matter most. Moments that we usually take for granted until they are gone. I knew this was going to be an emotional read. Yes, I definitely shed a few tears. But, it was also surprisingly suspenseful. The dreams/visions Kate was having with her deceased husband had me on edge and quickly turning the pages. What did they mean??Kate lost her husband Patrick twelve years ago. In an attempt to finally move on with her life she decides to settle into a relationship with Dan with the nudging encouragement of her friends and family. She begins having very vivid dreams of an alternate life with her deceased husband Patrick... the life she was intended to have. The dreams are upsettingly painful and real. Kate found herself wanting to stay in this alternate world where everything was playing out as it should have. Or, at least that's what she thought. These dreams reveal situations and truths to her that would be impossible for her to know and forces her to take a closer look at the life she is presently living. Kate finds herself questioning everything about her present life and whether or not she is doing what would make her feel happy and fulfilled.I loved how the author so beautifully tied the dreams with reality. The progression of the suspense was perfect and had me guessing all the way to the end of the book. And, the way everything came full circle in the end was utter perfection!My favorite part of the story was the inclusion of the silver dollars. The way the silver dollars ended up being one of the biggest signs of all in the end made my heart happy. Don't think I'll ever look at a silver dollar again without thinking about this book. It was so touching...This is a book I would definitely recommend to anyone who likes to read stories that touch on the emotions and makes you look at life with a new set of eyes. My favorite lesson I learned from this book??Sometimes bumps in the road lead you to better places. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDE8AUMPCDAWT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWTWM70#wasThisHelpful","RDE8AUMPCDAWT","A2PWCLHSY97X3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWCLHSY97X3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Erotica by Lauren Blakely always puts a big smile on my face. I've loved every book in this series but this one is definitely my absolute favorite!  This is a perfect choice for fans of friends to lovers storylines.  Nate and Casey are so amazing together... the chemistry between these two was extremely erotic and steamy!Casey is an Alpha Female business woman... she knows what she wants and goes after it but she has a little trouble in the romance department. She took a hit on her self confidence in the bedroom by an ex. Having decided she needed to learn to be more submissive and give up control, she turns to her best friend Nate for guidance and lessons.Nate, having been burned by love in the past is perfectly content with his playboy lifestyle. He's always been fiercely attracted to Casey but never crossed that line due their strong friendship. But, he simply can't turn down an opportunity to be with her, even if it is just temporary.Each time they come together, the emotions and connection that they feel for each other gets stronger and stronger. The author did such a beautiful job describing their intimate connections, feelings and emotions.  I could feel their passion, need and love for each other so strongly.  For me this was so much more than just erotica...  it was a beautiful love story as well.I really liked that Nate helped Casey to understand that she should never change who she is for anyone else. I loved his character immensely... a lover of animals, a juggler, a babysitter! But most of all... a man who knows how to love a woman with all his heart. He's my new favorite ideal man!There is one scene in the book that I have gone back and read several times because I loved it so much... I have to share it... it is the best kissing scene I've read in a while: (view spoiler)The kiss told her so much... that he was sorry for being late, that he'd missed her for the last several hours he'd been without her, and that this was the best part of his day. Hers too. This kiss was air, it was breath, and it was her heart on her sleeve. In the soft, slow sweep of his lips, in the hungry sighs they both made, in an instant, this kiss was everything. Her heel popped up. There it was. The final proof that no one had ever kissed her like he did, and no one probably ever would.**sigh** I heart you Lauren Blakely... :)))Do I recommend?? Of course I do...","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J8BGXVFO27GX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RXZG91Y#wasThisHelpful","R3J8BGXVFO27GX","A2PWCLHSY97X3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWCLHSY97X3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Chef Cuts four pack contains regular steak, cracked pepper chipotle steak, smoked turkey and honey bbq chicken.  I'm not the biggest fan of jerky around, but all four varieties were pretty tasty.  The jerky had a nice chew and was not leathery like jerky can be.  You know you were eating the cut of meat you chose and not some amalgamation of mystery meat.  The cracked pepper chipotle had a nice kick of heat and was the most interesting flavor.  The honey bbq chicken was the least successful as it was was more honey than bbq but it still was flavorful.  This is a pricey buy for what amounts to 10 ounces of jerky, but the quality is high and flavor is there.

"This Stainmaster 5x8 carpet is a quality area rug with a pleasing color scheme that makes it easy to incorporate into most home designs.

"Former Village Voice restaurant critic Robert Sietsema has seen food trends come and go through his decades of covering the food scene in New York City.  In his new book, New York in a Dozen Dishes, he distills the city down into those twelve dishes (plus one iconic NYC dessert) and shows how they've evolved from mainly ethnic kitchens into mainstream foods beloved by everyone from the blue collar outer borough types to the hipsters that proliferate the hot spots of the city.  Some choices are obvious.  It would be impossible and sac religious to not have pizza and pastrami as two of the dishes and Mr. Sietsema details the rise of these dishes from their Italian and Jewish neighborhoods to being two of the dominate staples of the NYC food scene that attract people from all over the world to come and try. Mothers are not so obvious like Masala Dosa and Cuy, but Mr. Sietsema shows why they are no less important the the city's culinary backbone than the more recognizable selections.  Each chapter in addition to giving the history of the food provides a dozen or so of the best places to get the dish in the city as well as a recipe for the dish.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW08RBNLXTH93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544454316#wasThisHelpful","RW08RBNLXTH93","A1GN8UJIZLCA59","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GN8UJIZLCA59?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Lifeproof Fre case for the iPad mini is certainly a functional case.  It says it can go two meters deep under water and still protect your mini.  I haven't tested that aspect of its protection, but I'll take their word on it. What I can say is that it tightly secures around the mini and is clear on both sides of the case so if you want to put a skin on the mini, it will remain visible while in the case.  The case isn't too bulky and the touchscreen works perfectly underneath the protective cover.  The reason I'm giving this only three stars is that it is extremely pricey.  While you can take the cover in the water, the rain, snow, etc., I don't think most people have a great use of an iPad in those conditions.  So unless you need to use your mini in those conditions, you can find a cover that will provide similar protection against every day normal use for much less.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FIQ6E9XSFCKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q543KL6#wasThisHelpful","R2FIQ6E9XSFCKY","A1GN8UJIZLCA59","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GN8UJIZLCA59?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ne-Yo's sixth studio album Non-Fiction is a disjointed affair.  There are some great songs but a few too many clunkers to make this album anything better than just okay. ""Integrity"" is a simply gorgeous track with an impassioned vocal that soars right out of your speakers.  ""One More"" could be a great song, but the constant repeating of the title underneath the singing sinks it.  ""Who's Taking You Home"" is a solid track and ""Time Of Our Lives"" has an absolutely pumping beat but is sunk by the horrendous Pitbull supplying his annoying ""rap"" to the track.  ""Coming With You"" a solid thumping beat and slick groove, ""Making It Easy"" has a simple drum beat that gives a stark backbone to the track and ""Money Can't Buy"" is decent track with a sweet vocal.

"Released almost four years to the day of their last release The King Is Dead, The Decemberists return with the glorious What A Terrible World, What A Beautiful World.  The album finds the band taking their folk rock sound into a 70's AM pop direction.  There are tons of great hooks and a lushness littered throughout the album.  ""Calvary Captain"" employs a Chicago style white r&b sound in the best possible sense.  The sultry tongue in cheek ode to cunnilingus ""Philomena"" simply soars with a gorgeous orchestration.  ""Make You Better"" starts off with a subtle guitar riff and then explodes into a powerful blast of piano pounding and soaring vocals.  ""The Wrong Year"" is propelled by a sweet accordion fill and a jangly guitar.  ""Carolina Low"" has the dark and somber folk rock sound the band is known for and it is deep and rich. ""Anti-Summersong"" has a country fair vibe with fiddles and a harmonica break and ""Easy Come, Easy Go"" has a wickedly cool reverb guitar that punctuates the track.  ""Mistral"" floats in with an airy keyboard and piercing guitar.  ""12/17/12"" is an acoustic guitar and harmonica track that sounds like it would have fit in nicely on Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska album.  The album closes out on a strong and uplifting note with the anthem like ""A Beginning Song"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JP1Y9GZXK5LX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P33GA7Q#wasThisHelpful","R1JP1Y9GZXK5LX","A1GN8UJIZLCA59","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GN8UJIZLCA59?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wallflower is a covers album from Diana Krall.  Ms. Krall's voice is in fine form and she does a great job with the tracks.  The problem with the album is that too many of the tracks are more or less Ms. Krall singing piano ballads drenched with strings that don't stray too far from the originals.  Where she excels is when she steps away from the color-by-numbers arragements.  The best track is The Eagles' ""I Can't Tell You Why"" in which she turns it into a smokey, jazzy, samba flavored number.  The song's original singer and co-author Timothy B. Schmit adds a luscious backing vocal that sends the song over the top.  Another song that has a nice arrangement (although it is almost sunk by too many syrup strings) is her piano driven reading of Crowded House's 80's classic ""Don't Dream It's Over"".  Her duet with Michael Buble on Gilbert O'Sullivan's ""Alone Again (Naturally)"" could benefit from a better arrangement, but hearing their two voices playing off each other is a treat.  Her other duet with Bryan Adams on Randy Newman's ""Feels Like Home"" is interesting because their voices are so similar that Ms. Krall could easily be the female Bryan Adams.  It'd be great to hear her tackle anything off of Cuts Like A Knife or Reckless.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJZ54N33F4U18/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N11MX1Y#wasThisHelpful","RJZ54N33F4U18","A1GN8UJIZLCA59","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GN8UJIZLCA59?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bill Kreutzmann has been part of one of the most famous and well-known rock groups and cultural icons The Grateful Dead for 50 years.  Despite that fact, he is virtually unrecognizable and unknown to anyone other than a Deadhead.  He was the original Dead drummer, but Mickey Hart is the name that probably first comes to mind when you think Dead percussion.  With all that Mr. Kreutzmann seems like an unlikely candidate for a book, but his upcoming book Deal is a pleasant treat.  Playing with the band has its perks and Mr. Kreutzmann takes you on the Dead's long strange trip from the Kesey acid tests, to the Haight Ashbury scene and the summer of love to Monteray to Woodstock to Eyrope to the Great Pyramids of Egypt and beyond.  Mr. Kreutzmann tells his story in a way that even though he is the main voice, it's like his he removed from it all.  There are tons of great antidotes like when he and Jerry Garcia are scuba diving in Hawaii in 1980 and while down about twenty feet under the water a woman approaches Mr. Garcia and motions him for an autograph.  Mr. Kreutzmann knows he was very fortunate to be part of such a phenomenon like the Dead and his laid back, hippie attitude permeates the book and makes it a fun and enjoyable read.  If you're not a fan of the Dead, then this book is probably not for you, but any Deadhead should out Deal on their must read list.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BMTCFZXXDQOM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250033799#wasThisHelpful","R3BMTCFZXXDQOM","A1GN8UJIZLCA59","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GN8UJIZLCA59?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Birdman is a bizarre, challenging and ultimately rewarding film.  Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is the real star of the movie.  He shot the film in essentially one long shot. This gives the film a claustrophobic feel like the walls of the theater where the majority of the film takes place are closing in around you.  All the awards and praise Michael Keaton's performance as a washed up former action film star trying to stage a comeback and become relevant again are more than justified and deserved.  Mr. Keaton bares his soul and the slow unhinging of his character is fascinatwing and engrossing.  Edward Norton is also excellent as a pompous, self-important stage actor brought in at the last minute to the play.  He makes the character completely unlikeable and that's the point.  Emma Stone is also superb as Mr. Keaton's daughter who provides a slap in the face to his stage dreams.  Birdman is dark, deep and profoundly weird.  You'll find yourself wondering what the heck just happened but you will walk away from the film knowing you just watched an expertly crafted piece of art.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BXOF3JI50J03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RO49JEI#wasThisHelpful","R1BXOF3JI50J03","A1GN8UJIZLCA59","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GN8UJIZLCA59?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Intermatic combo pack contains two automatic timers for lights, one for inside and one for outside.  The timers are slightly flimsy in their construction, but are sturdy enough to get by.  The biggest problem with the timers is how you set them.  Inside of having a digital display, it is done by rotating the dial to set the time of day (you basically can only set on the hour or half-hour since anything else is just a guess as there are no other marks).  Then you stick two clips, one into the time you want the lights to go on and another to have them shut off.

"(500) Days Of Summer is an angst filled ""love"" story that annoyingly flashes back and forward in no discernible order.  Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) works as a greeting card writer in Los Angeles despite the fact that he has a degree in architecture which is his true passion. He believes in true love to his core and that there is a soulmate for everyone. One day a new worker at the company, Summer (Zooey Deschanel), catches his eye and he is completely smitten.  They start dating even though Summer is the exact opposite of Tom and hates putting labels on relationships and doesn't believe true love exists.  They eventually break up after watching The Graduate and Tom sinks into a deep depression.  Summer quite the company, but they see each other again at a wedding and they share a dance.  Summer invites Tom to a party where he thinks they will rekindle their romance, but it turns out to be an engagement party for Summer.  They then again meet at Tom's favorite park and Summer, who is now married, confesses that Tom was right about true love and that she didn't feel that spark with him.  The whole 180 degree turn Summer has and the jumping into a quick marriage doesn't ring true with the set up of her character.  It seems ridiculous a commitment-phobe like her would suddenly not only find rue love which she didn't think exists, but then just get married all of a sudden.  The movie ends on day 500 with Tom waiting in the reception area of an architecture firm and striking up a conversation with a fellow interviewee (Minka Kelly) who he then ends up asking out for coffee.  She at first says she has plans to meet someone afterwards, but then changes her mind and accepts.  Her name is ridiculously Autumn.  The film starts off by telling you it isn't a love story but a story about love.  It is an interesting concept, but you never really buy Tom and Summer as a couple since Summer always seems to have one foot out the door.  Mr. Gordon-Levitt saves the film with his nuanced performance and it has an excellent soundtrack.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTN16DK91KUF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UV4XUQ#wasThisHelpful","RTN16DK91KUF2","A1GN8UJIZLCA59","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GN8UJIZLCA59?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel is another winner in his impressive directing cannon.  Like much of his previous work the film is a dark comedy.  Told in a double flashback from a writer (Tom Wilkinson) in 1985 who remembers how he learned the story of his book (same as the film's title) from the former lobby boy Zero now owner of the hotel in 1968 (F. Murray Abram as Zero, Jude Law as the writer) of his adventures with the former concierge (Ralph Fiennes) in 1932.  It is a caper involving murder, theft of artwork, escape from prison and the impending war.  The rest of the cast is made up of cameos from the usual Wes Anderson troupe including Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Edward Norton, Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody as well as Harvey Keitel, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum and Tilda Swinton among others.  Mr. Fiennes basically carries the film on his shoulders appearing in the majority of the scenes.  He pompous, effite and absolutely brilliant as M. Gustave.  Newcomer Tony Revolori is not quite up to Mr. Fineness high standards, but he does a nice job in his first major role.  Mr. Anderson's films are definitely an acquired taste and if you don't like his previous work then this one will not likely change your opinion of his work.  But for devotees, The Grand Budapest Hotel vaults to the top of his best of list right beside Rushmore.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R113IN21QWHS36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JAQJNN0#wasThisHelpful","R113IN21QWHS36","A1GN8UJIZLCA59","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GN8UJIZLCA59?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sirens is a comedy series from executive producer Denis Leary.  Mr. Leary starred in the long running Rescue Me and like that show, Sirens also follows a branch of public service, EMT's.

Johnny is the leader of the group and is in a relationship with Theresa (Jessica McNamee), Hank is gay and loves to move from guy to guy and Brian is new to the team and is struggling to find his place.  While there is some on the job humor, 95% of the jokes revolve around sex.

While the season does not deliver the consistent laughs of other seasons, it is still funnier than most shows on television.  The season revolves around the planning for and the wedding of Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cam (Eric Stonestreet). There is also a trip with the entire family to Australia.  While this is the main storyline, the real star of the season is Ty Burrell as Phil.  He constantly is saying things that make his look like a fool and the physical comedy he shows between getting smashed in the face again with a radio controlled airplane, stung by a jellyfish, having an allergic reaction to vegemite and getting punched in the face by a kangaroo will have you rolling on the floor in hysterics.  He won a second and well deserved Emmy for the season.  Another big change is that Manny (Rico Rodriguez) and Luke (Nolan Gould) start high school and both of their voices have changed.  Luke's change is much more drastic and some of the things he does aren't as cute in a growing teen as they were when he was younger.  Overall, there are some bunker episodes in the season, but the show still elicits major laughs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVPJS2XV11VP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FGEO4AC#wasThisHelpful","RVPJS2XV11VP4","A1GN8UJIZLCA59","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GN8UJIZLCA59?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Alan Light starts off the book by explaining how he was a huge fan of Prince's back in his high school/college days in Ohio, but he doesn't turn Let's Go Crazy: Prince & the Making of Purple Rain into a fanboy account of the film and album.  He offers a measured eye while getting into the heart and soul of both the film and the album.  While he fleshes out the story by offering up some details about Prince's days growing up in Minneapolis and his career leading up to Purple Rain and his time after it, the bulk of the book examines what went into getting the film made and the music recorded.  He offers many insights from the cast and crew of the film as well as the Revolution, but since Prince is notoriously closed lipped to the media, he can only offer archival interviews he conducted with the man.  This does not take away one bit from the fine job Mr. Light does in crafted a story about an artist as he made the leap from arising talent into a mega star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JV14ADAGUHVR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476776725#wasThisHelpful","R1JV14ADAGUHVR","A1GN8UJIZLCA59","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GN8UJIZLCA59?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Nine Lives of Christmas stars former Superman Brandon Routh as a playboy firefighter named Zachary who loathes commitment and Kimberly Sustand as a veterinarian student named Marilee who has sworn off love until her schooling is complete.  The story kicks into gear when a stray cat named Ambrose takes root in the house that Zachary is restoring to flip.  He at first wants no part of the cat, but they end up becoming attached.  He meets Marilee at a supermarket where she helps him pick out food for Ambrose.  Their paths cross again when it turns out that Marilee works at Zachary's self-absorbed model girlfriend's father's pet store and the girlfriend has her father fire Marilee because she feels she disrespected her.  Zachary finds out about this and tries to go to apologize to Marilee who is in the midst of getting evicted from her apartment due to her cat Queen as it is a no pets apartment.  Zachary invites Marilee to stay in his spare apartment and she reluctantly accepts.  Through a series of shared moments, the two build a bond, but Zachary is loathe to admit it to himself.  A misunderstanding at a Christmas party leads Marilee to move out setting up a reunion on Christmas day where Zachary professes his love atop a fire truck.  The film is mindless fun.  Although it is set during Christmastime, the film is really a straight rom-com with some brief holiday moments sprinkled in to create a seasonal setting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NPTJVO2EYYPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PTGRZJE#wasThisHelpful","R1NPTJVO2EYYPV","A1GN8UJIZLCA59","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GN8UJIZLCA59?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Pilot episode of Parks & Recreation does not give a clear indication of what the show would become.  The show was created by The Office producer Greg Daniels.  The show is presented in the same mockumentary style as The Office and it is clear they are trying to make the Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) character into the female Michael Scott (Steve Carrell) from the other show.  Leslie is the deputy director of the Parks & Rec department in Pawnee, Indiana.  She does have some of the characteristics like her complete love of the town of Pawnee and government work that she will show throughout the series, but she is presented as being somewhat of a dimwit and is mocked and ridiculed by her co-workers instead of being beloved.  Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari) is not the complete baller he will become, but he does love the flash.  He also just mocks Leslie every chance he gets.  Parks & Rec director Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) hates the government, but is more buttoned up and wears suits.  Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones) is the most consistent character in terms of how she evolve during the series, while her boyfriend Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt) is not a lovable dolt, but more of a conniver taking advantage of Ann's caretaking will she is nursing him with two broken legs.  The basis of the first season's episodes (and into the second), the pit is introduced at the first of many town forums.  The town engineer Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider) is the Jim character on the show, the calm voice of reason amid all the craziness.  He is too laid back and a little boring, but is kept around as Leslie still burns a torch for him after they had slept together five years before.  You have to stick with the show because it evolves into the funniest show on tv, but it is lucky it survived the first several episodes.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFMLK15UX8ZGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0091C5P8A#wasThisHelpful","RFMLK15UX8ZGL","A1GN8UJIZLCA59","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GN8UJIZLCA59?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I recently bought a RotorX Raiju micro brushless hexacopter (no, I'm not speaking gibberish, I swear!). I have eight 3S 950mAh packs for it and charging them up individually would take all evening. With this, I just have to make sure that all 8 are at relatively the same charge level and off I go, filling them up at the charger's max current (IMAX B6AC), while each pack charges at only about .5 amps (or 0.5C, in my case). All 8 batteries finish up in about an hour and a half, vs 6 hours or more if I did them individually. And at 0.5C, you can be sure that the packs are not being damaged by being charged too quickly. A precaution I'd highly recommend is to make VERY sure that all your packs are within 0.1V of each other, and then plug this board into the charger (so the banana plug leads aren't exposed and able to short out), then plug all packs into this board and let them sit to self-equalize a while before starting the charge cycle. This will help smooth out any differences between the cells and make for a better and safer charge. And, of course, stay nearby while your packs are charging and keep an eye on them. Any sign of overheating or swelling, and be sure to stop the process, disconnect everything, and take it outside or somewhere safe until you can figure out what to do next.The board itself is of very good quality, and has a nice baseplate to help isolate everything. The only thing I've noticed is that the 3S indicator LED only works occasionally. It's not really a dealbreaker of any sort, since I already know that I'm charging 3S and not 2S, but it would be nicer if the light worked. It doesn't impact the function of the board in any way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FM4Z4FG9CSFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBAU5FQ#wasThisHelpful","R2FM4Z4FG9CSFX","A360VP3RBMJFDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A360VP3RBMJFDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this because with all the Lipo batteries I have, I really NEED one to be just a little safer. I read various reviews and settled on this one for value vs price. I kind of wish I got one of the slightly more expensive ones, honestly. The construction could use a little improvement, as the liner under the ""loop"" portion of the velcro section isn't folded over on itself before sewing. This means that the more you open and close the bag, the more wear this takes, and eventually the liner unravels and starts to let go of the velcro - leaving a frayed loose edge. The liner is some sort of fiberglass type fabric, so these frayed loose edges will constantly shed small bits of itself. Whenever I interact with this bag, these little microscopic bits of fiberglass get embedded in my hands and forearms. It's itchy and slightly painful, and they're too small to be seen and removed. I just have to wait for them to fall out, or get scraped off or whatever happens to them.In summary, it works for now, but I'm on the lookout for a better solution.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FXO3EMHH2O6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MO6XLPE#wasThisHelpful","R3FXO3EMHH2O6P","A360VP3RBMJFDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A360VP3RBMJFDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this cable and added banana plugs to it to make an iMAX B6AC compatible adapter cable for my Hubsan batteries. I got sick of charging them one at a time, and went looking for something to help speed things up. I found a 3x adapter like this, but even charging 3 at a time wasn't quite enough. I examined the wiring on the 3x adapter and figured out how to modify this one to work. All you have to do is add a red banana plug/wire to the pin where only 1 red wire connects to it, and a black banana plug/wire to the pin with only 1 black wire. All of the 5 pins in the center have 1 red and 1 black wire going to them, so the pins I'm talking about are on the far end of the connector from each other. The charger will see the pack connected to the negative-most end of the plug (with the black banana plug) as Cell 1, and the pack on the positive-most end as Cell 6. It's not terribly important, but I stuck little number stickers on each Hubsan connector so I could tell the difference. I of course used heat shrink to cover the bare wires, and then a larger piece of heat shrink to sort of fuse all the wires together to have a convenient place to pull when removing it from the charger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZS40GK5MTOKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q7IOWYE#wasThisHelpful","R1ZS40GK5MTOKQ","A360VP3RBMJFDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A360VP3RBMJFDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice little addition to my quadcopter gear. I use this to make sure a surface is level before I set my quadcopters down to calibrate the accelerometers.

When I'm in the field I'll set my hardcase down on the ground, check its level, and shim it up with whatever small bits of stick and stone happen to be around. I have also used this to find the one table surface in my house that's naturally level, and I now use that table every time I need to calibrate.

"We recently upgraded our work phones from the iPhone 4 to the iPhone 6. I've been using Supcase cases on my Galaxy S4 for almost 2 years now (I say cases with an S because I bought them in at least 3 different color variants for the same phone). I'm happy to finally have a work phone that can also use a Supcase model. Fitment is very nice, and the construction seems to be very clean. The design is the standout feature as with most of their cases. The phone looks very sleek and modern with this case, and yes, they improve even on Apple's already sleek and modern design.The black outer ring seems to be either a new material from earlier cases, or it's the same material that is molded in another way. The end result is that it's a much more matte finish than my S4, and this gives noticeably better grip. The red ring inside that is a nice touch, and it's nice to see that they used a good deep red this time (One of the S4 cases I ordered was red with a black border, but it was kind of a pink-y orange-y red, and really wasn't what I was looking for. Yes, I'm overly picky about reds :D  There is a nice bezel on the front of the case, which helps protect the screen if you set the phone face-down. There's also a bit of a bezel on the back, which helps improve grip.Anyways, I'm glad I got this case, and look forward to using it for the next few years.

"This is my first ""real"" coffee grinder. I had one years ago that was basically just a like a blender and would just chop everything up until you turned it off. No consistency in size or anything. The Hario takes care of that, and makes all the grounds come out roughly the same size. At first I thought the handle was way too long, but then I realized that you're intended to move both hands in counter-rotating circles. This speeds things up considerably, and the extra handle length ensures that you have all the torque you need.Grinding the morning coffee can get a little tedious and feels a little bit like torture (Why do I have to do all this work when I'm at my weakest - before coffee??!?!) but I'm slowly training myself to just sort of tune out until it's done.I use a Bonavita coffee maker with a #4 cone filter, and I've found that the stock grind settings work quite well.

The radio I'm using is a Devo 8S and has a folding antenna. If your antenna does not fold you might have some trouble making it fit. The foam inserts work well, but I'm looking for a good supply of gray non-pluckable foam so I can make some real cutouts for all my stuff. The pluck foam works okay but does not hold up well over time (this is true of any of that kind of stuff I think) - the neighbors of the cubes you've already plucked get loosened up from use and will eventually fall out. All that aside, this thing is doing a great job of protecting my little gadgets. I'd say this is every bit as tough as a Pelican case, but at a much better price. I'll probably pick up another one for my new 250-class quad, but since it's so much larger there's no way I'll be able to keep both it and the transmitter in there. That's fine, I'll just carry two cases.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R198Y62IC2J8OF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008HQ6PY4#wasThisHelpful","R198Y62IC2J8OF","A360VP3RBMJFDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A360VP3RBMJFDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These were definitely not genuine Parrot Rolling Spider props. I bought a set of red and a set of white from another seller, and they were genuine. They took a while to arrive and were considerably more expensive, but I think it was worth it. These are imitations and while they look good, have one big drawback. I lost one of the original ones and replaced it with one of these. I was flying my micro H via FPV and suddenly the quad just fell out of the sky. I wandered over to where it crashed and noticed that this replacement prop had come off. I located it and reattached it, and launched back into the sky. I hadn't made it 10 feet before a heard a faint ""fzzzp!"" noise and saw that exact same prop come flying off yet again. I repeated this several times, and it was the same each time. The prop just would not stay on the motor shaft. So while these look great and are much cheaper than the others, they are pretty much guaranteed to come flying off your motors and leave your quad to fall from whatever height it happens to be at. Not worth saving 3 bucks to have that happen and potentially lose the whole quad.They came in bags very similar to the originals, yet side by side you can see slight molding differences, and differences in color. I guess everything of value these days gets its own knock-off.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWOGSTZSEOHCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R2PA6V4#wasThisHelpful","RWOGSTZSEOHCY","A360VP3RBMJFDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A360VP3RBMJFDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought these to replace the very dim 3047 reverse bulbs on my wife's 2012 Chevy Silverado. Only one filament is lit for some reason, even though two are available, and the light it produced was very anemic and hard to see by. I did a bit of research and found that these were supposed to be a pretty close replacement.  Turns out, they are a perfect replacement. The reverse sockets on her truck have 3 wires going to them, 1 goes to the 2 ground pins, and another is 12V switched by a sensor on the transmission, and the 3rd wire is... I have no idea what. It seems that it doesn't really matter, and these bulbs light up at full intensity. It's now almost painful to look at them, and the light they provide is very plentiful and makes backing up much, much easier. I'd highly recommend these to any other Silverado owners.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IBPGIXG9207X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G2TV7OG#wasThisHelpful","R1IBPGIXG9207X","A360VP3RBMJFDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A360VP3RBMJFDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ahh, my first quadcopter. I've got to say, I'm really darn impressed with this thing. I'll probably write a more extended review later, but figured I should write a short blurb here today.I was introduced to the Ominus by searching for quadcopters on another website (hobby town usa). They didn't have the copters themselves, but they had tons of replacement parts. That caught my attention because most other quads I had seen previously were definitely more ""toy grade"" than this - if you break it, you might as well toss it, because there are no spare parts available. I went looking for this elsewhere and of course found it here on Amazon for the cheapest price available. I have since bought a Hubsan H107D, but I still enjoy flying this one as well. It's much larger, measuring about 10"" diagonally between prop centers, where the Hubsan is about 4"".The Ominus has much greater lift, and about 15 minutes of flight time per charge vs 5 minutes on for the Hubsan. I think the Ominus is a bit more stable and forgiving than the Hubsan, at least in Beginner Mode. I like that it has 4 different control modes, all the way up to Expert. I started getting pretty good recently, and switched into Expert Mode. Turns out I'm not that good after all, and I immediately crashed :)  Apparently in Expert Mode, all the onboard gyros and stabilization are turned off, and all of that is left to the pilot. I'm SO not ready for that yet. However, it's nice to know that it's there! I'll get there one day, and it's going to be awesome. This has some really great potential.The flip mode works great, and is a lot of fun to toy around with. Pairing the quad with the Tx is very easy, but setting the control response and calibrating the sensors is a bit trickier (much easier on the Hubsan). Be sure to download and print the manual, and keep it stashed in the box when you take it somewhere. Incidentally, the box it comes in doubles as a decent carry case. When it inevitably starts to wear out, I'll start looking for a more durable case.I started flying in my living room, and then in my backyard. I was ""okay"" but kept crashing, of course. There are no prop guards for the Ominus, and it's fairly large and those blades pack a wallop. For beginners, I'd definitely recommend going out and finding a large open field to learn in. An unused baseball field is pretty good. My city park has a very large circular field that is bordered by tall trees, and it's pretty much perfect. The trees block the wind, and there are almost no obstacles. This was when I really started learning how to fly, since in the house and even my backyard I was so worked up about avoiding obstacles that I couldn't really concentrate on actually flying and seeing how to control it. After one day flying in a field, I was much better prepared to fly in more close confines. A new pilot will find that panic and overcorrection are their two worst enemies, and flying in an open field mostly removes these. Just make sure to practice when there is no one around that you could crash into.My one concern with the design of this quad is the design of the motor housings. The motors double as landing gear, and have little rubber feet in the bottoms of their housings. The housing is held in by a tiny screw opposite a larger plastic snap-in tab. That's all well and good, but if you hit the ground with a lot of lateral speed, especially moving in a diagonal direction, that tab isn't going to hold. The housing is then held in at an angle by that tiny screw, and the motor's gear won't interface properly with the prop gear. I bent it up pretty good once or twice, and once even had to undo that screw to get everything bent back into shape. Now that I'm flying better, this isn't as much of a concern, but I still wish the motor housings had some sort of brace that ran back to the center of the quad.Now I'm tinkering with the idea of mounting a camera to the Ominus for a bit of aerial photography. I bought the 808 #16 keychain camera, which is the lightest and cheapest of the cameras I've seen so far. It only weighs 19g, but is still apparently enough to throw the flight controller off. I'm sure the Ominus can handle the weight, but I think the balance might be off. The extra weight slung beneath it throws off the reponse quite a bit. When you move the stick back from forward flight, the Ominus overcorrects on its own and actually starts to fly slightly backwards for a second or two. Then the flight controller must decide that something's wrong, and responsiveness goes way down and it's hard to keep in the air. The camera runs off a 3.7v lipo cell just like the Ominus's cell but smaller, so I'm considering stripping it out of the case, removing the battery, and mounting it under the Ominus's canopy. There seems to be enough room in there. I can also probably find somewhere to connect it to power. I'm just not sure yet that I want to carve up the canopy so I can manipulate the controls. The good news is, if I mess it up , there are plenty of replacement parts available.I'm not sure why this never showed up in my initial searches here on Amazon, but I'm so glad I stumbled on it. Get one! You'll love it.  (Oh, look at that, I meant to write a short review, and absolutely failed. D'oh!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C1UK1DANP8VN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHLAJEG#wasThisHelpful","R2C1UK1DANP8VN","A360VP3RBMJFDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A360VP3RBMJFDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I needed a prop protector for my new Hubsan quad, and from other reviews found out that the ones for the H107L wouldn't fit the larger motors on the H107D. The H107C uses the same motors, so this prop guard fits perfectly. It arrived in 2 days via Amazon Prime, while most other prop guards arrive in several weeks from China. I paid $7 instead of $2, but figure it's worth it to protect my favorite new gadget. I'm ordering several replacements but from other sources, since I don't need them immediately.I've been using this for about a week and it's worked great, protecting my props from most crashes. It helped save my quad from a ~75ft fall, but I somehow managed to break slightly it in a much more minor crash in my back yard last night. I'm guessing the first crash weakened it, and I probably mashed it just right to finish the break. It's still mostly functional, as the break is in one of the support arms coming off a motor. I think it will continue to protect the props until my replacements show up from... wherever.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R210JVZ0X98AZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H32657A#wasThisHelpful","R210JVZ0X98AZP","A360VP3RBMJFDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A360VP3RBMJFDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this to allow me to connect the batteries from my Hubsan H107D to the charger that came with my Dromida Ominus. The Hubsan factory charger only pulls about .7 amps on the 5 volt side, while the Dromida charger pulls about 2 amps, so in theory it will charge a single battery in roughly 1/3 the time. The Dromida uses the JST connector while the Hubsan uses a Walkera connector, and this certainly does the trick of adapting one to the other.I'm a little leery of using this cable for its intended purpose, since connecting multiple cells to a charger in parallel isn't necessarily the best way to go about it. It's very easy for the different cells to charge to different voltage levels, and this can lead to damaged cells and outright dangerous conditions like swollen batteries and even fires. You can read other reviews here for other customers' experiences with that. Due to these concerns, I'm only attaching one battery at a time to the Dromida charger. All I can say is that, for my purposes, this cable works perfectly. It was delivered to me here in Georgia within just a few days, which is also nice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MJPK3WGY5X6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HTJKW4E#wasThisHelpful","R1MJPK3WGY5X6H","A360VP3RBMJFDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A360VP3RBMJFDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: Be sure to read the updates I've added at the bottom, there's some pretty important info added.I recently picked up a Hubsan H107D, and found that I only got about 5 minutes per charge. I quickly ordered a 5 pack of extra batteries, which keep me in the air much more often, but were a pain to charge. So, buying this charger seemed like a natural course of action. It seems to charge very well, but the battery connections to the charger aren't very snug. The little lugs that prevent unwanted disconnection on the Hubsan just aren't present here, so the connectors slide in and out a little too easily. Not a big deal, unless you intend to try using this in your car.I used my USB inline voltage/current meter on this and was surprised (and pleased) to see how much current it draws. The factory Hubsan charger initially pulls .7 amps at 5.05V or so, which is about 3.5 watts. This charger initially pulls as much as 2.6 amps, which is about 12.9 watts. I say ""initially"" in those readings because the charger pulls more current at the start of charging and slowly tapers off until the battery is fully charged. Anyways, 12.9 watts comes out to 3.2 watts per battery, which is almost as much as the factory charger. Of course, all these figures are on the 5 volt side of the charger, so the batteries themselves are seeing lower voltage and higher current. After converting to 3.7 volts and allowing for 85% efficiency (both of which are rough guesstimates), the battery probably sees about .8 amps on the factory charger and .74 amps on this one. Not bad, not bad at all.So that's the nitty gritty for the electronics geeks, the short version is: if you provide this charger with a high power USB adapter (like the Sabrent 50 watt 5-port USB charger I used here), you can charge four batteries in almost the same time it takes to charge a single battery on the factory charger. Gone are the hours spent monitoring the factory charger and swapping out the batteries when they're done.My one reservation about this charger is that it should have used a USB micro B port for power input. The cord it comes with is very thin, and while the barrel connector on the end isn't ""proprietary"", if this cable gets damaged or lost you'll probably just have to get a whole new charger.All in all, I'm very glad I got this as it makes the process of getting the Hubsan back in the air much, much less tedious.UPDATE: I read a few other reviews, and saw that people were actually able to fully insert the batteries by pushing them in very, very forcefully. I tried it and sure enough it worked, but the grip was so tight I had to use needle nose pliers to get the battery back out. If you do this, do NOT just pull on the wires - you will ruin your battery and/or charger. I ended up prying the case open and trimming the retention bumps on each charger port with a hobby knife. Reassembly was a little tricky because the ""ports"" are really just a connector on the end of a 1"" set of wires that's all twisted up until they fit, and each connector fits in its own little slot in the top half of the case. You have to make sure the wires don't get pinched during reassembly because you really, REALLY don't want a short circuit. There is no glue, the case halves stay together fairly well on their own due to the post/hole design. Now the batteries snap in nicely, stay there the whole time, and can be removed with a reasonable amount of force. I can now use this in the car while driving without having to worry about the connectors sliding apart. I still wish this used a micro USB port rather than the barrel connector, but oh well!UPDATE 2: I started noticing that my flight times were substantially reduced from what I originally was getting from my batteries. Some of the flights were down to as low as 2 minutes. It turns out that this charger was cutting off charging a little too early and the cells weren't getting full. I'm still using it because it does boost overall charging speed of my 6 batteries, but I'm having to switch up the routine a little. I'm now charging 4 at a time on this charger but now when it cuts off I'm swapping the batteries one at a time back to the factory Hubsan charger to top them off. Overall, it's still a lot quicker than charging all 6 batteries one at a time on the factory charger, but it's a bit more of a hassle than it would otherwise be. For safety reasons it's better to under charge LiPo's than over charge them, but there is still such a thing as too little.

"They are only a small percentage of wool, but they are thick. In -20 degree weather my feet got a tad nippy in waterproof boots, but they are far superior to standard socks, the equivalent of a double layer at least I would say. They are well put together and have a small amount of padding. They are much too warm during hotter 40degree days leaving feet quite sweaty.

"Solid rubber is good because it has a high tackiness and flexibility. It also holds up to harsh cleaners well as you will periodically want to scrub this for any mold despite overall resistance to mold, anywhere there is a lot of moisture trapped for extended periods carries the risk.

"These work like they are supposed to, very easily pulling plastic off a cut wire. The one complaint is there no auto-adjust for the initial cut, which most wire strippers have. It is good for pulling once the plastic is cut, but there is just a bulk wire shop, and a sheath puller, so you can't actually strip a wire with just this tool, which is stupid considering how bulky and expensive it is, this feature could have easily been included to some degree. In my opinion, a tiny $5 channel lock does just as well of a job. It's just like those auto-octagonal wrenches, they are okay in specific situations.

"Pretty decent, easily pulls over the whole head. The knitting is good with no imperfections and is nice and stretchy. However it is thin for my taste as the main reason for this type of headgear is extreme cold. It is substantially thinner than most entry-level stocking caps. It is essential to wear an additional cap over this if you are at 20 or below for an extended period in my opinion. But it does a very good job of covering areas most caps don't, and it is thin enough to wear additional gear over it. So just keep all that in mind. It is good quality, and if combined with a couple other pieces of gear you're set. It is easy to pull down below your nose if desired and glasses will not fog up when driving etc. A huge plus, as most thick neck warmers if pulled up will force vapor up and cloud glasses.

"Excellent door sweep. Solid rubber. PVD coated aluminum. Aluminum does not rust. Rubber is highly resistant to sun, weather, grit etc. This effectively stops drafts.

Stanley has a decent 12"" one on amazon for $5, which you will likely need to size it for your door.Other tools helpful to have during installation: tape measure, black sharpie to mark cut, drill for pilot holes, and screwdriver.Brush-sweeps are preferred by some when the floor is very unlevel as it will accommodate a bow in the floor better. My floors are quite uneven but this works excellently and will last many years, and has nice clean lines and does not trap grit.

"This is quite large, unless cooking for a large family with a mortar as your only tool I can't see needing anything much larger. It fits over 4 large avocados. The stone is nice and rough for things like flowers and small seeds, which this can grind to a fine dust. So it is versatile and large. It handles small quantities as easily as large. Seasoning mortars is a simple process that does not require and great skill, you basically just rinse it, let it dry, grind up some brown rice, and dump it out, and done. You can grind in peppercorns, chili pods or other spices if desired to ""season"" the stone itself.One possible issue with some is the bottom is rough. On a fine surface this could scratch. Same with the sides. Typically it is good traction. However if you don't like it rough you can paint the bottom with epoxy paint/resin and lightly sand it for an easy glossy finish. The ones with polished sides are more aesthetically appealing in my opinion, so if you are really into the aesthetics of your kitchen, you may opt for a glossy outside as polished granite is quite beautiful. Those tended to be smaller and more expensive.The natural stone of this mortar is also appealing and unobtrusive and would likely work for many rustic themed kitchens. It is a nice piece to display next to dark woods, and green plants =)  It is granite, so unless you drop it from a great height onto concrete it should last for hundreds or thousands of years, it is what the Rocky mountains are made of after all =)  Gets you more in touch with your food, the texture, the smells releasing. It is a slower and more gentler method to grind food than a blender or food processer. High speed commercial blenders warm foods which can oxidize your super-foods. It is fun to experiment with various foods and preparation. It may not seem like much of a difference in mindstate, but just not hearing a whirring blender that you have to shout over, or the annoying rattle of a coffee grinder, the stone is much earthier.It's just a mortar!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12C6ZHA6PFMP9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Y0AYFC#wasThisHelpful","R12C6ZHA6PFMP9","A1H4R7TY2G50DH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4R7TY2G50DH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Being so high in vitamin C I was thinking this would be somewhat tart, like a citrusy or berry flavor. The flavor is much closer to unsweetened tamarind, somewhat bitter with a bit of a tart & only slightly fruity kick in a powerful flavor that is not unpleasant, but not as versatile as say, orange juice. It's good to add to smoothies in measured amounts as an additive for a broad spectrum of vitamin, as opposed to using as a base-flavor.The reason this is better than vitamin C is it contains a more complete spectrum of antioxidants and bioflavonoids not present in processed vitamin C, like the difference between white flower and wild rice, which is more complete of a food? Some research has been done showing citrus with complete spectrums are superior to straight ascorbic acid, and ascorbic acid can actually have a leeching effect as it scavenges from other antioxidants to complete a spectrum. Lots of research out there on vitamin C, so I will just add to the chorus of ""whole food is better.""When in doubt on the effectiveness of a vitamin, but you feel like your body needs it, going to the whole food seems to be the wisest long-term choice to me.Hope that helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TMPNYDH7EIOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FEPUNUS#wasThisHelpful","R2TMPNYDH7EIOT","A1H4R7TY2G50DH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4R7TY2G50DH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is pretty decent matcha. You can use is straight out of the box just mixing it into water as it already has the ""ideal"" amount of sweetener for a ""sweet matcha"" taste. The downside is if you want a richer, fuller matcha flavor it is not really attainable as there is quite a bit of sweetener in this. I prefer a stronger matcha as I drink it primarily for the health benefits, so I tend to go for the straight powdered tea without anything mixed in. However with straight matcha it is also easy to make it too strong and possibly bitter. So this is a nice easy way to enjoy matcha with less room for error.

"Works awesome for hair dye. I dye my wife's hair who I would call a light brown-blonde. It turns her hair a nice natural reddish hue with very good color saturation. She was asked by her professional hair stylist who colors her hair, with compliments following. My dad, not knowing I had done the coloring, and is particular with women's hair color, also spontaneously commented on the coloring, asking what/how she did it. The reason Henna is so spectacular is because it is a natural product, surprise it gives effortless natural color with natural gradations and a deep natural resonance. Artificial colors are flat, artificial, lifeless. To a sensitive eye, the difference between a natural color and a fake color is readily apparent. This is also completely non-toxic. It smells quite good in my opinion, like wheat grass juice with strong grassy notes.I am not an expert hair dyer. I undertook this with my wife because I am cheap, and doing it for her myself turned out to be enjoyable with easy and excellent results. My formula is basically to mix some vinegar into the powder until it is a very thick mush. Then I pour boiling water into it until it flows similar to the consistency of somewhere between pudding and heavy creamer.I also have added indigo (for black shade), crushed hibiscus (bright red), and clove (deep red/maroon).Price-wise, I get many more uses out of this on my wife's hair than a standard kit.The one con is there can be little bits of clumps/granules, and/or plant matter, especially when adding hibiscus or clove, but it washes out and does not effect the end-color or texture of the hair negatively.One great plus, it is a natural conditioner that leaves hair SILKY smooth for days. I believe it is due to the high levels of anti-oxidants in greens. In contrast artificial color tends to weaken hair, making it more brittle.Hope that helps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E1NWLVCE17Q5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002DY3F7G#wasThisHelpful","R1E1NWLVCE17Q5","A1H4R7TY2G50DH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4R7TY2G50DH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These worked with organic vapor staining and varnishing in an enclosed 10x10 room for 30 minutes with no noticeable odor. They also worked in a house over a 30minute period, varnishing the entire house in an enclosed state, with no noticeable odor, while insects around me were dying (literally) from the fumes. I also wear eye protection as fumes can irritate any mucous membranes. I try to minimize exposure, even with these. If fumes/chemicals are greater than oxygen levels in certain situations these may not be sufficient. For a typical floor refinishing of a residence these are perfect, and an absolute safety necessity as organic vapors cause almost immediate brain damage even in low levels.The value pack was a great value when I got them and after using them I consider them comparable in quality to the 3M disposable masks, from what I can tell with my own senses (smell/taste = clean while in use). These also work great for insulating as the cartridges block fiberglass insulation particulates easily.Hope that helps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUOUV75BT2G1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XUF7RI#wasThisHelpful","RUOUV75BT2G1B","A1H4R7TY2G50DH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4R7TY2G50DH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used dozens of tarps, some the standard blue ones from hardware stores, others cheap ones, from canvas to vinyl.I live in an area at 8,000ft elevation near a ski-hill where it can snow multiple feet in a short time. This resists all snow loads in my application (which is basically just a cover for outdoor furniture)Pros:Much thicker than your standard tarp (obvious increase in durability)WaterproofHeavy - does not blow away as easily in high wind!This tarp has more brass (no rust) grommets than usual, so you can tie it down more completely.Cons:If you are moving large amounts of soil/gravel with this over concrete or another abrasive surface, vinyl does not hold up over time under those conditions, but this will still be superior to other tarps in that regard so it is not really a con for this tarp, but just all tarps in general.Neutral:Because it is so heavy duty (a plus) it also is difficult to fold or bend. This can be good or bad depending on your situation. Canvas is much more flexible while retaining durability but is not waterproof and is more porous and therefore more difficult to clean!Overview:This actually is a quite noticeably thicker material, heavier duty, and overall just heavier. I have no doubt this will hold up for many years if not decades to come. I do not regret the added expense one bit, it was worth every penny. If you are going to be leaving it out in the weather for years, it is worth the investment.Hope that helps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D4V3NYXHWRJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005MRQI9S#wasThisHelpful","R3D4V3NYXHWRJ5","A1H4R7TY2G50DH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4R7TY2G50DH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Call me forgetful, but I left the lid on accidentally for a few minutes and it melted into the pot ruining the unit. Should have had a metal or glass lid with plastic handle for an extra dollar. My next fryer I get will not have melting components. Poorly thought out fryer materials.That said, it was easy to clean the residue out and I'll get a different lid and keep using it. It brings oils to heat great. I use coconut oil and sometimes mix it with canola. Works great. Canola foams though.I wish the interior was not teflon, but it makes it easy to clean as oil does not stick to it. Cleaning vinegar with a paper towl works well.One great feature is the safety cord which should be a legal requirement for appliances like these. In addition to being forgetful, leaving the lid on during use, I am also rushed in the kitchen often, and I have yanked it out multiple times and instead of spilling boiling oil on myself the cord just flips off.Overall, it is a great fyer, if you don't mind teflon, and can remember the plastic lid, it would be a 5-star fryer for you!","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNMIV1TVHV4XN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005KB37#wasThisHelpful","RNMIV1TVHV4XN","A1H4R7TY2G50DH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4R7TY2G50DH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sage is a volatile oil. If you have ever used peppermint essence, bergamot, oregano, or tea tree oil, it is similar to that family of smells. It is earthy and minty if I had to pick two words. Now is a quality maker of essential oils, and they are predictable and uniform every time I buy them.. having bought basically a shelf-full to make my own natural colognes and aroma therapies.Modern medicine shows sage is a potent antioxidant, both the oil, and whole herb. It can be used to treat a variety of disorders such as candida overgrowth, colds, sore throats, but dilute it properly with other oils or you can give your sensitive mucus membranes a chemical burn (although not an artificial chemical). This is food grade essential oil that can be used for consumption.If you have belief in traditional herbology lore, sage is purifying of evil spirits etc, and sage rubs are made to smoke out negative energies.Sage goes good with Bergamot in cologne, also Frankincense.Hope that helps!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KISWILV1S0VQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000W3TDIU#wasThisHelpful","R3KISWILV1S0VQ","A1H4R7TY2G50DH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4R7TY2G50DH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a few different brands of derma rollers, including the one from derma logi that is over twice as expensive. The main difference is in the width of the needles. Personally, I'd prefer to spend an extra $2 to get one with finer needles, not length of the needle but the needles ""sharpness.""I decided to go for it despite questionable reviews and bought all three lengths because the price at $7.99 was well below any other brand.They all came in a plastic box sealed in cellophane. I cleaned it with alcohol before use anyway.Compared to derma logi ($15-$20), and SGF limited ($10-$16), for the price, I got what I expected. This derma roller is actually quite decent. I can't honestly say that I can tell a huge difference (although there is a difference). The tips, on use are less honed and take quite a bit more pressure, and is slightly more painful to use. On side-by-side visual inspection, the needles of this brand are around twice as thick (maybe a bit less), which is what makes it slightly more painful, and cheaper to produce.You do feel discomfort/pain using any derma roller. I'm a guy with high pain tolerance, and if you are using it on sensitive areas such as neck, cheek, around eyes, etc, you will definitely feel some degree pain without question both during and after use. They can also make your face quite red, and sensitive to direct full-sun.That said, this derma roller, and all others will stimulate collagen production, and decrease lines visible, age spots, scars, large pores, reduce acne etc. One of my favorite uses is if I notice a pimple, if you roll a derma roller over it a few times it will break it up and release it without causing a scab.I am happy with this purchase. It is more painful to use that my more expensive derma rollers, but for 1/2 the cost you are getting what you pay for.The 0.5mm size is good for around eyes and smile lines. The 1mm is a good general length to get if you are getting only one size as it can still be used in sensitive areas, just a bit more gently. The 1.5mm is quite long and would be good for occasional deep tissue stimulation where there is thicker skin, such as the back.Hope that helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXEQ2B50GAJPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZSKYPG#wasThisHelpful","RXEQ2B50GAJPS","A1H4R7TY2G50DH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4R7TY2G50DH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Spice Island, McCormick, Morton, etc all make good spices in my opinion. This is just as good as any other brand. Your main concern will be keeping this amount of spice fresh if you don't use it fast enough. A good way to do this is small snap-shut Tupperware containers or used empty glass jars.Curry, if you didn't know, is a spice used in Indian cooking. You likely know that if you are buying this quantity. But it is earthy and spicy, and can be overpowering if you use too much, like any spice. Some of my favorite uses of curry are with bean recipes and vegetable recipes. Such as kidney and garbanzo beans. And broccoli, cauliflower, and spinach.Plain yogurt adds a nice creaminess to many curry recipes.

The foot pedal is solid cheap plastic, and is also the most likely part to break. Luckily pedal switches are easy to find and universalized.Hope that helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RTV9GO5FJP6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008DRMHQ2#wasThisHelpful","R1RTV9GO5FJP6T","A1H4R7TY2G50DH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4R7TY2G50DH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Made in the USA.Heats up fast due to aluminum core. There are two types of electrical wire, copper which is the best and aluminum which is second best. Aluminum is right behind copper in terms of conductivity. We all know how expensive solid copper and copper core pots are. Aluminum, for cooking food, is really just as good in my opinion.The pan itself is very thick, including the edges. When you are cooking, you can easily give yourself a burn if you hit the edge with your hand. I was used to less expensive value-brand pots, and thin lips of just stainless steel don't conduct heat well. I wasn't used to the top lip being able to burn me. Also if you use metal cooking tools, and rest them against the lip, it will conduct heat into them. And if you rest plastic against the lip, it can melt it. To me, this is the mark of a truly good pot.The lid is the same level of quality. It fits tightly, creating a good seal that traps steam for dishes such as sunny-side-up eggs where the tops turn white via steam. The lid will also get hot and conduct heat. But the handle will not get hot.There are zero rivets or bent over metal to collect dirt or old food grime. The lip is a solid piece of metal.The bottom of the pan is perfectly flat, so it rests perfectly on my glass-top oven. Cheaper pans will have a slight curve and do not heat up well at all.Storing the pan, you can flip the lid upside-down and place a pot on top of it!This pan has a lot of great features and it's very high quality. Going from a value-brand to this has been great and I can't believe I didn't spend a bit of money sooner. Cooking with this has been a joy! Food cooks faster and more evenly too. And I don't have to turn the dial up as high to cook food. I used to have to cook food on high. Now that will burn food that it used to just barely get. Even med-low can burn foods I used to have to have on high. It took a bit of getting used to actually being able to cook foods. So I figure I must be saving some money on energy too.Hope that helps!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32T5MESSBCZNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00912HLAA#wasThisHelpful","R32T5MESSBCZNG","A1H4R7TY2G50DH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4R7TY2G50DH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've owned about 6 different neck-sleeping products including cervical pillows by other brands in the $20-$80 range. The curved memory foam pillows from walmart suck for cervical traction because the indent/curve is not nearly deep enough. An $80 one I had didn't last long because it was not densely packed enough so it became to compressed to be much use. Dog-bone pillows are pretty useful, but having nothing on the back of the head is too much of an indent, so it can be used for short periods of time but not all night long.This is hands down the best pillow I've ever used for my neck problem. I am a side sleeper but I like to start out on my back and wake up on my back. When I bought this I didn't realize it was designed for side-sleepers. I just thought dang, it's like this is designed to also be good for my side! If you have neck problems, with a standard cervical pillow if you lay in the middle of the pillow, it is not good for your neck, and the edges are too poofy with no contour.This pillow is perfect for those with neck problems who sleep on both their back and side. Surely I'm not the only one.When I use this pillow I have zero neck problems. If I go without it my chronic condition returns (pulled a disk out of my neck doing a deep arm stretch too early in the morning, which permanently loosened my ligaments).Hope that helps!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAL1F0PZDLR1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0078Q0WMK#wasThisHelpful","RAL1F0PZDLR1W","A1H4R7TY2G50DH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4R7TY2G50DH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They don't filter out heavy metals, radiation, salt (ocean water), fluoride etc. In a life-threatening situation where you have little access to water save dirty pools, this could save your life. Dirty pools in warm areas are rich in microbe life. If you drink from them the effects of diarrhea and vomiting are worse off than simply going without water. They are very light weight.

"This is a great kit because everything you need is included. It's a great space saver. If your kitchen is anything like mine space is at a premium. This also puts frequently used pots and pans at your finger tips. Ever try tugging a pan out that is stacked on the bottom of some pots and it's just a terrible experience? Well, no more situations like that with this, all your favorite pans are right in front of you. I should have gotten one a lot time ago. People will spend $400 on a kitchen cabinet, and they aren't exactly the most convenient way of storing pots and pans.I just screwed it into 2x4's with a stud finder. Honestly if your studs aren't 16 inches on center it doesn't matter, you just add a couple cross members and screw those into where you do have studs and screw the rack into that. A minor extra step that adds about $2 to the cost, and you need a drill anyway.

"I have had hundreds of watches pass through my hands as a watch hobby collector, including oris, tag heuer, eterna, omega, tissot, victorinox.The rubber links between steel on the band is an interesting mix I haven't seen before.The movement is a high quality swiss chronograph.

The pushers are smooth and solid, not chintzy and sloppy. In a chronograph that is important. The second hand doesn't have any play, it stays where it's supposed to. The movement is jeweled.

"The main competitors are DeWalt and Milwaukee. Is there much difference? Not really. The main difference are the unique tools in the various lines of batteries because once you buy into a batter kit it doesn't make much sense to buy into another.As for the tool itself, you can take off lugnuts on a truck with this. You can also get attachments for hex shanks to drill massive holes through telephone poles or log homes.An impact wrench transfers a blow to a hammer and anvil inside of the tool instead of your wrist. A normal high power drill, if you are drilling into something serious and the bit binds, but the tool keeps rotating, you can break your wrist. So drilling with one of these can be the safer way to go.The motor brushings can be replaced. The thing likely to finally wear down electric impact hammers in the end is the hammer striking the anvil enough time mushrooms the steel pieces so they are further apart, which reduces the torque. But that requires many years of hard daily usage. The batteries have quite a long life-span. Lithium batteries can typically be charged between 300 and 1000 times. On this makita box it says 1000 charge cycles. I would factor in cost with convenience. If you have a large air compressor, an air-powered impact wrench is going to be cheaper over the long run if you use it a lot.Hope that helps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TMH4OZ446LWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DOA8XDY#wasThisHelpful","R3TMH4OZ446LWD","A1H4R7TY2G50DH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4R7TY2G50DH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My mom had a hand held battery powered vacuum.

It can suck up strands of hair imbedded into carpet, that always seems to be the true test of a vacuum. It has no bag, you have to snap off the front and split the unit in two to empty it. This filter is a flimsy cotton filter with a soft plastic membrane for the seal. I do no see it holding up as well as the vacuum.

"The Dog Couch Protector sofa cover is made so well, that it doesn't even feel like a pet product!Made of brown Suede, it reminds me of a brown comforter that I have for my bed. In installs in less than 30 seconds, and feels super soft, and a there is a pattern stitching design throughout the material. The underside is white, and the same pattern design is visible on the bottom of the cover meaning that it is going to holdup a long time.It is water/soil resistant and machine washable.  I think it is very well designed- if you have a dog, cat, child, and want to protect your sofa this is a product I would recommend.  I myself don't let our dogs much in the house, only whenever we are going for a walk and they are pass through We do though have cats in the house, and they love to run up and down the couches with their nails out, and I get the joy of listening to people complain.

"The unit is tiny and portable!  I did have to research the technology a bit I found out that the ionizer creates negative ions which seek out positively charged particles, such as dust, dander, bacteria, pollen, mold, smoke, chemical vapors, and other allergens and then, once the positive and negative ions are bonded together, they become too heavy to float, and no longer affect the air quality of the surroundingsWhat is the ideal space for this size? I messaged the company and they recommended about 30cm surroundings space.This model is a little different the the product picture. The larger holes at the end that are releasing the negative ions have bristles. When I first received the unit- I turned it on, a green light lit up. For the most part it is silent but makes little sounds here and there. I couldn't feel anything on the skin on my so I put it to my cheek. When both bristle touched my skin, I would feel a little shock!You can actually fill a small container with smoke, put the device in there, and watch the smoke disappear.

"The Tree New Bee 15.6- 17 inch laptop cooling fan is a good option, but I do have some concerns.First thing to note is that there are 4 fans, 2 USB ports (1 for power, 1 for data), 2 controls for the fans and lights. 2 stoppers in the front that stop your laptop from comping forward.2 legs that come out the back for height.Everything works, which is great.My thoughts and concerns.There are 4 total fans, you can control the speed of the fan and turn on a light with the same switch. My conern is you can not turn off the lights, unless you turn off the fans. You can use any 2 fans at a time, or all 4 adjusting the speeds according to your needs, but there is not an option to turn the light off.You have 2 legs in the back to come up, but I think the unit would be even better if there was an option for 2 heights.The front stoppers were a great idea I have 4 different cool fans for my laptops and this is the first I have with this option to keep the laptop from slipping. my issue is that the stoppers are not rounded off and are kinda sharp and hit my wrists. I am using small laptop and that could be the issue, but if they were rounded off w/ rubber to prevent the sharpness. I would be much happier with the product.Overall it is well made, usb ports are interchangeable, the 4 fans work, it has a gaming feel with the blue leds, so I give it 4.5 stars.IT needs a little work, but its a good working fan.* ""I received free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F2JGFZWTO14Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016PMVM7Q#wasThisHelpful","R2F2JGFZWTO14Z","AUA0Z4MIO8VEM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA0Z4MIO8VEM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The panels have a plastic on them, that allow them to be water resistant (not waterproof- Do not submerse).Inside this zipper pocket is also the (2) charging ports that have an intelligent chip (TIRC) which actually detects your devices and charges at the maximum speed that your device can handle, without damaging your battery.It gets better please keep reading-Questions/ Information/ Pros/ Cons/ Requests?How are you going to get the most out of this device? Direct sunlight will give you the best results!1. 30-45 degrees -Facing the sun at an angle is the best2. 90 degree flat under the sun is still good3. Facing away from the sun( you should attempt to redirect the panel towards the sun vs away from it)Why is my Device not pulling as much even in direct sunlight?You will experience greater draw from an uncharged device vs a charged one that is just topping off, - trickle charge.The indicator light will show that it is charging in (in the Shade/ indirect light).- It is more or a trickle charge and you should consider moving it to direct sunlight! My meter indicates that it is giving power to my devices, and my devices indicate that they are receiving but it will take much longer for any type of charge this way- it is called solar charger for a reason, not shade charger.Pros:High Quality product and stitchingExtremely portableCan be attached to a backpack/ or strung up with the hooks and holes25W - 5V 4A Max  (2 large tablets)TiR-C Intelligent Chip protects your devices-Allowing for the fastest and safest charge for your devicesComes with a built-in zippered pocket to hold your device as it charges- can actually fit 2 devicesPass-through charging- bring your own Device-- helps reduce weightCons:I have not found any at this time.What I want to be changed from this item?

" 5:32 MinsWith the PowerCore+ 20100 USB-C (6A) Anker proves that it is always innovating, never imitating!Rated at 20,100mAh hence the name, I can get at least 10 charges on my phone with it.It does have some weight to it, premium aluminum Matte finish ( for the most part avoids finger prints), 2 USB outputs, 1 USB-CThe powe-button has 10 LEDs in it each one represents 10% charg in the device. When charging it is best/ safest to charge it using an Anker Charger because PowerIQ is the standard in Anker Chargers. I have the (5) Anker 5-port Charging HUBS, and the latest Anker PowerPort +1 with Quick Charge 3.0. I have many ports to choose from, but I am using the latest  PowerPort +1 which is supposed to bring charge time to only 8.3 hours.. I say supposed to because this is a monster of a battery and I have not come close to draining it yet.Just in case you are not familiar with PowerIQ, it essentially an intelligent Chip that detects your device, regulating the  charge current accordingly.  This allows for the fastest and safest charge for all your devices-- meaning there is less chance of hurting your batteries, or your devices..PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technologies combine to provide the fastest possible charge, up to 2.4 amps per port.

"PaleoCrazy Organic Matcha Powder Japanese Tea is something that was new to me. Well, partly.My moms friend was talking about how she starting drinking several items and that it was making her loose weight, and that it was recommend to her by a local grocery store. I don't know that brand, but matcha tea was of the things on the list.Now while trying to study and focus, ADD/ADHD combination didn't help, and I was out of mental stimulants. I found that mixing caffeine with L-Theanine could give you concentration and focus without the jitters. The L-Theanine derived from green tea actually neutralizes the jitters from caffeine. When I was offered a sample of this matcha tea and found out about the Antioxidants, and L-Theanine in it, I was happy. IYou should note- This product does contain Caffeine already.. so be cautious.

The Author is brief, yet informative to the points that even a novice can understand the subject.

"Luxebell LED Headlamp - 1000lm Cree Xm-l T6 Really is the best option for your money.I have tried headlamps in the $20 and $30 range and this one well out-performs them.Firstly it is rechargeable, and comes with (2) individually wrapped ""UltraFire"" BRC 18650 3000mah 3.7 li-ion. The battery pack rests on the back of your head, and has the control button (silver).  The Light modes:  High, Low, flashing (strobe).It has 3 straps-  1 down the center of your head and 2 on the sides.The lights itself is a T6 LED with a zoom-able convex lens.At first I didn't it was zoom-able.  To zoom all you need to do is pull outward on the lens area where the grip is.  IT was kinda hard in the beginning, but pull it in and out about 30 times and you will make it a lot smoother. The Lens mount can also rotate 90 degrees.The charging port is also located on the battery pack. you get a home charging cord, and a cig-lighter charger for the car.For the most part is a a very well made light.3 things I would liked to see different:- The charger type- I would like to see it as a micro-usb- I would like a travel case, even if it means the price goes up-  add a little more foam to the front of the forehead mount, because I feel over time it won't keep its formOverall it is the best head lamp that I own!

I tried to make it like my grandparents do by boiling some water in a pot, dumping coffee in and drinking.. its was a mess tasted horrible, coffee grains everywhere and then some! I tried one of those single cup coffee makers from walmart and no coffee grains but it still was bad.Four attempts later, I became a Blogger/product tester and I had my first chance at reviewing a French press and no lie it is the best way to make coffee.This miniature press is great for places that you do not have a lot of storage space such as work, small homes, RVs, Cabins, beach houses, Dorm-rooms and you get the idea.Because it is glass you do need to take care not to bang it too hard, or put absolutely boiling water! Always leave the press in a upward position while the coffee mingles in the water, and press down slowly with the spout away from you when you are ready to serve.This would make a great present for a coffee/tea lover!You get the actual french press itself,  a coffee scoop, and 3 replacement screen filters.

"When Daydreamer Neck Pillow said that they got it right when it came to neck pillows, I was a little skeptical. True though they really did. This Neck Pillow is Luxury and function in one.Firstly, It comes with a travel case that looks expensive.  The outer cover is made of micro-velvet fabric which is extremely soft.  The pillow is inflated via a little bubble pump that is hand operated versus mouth operated. Simply apply pressure to the bubble pump and the pillow will begin to inflate (note: Valve should be in open position).  Several pumps later you are set! The pillow can be inflated/deflated while on your neck. To deflate simply open the valve, and press your finger into it, the air will begin to release.

"I was quite amazed at what $15 bought me.When I upgraded to the iPad Air 2, I never bothered to get a case.  I use the device around the house for the most part, and for that reason, I felt reasonably assured that it would not drop.Had to go on a business trip at the last minute.  I scrambled to find something cheap to cover my iPad while traveling.  Just happened to come upon this product from KHOMO based on the number of positive reviews.  For $15 it seemed like a safe gamble.I was quite amazed by the quality of this case.  Compared to what Apple charges for theirs, this case doesn't scream ""cheap.""  It seems well made and it even has a magnetic closure that automatically awakes and puts your iPad to sleep.Really, it would be hard to tell that Apple didn't make this cover themselves.But here is the problem...It doesn't function well as a prop-up stand.  In another words, using it on may flight, I had it titled up on my seat tray by folding in the cover and using it as a stand.  The cover collapsed several times during my flight.  It just seemed as if the cover was not durable enough to act as a stand.So, the ""You can watch movies on an airplane with this cover"" functionality fails miserably  It will work, but chances are you are going to be fidgeting with the cover over and over to keep it propped up.Other than that, this is an exceptional case.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G76DSNGND36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKSMA6A#wasThisHelpful","R3G76DSNGND36","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In all, I would agree with most all Amazon reviews that this is a terrific case for the price.The problem is that it is a smidgen too thick on the bottom to fit in my iPhone charger stand.  Now, this isn't the Apple's new lightning dock.  The dock I am using is made by Henge Docks (Gravitas).  It is supposed to support most cases that fit the iPhone 6S plus, but the Spigen case bottom rubber is just too thick to fit compared to the Seidio.I would make certain that if the dock you are using is grooved and meant to support a certain size case, that you check to make certain the Spigen is not too large for your needs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R151LE6K5Y4RX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MVSAI0#wasThisHelpful","R151LE6K5Y4RX","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have gone through many brands of iPhone protection screen covers over the years.Upon purchasing my iPhone 6S plus, I purchased the Aduro Shatterguardz Premium Tempered Glass protector based on the mostly satisfactory reviews on Amazon.The product was packaged quite well.  There were a few extra stickers in the packaging that I didn't quite understand their use for -- and the instructions on the back of the box didn't explain why they were included.  However, applying the cover itself was a relatively painless process.  Simply clean your phone's screen with the supplied wet wipe and cloth, than peel the backing from the protector, aligning it correctly with the cutouts on the front of your phone.I was delighted to see that the protector was easily applied and any small amount of bubbles beneath it were effortlessly evened out with the included cardboard tool.The biggest gripe I have with this protector is the same gripe that most Amazon reviewers have.  It does not fully cover the entire screen of the iPhone 6S Plus.  It leaves a very small margin of unprotected area around the edges.  Now, this could be due to the fact that Aduro felt that cases with side overlap might not fit correctly over the protector.  However, I have a case with an overlap and there still is a smidgen of unprotected glass around the sides of the iPhone.Is this a deal breaker?  I would guess, no.  However, this is the first glass protector I have used that doesn't fully cover the iPhone screen and I am really wondering what is going on with this product that it has not been corrected.As far as reports from reviewers that the cover ""shatters""...I don't quite understand those remarks.  If you apply this cover carefully without being abusive to it, I can't see anything going wrong with the install process.As far as how well it protects your phone when it drops?  Well, fortunately, I have not had to even test that feature.  I rarely drop my phone. However, something tells me that if you don't have a case protecting your phone with a front lip, nothing is going to protect your glass should it fall face down on pavement from considerable height.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CMW7TFQ0GGSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5Y32VO#wasThisHelpful","R1CMW7TFQ0GGSD","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

For one, it has a dual tip for charging either an iPhone (lighting cable) or Android device (Micro USB cable).It also has a streaming flow of light across the cable to indicate charging speed and level.Of course, when using this in your vehicle -- as most of you will -- nighttime use will yield maximum results.  During the day, you won't notice anything other than your phone or tablet being charged.However, at night, it's sooooo cool to turn on your vehicle and be greeted by a stream of blue lights running across this cable.  It's sure to elicit some ""oohs"" and ""aaahs"" from those in your vehicle.  Most certainly, nobody has seen anything like this before.My worries are overall durability.  Some reviews have already expressed that this cable stops working after a short period of time.  I have found that the lights don't stay on once the device is fully charged.  Should they?  If not, something is already wrong.  I know if I move my phone, all of a sudden the cable comes to life.  It's not clear whether this is normal working practice or not.Truth be, I haven't used this cable long enough to establish long-term usage reliability.  I will certainly update this review should these cables stop working.On the surface, outside of the extremely long time it took to receive, I am very happy with this purchase.  It really adds a bit of flair to your vehicle at night.  It's just a really ""cool"" cable.  Just wish it was made from a company that had a little more reliable history behind them.  Something tells me that these are cheaply made cables and that the lifespan will not be what one expects from major cable manufacturers.  Time will tell.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROQDT6G1IHUV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z0E2UUO#wasThisHelpful","ROQDT6G1IHUV4","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wire hangers.  Hate them.  They ruin shirts.Best thing I did for my clothes, years ago, as get rid of all my wire hangers.  I switched to more durable and thicker plastic hangers that I found at my local Price Club store.However, the Price Club store stopped selling the hangers for some reason.  So, I turned to Amazon.  Bought the 12-pack and was pleased to find that these were the same type of hangers I already owned.  Nice thick plastic.  Durable.  No bowing.  No banding.  Heavy enough for pants.

"I recently purchased a Waring Dual Waffle Maker.I wanted to obtain the same spatula/fork took that hotel chains offer with their waffle makers that one sees at the complimentary morning breakfast.For under $10, this fit the bill perfectly.I don't understand the negative reviews.  I just made my first batch of waffles this morning.  Using this tong, I simply slipped the spatula beneath the waffle and removed it with the fork grip.  The waffle lifted out of the grill perfectly.  If I had just used a fork instead, I risked tearing the waffle apart.The size is perfect.  I don't need another huge gripping device in my utensil drawer.  It works wonderfully, and it's the same design that you see at hotel breakfast counters.  If it works for them, it certainly should work in the home.Listen, I am not putting down other reviewers.  Everyone has their particular likes and dislikes about how a product should perform.  However, what could be more simpler than sliding a spatula under a waffle and using a grip to gently pull it out from the grill?  This gripper works as advertised.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EMX5VHLHUB8J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006OVZRT8#wasThisHelpful","R2EMX5VHLHUB8J","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To begin with, I have owned a Braun electric toothbrush for many years.  I have one of their older rotating head models that still works well.  In other words, I have experience with these toothbrushes.  I also feel that, by far, you get a better clean using a rotating brush over a standard one.  I am a little over 50 years of age. In my lifetime, I have only had one cavity. I take great pride in maintaining proper dental hygiene.  I believe anyone can be cavity-free if they floss regularly and brush their teeth and gums twice a day for at least two minutes.What I liked about the older Braun electric toothbrush was that I could actually time my brushings to the recommended 2 minutes.  Start the holder, and at the two minute mark, the brush heads would make a funny motion to indicate that your two-minute mark has occurred.This new 7000 SmartSeries toothbrush takes that experience to a whole new level.The best thing about this expensive toothbrush is that it comes with a portable gauge with adhesive holder that you tack on to your bathroom wall near your sink.  It actually pairs with the toothbrush via bluetooth.  When you turn the toothbrush on, the indicator starts counting towards your 2-minute goal.  I like this, because without the indicator on the older brush, I never knew how far into my routine I was.  An indicator on the gauge not only counts your brush time, but also tells you if you are brushing too hard.  If you are brushing too hard, a sad face will appear on the indicator.  I was surprised how often this happened -- and it showed me, for the first time, that I was not brushing properly.The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was that every 30 seconds, the toothbrush heads would slow down for a split second, to indicate another 30 second cycle had just passed.  I don't think it was necessary for Braun to implement this feature.  It's not a deal breaker, certainly -- but I do agree with other Amazon reviewers that it can be annoying.At first, the thought of having a phone app for brushing your teeth seemed ludicrous.  However, after using the included gauge --- and becoming dependent on it --- I can see how an app would be perfect when traveling.  Think about it.....you can leave the gauge at home and use the mobile app instead to show you your progress and indicate when you are not brushing correctly.Now to debunk some prior review myths....Yes, it is true, it takes a full 24 hours to initially charge this toothbrush.  That's kind of crazy.  However, I suppose no big deal.  Some have said that the charging light is overly bright to the fact that it's almost like having a night light in their bathroom.  This is not true.  Yes, it has a blinking blue charging light, but in total darkness, it did not become bright enough to be distracting.Yes, it's a little noisy when being used.  However, not the point where you are going to wake up everyone in the house.  If you are like me and keep the bathroom door closed, nobody is going to be awakened by this toothbrush.The 7000 series is a bit larger and heavier than the older Braun toothbrushes.  However, it does seem to be more powerful.  I also feel a better clean, overall, using this series over the older model.It comes with, I believe, 3 brush heads.  A registration coupon inside offers a $3 savings on replacement heads plus an additional $7 off coupon when you register online.There is a beautiful travel case included.  I agree with one reviewer that the travel case might be better if it had air vents.  However, if you thoroughly dry your toothbrush prior to putting it in the case, I don't see any problems.Braun has moved from the fully upright charging stand to a flat dock.  I like this design.  It includes a covered area to store toothbrush heads for members of your family.With the included Amazon clip coupon, I ended up paying about $120 for this toothbrush.  It's pricey...yes...but once you start using it with the included gauge, you will look forward to using it every morning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q1D82TSDPB1Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9X34XS#wasThisHelpful","R3Q1D82TSDPB1Z","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just bought a new Lincoln crossover and I wanted some sort of organizer to hold all my car cleaning products.  I usually keep a collection of sprays and wipes on hand to handle bird droppings and such.Looking at the picture, this seemed like it would suit my needs perfectly.  However, upon receiving the item, I was a bit dismayed that this organizer was HUGE.I don't think I need something this big in my cargo area.  It takes up more room than I would have hoped.  If I have to go shopping or take friends on a long weekend excursion that includes luggage, it seems like this would be the first thing I would need to remove from the vehicle.It arrives folded.  All you need to do is insert the two cardboard base plates to form the box.  It's certainly ample enough to hold just about anything.  As I already noted, perhaps too large.If you have a lot of items you need to lug in the back of your vehicle, I would guess this will perfectly suit your needs.  However, if you are like me and just want an organizer to hold a few sprays and cloths, perhaps you should look for something a little smaller.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17XB482UGRYF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R3LYF7S#wasThisHelpful","R17XB482UGRYF2","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Up until today, I haven't been a huge waffle eater.  Not to say I don't like waffles -- I just don't have the means of making them.In fact, the only time I eat waffles is when I am traveling.  And, you can't imagine the excitement I get from staying at one of those hotels that has the complimentary breakfast that includes the waffle maker that you pour the mix into, flip, and then wait for the beeps to finish.  I mean, sometimes I would race to be at breakfast early enough that I wouldn't have to wait on line to use one of these things.So, the prospect of having one of these waffle makers in my home is something I have been pondering over for quite some time.  One of the big reasons I abstained from an initial purchase is because it's just another device that takes up room on a crowded countertop.  However, as time went on, my inner needs took over, and I ordered one of these devices.This morning, I went from unpacking box to my first batch of waffles in under 15 minutes.For those of you getting to ready to buy one of these babies, I will be more than happy to give you an overview of use -- plus a tip on what kind of mix to buy.To explain how easy it is to go from box to your first set of waffles, here is the quick setup guide...1. Unpack. Plug unit in wall.  Remove the filler shipping inserts from both waffle grills.  Wipe any possible shipping dust (I had none) from each grill using a moist cloth.2. Turn on Waffle Maker unit to preheat.  Set dial to 3.5 (mid-point) as an initial start.  Allow unit to preheat for about 5-7 minutes.  It will beep 6 times to tell you it is ready.3. For first use, prime both waffle grills by spraying or brushing cooking oil on the grills.  Manufacturer claims that you don't need to use any non-stick spray afterwards.4. Once unit beeps 6 times to tell you it is preheated, pour batter into one of the two grills.  Use spatula to even it out.  Close and flip.  Indicator light on grill will go out.  If making another waffle, repeat process for second waffle grill.When waffles are done, the unit will beep three times.I suggest purchasing very cheap plastic waffle tongs.  They will work perfectly in removing your waffles.  This is the one I purchased from Amazon..http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006OVZRT8?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01On my very first try, the waffles came out PERFECT!  I mean, PERFECT!  I couldn't have messed this up if I wanted to.  Put the hot waffles on my plate, doused it with maple syrup....and mmmmmm......perfection.  The 3.5 setting seems to give the perfect balance between delicately crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside.As for what mix to use....I did a lot of research on Amazon.  I poured over reviews of several mixes.  I ended up going with Hungry Jack Belgium Waffle Mix.  The reason was because all one has to do is add water to the mix.  The others require you add eggs and oil or melted butter.  I just didn't want that hassle.And, let me tell you, I don't believe you can get better tasting waffles from a mix that requires all those extras to be added.  When you make waffles, you want it to be a simple process.  Trust me when I say that the Hungry Jack Belgium Waffle Mix makes outstanding waffles.  Certainly the best waffles I have ever tasted.I am completely happy with my new waffle maker.  It's effortless to make outstanding restaurant quality waffles in a short period of time.  Clean up seems non-existent.  The waffles left no residue behind.  Once the unit cools, you simply wipe it down with a cloth.Construction seems very solid.  It certainly doesn't feel cheaply made.  I can't speak for long-term use as today was the first day I have actually used it.  However, I anticipate that it will serve me well for many years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RP5AESX05SY9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0034JU9T6#wasThisHelpful","R2RP5AESX05SY9","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just purchased the Waring Dual Waffle Maker from Amazon.Before receiving the unit, I poured over several Amazon reviews regarding different brands of Belgium Waffle Mix.  I really wanted the best tasting mix that could be had.The thing that turned me off about most of the mixes was the fact I had to add eggs with oil or melted butter.  I had hoped that there would be something a little more simpler to put together in a hurry without worrying about whether I had extra food items in my refrigerator.The Amazon reviews for Hungry Jack Belgium Waffle Mix were very good.  Some said it was the best tasting waffles they have ever had after trying several other mixes.  You can confirm these claims by reading reviews on the single box product.So, I took a chance and ordered the 2-box combo of Hungry Jack.  It arrived at my home in perfect condition.  No problems with the expiration date -- I did not receive old product.Yes, it's as simple as measuring the mix and adding water.  I used the 2-3 Waffles measurement.  It barely made 2 waffles.  Granted, I did fill the first Waffle grill to capacity, so I came up a wee bit short on the second.  However, it's safe to say, you'll get two nicely sized waffles out of this measurement.The taste?  Wow!  I can't see how using the other mixes that require the addition of eggs and butter to be any better than this.  The waffle was perfectly cooked -- crisp on the outside and fluffy inside.  It had a nice, sweet, vanilla-ish taste.  I would go as far as saying it's on par with the best waffles I have eaten.So, yes, you can get outstanding waffles from a mix that just requires water.  I am still sitting here, an hour after digesting, reflecting upon how great my first batch of waffles tasted.Now, I should warn that a box goes very fast.  Just making two waffles, I went through 1/4 of the box, if not more.  If you have a large family or plan to make waffles often, one box will not last you long.  I am glad I went with two boxes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QS4T5DXRPSOQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OEDC89K#wasThisHelpful","R3QS4T5DXRPSOQ","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, let's get to the meat of this review...This is the printer that most of you are going to want to get your hands on. Whether for personal or business use, the WF-R4640 handles all your printing, scanning, faxing and copying needs quickly and flawlessly.I am so happy that Epson gave me the opportunity to test this printer alongside its smaller (and less expensive) sibling, the ET-4500.  I will make references to both printers throughout this review so you have a comparison of why one might suit your needs more than the other.  You can also click on my profile and see my recent review of the ET-4500.So, let's begin, shall we?First of all, this printer is an absolute BEAST.  When it arrives on your doorstep, you will be rather amazed at how large the shipping box is.  Epson recommends that two people take part in lifting this computer.  I am relatively strong and fit, so I was able to do it on my own, though I will admit, it was quite a struggle single-handedly lifting the printer from the ground floor to the upstairs office, hoisting it on a stand.Epson has done an excellent job packing this printer for transport.  It is loaded with tape and inserts that protect all the parts inside.  You will spend the first 5 minutes peeling off dozens of protective tape strips and removing styrofoam inserts.  Quite frankly, I was very pleased that Epson took such care in making certain my printer arrived undamaged.Enclosed with your software disc is a Quick Start Guide.  This is all you need to quickly reference and set up this printer.The first thing I was relieved to find was that the installation of ink is quick and painless.  Now let me use this opportunity to compare the process to the ET-4500, which comes with 4 bottles of ink that you need to manually pour into reservoirs.  It's a somewhat messy process where one needs to wear protective gloves.  Not so with the WF-R4640.  The ink comes in 4 large bags.  You simply shake each bag vigorously for 20 seconds and then insert them into the printer.  What I really liked about this process was the printer's pop-out cartridge in which the bag of ink easily rests upon before being snapped to closure.Oh, and please heed the warnings on the ink bags....don't drink the ink.  :)Turn on the printer and it takes about 12 minutes for the ink to be primed throughout.  That's 8 minutes faster than the ET-4500.A big upgrade on the WF-R4640 is its 4.3"" Color Touch Screen.  It's such a pleasure to use compared to the ET-4500 which is mono and not touch responsive.  I love the fact that I can use the screen as I would my smartphone.  From start to finish, the setup process is executed by simply touching your finger on each selection.  In some cases, there is a small QWERTY keyboard where you can type in your Fax header and phone number.  The color menu is very attractive and makes it so very easy to pick the function you want the WF-R4640 to do.Connecting to the WiFi network was effortless as well.  The hard way of setting up your WiFi network would be to install the enclosed software and connect your Mac/PC to the printer via USB.  However, why go through all that?  Just use the touch screen to select SETUP and then choose the WIFI WIZARD option, which scans for your home network and then prompts you to enter a password.  I had my WF-R4640 connected to my home network in no time.  By the way, I should mention at this point that I use Mac computers in my home and business.  No compatibility issues at all, except for document scanning, which I will talk about shortly.The big reason why you are reading this review is that you want to know about print quality.  I think I am in the perfect position to give you an idea of how well the WF-R4640 compares to most laser printers (as I own a recent, popular Brother laser) as well as an ink-jet printer such as the ET-4500.Epson doesn't describe this model as a ""laser"" printer.  They tout their ""Precision Core"" technology whose performance they claim goes beyond laser.  Quite frankly, that's a claim that is difficult for me to confirm.  I can tell you without hesitation that the WF-R4640 is leaps and bounds ahead of its smaller sibling, the ET-4500 in speed and print quality.  I mean, printed Internet pages with lots of background information came out wet on the inkjet computer.  Not so on the WF-R4640.  At 20 ppm, this printer is 4 times faster than its sibling...and it really shows.  Print jobs were very quick, with results churned through this machine in no time.The Brother 4570 (which is their most popular laser model) boasts 30 ppm, and though that means that its printing is faster, it's not night and day when comparing it to the Epson.I mention the Brother model because that is the laser printer I have been using over the past two years.  Comparing the two, I found the print results to be almost indistinguishable.  Both featured razor-sharp text.  Both produced equally pleasing images, though I would not use either for printing photos.  You really need a specialized printer for that.  The Brother laser provided slightly more vivid/pronounced text and images but the differences were rather subtle.So if already owned a very good laser printer, why did I even consider the Epson WF-R4640?Well, that's a question that's easy to answer on several levels....First, this is an all-in-one machine that meets the needs of a home business like mine.  For the longest time, our office had separate scanner and faxing machines.  We can now get rid of those individual machines and rely upon the Epson to do all of that...and more.  There were no problems sending out a test fax to my old machine.  It was great that the fax contained the header information I had programmed into the Epson.  Copies of documents looked identical to the original, so I am very pleased with the overall copying functionality.  Document scanning worked in principle.  I was able to easily scan a document through the printer's top feeder.  It wirelessly initiated the document capture software on my iMac.  The problem was, the document software on the iMac could not process the document.  Several attempts put the Epson printer into ""interrupt"" mode, which essentially is an error mode.  Now, mind you, I am using a pre-release version of El Capitan OS X.  I have no doubts in my mind that the problems I am experiencing are due to Epson not providing a final software update compatible with the upcoming operating system.  At least I know that the WF-R4640 is communicating wirelessly with my Mac and Epson only needs to provide a software update to fix the document issue.It's kind of funny that I am this far down in the review and I am just starting to talk about this printer's ink capacity...Okay, so you are paying somewhat more for an all-in-one like this.  Well, your investment is in the ink itself.  This printer comes with enough ink to print 20,000 black/20,000 color documents.  Now think about that kind of capacity for a moment.  Even in a busy work environment, that's a lot of ink.  In a home environment, with normal years, it would take years to deplete that supply.  Additionally, it is my understanding that replacing the ink is much cheaper than dealing with cartridge replacements.  So, this is an investment that will pay off in the long run.Epson did provide me both the WF-R4640 and ET-4500 printers to test side-by-side.  Epson made it very clear to me that I could say whatever I want about these two models, be it good or bad.My review of the ET-4500 was not totally favorable because I felt that it wasn't suited for home business use, but rather for families that need a basic printer with all the bells-and-whistles.  I also did not totally approve of print quality and speed.The WF-R4640 is built for business.  It's fast enough to tackle big jobs and the print quality is comparable to expensive laser printers.  With two letter trays, its paper capacity is ample enough that you won't have to keep refilling.  I would not be surprised if this printer becomes the new standard for what other printer companies must now strive for.Please Note: I received the following printer from the manufacturer in exchange for my impartial review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17JC8FMWZ06A9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JFF0#wasThisHelpful","R17JC8FMWZ06A9","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't fully take credit for the title of this review.  Upon browsing through other reviews (prior to receiving my own unit), I saw another customer describe the Epson ET-4500 as a ""$400 machine with $100 features.""  I took the liberty of putting my own spin into that opinion.Truth be, this really is a low-end ink-jet printer with expensive features tacked on.  Don't look at that opinion as a total slam against the ET-4500.  You really are getting a rather excellent all-in-one printer that offers copy print, scan, copy and fax functionality.  While many other printer companies offer similar products for hundreds less, the ET-4500 offers enough ink in the box to outlast the competition.  Epson claims there is 20 cartridges worth of ink included.  I would estimate that Epson is on the money here.I really had to take a step backwards when I tested this printer over the course of a weekend.  I am a small business owner who has used laser printers for my needs.  So, it was very odd for me to see this printer where, instead of installing cartridges, I was filling reservoirs with different colored bottles of ink.So, the first thing I need to point out is that there is a more elaborate setup process to this printer than one would normally expect.  However, using the enclosed quick-start guide, it pretty much becomes a no-brainer from start to finish.  However, I wasn't prepared to don a pair of rubber gloves as I unscrewed bottles of ink and poured them into individual tanks.  Now I warn you -- and please heed this advice --- you MUST wear gloves when handling the ink.  It *looks* as if you can easily pour the bottles into the tank without a single drip.  However, it's more involved than that.  You have to first unscrew the cap, remove the protective foil, screw the cap back on, remove the cap tip, and then ""squirt"" ink into the tanks.  In doing that, it is guaranteed that you will get ink on your hands.  Also, be certain to put a newspaper underneath the printer to catch any protective foil or dripping ink.  After the ink reservoirs are filled, you will be walked through a setup that includes a 20-minute wait as the ink does an initial circulation through the machine.Though the Epson ET-4500 comes with a software disc to walk you through internet connectivity, I was easily able to set most everything up using the 2.2"" mono screen which resides on printer's front panel.  I simply went into setup -> network settings -> WiFi Setup and had the printer scan for my wireless network.  I entered my password and...voila!...the printer connected easily.  There is even a little WiFi icon that remains ever present on the home screen letting you know its connected.  At that point, any person using a device connected to your home network has access to that printer.  That's good for me, as I set this up as a centralized household printer where anyone in my family, including guests, can print from their phone/tablet/computer.All of Epson's features worked flawlessly.  I was able to perform a document scan, make a copy of a newspaper article, and fax an article to my fax machine.  Of course, I tested all sorts of basic printing options from Internet websites as well as documents I had stored on my computer.So, here is the rub...Although the Epson flawlessly executes all of its functions, it does it exceedingly slow.  I am used to a laser printer spitting out a printed copy within seconds of firing up.This Epson reminds me of my very first ink-jet printer well over a decade ago.  It prints as if it's actually drawing each character as the paper goes from feeder to output tray.  You sit and watch for what seems like a good half minute as your document gets printed.  It's not the kind of speed someone doing business work would want to see.  The same kind of ""chug-along"" speed is experienced when scanning and copying.  It's just not speedy enough for my preferences.Additionally, I was somewhat disappointed with its print quality.  For basic document prints, the results were pretty damn good.  Though not quite laser quality, I was pretty happy with how professional printed documents looked.  Where I really was disappointed was when I printed a webpage or photo filled with lots of colors and background images.  The paper actually came out wet.  As I picked up the document, ink smeared on my fingers.  Yeah, this is ink-jet alright.  I suppose if I had just let the paper dry before handling, it would have been okay.  Lesson learned.However, the reality of the situation is this...To get into a business all-in-one that gives you the professional quality speed and printing quality someone like me desires, I would have to pay at least twice this price.  Epson has introduced the WF-R4640 alongside this model.  I am being sent one to review.  It supposedly offers faster speeds and print quality that rivals (or exceeds) laser printers.  I will be putting that model through its paces over the next few weeks and I invite you to reference that model on Amazon to read my review when it posts.  I will attempt to revisit this review and post a direct link here.All that being said...I have to put myself in the mindset that the Epson ET-4500 is a budget printer with lots of bells and whistles intended for family use.  Put in that perspective, this printer performs admirably.  I mean, you get all the functions that an office printer would offer.  It performs all these functions beautifully.  For general family or personal use, most people won't mind that it performs all these functions more slowly than professional models.The Epson ET-4500 is well built.  It looks rather handsome sitting in our living room where it can be accessed by everyone.  Best of all, it contains enough ink that I don't have to worry about having to replace anything despite the heavy usage that it will receive.  Remember, you are making an investment in a printer that comes with an abundance of ink -- much more than any other printer being offered -- and the option of cheaper refills once it runs out. This is the reason why it costs more than competing all-in-one printers.My final recommendation is that the Epson ET-4500 should not be a consideration for business owners or anyone looking for professional laser quality speed or printing results.  Please wait for my review of the WF-R4640 in the next few weeks.  For those who want a cheaper all-in-one that is well-built and sacrifices speed for great bells-and-whistles, should consider the ET-4500.  It's perfect for home use, by everyone in the family, who can take advantage of being able to print wirelessly from their favorite device.Please Note: I received the following printer from the manufacturer in exchange for my impartial review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R70GFY9UAMDNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JEHE#wasThisHelpful","R70GFY9UAMDNX","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recently adopted a small dog and wanted to take her with me on trips.I own a luxury vehicle and the last thing I wanted was for my pet to destroy the front bucket seat.The Alfheim dog cover is perfect for my needs, although I was also considering the KIRGO cover which is much more expensive.  Glad I stuck with this brand.It comes with absolutely no instructions but it's quite elementary to figure out how to install.  There are two straps on the cover.  The first (at top) goes over the headrest and fastens with one loop going in the bottom slit and then through the top.  Pull to lock.  The second (in the middle) fastens in exactly the same manner.The bottom skirt fits perfectly across my rather wide-bottom 2016 Lincoln MKX seat.The seat cover seems to be made of durable material.  It isn't bulky, and really, doesn't look that out of place that it cheapens the look of my interior.  If I have anyone riding with me in my vehicle, it seems a ""snap"" to remove the seat cover.If there were anything different I would prefer about this seat cover would be plastic buckle fasteners (for easy connect and disconnects) rather than having to manually loop the strap through two slits -- which I can see being a real pain-in-the-neck if having to continually remove and install this seat cover.Oh....and if you have taken the time to read this review and make it to this point, a little extra surprise for you (and apparently ME): There is an included pouch to store your seat cover when not in use.

"After reading dozens upon dozens of Amazon reviews, I knew what I was possibly getting into when buying this scale.  I almost didn't do it, but there was the temptation to try it with the knowledge that I could return it....and return it I did.First of all, if you purchase this very expensive scale, know right out of the gate that Withings offers no customer support.  Oh, you can go to their website or use their app and see their encouragement for you to write an Amazon review.  However, the company has absolutely no presence on Amazon, addressing disgruntled customers when their product fails to work as promised.  Go to their online support, send them an email, and get nothing in return.  They don't answer support questions/complaints.So, basically, when you buy this product hope that anything that goes wrong with it does so within the Amazon return period.  Anything beyond that and you may be royally screwed.Next...To even set this scale up, you must have a smartphone capable of running the Withings app.  You cannot simply set it up with your PC.  You must also have a wireless WiFi connection in your home.  Don't rely on bluetooth because that connection will not be stable and you will not be able to use increased functions such as weather reports.Initially, I did not have a smooth setup process with this scale.  I almost sent the product back.  My issue was that, using the Withings app, I paired the Smart Body Analyzer scale to my iPhone 6 Plus via bluetooth.  When the option to pair it WiFi appeared on my screen, it would not advance the app any further.  In other words, the screen became stuck.  The only option I could select was ""I have no Wifi connection"" (despite the fact I did).  So, I had to solely rely on Bluetooth.  Big mistake.  Every time I left the house and came back home, the bluetooth connection would not automatically re-establish itself.  This is a common problematic theme for most reviews on Amazon.Of course, I wrote customer support an email.  However, as indicated throughout dozens of Amazon reviews, customer support does not exist.  Some have claimed to have gotten email responses from Withings, but those instances seem to be far and few.As I noted, I was about to send this product back until, very quietly, Withings issued an update to their iOS app.  It was if Withings had read my email support complaint and addressed the issue without bothering to respond to me directly.  The update solved the WiFi connection issue and allowed me to pair my phone with my home's wireless network.Once the scale was paired over WiFi, then I saw the benefits.  I was able to use more of the scale's features including daily weather report.  All my daily weigh-in's were automatically sent to my iPhone and computer, maintaining its connection from day to day.That's not to say that in the past week that I have owned this scale that things haven't been perfect.  Today, the scale decided not to give me my heart rate reading but reported everything else.  Not sure if that problem will continue or not.At first, I decided to keep the scale because I actually liked what it did when it actually worked.  In conjunction with the iPhone app, it keeps a daily progress of my weight and actually tells me how I am doing towards reaching my goals.  The Withings app is quite good, integrates with the Apple iOS health app, and since I also own their wireless Blood Pressure Monitor, it keeps all my readings in one place.I just worry about the longevity of this piece of hardware.  When you have a good handful of reviews that complain about deficiencies in the product, combined with a total lack of support from the manufacturer, one worries about whether they are buying a sound product for the exorbitant price.UPDATE: This morning my ""stable"" WiFi connection stopped working.  The scale appeared to work as normal, but was not transmitting weight data to my WiFi network and the Withings app as it had done initially.  I went through multiple attempts to re-establish an Internet connection by pushing the PAIR button on the scale.  Each time it failed to connect to my wireless network.One of the biggest things missing from this Smart Body Analyzer is a simple BLUETOOTH or WIFI indication on the display screen, actually alerting the user that there is a connection taking place....because, really, one has no idea if information is even transmitted/recorded until one opens the app or goes to the Withings website and logs in.  Today, I waited hours for this morning's weigh-in information that never came.  Once again, the WiFi and scale stopped communicating with each other.  And, no, it's not my router.  I am a computer guru.  I have multiple hi-tech gadgets in my home accessing my wireless network and none of them act as erratically as this poorly designed device.Frankly, I am tired of of having to play with connections on an almost daily basis.  I should have listened to the reviews.  I should have abstained from purchasing a product like this when there were so many inconsistent Amazon reviews.If the company can't stand behind this product -- if they can't make a presence on Amazon -- then they surely must be aware that these problems exist and are doing whatever they can to hide themselves from public response.And be careful of positive reviews from reviewers who don't have a VERIFIED purchase beneath their name.  A lot of positive reviews being printed on Amazon from folks that don't have that moniker.  There is a good chance that Withings is posting a wealth of good reviews in hopes of countermanding the bad ones from those who have VERIFIED PURCHASE beneath their name.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22Q0SA2GZMDTG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BKRQ4E8#wasThisHelpful","R22Q0SA2GZMDTG","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am in my early 50s and recently been diagnosed with mildly high blood pressure levels by my physician.  This is after a lifetime of having perfect blood pressure (and I am in the best physical shape of my life).I had been planning for quite some time to purchase one of these wireless blood pressure monitors and was keeping an eye on the reviews for the Qardio brand that is also sold on Amazon.  However, after all the negative reviews over hardware and sync failures with that brand, I knew I had to look at something else.  Actually, what finally drove me to Withings was the 5-star reviews of its app on the iTunes store.  There's nothing worse than a strong product that comes with a lousy iOS/Android app.  Fortunately, Withings comes through with flying colors in both departments.Out of box, setup was easy.  With batteries already loaded, I simply hit the bluetooth button on the cuff and paired it with my Apple phone.  I would recommend that purchasers install the app first, launch it, and have it walk you through the process.I would also recommend that before you hit the START button on the app and take your first reading, to click on the settings icon on the upper corner of the app and have it automatically take three readings to average out your readings.I was pleasantly surprised, using the enclosed instruction booklet, how easy it is to place this cuff above the elbow, wrap, and take a reading.  It's really effortless.  The results are not only sent to my iOS device, but readings are logged within the app and can easily be shared or emailed to my physician.Have not had to change the batteries yet, so I don't know how difficult that process will be.  There is a screw at the bottom of the cuff tube to access the batteries, though I am concerned about it becoming stripped over time.  I would be very, very gentle with any coin used to open it.I also, at the time of purchase of this Blood Pressure monitor, put the Withings Body Scale in my cart.  At the last minute, I removed it due to a few negative reviews and the mention that there is no customer support from this company.  That is concerning.  However, now that I have seen the Withings app in action and the fact that it supports all their fitness products, I have gone ahead and ordered the body scale.  It's kind of cool that I can track my weight gain/loss and blood pressure numbers all in one app, sent wirelessly, without me having to do anything than just use the products.So far, I am very happy with this Blood Pressure Monitor.  If I have any problems I will come back and update the review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20BBVQVFJ6707/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H43WOAK#wasThisHelpful","R20BBVQVFJ6707","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I turned my basement into a Home Theater room.  I wasn't initially motivated to do it, because the basement space is shared with a separate cellar where all kinds of varmints seem to find their way inside.I wasn't aware of how bad the situation was until I installed these inexpensive pest catcher trays.Within a few days, I found the trays littered with crickets and spiders.  Additionally, the tray has trapped a multitude of mice that get caught and cannot escape.So, this tray is hugely effective at catching all sorts of pests.  I would highly recommend its purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H6HJS052GMZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PUOW4QO#wasThisHelpful","R1H6HJS052GMZV","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amazon features many of these type of new LED Desk lamps and it's hard to distinguish which is better than the other.  About two months ago I bought a cheaper LED lamp from another company, and thought I like it, it's not as advanced as this one.In fact, I may have never bought this Coocheer product if not for the price it dropped $20 in sale price after I had been watching it for a few days.Just received the lamp this morning and within mere minutes from taking it out of the box, I had it assembled and plugged in.Assembly is pretty straight-forward.  No need to read instructions.  Take all the plastic protection off the product.  Put the light and swivel arm into the desk base and use the large hand screw to lock it into place.The great thing about this lamp is that it saves a great deal of space on your desktop when not in use.  All you simply do is collapse the light upon itself.  It sits, almost unnoticed, until you are ready to use it.  At that point, you unfold and extend and swivel it to your needed use.The light has several different power levels including: reading, relaxing, study and sleep.  As a desk lamp I really didn't need all these settings but it's nice to have.  As a bedside lamp, I can see how these settings would come into use.The great thing about LED lighting is that one, it's very relaxing on the eyes compared to bulb lighting.  Secondly, there is much more life longevity to be had with this kind of technology.If there are any real negative points to be observed they would be firstly, that the lamp could be a bit brighter.  For large desks, I think the light barely illuminates an entire area.  Fortunately, the lamp can be easily moved for the coverage you need.  Secondly, the piano black model does collect quite a bit of fingerprints.  This is a lamp that will need to be wiped down often.  Also not happy with its overly large plug that takes up more than one space on my extension strip.Still, I give it five stars.  It's a quality-made product.  I like it.  Think it's a bit overpriced so I would definitely watch it for when it goes on sale.Haven't tested it it with my iPhone 6.  All the reviews say it works well with that, so I am going to go on a leap of faith that I will have no problems.  Nice to have a built-in USB charger at my disposal.You can buy this product and be assured you are getting a nice quality desk or bedside lamp.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B9792LSN0VBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TDN3NRW#wasThisHelpful","R1B9792LSN0VBL","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's rather amazing to see how inexpensive flash drives have become.For just under $30 I picked up this SanDisk 128GB USB 3.0 drive for my Macbook Pro.  I mean, just a few years ago, one would pay a small fortune for a drive of this capacity.The thing I really like about this drive is that it's so small, once inserted into your portable computer, it will become part of the laptop itself.Mind you, it's not exactly flush to the laptop.  There is 1/8"" of hardware sticking out from the side once fully inserted.  Is it an eyesore?  No.  Does it prevent proper insertion into a laptop bag?  Does it make using your laptop more difficult or less portable?  No, no and NO!I suppose those who want perfection will nitpick that the drive slightly sticks out.  Everyone else will be quite content.Why do you need one of these drives?  Imagine being able to add 128GB of storage to your laptop or desktop computer.  Not only that, but 128GB of super-fast SSD storage.  If your computer already has an SSD drive in it, you will be amazed by how quickly files transfer from drive to drive.  I will be up front that I don't know much about transfer speeds, but having a Macbook Pro with a built-in SSD, I see my files back up several times faster to the SanDisk than they did to a physical hard drive.This flash drive is so unobtrusive, it remains virtually hidden from sight.  You'll forget its plugged into your desktop computer.  You will almost forget its plugged into your laptop.  Those with a Macbook will appreciate it's silver and black colors that go perfectly with the keyboard.Just a reminder for Mac users:  Go into Applications -> Utilities -> Disk Utility.  Click on the SanDisk SSD drive in the left column.  Click on the ERASE button in Disk Utility.  Give your drive a name and select OS X EXTENDED (Journaled) to format the drive in something your Mac will recognize.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R286SQ2Q1YPRMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YFI1EBC#wasThisHelpful","R286SQ2Q1YPRMO","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know a little about quality spoons.  My mother owned a really nice set of spoons -- a heirloom from a bygone area -- when kitchen dishes and utensils were made with care.  I mean, the spoon to the handle had rivets in it.After decades of owning these spoons, one of them finally broke.  Of course, when a utensil that has served your family so well for past decades finally breaks, it's tough to find something to replace it.I spent time pouring over Amazon reviews of several spoons.  The OXO steel spoon seemed to get the most favorable feedback.  Of course, one is still gambling when they don't have the opportunity to actually see the product in person.  As I usually do, I ordered this product blindly hoping for the best.Just unpackaged the two spoons I ordered this morning.  My Mom and I were very impressed.  In fact, so much so, we just stood there holding the spoons for quite a few minutes admiring its build quality and weight.This is a nice, hefty spoon with a great handle that looks as if it will last forever.  There is no question that this is quality built through and through.  I mean, for $10 a spoon, you can't go wrong.Do what I did when I read other positive Amazon reviews.  Take my word for it that this will be an outstanding serving spoon that will last for many years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QCODEE5GLZ9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004OCMQ#wasThisHelpful","R3QCODEE5GLZ9V","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently rearranged my workspace, and as thus, had to move from a convenient under desk drawer to having to place my keyboard on the desk itself.Not a big deal, but certainly not as ergonomically friendly.So, I searched Amazon for a nice wrist pad.  Didn't mind paying more for something that was comfortably padded and built to last.I believe I found that with the Glorious Gaming Wrist Pad.  It seems well built, it's very comfortable, and it has non-slip backing that prevents the pad from moving anywhere while in use.It's essentially PERFECT except for one glaring problem...The logo on the front.  It's rather large and ugly.  It features a bearded man character next to the company name.  There's no need to put that kind of obtrusive advertising across the front of a really nice product.  Why not put it underneath?  What kind of ego played into the logo placement?  Really, it takes a perfect product and makes it seem....well....silly.Still, I suppose the one downside is outweighed by the upsides of having a really great wrist rest against your wrist.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19415AFCY2Q10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5AXPTW#wasThisHelpful","R19415AFCY2Q10","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On and off, over the past year, I have been looking for a suitable replacement to my current wallet which always is left ""somewhere"" other than my pants pocket because it's too large and heavy.  Filled with about nearly two dozen different cards, it has become enormously thick and unattractive.A simple Google search for ""best thinnest mens wallet"" brought me to an article that compared many of the best rated wallets.  The Allet Classic Leather Wallet was among those in that group.  First thing I did was come to Amazon and read the many, many positive reviews.  Of course, you can sit here and read dozens of praises and still come away not believing you are going to get a wallet that truly satisfies you.So, I took a chance and ordered this wallet.  What the heck.  It costs under $40 and I figured if I didn't like it, I could return it.The wallet arrived last evening.  Taking it out of the package it seemed quite nice.  It's made of pliable leather and rip-stop nylon.  This morning, I began loading my credit, bank and reward cards into the 4 compartments that align both sides of the wallet.  I put a wad of bills into the cash compartment and then folded everything up.Amazing!  Absolutely Amazing!  You really have to see it for yourself to believe it.That bulky mess of a wallet I used to own was streamlined into something neat and compact.  I was actually easily able to slide it into the front of my pants with no resulting bulge.  I mean, for the first time in memory, I actually want to put my wallet in my pants pocket.This wallet totally redefines everything we used to know about our wallet.  We don't need long, horizontal wallets with center flaps that encourage us to stuff as much crap as we can inside of it.  Allet has created a more vertical design, keeping it simple, keeping it thin.You really need to experience this wallet for yourself.

"I am probably the toughest critic against Spigen's original Apple watch case.  If you look at their thin exact fit model (42mm) you will clearly find my Amazon review labeled ""DO NOT BUY.""That was a very stern warning, which apparently hundreds of Amazon buyers chose to ignore, and thus quickly discovered that they made a huge mistake.  The original Apple watch case from Spigen was a horrible product.  It fit so loosely around the watch that it easily popped off.  I went through three of those cases and each one was lost.  There were hundreds of complaints from Amazon purchasers who had similar problems.I must say that Spigen Customer Support was pretty damn good to me.  They sent me replacements, and finally recommended I look at their Tough Armor case.  I decided to order it and I can clearly say at this point that I am very, very happy.The biggest con to this case is that it's an inconvenience to install and remove it.  To do so, you must remove one of the two sides of the watch band and pull the rubber casing over the entire watch until it fits into place.  You must do the same thing to remove it.  It's not a simple pop on and pop off product.That being said, the upside is that no matter what, the case will not come off.  And you know what?  After going through multiple cases and having them all pop off, I am kind of relieved by having something like this and don't quite mind the extra effort of putting it on and off when I want to look more formal vs. having protection for my watch while at work.This ""Tough Armor"" case doesn't add as much bulk as I had anticipated, although it does turn a very handsome wrist wear into something that looks like an old Casio watch.  Still, for those of us who are blue collar workers and are prone to scratching our watches, this level of protection is a godsend.This case also comes with a face guard, which I am kind of scratching my head about its inclusion.  Does one really need a guard over the face of their watch?  Well, that's your decision.  Me?  I threw the face guards out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBC2YRP23FSE2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVSOWBY#wasThisHelpful","RBC2YRP23FSE2","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have always loved the concept of Listerine strips.  Imagine not having to lug around a bottle of mouthwash liquid when you get that ""icky"" feeling in your mouth.These little strips simply slide out of the dispenser, onto your tongue, and dissolve instantly to give you that ""clean mouth"" freshness.I have used the ordinary flavor in the past and decided to try Arctic Berry.  Wow.  Really like the flavor blast it initially gives you.  Was a really neat idea for Listerine to make other flavors available.  I can't find these flavors in my Costco store, so it was nice that I could order it on Amazon.The only problem I ran into is that the one-at-a-time dispense method doesn't always work.

"I used to carry around a huge, soft lunch bag around my shoulder.  It was always much bigger than what I had actually needed it for, so when it finally fell apart, I decided to downsize and go with the Coleman 9 can cooler in gray.Unfortunately, the size of the cooler is much smaller than what is depicted.  I like to bring sport size bottles of Poland Spring water to work. They don't fit snuggly in the cooler.  You can actually fit two of them in there, but they slant upwards and rest up against the zipping portion of the bag.  Not ideal, but it's the only way I can fit them in there.If you are the kind of person that brings a sandwich and perhaps a can or two of beverage to work, then this cooler's size will work perfectly for you.The bag itself is well made and seems quite durable.  However, as others have suggested, the strap is not long enough to wear around your shoulder.  You can do it, but the bag itself will hang closer to your neck than it will your waist.Just be aware that this bag is quite small and is only meant for a few cans, a piece of fruit, a sandwich and perhaps a cold pack.

"I have a home theater room filled with posters inside frames.  I was looking for a slightly smaller frame to fit a 24x36 movie poster that I had purchased.  Didn't want anything expensive, but wanted a frame that wouldn't look cheap.Went to many different stores to look at frames in the $20-$30 price range.  They all looked either cheaply made or had a plexiglass covering that was cracked.  Site reviews also reported that some of the frames were so cheaply made that they would not hang straight, but rather bowed towards the bottom.So, after reading positive reviews about this frame, I went ahead and blindly bought it from Amazon.I was pleasantly pleased to find that the frame fit my needs PERFECTLY.  First, I need to talk about the manner in which it was shipped.  It came double boxed, with a secure cardboard wrap around the frame itself.  This meant no matter how badly the package is handled in delivery, the frame is highly protected against damage.  That was very nice to see.The frame itself looks great!  It isn't overly expensive (under $40), but looks expensive.  It has a wood frame with plexiglass covering.  The plexiglass has peel-off protective wrapping on BOTH sides so that it arrives unscratched.  In addition, you get all the necessary hooks, screws and wiring to mount the frame to the wall.  A complete package where you need not buy any additional hardware.As far as the poster fit?  Perfect!  My 24x36 movie poster fit perfectly inside with no information lost along the sides.I cannot recommend a better frame in this price category.  You should be quite pleased with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VKQH74J9S21F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001K4BYDC#wasThisHelpful","R2VKQH74J9S21F","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

For the most part, these services are generally secure, though there are always chances that your data could be lost or compromised.What if you had the opportunity to have your own secured server right in your very home that could be accessed from just about anywhere?  That is the promise of Seagate's newest product, Personal Cloud Home Media Storage.  Once connected to your home router, you simply connect with your home PC (Mac or Windows), upload your valuable photos, videos, documents and music to your personal cloud, and have it instantly accessible on every computer, tablet and smartphone you own, wherever you may be. Additionally, Seagate advertises that you can view all this content via streaming to your SmartTV.Out of the box, Seagate provides everything you need for immediate hook-up including ethernet cable that gets connected to your wiring.Seagate makes installation an absolute breeze.  In fact, out of box, I had it set up in under 8 minutes.  I simply plugged the media storage unit into the wall, and then using the supplied ethernet cable, made a connection to my home router, a few feet away.  Seagate provides excellent instructions for connection your Mac or Windows PC.  Essentially, for my Mac, once the unit was connected to my router, I could see a personal server icon in my finder window.  Once clicking on that icon, I was able to begin the initial setup by further clicking on the URL icon file.This would be a good time to talk about the different personal cloud storage models that Seagate makes available. There are three single bay units in 3TB, 4TB and 5TB sizes.  These are for budget-minded individuals that just want maximum storage space.  The more expensive 2-Bay models come in 4TB, 6TB and 8TB sizes.  These allow you to split the maximum storage size in half so that anything you upload is automatically copied to another bay.  This gives you the most protection for your data as if one hard drive ever fails, your secondary has a copy.  The photo above illustrates my 2-bay 8TB model.  I have the option of having 8TB of data available to me.  However, I chose to use a RAID setup where all my data would be dispersed across two 4TB drives for maximum protection.Uploading your files to your personal server couldn't be more simple.  Seagate creates a PUBLIC and PRIVATE folder for my data.  Anything placed in the public folder can be accessed remotely by yourself or anyone you give permission to access it.  The PRIVATE folder is securely kept on your computer and cannot be accessed from your remote devices.  You can set this personal cloud storage device to perform automatic Time Machine (Mac) or Windows backups, if you choose to do so.  I have not tried to restore from Time Machine, but I am concerned about some reviews on Amazon that cite the Time Machine backup does not work as it should through this device.I should also note that the Seagate Personal Cloud unit has two USB ports (USB 2.0 and 3.0) for attaching and backing up an existing external drive you may already own.Through the Device Manager you can also configure your personal server to automatically back up its data to popular online cloud services such as Dropbox and Google Drive.Download the free SeagateMedia app for your mobile device and you have complete access to all the files in your PUBLIC folder (but not your PRIVATE folder).  This means you can access photos and documents as well as stream your music and videos directly from your server no matter where you are.  While access speed to various media was faster on a WiFi network (whether my own or another), I was able to successfully stream video while on my AT&T LTE cellular network.A great feature of the SeagateMedia app (at least as tested on iOS devices) is that you can automatically set it up to immediately upload any photo or video that you take with your iPhone or iPad.  This means that the moment you capture your precious event, it's available on your personal server.  Photos and videos that were previously uploaded to my iOS devices prior to installing the Seagate Personal Cloud were instantly uploaded to the server and available for viewing.The SeagateMedia app is available for iOS, Android and Windows phone.Note that for computer to computer access to your personal cloud, you need to be on the same WiFi network.  I could not access my Seagate device on my laptop once I left my home WiFi network.  It would be nice to see Seagate provide an access app for the desktop at some future point.While the SeagateMedia app does an admirable job of allowing you to access your files, it seems ill-conceived and unusually bloated, for which I question what Seagate was thinking of in the first place.  The app comes preloaded with thumbnails filled with videos of sharks, kittens, architecture and more.  It has absolutely nothing to do with your personal files and it serves, at least for me, to make it more difficult to find your content.  When you do finally get to the meat of the application, you'll find that your videos, pictures and music are somewhat neatly organized.Both Chromecast and Roku offer the SeagateMedia app so that you can essentially stream your content to your display.  I tested out the app on Roku and was very disappointed with the results.  While I was able to access and view photos and videos that resided on my iOS device, I was not able to access any content uploaded to my Seagate Personal Cloud.  At the time of posting this review, Seagate tech support was unable to figure out the problem.  As with the iOS version, the Roku SeagateMedia app seemed half-baked, and browsing through folders and having to deal with the bloated content seems like a rather unimaginative experience.Final ThoughtsThough not as all-around refined as I had hoped, at its core, the Seagate Personal Cloud ideally serves its purpose as a storage device that can be accessed most anywhere.  You can use it with software (such as Time Machine on the Mac) to regularly backup and restore your computer.  You can access all your files while on the road through the SeagateMedia application.  Owning one of these devices eliminates the need to pay high monthly costs for online storage systems.PROS* Simple and quick installation to your PC. Plug it in and configure in mere minutes* Access to all your documents, files, music and videos from any computer on your home WiFi Network* Access to all your documents, files, music and videos on your iOS, Android and Windows mobile devices as well as Roku and Chromecast.  Works over WiFI or Cellular connection via SeagateMedia app.* Very effective for computer backups such as Time Machine on Mac or similar software on Windows operating system.  Be aware, however, some reviews on Amazon cite the Time Machine backup not to work as it should through this device.* 2-Bay models have mirrored raid connection for extra protection of your most valuable data* Set up Seagate Personal Cloud to automatically sync data with Dropbox, Google Drive and other popular online cloud servicesCONS* Mobile app is bloated with preinstalled videos.  Finding your content can be cumbersome.  Seems like not much thought was put into providing a simpler, more enriched mobile experience* Could not access personal content through SeagateMedia application on Roku device despite several attempts to work out bugs with Seagate supportOverall, I'm not overly blown away by this cloud server and its remote access, but I am somewhat satisfied with the limited things I have been able to do with my Seagate Personal Cloud.  This is definitely a product that could use further refinement, and one hopes that Seagate will put that effort forward.  Until then, it simply serves its most basic purpose.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UXF3LZ9ZVWDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PZZZE7O#wasThisHelpful","R2UXF3LZ9ZVWDA","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like everyone else, one of the biggest fears I have is a failed water heating system that causes a flood in my basement.  Happened about 13 years ago and it's an issue I never want to revisit again.Always wanted to get an auto-shutoff valve.  Did a lot of research, but in the end, the biggest mistake I made was to try and save some money and buy the cheapest solution.You get what you pay for.This product is total garbage that did nothing but give us hours of heartache trying to figure out why it wasn't working.My brother is a plumber.  He fitted this valve to our water heater.  First of all, the valve ends did not match properly.  He was able to somehow alleviate that problem.  However, as soon as it was installed and plugged in, the device went into flood mode whereas it started beeping loudly and closed the hot water heating valve.We spent a good hour trying to figure out how to reset the device, which we could not.  We had to dismantle this product to manually open the hot water valve.There is absolutely no customer support information in the instructions to be found anywhere, so we couldn't even call the company for support.Looking at the gear inside the valve motor, you could see it was cheap plastic.  The gear only moved once when inserting the batteries.  Other than that, there was no gear movement (which opens and closes the valve) whether you pushed the OPEN or CLOSE button.Yes, I am aware there are positive Amazon reviews for this product.  However, do yourself a huge favor.  GOOGLE this product and read the multitude of complaints from buyers that could not get the valve to open once this product was installed.  One review is from a plumber that pleads people not to waste their money on this brand.This is absolutely going back to Amazon this week.  I opted to spend another $130 for another brand (FloodMaster) from another company.  Figure if I wanted a quality device I should just pay more money for one.EDIT:  My brother just installed a Floodmaster unit.  As noted above, it costs $130 more, but my brother was so pleased by the simplicity of the installation and the quality of the product.  As a plumber, he asked me to warn as many people as I could not to buy cheap junk like the Floodstop and go for the Floodmaster instead.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ID1P03KUL6ZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EA426X6#wasThisHelpful","R1ID1P03KUL6ZI","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I consider myself to be a coffee snob.  Like most people, I enjoy good coffee.  I go to the expensive coffee shops, buy my coffee whole bean, then grind and brew.I owned a very expensive Technivorm Coffee Brewer for several years.  When it recently died, a lot of online research brought me to the Bonita BV1800SS.  It was a tough choice to buy this brewer, as Amazon reviews were very mixed.  However, I took a gamble and had one recently delivered to my home.I'll get right to the point -- it makes perhaps the best coffee I have ever tasted.  Certainly better than the more expensive Technivorm.  That being said, I am brewing a little differently than I had.  The big change is the filter.  With the Technovorm, I was using a gold filter.  Most coffee snobs don't like these gold filters as the water passes through them too quickly.  The Bonavita comes with samples of brown filter paper which I indeed did find to be far better than the gold filter I had been using.  The coffee itself may not be as piping hot as I would have liked, but this machine does indeed make a smooth, delicious cup of java.That being said, this is one of the most ill-designed coffee brewers I have used.First of all, the brewing process is absolutely inane. There is no separate filter basket drawer on the machine.  You actually have to unscrew the carafe lid and place the filter basket on top of the carafe, insert it into the brewer, and brew the coffee.  Then, once the coffee is brewed, you remove the bulky filter basket from the carafe, screw on the lid, and pour your coffee.Now, most people won't want to screw on the carafe lid -- especially if making a single cup of coffee.  It's impossible to pour the coffee without that carafe lid attached without spilling some of it on the counter.Another problem, as I briefly stated above, is that it doesn't quite make piping hot coffee.  It's hot, but once you add a smidgen of creamer or milk, it substantially cools itself down.Finally, there isn't a hot plate to maintain the temperature of the coffee.  My model has the stainless steel carafe, but I don't trust it's going to keep the coffee hot for long periods of time.I should also mention that this coffee maker is a steam machine.  See those vents atop the brewing area?  They eject clouds of steam.  So, if the coffee maker is stored under a cabinet you risk ruining that cabinet with the hot escaping steam.  I simply pull the coffee maker forward, away from the cabinets, when doing my morning brew.For the most part, I'm happy with this coffee maker because, damn, it makes a great cup of coffee.  However, one really gets the feeling that after plunking down some serious change for this coffee maker, that some corners have been cut to sacrifice quality for price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33ZCTXWBR4XIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P7T4WK8#wasThisHelpful","R33ZCTXWBR4XIU","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew I was going to buy these lights and be somewhat disappointed.I needed LED lighting to add some ambiance to my basement home theater.  The lighting would reside atop and below the edges of my 118"" diagonal front screen and along the front speakers.The first obstacle to buying these lights are the price.  They are at least 3x expensive than ordinary LED strip lights.  Yes, they are a cut above what you can get cheaper because of the hub and mobile app control, but not that much better that they should cost $90 a strip -- especially when some of that may very well get cut and wasted.Secondly, these lights are not too bright.  In a totally darkened home theater room they really didn't do a good job of adding punch to the objects they were supposed to highlight.  You really need to double up on these lights to get the output you would want -- but who wishes to do that when they are so darn expensive.I did send a personal email to Philips telling them that they should reconsider their pricing for these lights.  Heard no response back.Installation is fairly easy.  You simply plug in hue bridge (and you need the starter kit to even use these lights) and then each strip of light.  A webpage tutorial takes you through setting up an account and then giving instructions on how to connect everything together.  The hue bridge needs to be plugged into a router.  I wish it was simply WiFi accessible so I can place it anywhere I want, but just another minor annoyance that adds up to disappointment.I use the iPhone and iPad mobile app to control the lights.  It's kind of cool that you can change the colors right on the mobile apps as well as turn on/off/dim each individual strand.It's a tough call whether to recommend these lights.  I spent $600 on a starter kit and 4 additional single kits in order to accomplish what I needed.  In the end, I can't say it was worth the money.  The light output is miserable.However....The ease of use, hue bridge connection and mobile apps make this one of the very few ""sure thing"" choices when you want the most control over your lighting.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9W9VWQ4Z33YV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I12XOES#wasThisHelpful","R9W9VWQ4Z33YV","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bought a Macbook Pro about two years ago.Was shocked to find that the MagSafe adapter cord starting fraying right at the point where it joined the power brick.I was even more shocked -- and became very angry -- when I went to the Apple store to read review after review of the same problem happening to other Apple owners.  It is very apparent to me that the fraying of the cord is a very common problem.I wrote a very angry letter to Tim Cook.  That letter got forwarded on to Apple Support.  I got a phone call from them explaining how to take better care of the cord (how to properly wrap it), but no offer to compensate me for the $80 I had to spend on a replacement that has effected hundreds of other Apple users.So, the point I am making here is that there is a problem with these cords.  They are not made strong enough to withstand normal usage.  Apple is doing nothing to improve its manufacturing.Yes, these work perfectly.

"Based on overwhelmingly positive Amazon reviews, I purchased this iPad holder blindly.Used it with my older iPad 3.  The fit was not perfect.  With the iPad out of the case, I really had to stretch the arms beyond its capacity.  I almost thought I would break them.  Did finally get the iPad to fit into the holders.  I would guess the thinner iPad Airs will fit much better.Had rented a Cadillac SRX.  Put this in its cupholder.  I felt as if I was forever screwing the base into the cupholder in order to tighten it.  It would not tighten itself perfectly.  As the car moved, there was a bit of sway from the mount.  Not too bad, and not certainly to the point where I felt that it would tip over completely.I do realize that different vehicles have different cup size holders so everyone's mileage with this mount will vary.In all, I felt it was effective for what it did.  It allowed me to place my iPad at eye-level view so I could look at its navigation while driving my vehicle to Canada.I would estimate that this is probably the best of all the other mounting tools out there for the price.

"Sometimes I wonder if I am really saving money with my expensive razor.Yeah, straight razor replacements are very expensive.However, to purchase a $300 Panasonic premium shaver and to have to buy these replacement blades and foil every year seems to almost be a ""wash"" when you consider the price.Still, I consider the Panasonic electric shavers to be excellent, and one really needs to replace its blades at least once per year.

"Had the older Panasonic 5.8 DECT phones.  They had limited range.  Could not get across my property, let alone even talk on the phone while on my deck which is located on the other side of the house.So, recently I purchased the Panasonic Dect 6.0 phones (TG7875s).  By themselves, the range of these phones is greatly increased.  I can now talk on my deck.  However, when walking the dog, I still can't talk across my large property.I took a chance and ordered one of these range extenders.  I was a little apprehensive about spending the money because of the mixed Amazon reviews.It's a very tiny device.  Getting it to pair was effortless, though Panasonic's documentation is very poor.  The best thing I would recommend anyone do is to go to Panasonic's Support site and look at the video tutorial. Hopefully this direct link will work for all of you...http://shop.panasonic.com/shop/model/KX-TGA405B?support=y(Click on HELP & TUTORIALS and then the video link)The pairing can be done in less than two minutes as you watch the video.Placed the Range Extender somewhere in the middle of the house.  Was not getting a secondary green signal.  Only Amber.  Yet, when I tested the phone range across my large property, I was very surprised to find that I had excellent signal strength throughout.  Phone calls actually sounded as if I was right next to the base unit.I think, because I did not put the extender closer to the base unit (which is why I get the amber light instead of green), there is an occasional ""quick"" signal loss, but it's not even worth worrying about.The main thing to be considered is that this range extender works as advertised.  I believe you could double the coverage of your Dect 6.0 phone using this device.  It's amazing the coverage it gives you.  If you need to be out in your yard, working or just walking your dog, this extender will give you the complete signal coverage that you need.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IS8G6P1I7CP9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003MOKUIS#wasThisHelpful","R2IS8G6P1I7CP9","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having bought the Panasonic TG7875S system, I wanted to buy this detector as an accessory to help locate the keys I always seem to lose.It's small enough not to be obtrusive on the keychain.It works perfectly with the phone system.  You go to its menu, select Key Detector, and a homing device appears on the phone handset with a signal that increases as you approach the keys.  Really neat!The problem is, the key alarm is not as loud as I had hoped.  Also, I have had the key detector alarm go off for no apparent reason while I was at work a few times.  I suppose, perhaps, it's picking up random signals from the alarm system or otherwise.  No way to stop it from chiming, either, without opening the battery draw to quiet it.So, it's useful, but not perfected.  Still, I would recommend a purchase.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GNRZHU23MZ3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BKUWQ24#wasThisHelpful","R3GNRZHU23MZ3E","A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a real fan to the m43 (MFT) camera format, championed by Panasonic and Olympus. I love the fact that the cameras and lenses are smaller and lighter than DSLRs and yet can produce stunningly high quality work that is comparable to that achieved by these these behemoths in most circumstances. The fact that panny have somehow managed to pack 20.3 MP into this sensor size is astounding.Unlike many modern photographers I do not usually jump into a new piece of kit quickly, preferring to make the most of my current kit for as long as I can and concentrating on technique. However, this is a special year for me so I took the opportunity to ""move up"" from my trusty GX1 to the new GX8, bypassing the GX7 model altogether.Wow, what a difference! The GX8 is quite a hefty body for a m43, at least compared to the GX1, and feels much more solid. The handgrip is larger and more comfortable and the arrangement of buttons and dials although a little bewildering at first, is brilliant in operation. The two rotary dials, around the shutter release and the on/off button, make manual selection of aperture and speed so easy when compared to the old ""thumbwheel"" of the GX1 (and my trusty LX5). The fact that almost every button can be programmed to the photographer's preference is also a boon.I use the EVF almost exclusively for composing so I am glad to have an integrated tiltable one (I use the LVF1 on my LX5 and the LVF2 on my GX1). The swing out, fully tiltable touchscreen has finally made it to the GX range and is a good feature for protecting the screen when not in use and for using the camera in those situations such as really high (or low) POV shots.So far I have found focus with my existing m43 lenses to be fast (*see update 4 below) and the image quality to be extremely good. There are a host of new features that I would not normally use, but one that stands out is the 4K Photo burst setting where 8MP images are shot at 30fps to allow selection from a fast moving target. This is a new one for me, and I am not sure how this differs from using a normal burst mode (which is able to achieve 40 fps using the electronic shutter a SH speed) but I will experiment.* Update 1 on battery life: I only managed to get 95 shots (shooting RAW+JPEG) on the initial full charge of he DMW-BLC12E 7.2V battery. That was using unpowered lenses and without too much chimping. I am hoping this improves as the battery conditions, but let's see.My spare battery gave me 115 shots (RAW+JPEG) on a shoot with no used of LCD whatsoever, so it's fair to say this camera CHEWS through batteries, unfortunately. I would definitely recommend carrying a couple of spares or more for a day's shooting!* Update 2 on battery life: Today, I managed 230 shots on a fresh battery, including several pano shots so maybe it's something to do with battery conditioning? Go figure! However, I do wonder if it could be a software/firmware issue (see below)* Update 3 on functions: I had a little extra time to play around with some of the functions I wouldn't normally use, namely the scene modes and the panorama mode. The scene modes are great for getting some different black and white compositions, HDR effects, toy effects etc. The great thing for those of us that shoot JPEG and RAW is that even in scene mode a RAW (RW2) file is also saved too, so if you want to change the image in post then you can. Having the instant feedback on the LVF and the ability for a quick JPG is great (Yes, I know this has been available on the previous GX models, but I never used it).The panorama mode is a bit tricky to get used to as you have to practice getting the speed correct. I did this handheld and the camera complained about me panning too slowly, then too fast and finally not panning level enough. In the end though it worked pretty well. You end up with a 8176 x 1920 px (15.7 MP) JPG  and no RAW file though, which is a little disappointing. For serious work I shall continue using vertical orientation and stitching but it is a fun thing to have.* Update 4: I have now taken 530 shots and I am not happy with the pinpoint focus, which seems a bit spotty. When used on my 45-200mm lens to get some background defocus the lens is incredibly difficult to focus on the foreground, even when the foreground object is 8-10 feet away. I did not have this issue with this lens on my GX1. I wonder if this is related to the firmware issue (see below, Update 5)* Update 5: IMPORTANT firmware glitch. I have now had two separate occasions when the camera has locked up totally just leaving the EVF functioning (I don't use the LCD for composing). No buttons worked, even the on/off rotary switch. The only thing I could do was to remove the battery. This is extremely disappointing on a $1000+ camera and, despite the fact that I am a panasonic ""fanboy,"" I am going to try to return the camera and get a replacement. Accordingly, I have removed 2 stars form my review, which is a crying shame as otherwise I love the camera!Handy References:A couple of resources I have found useful so far are linked below (replace [dot] with a dot, obviously):1.

Important tip: keep it horizontal (if you forget this simply go back to step 2, above)(9) Go to trash can and tilt the pan so that (most of) the dirt falls into can(10) Place brush back into handy holder.Congratulations, you've swept up something.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RI2N08YSXIA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KLSON7W#wasThisHelpful","R3RI2N08YSXIA7","AEN44U6T9R93","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEN44U6T9R93?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some people like to carry a pocket handkerchief. Personally, I like to be ready for a meal should one present itself. This full 5-piece setting can be carried in my large coat pocket and allows me to maintain my decorum should someone offer me a morsel to eat ""out of the blue,"" so to speak.The knife is sharp enough to remove those stubborn crusts from sandwiches and also peel and slice an apple with relative ease. There is always a compromise when carrying a knife in one's pocket. It needs to be able to cut, yet safe enough so that one does not stab oneself when stumbling around the subway after imbibing a beverage, or three.  Pocket knives can be misinterpreted by the increasingly wary security forces and a serrated blade seems a good compromise.But I digress.Admittedly this is hardly a complete set: there's no soup spoon, fish knife, etc. but one has to get by these days and this set has served me well (if you pardon the pun) and has not yet become bent or broken.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REXMLQ5S6CKR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0078V2BNS#wasThisHelpful","REXMLQ5S6CKR9","AEN44U6T9R93","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEN44U6T9R93?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a shame, this could have been good. To state this is ""based on Philip K Dick's novel"" is misleading. Aside from the loose concept of ""precogs"" there is little similarity with the classic sci-fi short story.

"Clearly building on the early experimental work of such greats as Ibn al-Haythan and Anthemius of Tralles, Cooper takes to the field with his astounding contraption snugly fitted to his collar. His work is a sublime fusion of the work of Martin Parr and Henri Cartier-Bresson, to which he adds his own surreal viewpoint to provide a taste of his vision. Some of the images appear mundane at first glance, but when viewed over a longer time period one cannot but be astounded by the depth of perception Cooper brings to his compositions. Other images, are plainly abstractions of the world he sees, perhaps extrapolations of his feline visual cortex, the complexities of which we mere humans can only wonder.Truly this is a work of genius that should be kept as a well thumbed reference book in every street photog's bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24YZH3ERIYMB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=061541043X#wasThisHelpful","R24YZH3ERIYMB4","AEN44U6T9R93","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEN44U6T9R93?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It fits in an overhead bin on an Airbus 319 with no problems as long as it is unexpanded. No questions asked form US Airways / American Airlines.It makes me laugh when people buy a case that is the right dimensions for carry on and then expand it to the full, including having bulges in the center of the case and wonder why it wont fit the bins. To be honest I think it was better when the airlines used to use frames that you had to be able to pass your hand luggage through.

"I gritted my teeth and opened this up to see what the angle would be. It is an interesting read and makes a lot of sense to freethinkers and similar-minded readers. I don't think it will sway any staunch GOP follower or Christian Conservatives (fundamentalists) though as they simply would never read the book in the first place. The text concerning why the South went from Democrat supporting to staunch Republican country after Truman was fascinating, and saddening. I cannot help but think that this great country could be so much greater if only the GOP wasn't so self-serving and manipulative of the South. If only the Southern states could focus on what is truly important, rather than being hoodwinked by the GOP all the time. For example, defending the confederate flag, and focusing on issues of religious intolerance means nothing if you have no health service, poor education and no welfare. The irony is how Jesus' words of compassion have been twisted so much and that the most ""devoted"" Christians have strayed so far from the path he espoused. I have to admit I have a whole new respect for the phrase ""what would Jesus do"" after having read this book. Undoubtedly, the answer is simply, LTN.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IQRROVYNMBBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007FPT09A#wasThisHelpful","R3IQRROVYNMBBK","AEN44U6T9R93","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEN44U6T9R93?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I can only comment on the table as the chairs still have not arrived!The table comes as 8 pieces: 1 top, 4 legs, 2 mid braces and a horizontal brace. i use the term brace 'loosely'.The 4 legs are metal and fit into flimsy plastic square holders which are loosely attached to the table frame. They are 'held in place' using a screw.  The attempt to add strength to this table is achieved by using a horizontal brace which is bolted in place across the 4 legs and the 2 mid braces. Initially, I thought there was a manufacturing defect but then I realized that the plastic holding the mid braces can simple be pushed along the underside of the table as you see fit. Interesting, as it's meant to add stability.The 25mm bolts used to fix the legs to the brace are tightened with the supplied hex key and so you cannot get too much pressure on them. They would have been better designed as proper hex bolt so you could fit a wrench/socket. Anyhow, it appears that only 3 of the 4 threaded holes that the bolt fit into have been drilled out sufficiently, so you will need a few extra washers to pack these out!Overall, an annoying and frail piece of  furniture. It will probably stand up as long I don't have to move it, but it surely isn't anything I would even lean against.Disappointing. I wonder what the chairs will be like?","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I2HM6XNI0K4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JSRO0R0#wasThisHelpful","R1I2HM6XNI0K4N","AEN44U6T9R93","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEN44U6T9R93?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There's a light also to tell you when the power is on. It fits easily to the base and is convenient to use.Only downsides: this is quite a heavy kettle, even when empty.

"As an advanced DIY'er, old car dude, and tool geek I was looking forward to reviewing this set. This set is very similar to what Bosch, Black & Decker, and Dewalt offer but at a much higher price point.The metal is basic, non-stainless, with no torque capabilities. But that is common with most inexpensive sets. The case is plastic, but some of the bits don't snap in tight enough causing them to bounce around and dislodge other bits.The bit selection is decent, but the average DIY'er will probably only use half of these infrequently, and the more popular slotted and phillips more frequently.The ""bit grip collar"" continually slips and doesn't properly hold the screw before torque. You'll be sure to punch holes in your drywall or scratch your wood projects. Best not to use it and buy one more purposefully designed like Dewalt or Bosch.For basic use, this is an adequate set, but the price is horrendous. $27? You've got to be mad. A similar, name branded set is easily half this price and will last you longer due to better materials and craftsmanship.Most of the less expensive bit sets are made in China, with some Taiwanese contenders. There are some USA varieties, and well worth the investment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIC9ZVFIE9NMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LBVZEI#wasThisHelpful","RIC9ZVFIE9NMU","AY49JOXTLDOG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY49JOXTLDOG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let's not confuse this electric chainsaw with it's gas operated big brothers. This B&D saw won't take down a monster oak or redwood, but for most homeowners it should be okay. Just because it has a 18"" blade doesn't mean that you can cut down a 18"" diameter trunk. You probably could, but you'd be there for 2 days and have to resharpen your blade 4-5 times.The instructions are easy to follow. Make sure you read EVERYTHING in the manual. Chainsaws are dangerous tools. You can lose a finger, eyeball, or testicle in the blink of an eye. Be careful!The build quality is on par for B&D, not great, not terrible, just middle-of-the-road.  With lightweight use and proper lubrication this saw should last many seasons.After installing the bar and chain, I trimmed my queen palm, red oak, and bald cypress trees. The biggest branch I tackled was 4-5 inches. The saw did it's job, but I noticed it does bog down when pushed too fast. Never an issue with a gas model.One thing I don't like is the cord. Imagine climbing a ladder with a chainsaw. That alone is dangerous, but now you've got cord dangling down from your waist and down the ladder. Yes I know it's electric and there is a cord, but this saw was sent for me to review. And honestly, the cord makes it very dangerous when above ground level. You'll need a second person below you so you can lower the chainsaw down out of your way.My recommendation for a lightweight saw would be a battery operated model. No cord! But if you need a saw with more oomph I would consider a gasoline version.The B&D is a cheapened version of the Oregon PowerNow chainsaw. Which is a better saw, but more expensive.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F9KUK96XSAAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TJ3FBHG#wasThisHelpful","R3F9KUK96XSAAA","AY49JOXTLDOG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY49JOXTLDOG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was looking for a small, cheap extra range bag when I saw this NCStar bag. It's new with no specs and no reviews, but I took my chances ands was surprised.Size: 13""L x 9""D x 9""H - Decent size but closes into a triangle shape reducing some of the volume.There are pockets outside, inside, and mesh on the outside. The pockets will hold pens, pencils, small tools, 9mm magazines and other small items.The bottom is rigid and will accommodate most items, but I wouldn't test it with a  1,000 rounds of ammo. The top opens completely and has a sewn-in metal rod for rigidity.If you already have a pouch or rug for your pistol this bag would be ideal. It will hold a pistol, magazines, ammo, hearing protection and other items needed for a successful range day. It will also work as an extra bag for ammo, brass, or shooting accessories when at the range.I don't expect the bag to last more than a few years, but at a $6 price point I'm okay with that.

Blimey.I didnt have the clams to mix this stuff with beer, but I did whip up a Caesar, which is a Bloody Mary made with Clamato.  Not bad.  Still salty.  Probably not going to be my go-to cocktail.And what makes this a cocktail and not a cold soup anyway?  Its made with dried clam broth.  Its got spices.  Ive had less flavorful soups than this.  Is it just because its in a bottle?  Served in a glass and not a bowl?  Again, your input is appreciated.I was really hoping for something disastrous with Clamato, but altogether, its not bad.

"Good concept, expensive to use. I was looking forward to reviewing this ceramic cutter as I've never used one before. Wow, was I disappointed.I compared the Slice cutter to my Olfa SVR-2 which has a similar blade cutting area (see my image).The Slice's body is plastic with a slight taper towards the blade. The three-position slide lock would loosen and slide back when any pressure was applied. The slide lock is positioned perpendicular to the blade, right where you would normally rest your thumb or index finger. This causes the lock to fail. The Olfa slide lock, on the other hand, does not move when engaged due to its side positioning.The blade on the slice protrudes correctly, but is rounded. There are instances when a sharp point is needed to puncture to start your cut, like thick packing tape or duct tape. The Slice's blades, being ceramic, are uber spendy. $13.68 for 4 blades. Ouch! No extra blades are included with the cutter.I tested the Slice cutter on manila bubble envelopes, paper/fiber packing tape, thick 3M packing tape, duct tape, standard shipping boxes, cardboard soda case bottoms, plastic blister packaging, and shrink wrap used on pallet wrapping.The Slice cutter work adequately on thin material, but fell short on thick cardboard or tape. Due to the thickness of the ceramic blade the Slice bogged down on the duct tape, where the Olfa just whizzed on by. Due to the rounded blade tip I couldn't get the Slice started on blister packaging.Bottom line, the Slice is extremely expensive, especially with it's shortcomings. The Slice cutter, with a pack of 4 blades will set you back over $26! The Olfa, however, costs only $13 for the cutter and 130 blades!I cannot justify paying double for a simple cutter that performs poorly on various materials.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X8AW9ROUCDHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9SSJE4#wasThisHelpful","R1X8AW9ROUCDHN","AY49JOXTLDOG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY49JOXTLDOG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Why is TP advertised so heavily on TV? It's not like it's something we don't need.Then I came across test results of Charmin's Ultra Strong.The pros were strong, absorbs well, and rated softest.But the cons were dissolves slowly (bad), and low weight per roll (mean less TP for your money).It's your choice, but for the money I'll stick with my Kirkland brand TP.

"I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes a couple of years ago. I had other health conditions that made things worse including severe endometriosis that affected my intestines, colon and lungs. I had to take so many prescription medication and I also had to undergo so many surgical procedures to correct some of those medical/health anomalies. I had to change my entire lifestyle, eating habits and daily routine to reverse my Type 2 Diabetes and this was all because I had a serious health scare. My kidneys and liver were suffering from my diabetes. All the medication that I had to take on a regular basis, took its toll on my liver as well. Yup...not everything prescribed to us is necessarily good for the body. Every single medication out there has side effects and backlashes on our bodies.I started taking natural supplements like the Liver Edge Herbal Support Supplement, in conjunction with my new lifestyle and diet. The results were beyond what I expected because my blood panel tests that I used to dread, yielded positive results this time! It really is true that what nature has to offer is sometimes better than ingesting chemicals that cures one ailment and replaces it with another condition.I am not saying that I was able to eradicate all my prescription medication at the moment. However, I have kept everything to a minimum - which is very good for my liver and other organs. My healthier choices has enabled me to live a better life. I highly recommend this supplement to people who have health issues like myself. Make healthier choices and save yourself the trouble of forking out a lot of money for prescription medication.

I remember buying the free mousepad alone for $12 or $15 at one of the major box stores in my area. To see this bundle deal for this awesome price is beyond awesome to me!

"Anyone who checks my Amazon Profile would know by now that I am a big US Art Supply fan.

I wish I can post photos to go with my review but for some reason, I get error messages every single time I attempt to. All the same, this Display Easel has been working wonderfully for me - as an easel when I work on my paintings and as a tool to display my latest seasonal art work!

"No matter how careful you are when working out, there will always be mishaps and injuries every now and then. This proves true for me and my husband...which is why we always have Elbow Brace with Compression Pads in our home. We have particularly been loving these Elbow Support Braces from PlayActive Sports because you get two products in one pack. Needless to say, you get more bang for your buck! It also worked well for my husband, who periodically suffers from ""Tennis Elbow"" - so I am sticking to this brand. I have tried other brands out in the market that didn't really work that well for me and/or my husband. This particular brand is very easy to slip on and secure, as it has velcro straps.

"I got this supplement for my husband, as most of the males on his side of the family suffered/had prostate related issues. Prevention, in my opinion, is always better than finding a cure for any/all health conditions. One thing that my husband noticed, is the fact that it has helped with his constant trips to the bathroom at night. Less pee trips means more sleep which equates to a happier hubby. He has also been complaining about his receding hairline. It's not that bothersome because I can barely tell, as my husband still has his full head of hair. But I guess he can tell and apparently, it's been bugging him a wee bit. He said that he wants to continue taking this supplement, because if it works for matters concerning his testosterones and prostrate, then he is pretty confident that it will help with other matters like hair loss as well.

"I use this cream for my upper arms and thighs - my problem areas that make me feel so self conscious. I have been regularly using it, in conjunction with a regular exercise routine and a low carb diet. The results that I have observed from using this product truly impressed me. I work out religiously and I do a little bit of weight training because my upper arms are stubborn and refuse to remain firm. I am sure y'all know what a struggle it is toget rid of cellulite. This product has been a tremendous help to me and I have noticed that my arms are becoming firmer and the dimples at the back of my thighs are becoming less pronounced.

"I have very sensitive skin that is perpetually dry. During the colder months, my palms would crack and I absolutely hate it because it's uncomfortable - not to mention painful! I used a brand of hand cream that is supposedly good for cracked skin, from one of the box stores in my area. It didn't really work out that well for me and my husband, whose skin (on his hands) cracks worse than mine. We don't really know what to expect when we got this product in the mail but after using it for a few days, I must say that I am a believer of this brand! This Crack Creme comes in liquid form, so product gets thoroughly deposited on the parts of our (me and hubby's) hands that need the most help. The results were pretty amazing because it truly works. In a matter of days, it worked wonders on our hands! If you have the same issues as me and my husband, I suggest you look into getting this product.

"In Return on Character (ROC), author Fred Kiel offers an antidote to Stanford Professor Jeffrey Pfeffers Leadership BS, in which Pfeffer criticizes the oft-made prescriptions for leaders to be honest, authentic, and modest, tell the truth, build trust, and take care of others. Kiel now provides contradictory evidence to Pfeffer, showing a measurable relationship between the character of leader and organizational performance in ROC.Over nine years, Kiel, a pioneer in the field of executive coaching, and his team of researchers polled 84 CEOs and 8600 related employees to determine if character really mattered.  He found a positive correlation and includes ample data to substantiate this claim.Kiels team started with a metric for assessing the character driven behaviors of 44 US-based companies from which they were able to compile a complete set of both interview and financial performance data. The survey included Fortune 500, private and nonprofit companies.They defined character as being tied to integrity, responsibility, forgiveness, and compassion and refined these universal principles into key behaviors which they measured, such as: telling the truth (integrity) language employed to misinform or mislead (lack of integrity) redress of wrongs (responsibility) mediation of conflict (forgiveness) empathy (compassion)Kiels team then designated top CEOs on the character scale as virtuosos and those at the bottom as self-focused. The simple naming of those two categories was needed to understand the core message of this book. Virtuosos use both head and heart (see Dotlich, Cairo, and Rhinesmiths classic Head, Heart, and Guts) to orchestrate a high-performance team while self-focused leaders were mainly out for themselves.Research in the book revealed a significant gap when the CEOs rated themselves on strength of character habits and compared them to employee ratings. Virtuosos and the self-focused gave themselves almost the same score, 84 and 83 respectively. The employees did not and gave the virtuoso CEOs an 87 while awarding only a 68 to the self-focused leaders. This translated directly into the financial returns (ROC) for a firm. Those who qualified as virtuosos achieved a 9.35% return on assets and those who qualified as self-focus returned only 1.93% over a two-year period. Virtuosos at the top end of the curve performed more than five times better.The book is organized into three parts: the path towards leadership; ROC leadership at work; and the ROC habits workshop  what people and organizations can do to improve their ROC. Each chapter ends with summary Take Aways for quick reference.The book contains profiles of those CEOs who are high on character, such as former COSTCO CEO Jim Sinegal, former REI CEO Sally Jewell, and Barry-Wehmiller CEO Bob Chapman.Behaviors for both extremes of CEOs are detailed. An example of common traits we have seen in those who are self-focused (probably identify people with them as you read this): they cant be trusted to keep promises they often pass off blame on others they frequently punish well-intentioned people for making mistakes they are especially poor at caring for people in generalThere is no service component for these people.  Albert Sloan, mentor to leadership guru Peter Drucker taught that leaders were the servants of the institution that employed them. It is service that provides the basis for the legitimacy of power and authority. Before he died, Drucker was becoming increasingly concerned with the leadership drift he was seeing in organizations. He emphasized that leaders needed to be more concerned with serving the mission of the organization, its customers, and developing its people than with the glitz of rank and power. Legitimate authority in leadership, he said, comes from taking responsibility for the stewardship of the human, financial and physical resources of the organization and performing the duties that advance the organizations missionnot those focused on advancing ones personal agenda.The products of personal wealth and fame, which so many put ahead of the organizational mission, do not create fulfillment. This becomes very obvious as we achieve prosperity. Former car executive Lee Iacocca noted, Here I am in the twilight years of my life still wondering what its all about... I can tell you this: Fame and Fortune is for the birds.Return on Character is well researched and well-written. Readers who are not hardened will intuitively know that the returns of character extend well beyond the footprint of any organization.  As Kiel concludes, People are hungry to have a model of leadership that they can believe in, one they can inspire to, one that is founded on and nourished by shared humanity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R41WR4V06KYDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1625271301#wasThisHelpful","R41WR4V06KYDT","A3CZWVO53MLZI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CZWVO53MLZI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disrupt Yourself is the best book on career transition and development to come along in a number of years. In it author Whitney Johnson takes a page out of mentor Clayton Christensens disruption playbook to provide structure on career disruptionnot how to avoid being disrupted by forces of disruption but how to leverage disruption and change ones trajectory to increase meaning and happiness.The S-Curve, more commonly called the life cycle has been used for years to show how some companies, products, technologies, and start-ups blossom while others wither. Johnson in Disrupting Yourself now adapts this to career planning.Playing it safe is not safe in todays fast-paced world. While some think it is smarter to stick to the knitting, Johnson shows why it is safer to jump to a new S-Curve where opportunity, steep learning, innovation, and personal growth fuel personal productivity and happiness. Shifting successfully to a new learning curve demands managing these seven variables: taking the right risks playing to ones distinctive strengths embracing constraint battling entitlements stepping back to grow giving failure its due and being discovery drivenJohnson devotes a chapter to each.The really big idea of this book centers on the ability to distinguish between competitive risk and market risk. Pursuing a career where there is plenty of supply (and competition) is to take market risk. We need to first assess how crowded the market is, and then what is needed to compete successfully. All who have hired have the normal distribution of resumes received for a specific job. The bulk of the resumes are indistinguishable. Competition is tough.Another and better approach is to go where no one else is going and to position you to play where no one else is playing. Chances are that very few people will be able to offer what you can. This is at the core of disrupting yourself.The decision to jump to a new curve requires guts and perseverance (staying power) but as Johnson notes, those that do also are rewarded with expanded horizons, increased productivity, improved emotional and physical well-being and high-velocity growth when the inflection point is reached. Nature favors risk-takers.Risk mitigation is helped by discerning our unique strengths. Johnson supplements Raths Strengths-Finders 2.0, which I recommend, with great questions to provide additional insights: What skills have helped you survive? What makes you feel strong? When do you feel invigorated, inquisitive, successful? What exasperates you about others? What made you different, even an oddball, as a child? What compliments do you shrug off? What are your hard-one skills?I have been co-leading a ministry for executives, managers, and professionals in-transition since 2002. We have served over 6000 people regardless of faith tradition and presently have 1300 participants. I recently presented Disrupting Yourself as a new concept to consider in personal career development. This produced an ah-ha moment for all participants.Johnson has provided structure and guidelines for how to find a new path. Disrupting yourself is critical to avoiding stagnation and to fast-tracking your personal and career growth. It will force you up steep foothills of new information, relationships, and systems. Progress will be exponential.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D9J6P5MTB6XU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629560529#wasThisHelpful","R2D9J6P5MTB6XU","A3CZWVO53MLZI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CZWVO53MLZI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Attention Shareholders: Beware of the BoardCredit Suisse Settles Dark Pool CaseStanford Business School Steps Down After Affair with Wife of Direct ReportBribery Case Hits UNVolkswagen Chief Martin Winterkorn Resigns Amid Emissions ScandalVC Arrested for Insider Trading Now Accused of Defrauding His FirmThese recent headlines in the Wall Street Journal highlight the on-going problem of leaders who have gone south and have taken their organizations with them.  Stanford business school professor Jeffrey Pfeffer would use these as examples of how the leadership industry has failed. Prescriptions for leaders to be more truthful are at odds with what goes on in the real world. The ability to lie can be very useful for getting ahead, says Pfeffer. Manipulation is a foundation for social powerin fact; there is a reciprocal relationship between power and lying.That brings us to Bill Georges latest book, Discover Your True North: Expanded and Updated. In it, George brings his wisdom, observations, examples, and practices to bear on helping leaders be something more than what Pfeffer proposes. He encourages us to build on our natural leadership gifts and to stay on our True North track to inspire and empower others to excellence. According to George, our True North is the internal compass which, based on deeply held beliefs, values, and principles, represents who we are at our deepest level. Knowing our internal compass helps when pressures and seductions detour us from achieving our purpose in life. It is our lifesaver alerting us to get back on track when the life being lived is not aligned with who we are at the deepest level.Georges True North needs some reconciling to Pfeffers belief about the reality of leadership. Pfeffer talks about power for the sake of power while George talks about power that flows from character. This disconnect may be attributed to the lack of good role models for those seeking to be leaders.  I have observed over the years that leadership training if not reinforced by good role models does not lead to True North leadership. It is hard work to develop the type of leader George talks about. It is The Road Less Traveled due to the required investment of time by both the student and the role model.For this reason, I recommend Discovering Your True North but with the caveat that it is reinforced by a role model. This may be satisfied with Georges concept of a support team that he details in the book. I have worked with Bill George and can vouch that he is the real thing. I am sure that he provides the modeling needed to those he touches in the class room and for those he works with in his consultancy.In brief about this updated edition - George revisits his NYC Times best-seller and now business classic that was released in 2007. He integrates his personal insights gained as CEO of Medtronic and as a professor and Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School with new first-person interviews of 48 authentic global leaders. These leaders include many who have garnered the positive attention of the press and have inspired and empowered millions to excellence Indra Nooyi, Jack Ma, Alan Mulally, John Mackey, Sheryl Sandberg, Michael Bloomberg, and many others. He also includes updates on the original 125 participants featured in his first book and includes a chapter on finding your GQ, your global quotient.George also includes case studies of those who were seduced and made bad choices which led to painful detours in their lives  Rajat Gupta (insider trading), Lance Armstrong (fraud and demonization of those who tried to get the truth known), and Michael Baker (fraud).

"I met Dr. Michael OBrien, executive coach and author of best-selling Profit from Experience: A Guide to Knowing Yourself and Influencing Others, while attending the 24th Annual Health Forum and American Hospital Association Leadership Summit. It was serendipitous that we found each other.  We spent our time discussing the leadership vacuum that exists today across the for-profit, not-for-profit, and government sectors.Two weeks after we met, I received Quicksilver, complements of OBrien. Quicksilver was a provocative read and will serve as a great resource for personal development. The book highlights a learning disorder that threatens humanitys very survival  unconscious leadership. OBrien uses the great financial meltdown of 2008 to highlight how unconscious leadership"" took the world to the edge of the abyss.Leadership today is sleepwalking. In a world of rapid change, we are failing to recognize the less obvious drivers of change and quickly dismiss insights that come from those who come from outside the inner circle of current thought. Dismissing diverse perspectives limits consciousness of self and the environment and perpetuates a limited focus only on those things that are in our consciousness, severely limiting are ability to act. Everything today keeps getting more connected to everything else. Everything depends on everything else. Moment by moment the future becomes more purely conditional, more sublimely unpredictable. This calls for a new type of consciousness.Bad thinking results from insufficient consciousness, leading to bad thought products. The problem has been that our minds were changing the world, when we should have been changing our minds to match the world that we are creating.  To do this, we need a set of explicit personal practices to help us proceed more consciously in a moment of perfect mystery  ""perfect high-stakes mystery to improve our selection of solutions. How can we see how the world has changed and is changing if we are not fully conscious?In Quicksilver, OBrien provides the principles - accountability, bravery, authenticity, intentionality, and truthfulness - and the personal practices fundamental to conscious leadership. While these principles are the standard fare of most leadership books, OBrien offers a fresh look at each one and provides revolutionary practices for each. The practices appear simple but they are not. They need tremendous discipline to work through and to complete them.One practice that many find difficult is journaling. OBrien urges all to journal and write things down. Keeping a written journal makes you the author, not just the subject, of your story. It is like taking off a backpack filled with 200 pounds of rocks. It will loosen your mind and help you to attend to fundamental things all the time. You will come to understand who you are as well as who you are supposed to be.Another practice that stood out for me is an exercise related to PDQs, paradoxical development questions. This practice, which requires tapping into our unconscious mind, enables us to face the messes of life honestly and generate creative breakthroughs. The author has found this practice has helped his clients, individuals and organizations, find breakthrough solutions to all manner of honest messes.Quicksilver is about finding and responding to truths of the world. Effective truth-seeking requires a mix of consciousness and unconsciousness. Leaders today must learn how to cultivate and sustain an optimal mixture of consciousness and how they notice what they notice. This requires a supreme act of self-examination which must now be considered a core competency of every modern leader. The very business of a leader is to continuously lead organizations into the unknown, but they cannot lead anyone anywhere without going there first.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YIZG24P4DRVT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1934738212#wasThisHelpful","R2YIZG24P4DRVT","A3CZWVO53MLZI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CZWVO53MLZI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Writing an adequate review for best-selling author David Brooks The Road to Character has been challenging. I typically work with five pages of detailed notes when reviewing a book but found myself with twenty-one pages for this review.Brooks has written a gem of a book, one that raises the bar for future discussions of character. It takes time to absorb and savor. Brooks says publicly that he wrote this book to save his own soul.The Road to Character is about the cultural shift from the little me to the BIG ME, from a culture that encourages people to think humbly of themselves to a culture that encourages people to see themselves as the center of the universe. This cultural shift encourages us to think about having a great career but leaves nothing for us to develop an inner life and character. For Brooks, we have lost our way to being good and doing good.Brooks frames the discussion by contrasting resume virtues - those skills that one brings to the job market that contribute to external success  with eulogy virtues  those that are at the core of our being like courage, honesty, loyalty, and the quality of our relationships that contribute to real joy. These are embodied in two competing parts, Adam I and Adam II, of our nature that are a constant source of contradiction and tension.Adam I is the external Adam. He wants to build, create, produce and discover things. He is characterized by actively seeking recognition, satisfying his desires, being impervious to the moral stakes involved. He has little regard for humility, sympathy, and honest self-confrontation, which are necessary for building character. He wants to have high status, win victories, and conquer the world.Adam II is the internal Adam. He wants to embody certain moral qualities. He wants to love intimately, to sacrifice self in the service of others, to live in obedience to some transcendent truth, and to have a cohesive inner soul that honors creation in ones own possibilities. Adam II is charity, love, and redemption.Adam I is at work in todays BIG ME culture. Big Me messages are everywhere; you are special; trust yourself; and be true to yourself. This Gospel of Self begins with childhood when awards and rewards are given for just being, not doing. We are all wonderful, follow your passion, dont accept limits and chart your own course.This has led to an ethos based on a ravenous hunger in a small space of self-concern, competition, and a hunger for distinction at any cost, an ethos where envy has replaced admiration. This self-centeredness leads to several unfortunate directions: selfishness, the use of other people as a means to an end, seeing oneself as superior to everyone else, and living with a capacity to ignore and rationalize ones imperfections and inflate ones virtues.The BIG ME culture distorts the purpose of our journey and the meaning of life. Parts of themselves go unexplored and unstructured. They have a vague anxiety that their life has not achieved its ultimate meaning and significance. They live with unconscious boredom, not really loving, and unattached to the moral purpose that gives life its worth. They lack the internal criteria to make unshakable commitments. They never develop inner constancy, the integrity that can withstand popular disapproval or a serious blow. They foolishly judge others by their abilities and not by their worth. This external life will eventually fall to pieces.In this increasingly BIG ME culture, Brooks became haunted by the voices of the past and the quality of humility and character they exhibited. People in the past guarded themselves against some of their least attractive tendencies to be prideful, self-congratulatory, and hubristic. You would not even notice these people. They were reserved. They did not need to prove anything in the world. They embodied humility, restraint, reticence, temperance, respect, and soft discipline. They radiated a sort of moral joy. They answered softly when challenged harshly. They were silent when unfairly abused, dignified when others tried to humiliate them, and restrained when others tried to provoke themBut they got things done. They were not thinking about what impressive work they were doing. They were not thinking about themselves at all. They just seemed delighted by the flawed people around them. They made you feel funnier and smarter when you spoke with them. They moved through all social classes with ease. They did not boast. They did not lead lives of conflict-free tranquility but struggled towards maturity. These people built a strong inner character, people who achieved a certain depth. They surrendered to the struggle to deepen their soul.Brooks highlights the lives of prominent and influential people - Francis Perkins, Dwight Eisenhower, Dorothy Day, George C. Marshall, A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin, George Eliot, St. Augustine, Samuel Johnson, Michel de Montaigne  to articulate the diverse roads taken by a diverse set of people, white and black, male and female, religious and secular, literary and non-literary. Not one of them was even close to perfect. They were acutely aware of their own weaknesses and they waged an internal struggle against their sins to emerge with some measure of self-respect..The Road to Character is a road less traveled. It involves moments of moral crisis, confrontation, and recovery. To go up, one first has to go down (The U Curve); one must descend into the valley of humility to climb to the heights of character. Only then will one have the ability to see their own nature, their everyday self-deceptions, and shatter all Illusions of self-mastery.Humility is central to the journey. Humility leads to wisdom, a moral quality of knowing what you dont know and finding a way to manage ignorance, uncertainty, and limitation. It offers freedomfreedom from the need to prove your superiority. Alice had to be small to enter Wonderland. Only the one who descends into the underworld rescues the beloved.The paradox for Adam I is that he cannot achieve enduring external success unless he builds a solid moral core as sought by Adam II. Without inner integrity, your Watergate, your scandal, your betrayal, will eventually happen. Adam I versus Adam II, Adam I ultimately depends on Adam II.Brooks wrote this book to learn who has traveled this road to character, and what it looks like. He found you cannot be the good person you want to be unless you wage this campaign against self. I highly recommend this book as one of the most profound books published this year.End note: Brooks sections on love and suffering are excellent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQLOKO9H470UO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081299325X#wasThisHelpful","RQLOKO9H470UO","A3CZWVO53MLZI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CZWVO53MLZI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Headlines like this appear with great frequency all over the world.We are in the throes of an innovation/start-up arms race as regions all over the world try to duplicate Silicon Valley's innovation-based job creation success. These efforts began in the 1980s and are accelerating due to the democratization of knowledge and the structural transformation of global markets. ""Eat or be Eaten.""The authors of ""Global Clusters of Innovation"" tell us that the geographical distribution of innovation and entrepreneurship today is very irregular despite all of these efforts. ""Some locations are hotbeds of innovation and entrepreneurship while most others are innovation deserts."" Why? What are the origins of clusters? What contributes to sustainable, self-renewal in the face of never-ending waves of creative destruction? - Think Silicon Valley - silicon chips to computer hardware, software, internet; genetic engineering and medical devices to bio-tech, genomics, digital health; and then to green energy and automobiles.To answer these questions, editor and co-author Jerry Engel has called on 19 practitioners and scholars to identify the necessary elements required to develop an innovation cluster and then to apply these to assess highly successful and not so successful clusters around the world. It is by no accident that Engel directed this effort. He developed one of the top programs in entrepreneurial education while leading the Lester Center for Entrepreneurship (Haas School of Business, University of California Berkeley) as its founding executive director.COIs are concentrations of interconnected companies that both compete and collaborate.

Shared valuesEngel then expands to a ""global perspective by characterizing collaborations across space, from 'weak ties' to 'covalent bonds'"" - the depth of the relationship in which resources, especially key personnel, are shared between organizations in different locales determining the success of global collaboration and cross-pollination.This book recognizes the importance of having a professional class of entrepreneurial managers, a limited resource that is the major constraint for most who attempt to create clusters.

"""Jugaad Innovation"" is a good addition to the growing body of work on creating innovation eco-systems. Jugaad is a colloquial Hindi word and is all about doing more with less. Authors Navi Radjou, Jaideep Prabhu, and Simone Ahuja are expert observers of the ""frugal"" innovation movement, and have translated their ""Jugaad"" observations into an easy-to-read format for those looking to escape the more resource-rich, risk averse, rigid and less productive innovation approaches plaguing the West.Jugaad is a universal concept and was at one time the driver of Western innovation. But with success and scale, innovation capabilities became institutionalized and bloated. The creative process became rigid and expensive. Big budgets, multiple approval levels, standardized business processes, and controlled access to knowledge became obstacles to competition in a world that is increasingly fast-paced and volatile. It lacks flexibility, is elitist and insular.The book is organized around the six guiding principles of Jugaad:* Seek opportunity in adversity - reframe adversity as a source of innovation and growth.* Do more with less - the critical customer question is ""how will you improve my life?"" Solutions are not found in over-engineered solutions but rather, ""good enough solutions"" that get the job done.* Think and act flexibly - avoid Six Sigma and other approaches that constrain.* Keep it simple - Jugaad's key principle. There is no need to participate in the ""arms race"" to out innovate others. Simplicity will be the source of emerging competition.* Include the margin - seek out marginal, underserved customers and pull them into the mainstream. This is similar to Christensen's point to find unserved, downstream markets as this where innovation can thrive.* Follow your heart - do not follow focus groups or formal market research to decide what products to make. Use intuition, empathy, and passion - qualities that are increasingly just as important as analytical thinking.The authors provide good business case studies for each principle, illustrating the application and importance of each.  The last two chapters focus on ""Integrating Jugaad into Your Organization,"" and ""Building Jugaad Nations.""The book also highlights (with examples):* Learning to improvise. Rules must be broken and values need to shift to reflect new market realities.* Turning a deaf ear to external stakeholders who have in the past been relied on to dictate the innovation agenda. They tend to be conservative and lack the perspective to appreciate vision or foresight. ""Henry Ford is quoted as saying, `if I had asked customers what they wanted, they would've said faster horses.'""* Creating time and space for employees to improvise and experiment.* Getting outside the comfort zone to gain new perspectives.* Partnering with flexible thinkers.* Experimenting with multiple business models.* A ""fail cheap, fail fast, fail often"" culture.  Successful Jugaad innovators are willing to go for broke because they have little to lose.* Breaking down organizational silos to gain speed.The Jugaad approach, the authors feel, could help Western companies rediscover their roots and take on the complexity of our tough and turbulent times.Additional articles and videos on Jugaad can be found on the author's companion website, www.JugaadInnovation.com.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PSUT3VTHFF61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118249747#wasThisHelpful","R1PSUT3VTHFF61","A3CZWVO53MLZI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CZWVO53MLZI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This my second Nuvi with traffic updates, a feature I would not do without. I made my choice from several other more expensive and less expensive models weighing cost with features. This is what I would characterize as a smart purchase. The 2555LMT has all the features I need and the price was right. I paid a little extra over less expensive models for the traffic and lifetime map updates. I have gotten use to having the traffic updates and would not buy any GPS without it. The extra $30 bucks is well worth the investment.For long trips like SF to LA, I supplement my Nuvi with Waze, as Waze offers real-time, crowd-sourced traffic information that is invaluable.

"We started watching this several weeks ago, after which Bosch became our evening's entertainment until we completed what was available. We look forward to the next installment. Bosch is a great example of how programs like this are transforming cable, TV, and streaming: great story lines, well produced, and great acting. The story line focuses on a very independent detective who has his supporters and detractors within the LAPD. Bosch's mother was a prostitute who was murdered. He has and continues to push the envelope in pursuit of justice.His ex-wife, a former LAPD profiler and now professional card player in Las Vegas, and his daughter play key roles as the series progresses. The series begins with Bosch investigating a murder involving a young boy who was also battered years ago. A dog has found the boy's bones and the investigation begins. This is particularly sensitive for Bosch as he, like the boy, was abused (while in a home for foster boys).A second investigation and search which overlaps the bone's investigation. becomes center stage when a convicted and imprisoned serial killer  escapes as Bosch and the DA's office take the convict to a crime scene where he may have killed others. The convict has already admitted to kidnapping and killing the boy in the bone's case...he did not.

He has written and lectured extensively on strategy, execution, innovation, executive leadership, the board's role, alignment, and global competition.In ""Attackers Advantage"", Ram zeroes in on today's global market uncertainty caused by the revolution in digital and communications technologies which are feeding an increasingly faster rate-of-change and transformative structural changes. The victors today are those who create change ( like Google, Alibaba, GE, Apple, TATA, Kaiser, and Merck)  ""by immersing themselves in the ambiguities of the external environment, sort through them before things are settled and known, set a path, and steer the organizations decisively into it.""  They succeed by identifying by anticipating ""bends in the road and new needs or a total redefinition of an existing need.Innovation is either treated as a side show or as an executive sound bite that has no follow-through in most quarters. Long-term plans become toothless - even dangerous - and rigid planning processes stymie the flexible thinking needed to identify the next big thing. Companies must abandon a fixed mindset that comes from ""the tried and true"", and its past success, as past success blinds companies to the fact that every new challenge is unique and demands another approach for success. Technology cycles are getting shorter and shorter - forcing incumbents to unlearn and learn even faster and to identify the ""bends in the road"" (not trends but changes in trends) so they can ride the next wave.John Chambers, CEO of Cisco, reported the number one issue on everyone's mind at the 2015 World Economic Forum (Davos) was innovation and how to become ""a math company"" (Ram's lexicon). The second most important thing was the ""Internet of everything"" and the growing capability of sensors, etc. ""This has exploded. It's going to change every country and every business.""He feels strongly that ""40% of the companies represented at Davos won't exist in a meaningful way in 10 years unless they change dramatically."" Every company's future is going to depend on whether they catch the market transitions right."" ... Most every company coming out of Davos said, ""I'm not moving fast enough. I have to become a digital company first, a physical company second."" Companies, executive teams and CEOs must reinvent themselves. They cannot continue doing the same thing much longer.In ""Attacker's Advantage"",  Ram provides a practical ""how to"" guide defining the critical business skills needed to succeed in  this completely different and enormously challenging environment, one marked by ""creative destruction"" and structural uncertainty.  It requires a new mindset and new mental tools to chart today's uncertain waters, anticipate change, and go on the attack.The `attacker' who gains the advantage has the perceptual acuity to detect forces causing changes in trends that could radically reshape the marketplace ahead of others ...allowing the CEO and his/her team  to position the business to make the next move first. He/she needs the ""mind-set to overcome the fear of uncertainty to find opportunities, to muster the courage to move forward despite the unknowns, and to gain the advantage with speed and focus, without breaking morale.""The book is organized around four sections - 1) The Fundamental Leadership Challenge of Our Time, 2) Building on Perceptual Acuity, 3) Going on the Offense, and 4) Making the Organization Agile - which build on one another. Section one centers on the challenge of structural change, the algorithmic revolution, and identifying early warning signs; section two on identifying the catalysts (people, government, companies) of change and understanding what it is they see, and tools for developing perceptual acuity; section three on defining a path, and developing a mindset for taking the offense; and section four outlines the use of idea generating Joint Practice Sessions (JPS) which also provides transparency and coordination, and lastly, the what, who, and how of decision-making to zero in on critical decision nodes.I cannot over-emphasize the importance of JPS in creating positive change and goal alignment. It is a form of executive crowdsourcing that demands humility and openness to another's ideas for success. I have been in several JPS Sessions with previous boards and executive teams facilitated by Ram. It was an epiphany for me and for others who participated. Ram orchestrated a free flow of concerns, opportunities, and needed actions which led to the transformation the company's direction, as well as alignment and support from all participants. We exited these sessions laser-focused on key short-term (6 months) and long-term (18 month) objectives. JPS also stoked moral.One of my learnings about the JPS process is that I feel it is important to have a third party facilitator involved. CEOs need to participate but also need to be on the back bench listening. CEOs have their own biases and can unconsciously direct the conversation as a facilitator. A good outside facilitator who has no bias will draw on the wisdom of all participants and provide better insights.""Attacker's Advantage"" is this year's must read for CEOs, executives, consultants, and board members in both the for-profit and not-for-profit sectors. The US is facing an unprecedented change in the age structure of its population. Without increased growth in productivity, we face economic growth that will make it impossible to finance the social costs of an aging population. We are better off than most of our competitors whose populations have or will peak and then decline. This structural change makes it imperative for all to move now with a relentless focus and an all-hands-on-deck effort to accelerate innovation.""Attacker's Advantage"" is a call to action providing a much needed game plan for companies and executives to address structural change in today's rapidly changing global environment.AddendumThe five capabilities listed by Ram that are required to succeed in today's challenging global environment include:1. Perceptual acuity2. A mind-set to see opportunities in uncertainty3. The ability to see a new path forward and commit to it4. Adeptness in managing the transition from the current path to the new one (characterized as pivoting in the world of start-ups)5. Skill in making the organization steerable and agileThese resonate with me as I have been embracing uncertainty for a number of years as a medical technology entrepreneur. These capabilities are crucial to successfully bringing a new idea to the market when the conventional wisdom of doctors, investors, and regulators erect multiple obstacles, ""the thousand nos.""This brings to mind a conversation I had with Ram in the 1990s. He felt strongly that CEOs of multi-nationals and larger companies should sit on the boards of start-ups to gain an appreciation for the skills required to bring innovative products to market. He also advocated that multi-nationals and larger companies would benefit with start-up CEOs on their boards. They bring a different and much needed perspective to the boardroom. A need, I believe, that has been amplified by today's accelerating pace of change.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3490BLAED2AT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NP8MH3W#wasThisHelpful","R3490BLAED2AT","A3CZWVO53MLZI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CZWVO53MLZI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""The Fourth Revolution"" is a very thought-provoking book focused on what ""Economist"" editors, John Micklethwaite and Adrian Wooldridge believe is the primary political challenge of the next decade - fixing government. History has shown that countries with ""good government"" have sustained economic growth and a decent standard of life for its citizens. Lacking this, a country will be condemned to long term economic morass and dysfunction as the great Chinese empire was in the Middle Ages.  Pride in Chinese superiority ossified the Middle Kingcom as its emperors ""alternated between plucking and killing the golden goose.""Better government has been one of the West's great advantages but today, it is saddled with bloat and needs to be fixed. The Western state has become an essential part of everyone's daily life. ""Government claims the right to tell its citizens how to do many things - how long you needed to study to become a hairdresser what codes (140,000 of them) hospitals need to follow for ailments they treat."" They have also become integral do defining what rights you have - like the right to monitor your emails, who you must hire, and who you must rent your church hall to. The government of today, which was once an occasional partner in life, has become a tyrannical nanny.The authors take us through the 3  great revolutions the Western state has been through in modern times and their consequences:* The first was in the 17th century when Europe's princes constructed centralized states that put them ahead of the rest of the world.* The second came in the late 18th/early 19th centuries with the American and French revolutions. Liberal reformers replaced regal patronage systems with more meritocratic and accountable government.* The third (and half) arrived with the invention of the modern welfare state. It is what we in the West live with today. It has ruled unchallenged since the second  world war with the exception of the 1980s when Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan temporarily halted expansion of the state and privatized segments of the economy (the half revolution).The authors refer to three important historical figures - Thomas Hobbes (paved the way the liberal state), John Stuart Mill (philosopher of the liberal state), and Beatrice Webb (the godmother of the welfare) - and their role in the first three reinventions (revolutions) of the state.""The Fourth Revolution"" is about what can be done to make democracy work again. The authors argue a revolution is needed, driven by the necessity of diminishing resources, renewed competition among nation-states, and the pressures accruing to doing things better. ""The West has to change because it is going broke.  ...There is a global context but one based on promise as much his fear...debt and demography dictates that the rich world has to change. ...America continues to tax itself like a small government country (but) spends like a big government one, while hiding its liabilities using tactics that would have made Bernie Madoff blush.""Micklethwaite and Wooldridge are optimists and believe that the ship can be ""righted"" but not without some pain. They hope this book will serve as a call to action to prove John Adams wrong when he wrote, ""Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZLDEIWZCNNUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205396#wasThisHelpful","R1ZLDEIWZCNNUL","A3CZWVO53MLZI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CZWVO53MLZI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Drug Repositioning"" is an excellent resource for biopharmaceutical executives and researchers who are interested in this burgeoning field. Editors Michael Barratt and Donald Frail have successfully corralled 42 experts to contribute meaningful reference papers, providing much more than a basic primer on this daunting topic. Subject areas which are presented in three parts include:PART I - DRUG REPOSITIONING: The business case, strategies, and operational considerations.1. Drug Repositioning - the business case and strategies to repurpose shelved candidates2. The Opportunities and Challenges for developing new indications3. Clinical and Operational Challenges in repositioning4. Regulatory ConsiderationsPART II - APPLICATIONS1. Computational and Bioinformatic Strategies2. Mining Scientific and Clinical Data Bases to Identify Novel Uses3. Predicting the Polypharmacology  of Drugs4. Systemic Phenotype Screening for Novel Synergistic Combinations5. Phenotypic In Vivo Screening6. Old Drugs Yield New DiscoveriesPART III - ACADEMIC AND NONPROFIT INITIATIVES AND THE ROLE OF ALLIANCES IN THE DRUG REPOSTIONING INDUSTRY1. Repurposing Drugs for Tropical Disease2. Drug Repositioning Efforts by Nonprofit Foundations3. Business Development Strategies4. A Case Study - SoseiContributors come from industry, the academy, and non-profits including AstraZeneca, Thomas Reuters, Concert, Pfizer, Comargo, Bayer, Concert, the University of California, Washington University, The Michael J. Fox Foundation, and Polycystic Kidney Disease Foundation.Drug repositioning, also commonly referred to as drug re-profiling or repurposing, has become an increasingly important part of the drug development process for many companies in recent years. Identifying new indications for existing drugs, discontinued, or ""shelved"" assets is a very practical and attractive way to leverage prior or current investments in preclinical and clinical research  that were originally designed with different patient populations in mind. This has become the starting point for numerous biopharma start-ups since this approach requires significantly less development capital and accelerates the time to commercialization.I am now involved in my second start-up commercializing a re-profiled drug or class of drugs. I have found """"Drug Repositioning"" an invaluable resource and guide.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PEFGPR0LIIZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0470878274#wasThisHelpful","R1PEFGPR0LIIZ8","A3CZWVO53MLZI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CZWVO53MLZI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""When the Game Stands Tall"" by sports reporter and author Neil Hayes traces the storied football program at De LaSalle (DLS) High School (Concord, CA) from its roots to becoming one of today's most highly regarded in the U.S. Hayes interweaves three stories - the school's football program which won 151 consecutive games (""The Streak"") over twelve seasons, the life and maturation of DLS's head football coach Bob Ladouceur, and an intimate view of the 2002 game-by-game preparation and execution which led to the 11th consecutive undefeated season.Ladouceur, who played college football at Utah State then San Jose State, was an unlikely candidate for establishing himself as one of the premier high school coaches in the U.S. He left college football with a sour taste for football, feeling that it ""used him up then spit him out.""He played high school football under the legendary Fred Houston at Danville, CA.'s San Ramon High. Houston was a blood and guts coach that forced players to make a choice...""those who remained were dedicated and believed in what they were doing.""  Houston taught discipline, fundamentals, and that the game was hard and had to be played agressively - attributes that would become hallmarks of Ladouceur's programs.Ladouceur's arrival at the Christian Brother's De LaSalle High School in Concord, CA. (35 miles northeast of San Francisco) at the age 25 with of  one year of coaching experience was not popular. Nevertheless, the school's principal who wanted a teacher first and someone who put the students first, and Ladouceur who worked part-time as a probation officer and wanted to help troubled kids, found one another...and the building of a legacy was underway.Author Hayes had unfettered access while writing ""When the Game Stands Tall"" to present and past DLS school officials, coaches and players, opposing players and coaches. The book is filled with quotes, stories of special and troubled players, anecdotes, and speeches made during the period by players, coaches, and Ladouceur.Each game of the 2002 season is presented in great detail with an emphasis on the powerhouse games with Long Beach Poly, Mater Dei of Santa Ana, St. Louis of Hawaii, and local rival, Pittsburgh.""When the Game Stands Tall"" serves as a great how-to manual (and must have) for anyone wanting to coach or lead. Ladouceur's body of work epitomizes excellence and the sacrifice one makes to achieve it. The book also reinforces the notion that fulfilling a vision is a journey, a process, not an event.De LaSalle's success has a history, and it creates a culture, with traditions, ritual and doctrine. It has a mind and a soul as well as a body. It is enduring and deep. It is the legacy the Bob Ladouceur and his staff has created for the ages.This edition of ""When the Game Stands Tall"" is the revised and updated version released in August 2014 to accompany the motion picture bearing its name, starring Jim Caviezel (""Person of Interest,"" ""The Passion of the Christ""), Laura Dern (""Enlightened,"" ""Jurassic Park""), and Clancy Brown (""Shawshank Redemption"").","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24F6MUHJL6B8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1583948058#wasThisHelpful","R24F6MUHJL6B8O","A3CZWVO53MLZI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CZWVO53MLZI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Boards that Lead"" is a call to leadership for boards of directors. In it, authors Ram Charan (renown business adviser and former Harvard Business School teaching great), Dennis Carey (Vice-Chairman, Korn/Ferry Intl), and Michael Useem (Univ Of Penn professor and head of its Leadership and Change Management Center) claim that the time has come for boards to rebalance their responsibilities and take a more active role in the leadership of the enterprise. They point out that there is a delicate balance - board leadership does not mean micro-managing but rather, establishing a deeper relationship among directors and with executive teams by requiring directors to educate themselves on strategy, risk management, and talent development. Board members must also learn when to take charge and when to stay out of the way.""Boards That Lead"" provides the reasons for this, the principles on how to do this, and the cost of not doing this. Charan et al believe that ""directors remain one of the most valuable least utilized company's assets there. Their wisdom and guidance are still too often closeted."" This book provides practical and actionable advice to build on the tangible experience of directors and executives in creating enterprise value.Charan et al begin the book outlining the importance of an enterprise's central idea - ""why the company exists, whom it serves, how should be nurtured, why it will flourish, how it will make money and manage risk, where it must be going if it is to sustain a competitive presence and achieve its broader purpose. The central idea is the bedrock on which the enterprise is raised and how its resources are spent. It is easily translated into action. The board needs to be sure the central idea is clear and compelling that every board member understands it. The central idea provides a rudder that lets the board and management navigate through the choppy waters (that are most certainly) ahead.""The board must be actively involved in developing the enterprise's central idea. Every board member and executive must own it. It is the company's DNA and everything related to the enterprise flows from it.The ""central idea"" concept is one that Charan has been advocating since the 1980s. When successfully done, it gets everyone on the same page and creates a laser-like focus on creating value. Unfortunately, many boards have yet to adopt this concept and for this reason, they and their enterprises are like corks on water floating off to wherever the currents take them. I can personally attest that getting board members and executives to agree on the central idea is very hard work; but with the reward of providing a big return in value.""Boards That Lead"" goes on with actionable advice and examples (including invaluable check lists) for recruiting directors, rooting out board dysfunction (at least 50% of Fortune 500 boards have1-2 dysfunctional members), establishing a board leader, managing CEO succession, managing a falling CEO, turning risk into opportunity, board governance, director evaluation, and the division of responsibilities.The authors use plenty of case study examples throughout the book, including Apple, HP, Infosys, Ford, Glaxo Smith Kline, Lenovo, Brazil's Group RBS, Delphi, and many more.""Boards That Lead"" will be a very useful and valuable guide for board members, CEOs, and potential board members worldwide. While written for larger public companies (U.S. and non-U.S.), smaller public and private (including start-ups) will find great value in this as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP5NFOMQE5LT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IIB04TA#wasThisHelpful","RP5NFOMQE5LT8","A3CZWVO53MLZI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CZWVO53MLZI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been co-leading a Danville (CA) ministry focused on coaching executives, managers, and professionals in-transition since the dot.com crash of 2001. Our weekly meetings consist of workshops and speakers addressing personal brand development, networking, interviewing, and much more. Michael Breen, former SVP, Brand Strategy, Lowe and Partners, serves as our branding expert and teacher.Chritton's ""Personal Branding for Dummies"" provides a great introductory overview of personal branding. She covers all the bases, explains cutting-edge approaches for marketing one's brand, and makes the most important point of all, ""establishing yourself as a (subject matter) expert,"" or as one of our speakers, author Jack Reed, said, ""be the one eyed giant in the land of the blind.""Chritton has organized ""Personal Branding"" around five chapters:1. Why is personal branding important2. Knowing your brand3. Communicating your brand with the world4. Controlling your brand ecosystem5. The Part of Tens (four sets of 10 things to do or not to do to protect your brand)The one weakness of this book is the absence of reference books (and there are many good ones) to use for delving deeper into subject areas of interest. We recommend Loehr's ""The Power of Story"" to help in aligning gifts with passions to insure the ""story"" lived is the right story and not someone else's, like one's parents; Rath's (Gallup) ""StrengthsFinders 2.0"" to help people with identifying and articulating their strengths; and Schwerdtfeger's ""Marketing Short-Cuts"" which has a step-by-step, how to integrate blogs, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, etc. into any marketing campaign - personal or company.I will add Chritton's book to our list of recommended books for participants, and then direct them to others which will provide more depth in key topics. There is no doubt that ""Personal Branding for Dummies"" is for dummies and is not for branding experts. This much needed book will get people off the dime; getting them to think about, develop, and protect their personal brand.As our great teacher, Mike Breen, says, ""If you don't figure out how to brand yourself, the world will...and you will bear the consequences.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZO4K4BF2DLME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118915550#wasThisHelpful","R2ZO4K4BF2DLME","A3CZWVO53MLZI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CZWVO53MLZI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"XXXXXI had been reportingalmost unknowinglyfor a year since the debacle with Dr. Silver.  I had started asking questions because its what I do and because I was scared.Instinctually, Id started gathering bits of information like so many bricks that I could use to build a barricade between me and my gloomy diagnosis [of multiple sclerosis or MS].As I went from doctor to doctor and flew to Canada, California, and back to Denver, I had collected information and ideas about interconnections of body, mind, and spirit.  Or more accurately, I had learned how my body, mind, and spirit were connected.  More than connected, they were in fact the same thing.  All one.The above comes from this inspirational memoir by Jody Berger.  She is a freelance journalist and certified holistic health coach.The one good thing this book gets across is to take charge of your health.  Berger does this and at the same time tells us how difficult it is to navigate Healthcareland.  She ultimately turns to alternative medicine for the right answers since she did not believe her diagnosis of MS.  (She is a graduate of the Institute of Integrative Nutrition based in New York City.)However, I did have problems with this book.  She tells us that she went from doctor to doctor and flew to many places.  She even flew to India for yoga workouts.  She took nutritional supplements.  The fact is that the majority of people would find it difficult to afford everything that she did.  As well, many people cant pick up and fly to places seemingly on a whim.There are some high-profile people that have MS.  One of these people is former talk show host Montel Williams.  You may have seen his infomercials for nutritional products (juicers, etc.).  If nutrition was the answer to the puzzle of MS, youd think he would have been cured years ago.The fact is that MS is a finicky disease, known for its remissions.  By the end of her book, Berger tells us how alternative medicine had cured her and then the book simply ends.  If I was thought to have been cured of MS, the first thing I would do is get the appropriate tests and scans to make sure that this is truly the case.Berger spent, I felt, quite a bit of time discussing her (rich) boyfriend and her tumultuous relationship with her mother.  Doing this bogged down the story.Bergers story reminded me of the late comedian and actress Gilda Radner-.  She did not have MS but had ovarian cancer.  She beat the cancer and even wrote a book of her triumph.  Unfortunately, the cancer returned and she died.  I hope that this is not Bergers fate where her MS returns and she ends up severely disabled.  Time will tell.Finally, Im concerned that this book may send out the wrong message: if you get a diagnosis you dont like, just ignore it and get one you do like.  This is dangerous thinking.In conclusion, this book has good intentions but it may send out the wrong message.(First published 2014;  21 chapters;  afterword;  main narrative 270 pages;  appendix;  references;  acknowledgments;  about the author)<<Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNAC228373KL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402293887#wasThisHelpful","RNAC228373KL2","A2VP7JOT3K7PFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"XXXXX""Animal life on Earth goes back millions of years.  Yet most species use only 3% to 5% of its cerebral capacity.But it isn't until we reached human beings at the top pf the animal chain that we finally see a species use more of its cerebral capacity.10% might not seem like much, but it's a lot if you look at all we've done with it.""The above comes from this intriguing movie written and directed by Luc Besson (who has a small cameo).This is an English-language French sci-fi action movie that was filmed in Taipei, Paris, and New York City.Scarlett Johansson portrays ""Lucy"" who gains special intellectual abilities when a drug is absorbed into her bloodstream.  Morgan Freeman plays a respected professor of neuroscientist whom Lucy consults.We get to see how Lucy changes as her brain capacity increases gradually to 100%.Despite the nonsensical plot that focuses on the 10% brain capacity myth, this movie still managed to pull me in because of Johansson's performance, the intriguing themes, and the visual effects.  In fact, I think it's a credit to director Besson's style and Johansson's performance that this movie wasn't a train wreck.An intriguing feature of this movie is that there are flashbacks to the female hominid (who lived 3.2 million years ago) whose common name was ""Lucy."" (Her discoverers named her after the Beatles' song ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."")  This movie implies that she was the oldest ancestor of humankind.(Four people are credited with discovering the bones of Lucy in Ethiopia in Nov. 1974.  One of these discoverers was American paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson.)The DVD (released in 2015) has one ten-minute extra called ""Cerebral Capacity: The True Science of Lucy.""  I found it quite informative.Finally, this film has performed exceptionally well at the box-office: it has earned back about 11.5 times its budget.In conclusion, I found this an intriguing movie.

"XXXXX""The quantum, the name for the fact that energy comes in finite packages and is not infinitely divisible, was introduced in 1900 to explain puzzling results in a remote corner of physics about how light is emitted and absorbed.Two quantum revolutions followed.The first occurred between 1900 and 1925 when scientists discussed and developed the theory without attracting much public attention.Then, in 1925-27, the theory was transformed by a second revolution, called quantum mechanics, whose bizarre implications became the subject of public curiosity and discussion.Even today, over eighty years later, humanity is still unsure what to make of the second quantum revolution, finding it puzzling, visionary, and even shocking.""The above comes from this fascinating and highly readable book by Robert Crease and Alfred Goldhaber.  Crease is a professor in the Department of Philosophy at Stony Brook University (located in Stony Brook, New York) as well as an author.  Goldhaber is professor at the Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics in Stony Brook University and Fellow of the American Physical Society.This book tells the true story of quantum physics (the physics of the very small or subatomic) in accessible language.  We learn about diverse concepts and images that sprang from the quantum idea such as quantum leaps, randomness, wave-particle duality, the uncertainty principle, complementarity, superposition, Schrodinger's cat, spooky action at a distance, parallel worlds, and multiverses.The history of quantum physics as it progresses is done quite well.  We're introduced to the cast of characters responsible for these revolutions that includes such science geniuses as Max Planck, Erwin Schrodinger, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Paul Dirac, and Albert Einstein.  We get to peruse the actual writings of some of these science giants.Perhaps the greatest idea pursued by this book is looking at the impact of quantum mechanics on general culture.  Thus, along the way, there are jokes, cartoons, trivia, etc.After each chapter is an ""interlude"" that gives technical details or mentions related topics not mentioned in the main narrative.  {These interludes can be skipped if desired.)Finally, there are just over forty-five illustrations (portraits, comics, etc.) found in this book.In conclusion, after reading this book you'll probably agree with the following penned by a philosopher:""Never in the history of science has there been a theory which has had such a profound impact on human thinking as quantum mechanics; nor has there been a theory which scored such spectacular successes in the prediction of such an enormous variety of phenomena.""**After writing this review, I deserve a break.

"XXXXX""What makes our time so different than the past is that we've never had 7 billion people living on the planet.  50% of the surface of our planet is in the tropics and 70% [about 5 billion] of those people live in the tropics.  And so the impacts on people will be felt most severely here in the tropical regions.In the worst case [scenario], if we melt all [the glacial] ice on the planet, sea level will rise 70 meters [about 230 feet].The world will not look like it looks like today.  The impacts on people having to migrate to find places to live will be tremendous.""The above is said by one of the commenters in this beautifully-filmed documentary.  It has no narration but is purely comment-driven.A glacier is a body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight.  It forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its melting over many years (usually centuries).  Glaciers are found in mountain ranges on every continent (except Australia).  Glacial ice is the largest reservoir of freshwater on Earth.This documentary is a journey along the spine of the Andes Mountain Range in South America.  We start in Columbia, then go to Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and end in Argentina.Along the way, we get to know the indigenous people and lives of those (especially farmers) who are affected by the dwindling tropical glacial reserve.  (The dwindling glacial reserve is the ""canary in the coal mine"" for climate change and global warming.)We are accompanied by scientists (geologists, climatologists, glaciologists, etc.) who give us a perspective on what is happening in the natural world and what we can expect.And from that, the greatest thing we learn is of the chain reaction effect that these disappearing glaciers are having on us and the rest of the world.This film has comments from over fifty environmentalists, activists, and scientists.  It features Lonnie Thompson, ""Time"" magazine's ""Hero of the Environment.""Finally, this documentary is the ""official selection"" of many film festivals.In conclusion, this is a beautifully-filmed documentary that educates the viewer about an alarming ugly fact: the dwindling glacial reserve in the Andes Mountain Range of South America.(2013;  93 min excluding end credits;  wide screen;  9 chapters)<<Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I9ZZV60XPCNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J4S0LHQ#wasThisHelpful","R1I9ZZV60XPCNG","A2VP7JOT3K7PFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"XXXXX""[1] [Are] there other Earth-size, Earth-like exoplanets [extrasolar planets, a planet that orbits a star other than our Sun] in our Galaxy, and in the wider universe?[2] Was our situation here on Earth average, or was it instead quite special, even unique?[3] [Are] we cosmically alone?I decided to write this book when I learned just how soon we might gain answers to some of these seemingly timeless questions.""The above is found in the introduction of this interesting book by Lee Billings.  He is a science writer whose work has appeared in several respected science magazines.  This is his first book.The first two chapters begin with the history of SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence), a discussion with SETI pioneer Frank Drake, and a detailed look at the Drake Equation, an equation that must be considered when dealing with ""The search for life among the stars"" (this book's subtitle).  I felt that these first chapters were well-done and I must admit that Billings' writing and research are impressive.One thing that Billings does in these chapters is provide the reader with the actual values that Drake and others came up with for the Drake Equation (a seven-variable equation formulated in 1961 which calculates ""N,"" the number of communicating civilizations on exoplanets in our Galaxy).  I think, instead of providing values that are over fifty years old, it would have been more instructive to provide the present-day values  As well, the final value of N is not calculated (even though a value is given using Drake's ""shortcut"").(I did do the calculation using the actual values of 1961 and got {N = 20 to 50,000,000}.  For those who are interested, the present-day value is {N = 2 to 280,000,000}).The next four chapters seem to go off-topic.  Billings gets lost in historical asides as well as long, detailed profiles of scientists, and other musing (e.g.  greenhouse gases, Marcellus formation) .  There are chapters, for example, on the history of astronomy and the Earth's early epochs (Yawn).  Thus, I found these four chapters somewhat tedious to read (even though the writing is still good).  In fact, I was going to give up on the book at this point.However, I decided not to give-up.  To my surprise, I found that the last four chapters went back on-topic with respect to exoplanets and I found them to be quite interesting since I had not read some of this information before.  Yes, the author does meander at times but generally he stays on-topic.Billings traces the triumphs, tragedies, and even betrayals of the exceptional men (e.g.  Jim Kasting, a former NASA scientist) and women (e.g. Sara Seager, a MIT professor and visionary, known as the ""astronomical Indiana Jones"") seeking life among the stars.This book has no illustrations.  These, I feel, would have helped cut down this book's wordiness.Finally, I should explain my rating.  Six of this book's ten chapters are good.  Thus, it deserves three stars out of five stars.  I was also impressed with the quality of writing and research.  Therefore, this book deserves another half starIn conclusion, when he stays on-topic, science journalist Lee Billings does a good job of exploring the past and future of the ""exoplanet boom"" through research and interviews with the astronomers and planetary scientists at its forefront!!*** (First published 2013;  introduction;  10 chapters;  main narrative 265 pages;  acknowledgements;  references and notes;  index)<<Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11RHRNXEMKR6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617230162#wasThisHelpful","R11RHRNXEMKR6O","A2VP7JOT3K7PFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"XXXXX""[In this book], we aim to provide a response to the plethora of skeptic misconceptions that inundate the media and blogosphere.Using clear and accessible explanations of what we do and don't know about the science, we hope to equip readers with the tools to distinguish fact from fiction, to see through the smoke and mirrors, and to understand what needs to be done to address climate change and why.You don't need a degree in science to understand the basic principles of climate change, but you do need to have some facts straight--facts that we're confident you'll have at hand after reading this book.""The above comes from the introduction of this book by Seth Darling and Douglas Sisterson.  Darling is a scientist at the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) in Illinois.  Sisterson is a senior manager at the ANL for the US Department of Energy's Climate Research Facility.  Both authors have received the University of Chicago's Pinnacle of Education Award.What this easy-to-read book does is to scientifically examine fourteen claims common among climate change skeptics (also called ""truthers"").Here are just five of the fourteen skeptic claims that are examined:(1) There is no consensus.(2) Who says climate change is such a bad thing?(Climate change is any significant change in the measures of climate {such as temperature, precipitation, or humidity} lasting for an extended period of time {such as several decades or centuries}.  Many people confuse this with ""global warming"" which is the phenomenon of rising average temperatures around the planet.)(3) Climate is too complex to model or predict.(Climate is not the same as weather.  Weather is what you get day to day.  Measures of weather include temperature, humidity, and precipitation.  Climate is the average of weather measures over many decades, usually a thirty-year period.)(4) There's no link between carbon dioxide and global temperature.  (Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas.)(5) Renewable energy is too expensive or too variable.  (Renewables include solar and wind.)I said above that fourteen skeptic claims are examined in this book.  Actually, what I meant to say is that there are fourteen major skeptic claims that require an in-depth scientific analysis.A chapter in this book examines eleven minor skeptic claims that can be easily explained and thus can be lumped into one chapter.  An example of a minor skeptic claim found in this book is as follows:Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), rather than carbon dioxide, are the primary cause of climate change.Thus, in effect, this book examines a total of twenty-five skeptic claims.Finally, excellent illustrations permeate this book.  My favourite is entitled, ""Greenhouse Effect.""  It has the following caption:""The sun's rays heat up the Earth's surface, which then emits longwave radiation back toward space.

"XXXXX""As I began to research this book and initiated conversations with dozens of climate scientists, geologists, and atmospheric physicists, I learned that the [U.S.] Midwest and the [U.S.] Southern Plains are likely to tip into desert once again as temperatures continue their inexorable climb.Combing through the gripping and poignant oral histories of the survivors of the 1930s' Dust Bowl, it hit me that the bleak physical, psychological, and emotional assaults on their daily lives might offer a glimpse of what our future could hold.  These stories also provide a disturbing preview of the impending deterioration of our physical health amid the growing deprivations, changes in ecosystems, and increasingly harsh weather that result from the careless dumping of billions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.""The above comes from the beginning of the extremely well-written book by Linda Marsa.  She is an investigative journalist who has covered medicine, health, and science for more than two decades.The hallmark of this book is that it depends on interviews with people.  These people include scientists and public health doctors from all over the world.  Aussies on climate change's front lines.  Physicians, nurses, and firefighters in New Orleans who experienced Hurricane Katrina.  Green activists in New York (where Super storm Sandy occurred) and Vancouver, Canada.  Environmental justice advocates in California.The title and subtitle of this book gives the impression that this book ONLY deals with the important subject of how a hotter planet will hurt our health.  It certainly examines this.  But it also gives more information by detailing, quite well, the effects of climate change in the past and what that may mean for our future.The result is quite an informative book.  In fact, I would say it's probably the best non-technical book I have read on climate change.Finally, in the last chapter, Marsa makes the case that our fate is not sealed due to climate change.  We can make a change but only if we act today.In conclusion, this is a must-read for anyone who cares about humanity's future!!(First published 2013;  acknowledgements;  introduction;  eight chapters;  main narrative 215 pages;  notes;  bibliography;  index)<<Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LYLUOYNJ1ZK4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160529201X#wasThisHelpful","R2LYLUOYNJ1ZK4","A2VP7JOT3K7PFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"XXXXX""In the United States alone, more than 10 million children are living with domestic violence--just as I [the author] did...More than 1 in 7 adults in the United States, or 40 million people, lived with domestic violence as children.Worldwide, the number of people who lived with domestic violence when they were young is approximately 725 million.  Another 275 million are currently living with it...This is my [the author's] wish for everyone who grew up with domestic violence:[Through] all those [ten] LIES--that you are guilty, resentful, sad, alone, angry, hopeless, worthless, fearful, self-conscious, and unloved--you can see the TRUTH.It can be done, because we are RESILIENT, much stronger than we ever knew.  When we discover that HIDDEN STRENGTH, the TRUTH is never far away.""The above comes from the beginning and end of this penetrating and eye-opening book by Brian F. Martin.  He is an entrepreneur, and founder of the Children of Domestic Violence Foundation (in New York) whose mission is ""to help those who grow up living with domestic violence reach their full potential.""  Martin is also a victim of domestic violence.The purpose of this book is to increase awareness and understanding of childhood domestic violence.  Its purpose is also to inform and inspire anyone who grew up living with domestic violence, including those who care for them.  This book is also a fantastic resource for those (like me) who want to learn about domestic violence.What this book does is that it takes the ten lies mentioned above and devotes a chapter to each one of them, showing how it is possible to transform the lie into a truth.  For example, there is a chapter on the lie of being fearful and how that lie can be transformed into the truth of being confident.  (Thus, this chapter is entitled ""Fearful to Confident."")How does each chapter achieve its goal?  By using:(1) Revealing and powerful true stories(2) The author's own experiences (where applicable)(3) Commentary based on the latest social science and psychological researchFinally, what I especially liked were the summaries at the end of each chapter.  These are entitled ""FROM THE LIE TO THE TRUTH.""  Each summary is divided into four brief sections:(1) THE LIE (an explanation of the lie is given)(2) THE WHY (that is, why the lie has taken over your life)(3) THE TRUTH (the desired transformation of the lie)(4) TO TRY (simple, practical exercises that will aid you in transforming a lie into a truth)In conclusion, this is a powerful book that has the potential to change lives.  I leave you with some quotations from this book:(1)  ""If you lived with domestic violence when you were young, you no longer have to live with [its] effects today.""(2)  ""Because we survived difficulties that others never had to face, we have far more potential than we realize.  We were forced to develop qualities of resilience, courage and perseverance that are now available to us as adults.""(3)  ""As you unlearn the lies that were unconsciously coded when you were a child and free yourself from the fears and emotions that hold you back, you can begin a journey toward reclaiming the life you were meant to live.""(4)  ""Our lives have become so fire tested that, in many ways, we've become INVINCIBLE.""(First published 2014;  author's note;  foreword;  preface;  introduction: ""Undiscovered Gifts;""  10 chapters;  conclusion: ""My Wish for You;""  main narrative 245 pages;  acknowledgements;  notes;  index;  about the author)<<Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REP8AQXKY5CGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399166572#wasThisHelpful","REP8AQXKY5CGN","A2VP7JOT3K7PFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"XXXXX""The most incredible effect of fracking is the impact it has on the amount of energy we have in the world.  With one technological leap, we have increased the world's [natural] gas reserves by 40 per cent, an astonishing magnitude.And it has opened up energy reserves in countries that have never had them before.  Countries like Poland and Ukraine, which have to depend on Russia for their daily needs...The natural gas transformation [or revolution] is making energy-starved countries into energy powerhouses from scratch.""(""Fracking"" is short for hydraulic fracturing.  It involves the injection of millions of gallons of water mixed with sand and chemicals into a well deep underground to fracture shale rock and release stores of gas {and oil}.  In this book, the author defends the virtues of shale gas obtained through fracking.)The above (in quotation marks) comes from this strange book by Ezra Levant.  Even without reading this book's main narrative, I noticed not one but two odd things as well as one omission.On this book's inside back flap, there is a mini-biography of Levant that says, among other things, that he is a ""lawyer"" and ""journalist.""  Yes he has a law degree so he is a lawyer.  (The law firm I deal with is ""Dewey, Cheatem, and Howe."")  However, he has no journalism degree.  Therefore, he is not a journalist.Next, I looked at this book's table of contents.  There are exactly four chapters (of thirteen) devoted to the ""Criticisms of Fracking.""  (That is, each of these four chapters analyses quite briefly one criticism of fracking.)  ONLY FOUR!!  Levant must realize that there's many more than just four!What's omitted in Levant's mini-biography is that he was a tobacco industry lobbyist.  Yes, he was one of those intelligent people that told people (including children) that cigarette smoking is not bad for their health.What does all this mean?  It means you have to be very, very, very, VERY careful when reading this book.I wondered how Levant could possibly make a ""case for fracking"" (this book's subtitle) without examining ALL the criticisms of fracking.  Of course!  In typical Levant style he abrasively attacks what he terms ""the enemies of fracking.""Revisiting a theme from his earlier book,  ""Ethical OIL,"" Levant argues that the crux of our energy future comes down to a simple choice between ""ethical energy"" represented by shale gas and ""conflict energy"" sold by human-rights violators such as Iran and Russia.He rejects, not surprisingly, criticism of shale gas upon water quality and green-house emissions and repeatedly tells us that fracking is ""clean"" and ""harmless."" Renewable technologies like solar photovoltaic and wind are dismissed as the ""costly fantasies"" of those pesky environmentalists.Levant achieves near angelic eloquence in highlighting fracking's effect on economic opportunity, not only in North America, but overseas as well.It seems that Levant is unaware of the immediate impact of a shale gas revolution outside of North America.  In April 2013, ""Forbes"" magazine identified ""six reasons fracking has flopped overseas.""  A year later, the BBC was reporting that the ""shale industry faces global reality check.""Levant's outright dismissal of solar as a ""messiah fuel"" has been challenged by on-going cost reductions of solar power.  In fact, both the U.S. and China appear to be ready for significant solar growth.  (Apparently, Levant forgot (??) to tell us that there's more than one energy revolution taking place.)Levant's environmental arguments in favour of shale gas are simple (very simple!) but run contrary to current science.  A 2014 report of the Council of Canadian Academies states that:""The assessment of environmental impact is hampered by the lack of information about many key issues, particularly the problem of fluids escaping from incompletely sealed wells.""Levant dismisses concerns over community health and seems to ignore the importance of indigenous Aboriginal rights with natural resource development.His greatest blunder is stating that human-influenced climate change is ""speculative.""  By doing so, Levant casts a dark shadow over his entire argument.This book has no index.  Why?  A wealth of information is presented but there is no easy access to it.Finally, Levant asks the following question: ""How did the fracking industry come to use so many kitchen ingredients to drill for oil and gas?""  Here he's referring to the chemicals used initially in fracking (they're combined with water to form a ""chemical cocktail"") and is implying that they are so safe that they can be ingested.As well, Levant talks about the ""flow back water"" (the waste water that returns to the surface in the fracking process) and implies that it's actually safe after being recycled.Let's test his claims.  If the ""chemical cocktail"" and the recycled ""flow back water"" are so safe, then I challenge Levant to drink a standard cup of these fracked waters on his televised ""news"" show.  (The only thing I ask is that either I or a person of science supervise the entire process.)In conclusion, former tobacco industry lobbyist and wannabe journalist Ezra Levant has presented a ""case for fracking.""My verdict:Levant has failed to adequately provide a convincing case.(First published 2014; introduction;  13 chapters; conclusion; main narrative 225 pages;  acknowledgements;  sources)<<Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IBBZ4YTXM2EU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0771046448#wasThisHelpful","R2IBBZ4YTXM2EU","A2VP7JOT3K7PFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Both actors do a good job in their roles.  Elba seemed to have a certain charisma that kept me drawn to the movie.  (The real Nelson Mandela also had charisma.)The background music was impressive.

"XXXXX""Gorongosa National Park [in Mozambique, Southeast Africa], with the mountain [Mt. Gorongosa] forming its northwestern border, is a global treasure.  Its forested plateau is the southernmost extension of Africa's Great Rift Valley, a domain of savanna, dry forest, and grassland centered around Lake Urema and fed by a lacework of rivers and tributary streams.  The eastern slope of Mount Gorongosa is covered by a series of vegetation zones weakly divided by elevation and capped by the summit rain forest.  Close by rise three seldom visited inselbergs, miniature peaks of lower elevation.To the east of the massif is a region of caves and exposed limestone ridges and intervening deep ravines, their sides and bottoms heavily grown in rain forest, also awaiting exploration.  This mix provides the greatest variety of habitats of any park in Mozambique, and one of the most diverse in the entire world.In the whole of the park have been found so far 398 bird species...compared with 914 in all of North America; 123 mammals...which is well above the 67 species living...in Yellowstone National Park; 34 [reptile species]; and 43 [amphibian species].  It is just an educated guess, but I am reasonably certain that the resident species of insects, arachnids, and other invertebrates number in the tens of thousands.""The above comes from this revealing book by Edward O.

He has received more than one hundred awards including the U.S. National Medal of Science, two Pulitzer Prizes in nonfiction, International Prize for Biology, and the Carl Sagan Award for Public Understanding of Science.  Wilson is currently Honorary Curator in Entomology and University Research Professor Emeritus, Harvard University.There are three parts to this book:(1) Text or main narrative (by Wilson)(2) Photographs in color(3) DVD (by an award-winning filmmaker)What can I say about this extraordinary book?  Between Wilson's splendid main narrative and the gorgeous photographs, I learned a lot about a piece of ""paradise.""If that's not enough, the DVD (a ""companion"" to the book) entitled ""The Guide"" is beautifully filmed.  It catches the essence of the book through the eyes of one of the park's young indigenous inhabitants (who is also briefly mentioned in the book and may well, in the future, become this park's ambassador).  We also get to see the man himself, Professor Wilson, and the philanthropist who made everything possible, Greg Carr.  (It was Carr who conceived and brought to reality the rebirth of this majestic park.)(Note that the DVD is located in a pouch at the back of the book.)Where does the title of this book come from?  The wild lands of Africa (that includes Gorongosa National Park) gave birth to humanity, and it is this natural world, still evolving, that may outlast us humans and become our legacy, our WINDOW ON ETERNITY.Finally, the front cover of this book (displayed above by Amazon) shows the lush canopy of the forest and two inselbergs in the western part of Gorongosa National Park.In conclusion, the subtitle of this book is entitled ""A biologist's walk through Gorongosa National Park.""

"XXXXX""I am concerned with the direction that corporate America is headed.  I am convinced that empathy-based management is a healthier and more effective way to manage your employees than traditional management practices based on temporary inducements.  The practice of empathy-based management needs to become a conversation in your organization and across corporate America about what works and what is ineffective in the real world.  I hope you'll make this book a starting point for this much-needed discussion.""The above comes from the conclusion of this pioneering book by George Langelett, PhD.  He is a professor of management and economics at South Dakota State University in Brookings, SD. Also, Langelett is a member of the Academy of Management.So just what is empathy?  Langelett prefers humanistic psychologist Carl Roger's definition:""Real Communication occurs...when we listen with understanding.  What does this mean?  It means to see the expressed idea and attitude from the other person's point of view, to sense how it feels to be [that person], to achieve [that person's] frame of reference in regard to the thing [that person] is talking about.""Langelett defines empathy-based management as follows:""A new protocol in which a manager's ability to empathize is a prerequisite to effectively performing the duties of management, including planning, organizing, leading, and controlling.""This book is well-written (though repetitive and wordy in spots).  I liked the neuroscience that was presented which gives strong validity to the effectiveness of empathy-based management.  I especially appreciated the conclusions or summaries found at the end of each chapter that included a preview of what was to be discussed in the next chapter.Another hallmark of this book is that it includes hypothetical dialogue between a manager and employee in order to illustrate a particular empathetic technique.There are six appendices.  Each one is short and concise.  My two favourite ones are entitled ""A Journey through Management Theories of Motivation"" and ""Managing by Fear vs. Managing by Empathy.""There are also three worksheets.  These are important because they allow you to put the book's core information into practice immediately.Finally, the only problem I had with this book is that there is no index.  This by itself is not a big problem since it can be made up for in other ways.  For example, the table of contents, instead of just listing the titles of each chapter as this book does, could have had indicated the names of each section included in a particular chapter.  Also, there could have been a glossary listing key words and key terms that are paramount to empathy-based management.I say this because this is an instructional book and access to information is thus critical.In conclusion, I feel that this is a pioneering work that may very well help change the direction of corporate America!!  Best of all, empathy-based behavior is not difficult to learn as Langelett tells us:""Management literature often treats empathy as a fixed personality trait.  This assumption is incorrect.  Much like learning to drive a car, empathetic behavior is a skill that can be mastered with practice by virtually anyone.""(first published 2014;  preface;  introduction;  5 chapters;  conclusion;  main narrative 135 pages;  acknowledgements;  6 appendices;  3 worksheets;  about the author;  notes;  bibliography;  further reading)<<Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YOGAFCPJSEQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1938416732#wasThisHelpful","R1YOGAFCPJSEQM","A2VP7JOT3K7PFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"XXXXX""If I cannot definitely prove that the usefulness of religion is in the past,[1] and that its foundational books are transparent fables,[2] and that it is a man-made imposition,[3] and that it has been an enemy of science and inquiry,[4] and that it has subsisted largely on lies and fears,[5] and been the accomplice of ignorance and guilt as well as slavery, genocide...and tyranny...[6] [and that there is a] connection between religion, racism, and [dictatorship or] totalitarianism [as found, for example, in the Hitler and Stalin regimes],I can most certainly claim that religion is fully aware of these criticisms.It is also fully aware of the ever-mounting evidence, concerning the origins of the cosmos and the origin of species, which consign it to marginality if not to irrelevance.""The above is found in this fascinating book by Christopher Hitchens (1949 to 2011). He was a British-American author and journalist whose career spanned more than four decades. Hitchens was named number five an a list of the ""Top 100 Public Intellectuals.""He supports his position that ""religion poisons everything"" with personal stories, documented historical evidence, and analysis of religious texts.Hitchens is mainly concerned with the Abrahamic religions (the largest being Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) although he touches on other religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism.I feel that the best way of conveying what this book has to offer is to list some of its chapter titles:(1) Religion kills(2) A note on health to which religion can be hazardous(3) The metaphysical claims of religion are false(4) Arguments from design(5) Revelation: the nightmare of the ""Old"" Testament(6) The 'New' Testament exceeds the evil of the ""Old"" one(7) Does religion make people behave better?(8) Is religion child abuse?(9) A finer tradition: the resistance of the rationalOne of my favourite chapters is the one where the author tells us that ""there are, indeed, several ways in which religion is not just amoral, but positively immoral."" These are:(1) Presenting a false picture of the world to the innocent and [to those that believe too easily especially with no proof](2) The doctrine of blood sacrifice(3) The doctrine of atonement(4) The doctrine of eternal reward and/or punishment(5) The imposition of impossible tasks and rulesFinally, the vocabulary used in this book is, in a word, impeccable. I, personally, appreciated this but some potential readers may have to resort to using a dictionary for some words.In his book's acknowledgements section, Hitchens states,""To all those...who live in...worlds where superstition and barbarism are still dominant...I hope this little book may fall [into their hands].""In conclusion, I fully agree with the endorsement on the book's back cover that states:""an intellectual willing to show his teeth in the cause of righteousness.""Christopher Hitchens may be the best since Bertrand Russell's ""Why I am not a Christian"" (1927) to laying out essential arguments with both force and precision!!(first published 2007; 18 chapters; conclusion; main narrative 285 pages; acknowledgements; references; index)<<Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1069NYRX488MK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DU7A172#wasThisHelpful","R1069NYRX488MK","A2VP7JOT3K7PFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"XXXXX""After decades of studying religion, I was awakened to the idea that because skepticism was my nature, I had more questions than answers about religion [or religious faith].  [Faith is complete, unquestioning acceptance of something even in the absence of proof and especially, of something not supported by reason.]I realized that free thought had been the methodology with which I explored my theological questions and that agnosticism [the doctrine that that the human mind cannot know if there is a God] was the conclusion to an investigation into the question of religion that spanned twenty-five years.But what really brought me to atheism--and I believe that atheism is an opinion because the existence of something outside of our reality is neither provable [nor] unprovable--was humanism [any system of thought based on the nature, interests, and ideals of humans].  In all my endeavours, from ministry to city hall [the author had a job at city hall until he was fired], humanism has been my motivation.""The above comes from this memoir or autobiography by Jerry DeWitt {with Ethan Brown}.  His ministry began when he was seventeen.  After twenty-five years as a preacher, including being the pastor of two fundamentalist congregations (he preached for the last time in April 2011), DeWitt became an atheist, writer, and public speaker.  {Brown is an author.}This book does exactly what it says on the front cover.  It traces DeWitt's agonizing journey from belief (or faith) to atheism (the doctrine that there is no God or gods; godlessness).I think the best way to convey the essence of this book is to list its chapter titles:(1) God loves everyone(2) God saves everyone(3) God is in everyone(4) God is everyone's internal dialogue(5) GOD IS A DELUSIONI have to give DeWitt a lot of credit.  It must of took tremendous courage to come out as an atheist after being a preacher for quarter of a century.  (There were consequences to this action: public ostracism, family break-up, and financial ruin.)I want to emphasize that this book, in no way, attempts to convert readers to atheism.  For those readers that are already atheists, this book will probably be quite an interesting read.Finally, I had a couple of problems:First, I mentioned above that this book was a memoir or autobiography.  Unfortunately, this information is tucked away at the very back of the book.  I think it would have been beneficial to have this information at the very front so as to prepare the reader for what is to come.Second, the first chapter is VERY long (150 pages).  I think some of the excessive detail in this chapter could have been removed without affecting the overall story.In conclusion, this book effectively traces a pastor's tortuous journey from faith to atheism!!  I leave you with the author's explanation of the book's title:""By embracing humanism as fully as I once embraced God, [I now know] there is HOPE AFTER FAITH.""(First published 2013;  prologue;  5 chapters;  epilogue;  main narrative 265 pages;  acknowledgements)<<Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11HKIX2VMU95T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0306822245#wasThisHelpful","R11HKIX2VMU95T","A2VP7JOT3K7PFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"XXXXX""Tanis development proceeding.  Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra.  Abner Ravenwood, U.S.""The above secret German cable is the motivation for this fantasy adventure film (from a story by George Lucas and Philip Kaufman, directed by Steven Spielberg).  For if the Germans acquire the headpiece, they will be able to locate the lost Ark of the Covenant with its mysterious powers.  (The Ark of the Covenant is a chest that contains the stone tablets in which the Ten Commandments are inscribed.)It's up to Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) to locate the Ark before the Germans do.  Dr. Jones is Professor of Archaeology, expert on the occult, and obtainer of rare antiquities.  Jones' trademark when he's in the field is his bullwhip and Fedora (a type of hat).This movie could very well be the greatest adventure film of all time.  The viewer is treated to one cliff hanger after another.  As well, the acting and special effects are good.  (This is Alfred Molina's acting debut.)What I especially liked was the blend of humor, adventure, and drama.  Also, the music by the great John Williams is unforgettable.Photography was in France, Tunisia, Hawaii, and studios in England.The title of this movie was originally ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" but was later changed for marketing purposes.This film originated from George Lucas' desire to create a modern version of the serials of the 1930s and 1940s.The budget for this movie was eighteen million dollars.  It has grossed almost three-hundred and ninety million worldwide!Finally, the DVD itself (released in 2008) has six extras.  I found most of them interesting.In conclusion, I would recommend that you have your seat belts on when you view this film.  Why?

"XXXXX""Nolan KennardGeorge CameronThomas SternJohnny SquaresMolly FisherTony EngedalMichael CiprianoHarry Callahan""The above list of names is a DEAD POOL--a macabre betting pool where the bet is who will die.  And the last name on this list is SFPD Inspector ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood).This list is the motivation behind this final film in the ""Dirty Harry"" franchise.  Harry has to find the serial killer who made up this list, not only to save others on it, but to save--himself!!Harry's new partner (his old partners have a habit of getting killed) is a karate wiz.  I personally enjoyed the performance of the actor who portrayed Harry's partner (Evan Kim).And yes, there is a famous car-chase scene in this movie.  But instead of being between two cars, it's between a remote-controlled bomb (disguised as a remote-controlled toy car) and a conventional car driven by our hero.I thought this chase scene was ingenious.  This scene has many similarities with the famous chase in the Steve McQueen film ""Bullitt"" (1968) which also took place in San Francisco.For some reason, this movie is underappreciated.  The acting is good with top-notch performances from not only Clint Eastwood but from Liam Neeson, Patricia Clarkson, and Jim Carrey (his first non-comedy film).Perhaps it's because of Eastwood's age (he was 58) that this movie is not appreciated.  However, he appeared to me to be quite fit.  Then, perhaps, people were just getting tired of this character.  There are probably many opinions as to why this film is so underappreciated.  (As Dirty Harry says in this movie, ""Opinions are like a-holes.  Everybody has one"").There are five movies in the ""Dirty Harry"" movie series.  In my opinion, the best one was ""Dirty Harry"" (1971) and the most mediocre was ""The Enforcer"" (1976).  Between these two extremes lies this film, ""Magnum Force"" (1973), and ""Sudden Impact"" (1983).Finally, the DVD itself (released in 2001 and part of the Clint Eastwood collection) has five extras.In conclusion, this is a worthy addition to the ""Dirty Harry"" movie series!!(1988;  1 hr, 28 min excluding end credits;  wide screen;  31 scenes;  rated `R')<<Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WWNTVOXUJUWY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005NTNL#wasThisHelpful","R2WWNTVOXUJUWY","A2VP7JOT3K7PFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"XXXXX""This is the .44 Magnum Automag...and if properly used, it can remove the fingerprints.""The above is a memorable line from this fourth movie in the ""Dirty Harry"" series.  This movie breathed new life into the series after the mediocre ""The Enforcer"" (1976).  (The first two movies in the series were the excellent ""Dirty Harry,"" 1971 and the good ""Magnum Force,"" 1973.)This time Clint Eastwood (as SFPD Inspector Harry Callahan) took over the reins by producing & directing this movie and it shows.  As well, Eastwood seems to have renewed interest in the character, giving it the energy and intensity it deserves.  (He seemed to have lost this interest in ""The Enforcer."")Sondra Locke plays a ""revenge"" killer in this movie.  She does a good job in her role.This is the only ""Dirty Harry"" movie to be primarily set and filmed outside of San Francisco.This movie is especially known for the catchphrase ""Go ahead, make my day"" (uttered by Harry).  In fact, it became so famous that then-President Ronald Reagan used it in a speech to Congress to challenge them on an issue.This movie was a box-office success.  It was the highest-grossing movie of the five films in the ""Dirty Harry"" franchise.Finally, the DVD itself (released in 2001 and part of the Clint Eastwood Collection) has five extras.In conclusion, this is a must-see movie that breathed new life into the ""Dirty Harry"" movie series.

"XXXXX""We want one million dollars or we start blowing things up.  The People's Revolutionary Strike Force.  Remember Fessenheim.""The above is the motivation for this third installment in the ""Dirty Harry"" movie series.This movie tries to follow the same formula as the first movie (""Dirty Harry,"" 1971) but this time instead of pursuing a single thug, ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) is going after a group of thugs.The first movie also presents Dirty Harry to the world and does a memorable job in doing this.  This movie can't do this so, to make it more interesting, Harry is teamed up with a newly-minted female inspector (Tyne Daly).Unfortunately, this does make for a very interesting film.  Clint Eastwood seems to walk through his performance and does not seem to deliver the same energy or intensity as he did in the first two installments of the series.  (The second installment was ""Magnum Force,"" 1973.)The only bright spot is Tyne Daly.  She gives an admirable performance.This movie has a high level of violence but even with this, this film seems ""routine.""As well, the background music was lack-lustre.I was surprised when I read that this movie was a major commercial success.  (Its budget was nine million dollars and its box office draw was about forty-six million.)  I think this was due to Clint Eastwood's star power which was firmly established by then.Finally, the DVD itself (released in 2001, part of ""The Clint Eastwood Collection"") has six extras.In conclusion, after two excellent installments in the ""Dirty Harry"" movie series, this movie falls below expectations.(1976;  1 hr, 35 min excluding end credits;  wide screen;  30 scenes;  rated `R')<<Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y7F7F4IBRXJV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005NTNM#wasThisHelpful","R2Y7F7F4IBRXJV","A2VP7JOT3K7PFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"XXXXXThis is the second movie in the ""Dirty Harry"" series and it does not disappoint.This time major thugs are being killed and it seems like ""somebody is trying to put the courts out of business.""  It's up to Harry to solve the mystery of who is responsible.I found that this movie was more action-orientated and did not have the emotional impact of the first movie.  (""Dirty Harry,"" 1971).The acting is terrific.  Clint Eastwood gives his usual excellent performance as Harry Callahan (even though Harry is not as gritty as he was in the first movie).  However, Hal Holbrook gives an equally good performance as his boss, Lieutenant Briggs.This movie also features early appearances by David Soul (""Starsky and Hutch"") Robert Urich (""S.W.A.T.,"" ""Vegas,"" ""Spencer for Hire"") and Tim Matheson (""Animal House"").  Also, look for Suzanne Sommers (""Three's Company"") in a bit part.There is also social commentary blended into the action of this movie.The background music is good but not as good as in the first film.This is also the longest movie in the series.Finally, the DVD (part of the Clint Eastwood Collection, released in 2001) has six extras.In conclusion, this is a decent sequel in the ""Dirty Harry"" series!

He is founder of Celera Genomics, the Institute for Genomic Research, and the J. Craig Venter Institute.  Venter is the recipient of numerous awards and honorary degrees, including the 2008 U.S. National Medal of Science.Venter opens his book with the question ""What is life?""  He asserts that life is reducible to the ""DNA machines"" and ""protein robots"" that operates within cells and hopes to prove it by constructing synthetic organisms from scratch.On May 20, 2010, headlines around the world announced one of the most extraordinary accomplishments in modern science: the creation of the world's first synthetic life form.  In other words, Venter had achieved his goal.(""Synthetic life [is] self-replicating biology based on a synthetic genome, a synthetic code-script."")In this book, Venter shares the dramatic account of how he led a team of scientists to this pioneering effort in synthetic genomics--and details how that work will have a profound impact of humanity in the future.Venter does a good job in tracing the history of key discoveries in genetics along the way.  The science described in this book is impeccable.A major strength of this book is the portrayal of the scientific process, of the false starts, unexpected problems, and improvised solutions.  Venter does not shy away from discussing the setbacks his team faced before his synthetic cell came to life.Finally, there are a few problems with this book.  There is too much technical detail that may scare off the casual reader.  Thus, a good glossary would have been helpful.  (The good news here is you don't have to understand all the scientific technicalities to appreciate this book.)  As well, illustrations would have been beneficial, thereby reducing this book's wordiness.Bottom-line: this book offers an insider's view of one of science's hottest new fields!!!(First published 2013;  12 chapters;  main narrative 185 pages;  acknowledgements;  notes;  index)<<Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AZTFAJJFZ08I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670025402#wasThisHelpful","R3AZTFAJJFZ08I","A2VP7JOT3K7PFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Hawking is a disabled theoretical physicist and cosmologist who was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics (a post once held by Sir Isaac Newton) at the University of Cambridge for thirty years.  He has been the recipient of numerous awards and honours.  Hawking has written many books for the general reader including the classic ""A Brief History of Time.""This is Hawking's autobiography.  He recounts his improbable journey from his postwar London boyhood to his years of international acclaim and celebrity.This book is aptly titled.  This is a very brief book and in my opinion, far to brief.  For somebody who ""has been married twice"" with ""beautiful and accomplished children,"" and who has ""been successful in [his] scientific career,"" it's hard to believe he hasn't more--much more--to mention.For those who have followed Hawking throughout the years, you won't find much new here although I did find a bit of stuff that was new to me.  Some of the almost forty-five black & white pictures that are peppered throughout this book were also new to me.One of the chapters is entitled ""A Brief History of Time.""  It tells us of the book that catapulted Hawking to fame.  I was disappointed that Hawking did not even mention the late Dr. Carl Sagan who wrote an excellent introduction to this book.Finally, there are two chapters tacked on to the end of this book that deal with time travel and imaginary time respectively.  They detail the science behind these topics.

I hope my story will inspire girls to raise their voices and embrace the power within themselves.""The above comes from this tell-all  book by Malala Yousafzai (with Christina Lamb).  Malala came to public attention at the age of eleven by writing for the BBC about life under the Taliban.  She often spoke about her family's fight for girl's education in her community.In Oct 2012 (at age 15), she was targeted by the Taliban and shot in the head as she was returning from school on a bus.  She survived and continues her campaign for education.In recognition of her courage and advocacy, Malala has received numerous awards.  She is the youngest person ever nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.(Cristina Lamb is one of the world's leading foreign correspondents who has reported on Pakistan and Afghanistan since 1987.  She has authored five books and has won many awards for her work.)This book is an autobiography of Malala's life up to the point that she was shot and slightly after.  The epilogue gives us an indication of her and her family's new life in Birmingham, England as of Aug 2013.In the first half of this book, she writes about what she knows, her family and her country, Pakistan--its culture, religion, politics, customs, etc.  She goes into detail about the history and recent history of her country.Some sections of this first half are gruesome.  We're told about murders, suicide bombings, floggings, beheadings, etc.  Some readers may be put off by this.  I know I was initially.  But I realized that this was an account of what was going on here as seen through a teenager's eyes.  Thus, I came to appeciate what was written.  My only complaint is that there was, perhaps, too much detail given and this made the book difficult for me to read.Malala also talks extensively about her family, especially her father.  This is only natural.  But again, I felt too much information was given and the book seemed to drag during these sections.This book seemed to be easier to read in its second half (or perhaps, I had just become desensitized).Malala gives an excellent account of what happened to her during and after the shooting.  The only thing I couldn't understand is how she could recall all of this if her memory was not intact and she was close to unconciousness.Throughout both halves, she mentions the right to education.Two sets of colour, glossy photos are included.  The first set is composed of almost twenty photos while the second set consists of almost fifteen photos.  I found all of them interesting.There is also a glossary in this book.  It consists of mainly translations of foreign words and foreign terms found in the main narrative.  I found this tremendously helpful but I became frustrated when I could not find a foreign word or foreign term that was not listed.There is also a map of Pakistan and surrounding areas (Afganistan, Iran, etc) at the very beginning of this book.  I found this invaluable for following the action of the main narrative.Finally, I think this book is of sufficient length that it warranted, at least, a brief index.In conclusion, for a sixteen-year-old teenager, this is an exceptional autobiography with an important message.  I leave you with Malala's final words:""Peace in every home, every street, every village, every county--this is my dream.  Education for every boy and every girl in the world.

"For me, these earphones took a little getting used used to --- but once I did they became my favorites.  As others have pointed out they go on slightly differently, hooking around each ear rather than plugging right into each.  Once I got the hang of them, I found they stayed on better than others when I'm out walking and listening.  Sound quality was great and yet I'm able to hear other noises so that I don't get run over by a car.

"I'm an Epson fan.  Have owned multiple ones over the years.  This is one of the fastest and easiest for small home office use. Here's are my ups and considerations to help you decide if its for you:Ups/Why I like it:-Easy, easy set up- Great quality printing with the option to get it faster or better qualtiy (admittedly my default is low quality, fast and B&W to save those color cartridge ink for when I need it.- Holds plenty of paper - in a real paper tray (instead of hanging over the back like some computers)- When I do print photos in color - they are incredibly crisp and clean- Multiple connection/printing options: Print from anywhere to it, print from your mobile to it, print with it connected wirelessly - or if the internet goes out - print from it connected by USB.  I'm pretty sure I haven't yet found every way you can print on this thing - but, I feel safe it's covered.- All the features an AIO needs -scan, fax, copy etc. They are there. They are easy to use and work like they should.The one caveat I always have about Epsons applies here.  They tend to live by the ""sell them cheap - and then make lots of $$$ for their life via very pricey printing ink refills"".  To get around this, I recommend:- Keep your default on B&W draft/fast for everyday printing,- don't always believe it when it tells you you're running out of ink (often there's plenty to go - and it will print with whatever cartridges have ink if you ask it to),- do a print test of a couple of a few pages before printing out a whole large document or multiple copies of larger documents, and always buy the cartridges with XL in them (T252XL not T252) - for about $10 more they will give you more than 3x the paper. (e.g. T252 = 300 pages, T252XL =1100pages). XL cartridges tend to run about $30 each.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FMJJ0LVV34P3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXLGF06#wasThisHelpful","R1FMJJ0LVV34P3","A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The right printer selection is always about how you use it - for what this one does, overall, I think its great, but there's a couple of features I wish it had.  Here's my ups and downs to help decide if its for you:Ups/Good things:- Super easy set up- I really love being able to print from my phone and ipad wirelessly (heck, I'd never figured out how to do that with a wire)- Always nice when a printer lets you print to it from anywhere on the cloud - and this one does- Super, super fast - hadn't realized how used to waiting around for pages to print I'd gotten- Good quality print- cartridge lasts longer than most other printers (maybe the lack of needing the color cartridges too?) and are reasonably priced ($30-60 depending on if you get high yield or not)Downs/Things I'd change:- As others mention, needs a flat service for the paper tray or wpaper will get stuck (no wire shelves for this one)- Doesn't make copies - only prints - and occassionally I want to copy, which would require scanning a hard copy into my computer - except it also doesn't scan- And, though I mostly keep my other printer as a default on B&W - and this one beats it on all fronts as a B&W printer -I still have to keep my other one for the occassional time I want to print in color, copy or scan.Bottom Line:  If all you need/want to do is print B&W from your computer and all of your phones and other gadgets easily, quickly and with good quality affordably this is a great option.  But, you might want to consider your full intentions for your printer if you also need to scan or print in color even on occassion -- I'd almost call this a supplemental printer you'll use very frequently to your all-in-one","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8RZ2372HZXP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JCA4GW2#wasThisHelpful","R8RZ2372HZXP","A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in a high rise - so, for me, a cart is an essential. Here's my mostly ups and a few considerations to consider to help decide if this one is for you:Ups:- Covers up my groceries.  I don't really want everyone seeing what I buy, and this one even includes an attached flap that you use, if you choose, to cover the top.- Also prevents anything from dropping out.  Some steel carts have gaps that mean you can lose little items.- Very sturdy and washable canvas material and good quality overall.  Folds/unfolds easily.  Plastic wheels are sturdy and roll easily in multiple directions.- Also doesn't snag on anything.  Another issue with putting some steel ones in your luggage compartment is the snagging effect.  This one doesn't have any pieces that ""catch"".- Big, deep pocket.  This one has enough space to get all my groceries in - including cases of soda, big laundry detergent bottles, etc. And, the canvase has just enough give to pack things in well.Some considerations:- Shorter handles. Sometimes I feel like I'm walking with one of those walkers - that about its height. Would have been nice if they'd made them adjustable to raise them to a higher level.- Still, even folded up - it's a pretty good size.  Not that wide - but it's taller than an oven or dishwasher.All in all, I think it's a far better option than any of the steel ones - which may be a little bit more compact and have taller expandable handles but less functional space - and is good quality overall.  I use it regularly and I'd buy it again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J38HVET56J5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LPFUG8#wasThisHelpful","R2J38HVET56J5Z","A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hmmm...this is a good cross between a curling iron and hot rollers.  I'm a hot roller girl through and through though, and I still prefer my curlers to this.

"I hovered between a three and four star on this one, but ultimately because of what are for me key issues I'm going lower.  Think it is worth taking a serious look at comparably priced laptops - even other Dell Inspiron ones - to get the computer that hosts the features you'll most require.Here's what I like:I like Dell Inspiron's - I've had two before  of varying sizes.  They've proven their value to me over time. This one isn't an exception:- From a look, feel, quality of materials and resolution, plus long lasting battery life this one has it all - right down to the backlit/spill resistant keypad.- Add on lots of speed and lots of storage - and ultimately the computer itself is a winner.Here's what I don't like:This one is just not that user friendly:- Windows 8 isn't a favorite of mine ever - but is completely insufferable when put on a machine that doesn't have a touch screen. Note to Dell: Windows 8 is designed for touch.  Please stop torturing people by putting it on machines it is clearly not intended for. Note to potential buyer: Make sure you check out the touchpad version of this computer - costs sometimes are roughly the same.- The lack of a DVD drive is a definite issue.  One day it will probably very well be true that this won't be needed.  But, there are still many of us at all ages that still at least occassionally need it - to load software, to upload music, or in my case - to play my favorite, un-uploadable foreign language learning programme.Bottom Line: A good computer with a couple of features issues. Would definitely compare with ones that have touch screen and disc drives.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VQ0I3SMIYVUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K4PAP10#wasThisHelpful","R2VQ0I3SMIYVUL","A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like the look of this and it goes with my Tuscan-ish restroom.  It's seems decent quality... but, it's design is poor - at least for me. It needs to have been made slighly longer or at least with more height for each of the shelves.  If I put my shampoo or even my shorter soap bottles on the top shelf - they rise higher than the shower spigot.

"I debated between a three and a four for these and am leaning upward... because it all depends what type of hair you have and what you are looking for.  As someone that feels I've owned every set of hot rollers available at some time or another - this one offered some unique twists.  So, here from someone that has very fine but lots of hair is my take on the ups and downs:Ups:- Warms from the inside and out- for a great silky curl that lasts and I haven't seen done as well with other rollers (I had another set similar to these that you had to keep putting a few clips on a warming bar as you used them - that drove me crazy- this design is better)- Speed baby! These things heat up fast and well (my favorite set is still a travel set that heats up in five minutes)- Plenty of rollers for every head. (Unlike my travel set, I can use these in one round). Plus, they've eliminated those few itsy-bitsy rollers I never use in place of just medium and large.Potential Downs:- Size! Professional level in their description apparently means you should have a large professional sized counter space to put them on (definitely keeping the travel set for any road trips)- Practice required. As others have pointed out - these things get hot! And you can burn yourself if not careful.  Easy enough to get the hang of with practice... but, be careful early on.  I didn't get any burns.- Not quite as good for fine, medium hair.  While the curl is great and sleek, I have a bias against these types of clips over the old pin like ones because it's difficult to do certain parts of my hair at the top without getting a kink from the clip.  These actually do hold my hair in so I'm not chasing rollers around the bathroom floor and aren't as bad as others in ""clip kinkiness"".  But, I have to do some more practicing to get it right.Bottom Line: I think these are great curlers that give fast, outstanding, lasting curl quality - if you have the space and lots of longer or thicker hair, or if you have fine hair and have figured out how to use these types of clips without getting 'clip kinks""","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BZXQOQI6OL6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BB8ZIQQ#wasThisHelpful","R3BZXQOQI6OL6M","A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is no doubt, this is one smart ""Cookie"" of a toy.  My six-year old princess fell in love with her immediately - and it hasn't been a short-term affair.  She constantly comments on how soft her coat is and with the help of 4-C batteries acts like a perfect little happy puppy lady, including chewing her bone.I agree with another reviewer that about the 5-8 range is where this gift lies, and for the most part it will make a wonderful gift. There's only one caveat, if you or the person you are giving the gift to already has a real dog - this may not be your best choice of gift.  The bone Cookie chews is easily confusing to a real dog as their squeaky toy. In fact, the young mixed mutt real puppy exposed to Cookie was completely bewildered by her, she thought it was supposed to be her toy and playmate.BOTTOM LINE: A great, highly-entertaining and engaging gift for a six-year old princess (this really is designed all the way as a girls toy - right down to the pink and purple accessories) that is probably best for those that do not already have a dog in the house.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWW10PG6GKTSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004P958XQ#wasThisHelpful","RWW10PG6GKTSF","A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A purple airplane, a pretty little girl, and a puppy with lots of accessories made this a hit with my six-year old princess.  It's a good size and she has spent a lot of time imagining Blythe and her pet friend are taking exotic journeys.  Sometimes she has Blythe be the pilot and sometimes she's the passenger, either way this is a toy that has delivered a lot of good, simple imaginative play.The plane opens up in much the same way as a doll house and provides that type of experience, but with a more exciting travel theme.  Since the princess's father is a pilot this may have had a bit more appeal than to some.  But, overall I think if you have a 4-7 year old that has ever been on a plane or dreamed of traveling to far off places - this is a great, good quality gift.  It'd also make a great birthday gift if you're looking for one for a girl this age.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R197D5KZV96BVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004P90PIO#wasThisHelpful","R197D5KZV96BVN","A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As other reviewers point out this is not your typical thriller.  It's more of a blend of a mystery-who-dunnit thriller with the tale of a woman coming to terms with the loss of her sister and discovering her inner strength.  Here was why I liked it - and where I think it might not appeal to some based on their tastes.Short Summary: Older sister is unconvinced that her sister's death was a suicide and goes on a hunt to find the killer. She writes an open letter to her sister to tell her of the pursuit.1. For me, this was a page turner - but, not in that normal thriller way.I read this in one day.  I was captured by Beatrice's pursuit of tracking down clues to discover who and why her sister died equally as much as by her blossoming understanding of her sister and the dynamics of her family. Most thrillers are more short chapters of action and suspense.  This one not so much.  So, if that's what you truly enjoy - you're going to like this one less.2. It's well-written with an equal focus on character development and family dynamics.This book shines beyond a thriller by bringing to life the complex dynamics of relationships with her mother, siblings, father and fiancee as she grows to better understand herself through her sister's death. If you're not into well-written more introspective looks at familial relationships - or stories of women finding themselves bore you - this probably won't be your cup of tea - even if it's, in my opinion very well written.3. You don't have to have a sister to enjoy it - but there's no doubt you'll enjoy it more if you are a woman.I don't have a sister, and yet could relate to the dynamics of the sister relationship. And, even more so within all of Beatrices relationships there is something I think most women, but not men, might relate to within themselves. To me, this is the type of book that will appeal to people who also liked Before I Go to Sleep: A Novel, Still Missing or other more psychologically relation-based thrillers versus your typcial action or who-dunnit thrillers.4.Don't read it because everyone says it has a twist.Yes, it does twist in a surprising way that I found unique and relevant.  But, more importantly for me is that it really did seem a great way to bring the entire big theme of the book together. That was realy it's true beauty to me.BOTTOM LINE: A well-written, intriguing book that kept me turning the pages through its combined tale of a who-dunnit mystery with the story of a woman finding her inner self and coming to terms with the relationships in her life. But, you're not going to like it as much if you're expecting twisting suspenseful and action-filled turns on every page - it's just not that type of thriller.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GSALGTXLA6BJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307716511#wasThisHelpful","R3GSALGTXLA6BJ","A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a sucker for any ab machine infomercial. So, I have the full gamut of products. Here's my rating and comparison on this one vs. what they promise and vs. the other available products to help you decide if it's for you.1. Quality - 5.0 starsThis is a very-well constructed, sturdy piece of exercise equipment - particularly for the price. Really capable of dealing with even taller or wider people.2. Ease of Assembly/Space Needed/Storage 3.0 StarsAssembly is not too hard (I was able to do it and I'm technically challenged), but it's not as easy as many of the infomercial machines which come totally together.  I find the space needed for this one and the storage more challenging.  While out - it takes up about 6-1/2 feet by 2-1/2 feet of clear space to use - or almost as much as a couch.  At the same time, it's not really attractive enough to be putting out as a general lounger. Storing it, isn't as easy as the infomercial makes it appear.  It's big and bulky even folded up. And, all of those quality materials mean it's heavy and more challenging both to fold and find a place to hide away.3. Ease of exercises - 5.0 StarsThis is as easy to use as promise.  It provides great back support - if you are one of those whom typical crunches and other machines sometimes hurt your back.4. Effectiveness of exercises - 4.0 StarsThis really does allow you to get in those long crunches that stretch your muscles and allows you to hit those hard to hit lower abs.  There's exercise routines included on the CD - or you can just sit in it watching your favorite TV show and do your favorite exercises from it.  The area that it's not as effective on are those side ab muscles.  For that, I still stand by my all time most favorite infomercial product AB Dolly Plus.  But, this one is more comfy than that one and you'll definitely feel and see it working if you use repeatedly.5. Desire to use repeatedly - 4.0 StarsFor me, these machines always come down to ""Do I want to use it often and does it work?""  The answer on the first part of that question for me is ""it depends"".  When I have it out and sacrifice the space and look of the room - I use it regularly.  But, it's such a pain to get out and then put away - when I don't want it hogging up space - it can stay tucked away for a long time.  But, it does work.BOTTOM LINE: Good quality, fine ab machine that works.  But, make sure you really have the space needed to allow you to leave it out somewhere to really encourage you to use it regularly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MUJF1B8G54XY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A4XRAG#wasThisHelpful","R3MUJF1B8G54XY","A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow! Don't those late night infomercials make this one look great?  There's a lot of problems in this one both versus what they say and versus other Ab machines out there (and I swear - I pretty much have them all, I'm a sucker for a good infomercial).So, here's the rankings vs. what they promise:- A back massage and neck support: 0 starsThose rollers sure look like they'd give a massage - but, in fact, they are not comfortable and there is definitely no massaging going on. I'd say this is easier on the back than crunches - but not by much. Since the back is one size fits all - whether you get neck support is going to vary by your neck and torso length.  Tall people be particularly wary. That said, you are not on it that long. It's really a five minute work out.- Quality: 1-starReally flimsiy made for an exercise machine.  Particularly cheap handles and attachments.  Doesn't click the way they say it will in the ads. If you are a larger/wider person this thing may not stand up to your weight, and the small seat is definitely going to bother you.  It's made cheaply all the way around - or there is poor quality control going on.- Ability for anyone to use it - 4.0 StarsComes with a DVD that has routines for every level from beginner to advanced, and three different level tension cords that attach the seat to the back that make the exercises harder or easier. There's also they typical meal planner and recipe book that comes w/ all of these because any promises of losing inches ARE ALWAYS based upon you BOTH following the plan and using the machine.- Value of exercies for abs - 3.0-4.0 starsIf you just sit on this thing and rock up and down like a rocking chair, as the ads imply, it won't hurt - but isn't going to do that much good (and there's far better machines out there for that like the Ab Lounge Sport that give you better range more comfortably. However, those are harder to work the obliques - and the twister motion on this works.  But, the way this does the most is by following the routine that's appropriate for you on the DVD.-Versus other ab products 1-starI liked the idea of this because I thought it combined the benefits and ease of the Ab Lounge (without being so big and bulky) and my favorite all time informercial ab machine, the AB Dolly Plus (without requiring the hard floor space to use) into one.  But, the poor design and flimsy construction, plus the lack of comfort using it just don't stand up.BOTTOM LINE:  There are better all around and better made ab products out there that will do the job as effectively, if not more so.  This one just doesn't deliver on the promises of the ads and for the cost it's quality is below par. It's just not one I'd want to use everyday. Recommend looking at other options.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R83VX2NM3256B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00507S5V4#wasThisHelpful","R83VX2NM3256B","A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a solid, engaging thriller that had some ups and downs to me.  Here they are to help you decide if its for you:SHORT SUMMARY: Unemployed woman gets dream job in art gallery - only to find herself in the midst of a set up for murder.  Separately, another girl goes missing.  Who is trying to set her up? Can she extract herself from this mess? How did the girl go missing? Where has she disappeared to?1) A well-plotted who-dunnit with an intriguing conceptFrom the first page, the writer had me intrigued with Alice and set up a complex whodunnit plot. If you like following clues and and trying to figure out who and why is behind it all - this is well plotted for that, with lots of twists and turns as clues are revealed.  Having said that, while it all ties together well in the end with some surprising revelations - I'm not sure enough clues were laid down really for having anyone piece it together before the end.2) There's a side story about a missing girl that seemed out of place.Though the author weaves the two tales tangentially together - it has a totally disconnected feel to it.  If it's supposed to be a red herring, for me, it didn't really work. Partly because that line of the story gets short thrift at the end, and feels forced.3) I found myself invested in the answer to the plot, but not the charactersI just didn't find I cared about these characters.  Admittedly, there are a lot of them - and that side-story doesn't help - so much of the character development gets short thrift. Initially I was invested in Alice plight, but as the story progresses even she seems to have only surface emotions and reactions. I just wish I had cared and understood the key players characters and releationships more - it would have made the book and the resolution that much more enjoyable to me.BOTTOM LINE: 3.5 Stars for a solid, engaging whodunnit.  While it's not a book ""I couldn't put down"" it is one I wanted to continue reading to see where it lead.  So, it makes it good as a summer pool-side or plane ride read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O2KSZPAS7NXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061999180#wasThisHelpful","R1O2KSZPAS7NXH","A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For me, this was a solid, but not-as-suspenseful-as-I'd-hoped of a psychological thriller. Here were the ups and downs I found to help you decide if it's for you.Short Summary: Adopted woman decides to find her biological parents only to discover her father is a serial rapist-murderer who is still on the loose.  Through her search the serial killer discovers he has a child - and now he's determined to connect to her.  She turns to the police and works with them to help catch him.  Will they be able to catch him before he kills again? What does it mean to her and her child that they share a crazy pyschopath's genes? Will he hurt her or those she loves before he can be caught?-  Stevens resurrects her original unique approach from Still Missing, of telling the story through a series of sessions by the protagonist with a psychiatrist (who never speaks). While still original, it doesn't work as well in this book as it did in the former. For me, in this one, the sessions weren't believable and acted as a a distraction.- Stevens is a good writer and the concept is unique, but as executed it didn't provide the page-turning suspense needed to make this book as great as her first.I love a unique concept and do this one as well.  Unfortunately,  While there's a psychological mystery built into it - it's really not apparent until the end. And so, most of the book has the main character annoyingly continually vacillating on whether she should or should not help her bring her serial murder father down - based upon some rather unbelievable pressures and opinions by her fiance, adopted father, police and her family. Every chapter in the middle was just another bout of her doing the ""should I talk to him or see him, shouldn't I talk to or see him"" game. It became tedious and made putting the book down pretty easy.- At the same time, there was enough that was engaging about it to make me want to finish it - and it's really a couple of surprising twists at the end that actually turned this into a real psychological thriler for me.Bottom Line: While a decent, solid psychological thriller in large parts due to a couple of twists at the end -it didn't live up to my expectations based upon the authors first book, ""Still Missing"", which I loved.  If you are a first time Stevens reader - go for that one instead, and for more page-turning psychological suspense I'd have to say I recommend Before I Go to Sleep: A Novel or Room: A Novel before and over this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX955B1IT3F55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312595689#wasThisHelpful","RX955B1IT3F55","A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Here's what I liked and the minor downsides I found w/ this detergent to help you decide if it's for you.1. It did exactly what it promised - the white were whiter and the colors were brighter (and I have a bad habit of throwing them all in together - and this still worked wonders).2. It did a great job of lifting out tough stains. Though I didn't pretreat any of them - they were all gone.3. ""Can that little of detergent really clean a whole wash?"" That was my thought when I followed the directions and put in the amount. ""Wow! that's pretty efficient"" was my thought after the clothes were cleaned.4. Nice, clean fresh smell.Still, it hasn't changed my preference towards liquid detergents. They've just never come up with a good way to package these powder ones. The box (on all of them, including this one) is hard to open and doesn't reseal, which isn't good if you store on a higher shelf.I also am a fan of the alternative Tide versions that have the proprietary Actilift in them. While this took out some tough stains - Actilift I've seen lift some amazing levels of stains easily.Tide runs more than other brands typically. But, having tested them - I firmly believe they have better quality than the others. They also, unlike many of the others, don't make private label version of their soap that grocers can sell - so the only way to get the quality is to pay for it.Bottom Line: Though my preference runs towards liquid and the Tide Actilift versions this is an efficient, high-powered powdered detergent that delivers whiter, brighter, cleaner clothes and gets stains out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB94WMEXDBUYD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049MEI5S#wasThisHelpful","RB94WMEXDBUYD","A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W7R5ZAGVOSVQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These quart-size Hefty Slider Storage Bags are ideal for everyday use. For things like packing sandwiches or snacks for lunches, storing some leftovers in the fridge for a few days, or organizing odds and ends, they're great. Unlike some reviewers, I've had no problems whatsoever with the sliders creating and keeping a tight seal. In fact, I find the sliders much easier to use than the standard seals used on Ziploc bags. (Boy, I sure have trouble getting *those* to close sometimes!) My only complaint? I wish the bags were just a little bit thicker. I realize these are standard bags and not freezer bags (which are 35% thicker), but they still seem a little too thin to me. That said, they still work well and are a good value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWVPFZJWNYPSZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NMVYPEG#wasThisHelpful","RWVPFZJWNYPSZ","A2NX6MFZP8TM6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6MFZP8TM6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a brutally honest memoir about love and mental illness. Like some other reviewers, I find it very hard to believe that it took so long for Sheila Hamilton to recognize her husband's illness; but who am I to judge? Without being in the same exact situation, we can't say for sure if we would have realized what was going on any sooner. The important thing about this book is that it brings mental illness into the open, and shows the world the devastating effects it can have on individuals, spouses, and families. It also includes resources that can educate people about mental illness, which may lead some people to getting the help they so desperately need. That's a wonderful thing.Toward the end of the book, Sheila Hamilton writes:""Grief is like an unwelcome stranger, an abductor who comes just at the moment you least expect and puts a black sack over your head, whisking you away to a dark, unknown place. Just when I thought I could cope with the idea of David's absence, I would wake up confused and traumatized all over again.""Sheila Hamilton's soul-baring honesty makes this book a winner. As Bren Brown says, ""When we push down hurt or pretend that struggle doesnt exist, the hurt and struggle own us."" That's why transparency is always a good idea. I commend Hamilton for telling her story and hope that she can eventually break free from her grief.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34R1B1XN4N00E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1580055842#wasThisHelpful","R34R1B1XN4N00E","A2NX6MFZP8TM6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6MFZP8TM6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a terrific space heater that will keep any standard size room toasty warm. Unlike a lot of heaters, this Vornado VH10 has a sleek and appealing design. And although it's made of plastic, the build quality is very good. Controls are on top of the unit and very simple: on/off, hi/low, and a rotating dial to adjust temperature. The one thing that really surprised me about this heater is how crazy quiet it is. I've used a lot of different space heaters over the years, and this is by far the quietest of them all. It would be perfect for a bedroom or baby's room. I also like the cord wrap that's integrated into the bottom of the unit. A little thing, for sure. But it's really convenient. The handle that's built in to the top also makes it easy to carry from room to room if you need to. Add in a nice 5-year warranty, and this heater is truly top-notch. The only thing I don't like about the VH10? The price. At around $80.00, it seems a little overpriced, which is why I only gave it a 4-star rating. (If I could've rated it 4.5 stars, I would have.) But maybe this is an instance of ""you get what you pay for."" Trust me: There are a lot of bad heaters out there at budget prices. This Vornado is pretty darn nice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U93P4I3I2XWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVIPVHU#wasThisHelpful","R1U93P4I3I2XWN","A2NX6MFZP8TM6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6MFZP8TM6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used plenty of space heaters over the years and I have to say: This Dr. Heater DR-838 Family Ceramic Heater is the worst. Yes, the heater does provide decent heat. So there is that. But the build quality of this heater is absolutely awful. As at least one other reviewer pointed out, the metal used for this heater is pretty flimsy. When you put the heater down on a hard surface, it sounds like you're setting down an empty tin can. The front grill can be bent simply by pushing on it with your fingers. I can only imagine what would happen to it if it was accidentally kicked by someone wearing a shoe. And the biggest joke of all? The foam electrostatic filter on the back of the unit. It's so thin, I thought it was a piece of scrap foam that was used as packing material. (How thin is it? Look at the photo I've included and you'll get an idea.) It's supposed to slide into two grooves, but it's so thin and flimsy that they had to stick two pieces of tape on the back to help hold it in place. The instructions for the heater say that you should clean the filter once a month by ""vacuuming filter clean."" Are you kidding me?!? If you tried vacuuming the filter, it would end up getting sucked into the vacuum cleaner in an instant. I have no doubt that this filter will start to rip and tear in no time at all. My favorite thing about this heater is the handle on the top. It makes it easy to carry. Other than that, this heater seems like something you'd find on the clearance table at a discount store. Believe me, there are way better options out there. (For example, the Lasko 754200 Ceramic Heater with Adjustable Thermostat is fabulous. I bought two of them seven years ago and they are still going strong. I've never had a problem with them.)","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36G4YZWXAD40U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DZ2V6C#wasThisHelpful","R36G4YZWXAD40U","A2NX6MFZP8TM6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6MFZP8TM6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used Macs for the last 15 years or so, but I have to admit that Microsoft's suite of productivity software has always been better than anything Apple has offered. I got Microsoft Office Home & Student 2016 for Mac to replace the Microsoft Office 2008 that I've been running on my MacBook Pros for quite some time. (What can I say? It did what I needed it to do!)Of the four programs included with this version of Office, I will only use two of them--Word and Excel--with any regularity. PowerPoint is nice to have, I suppose, but I rarely use it. And I've been using Evernote for a few years now, so I won't be using OneNote at all. That said, Word and Excel are worth the investment all by themselves.Downloading the software was simple, although it did take quite a while--a little over an hour using my 70 Mbps Internet connection--and installation was a breeze. I am not a Microsoft Office power user, so I can't speak to the differences between this version of Office and the older version I was using, other than the 2016 version has a much cleaner look. It also seems to be faster, which is definitely a good thing.Microsoft's Office has been the standard office software for several years now, and I don't know of anything out there that's a threat to stealing that title away from Microsoft anytime soon. So if you own a Mac and do word processing, spreadsheets, or slide shows, you should probably own this software. Whether or not you get the Home & Student edition--which is only good for use on a single Mac--depends on your particular situation. Your other options are Microsoft Office Home and Business 2016 for Mac | Mac Key Card (which adds Outlook to the mix); or Microsoft Office 365 Home 1 Year | 5 PC or 5 Mac Key Card (which adds Outlook, online storage, and allows use on 5 Macs and 5 tablets, but is an annual subscription instead of a one-time payment).One thing to be aware of: You have to have OSX 10.10 or above on your machine to use this version of office. So that means Yosemite or El Capitan. If you are still running Mavericks--or anything earlier--you will have to upgrade before you can use this software.Lastly, I don't quite understand why the key card for this software has to be mailed to you. Other than the actual key card with the Product Key number on it, all you're getting is a little cardboard box and a small piece of cardboard with five short steps on how to set up the software (a grand total of about 50 words). Isn't this something that could be emailed to purchasers? Why waste the materials and resources to mail it? If anyone knows the answer to that question, please let me know.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBFLW5YNQQ3SJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0148BYIPY#wasThisHelpful","RBFLW5YNQQ3SJ","A2NX6MFZP8TM6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6MFZP8TM6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I already own an Olympus VN-702PC Voice Recorder, but decided to upgrade and give this Olympus WS-853 a shot. Boy, am I glad I did! I have to say, the WS-853 is better than my older model in a lot of ways--better sound, more storage, more features--but the one feature I like the best is the direct USB connection. After I record interviews, I frequently upload them to my Mac. With my older Olympus recorder, I was constantly fumbling with the (very short) USB cable needed to upload files to my computer. What a pain! Now all I have to do is pop out the built-in USB connector and I'm ready to roll. A simple thing, yes, but what a relief! (By the way, the recorder is compatible with both Macs and Windows computers.)The WS-853 does a great job of recording voices in pretty much all settings. The stereo microphone system is terrific, as is the automatic recording level adjustment option. Playback sound of the unit is excellent, especially for a device this small. The storage capacity--8 GB of memory that will record 2,080 hours--is surely more than enough for most people's needs. And if it's not, you can even add a MicroSD card for even more capacity. In addition, the two AAA rechargeable batteries (included) are very convenient--especially since they can be charged via USB.There are several functions on the WS-853 that a lot of people might not need to use, but don't fret. Olympus has outdone themselves by providing a ""Simple Mode"" for this recorder. Selecting this mode offers a ""no-frills"" option that displays only basic information and limits the available functions to the most commonly used. The display font is also larger in ""Simple Mode,"" which is great for old people like me. ;)All in all this is an incredible little device. Yes, there are more expensive digital voice recorders out there that have more features. But I have to believe that the Olympus WS-853 is the perfect choice for the vast majority of people shopping for a compact, full-featured, quality voice recorder. I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R292Q6XWMDZ9YS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014658DHQ#wasThisHelpful","R292Q6XWMDZ9YS","A2NX6MFZP8TM6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6MFZP8TM6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In the interest of full disclosure, let me state up front that I'm a Mac guy. I've been using strictly Apple computers and devices for the last several years, with the exception of a couple of Windows laptops I was issued by my employer. Even so, I have found this ASUS Transformer Book Flip TP200SA-DH04T 11.6"" laptop to be a very handy machine.The size of this device is very handy. It's just about the same thickness as my 13"" MacBook Pro and is very light. This makes it very portable. It was also very easy to set up. From the moment the unit was first turned on, I was guided through the setup process on-screen and everything went very smoothly. To my surprise, I even found Windows 10 to be very manageable. In the past, that hasn't always been the case with me and Windows.The speed of this Transformer isn't the greatest, but it's still decent. I noticed the biggest slow-downs when browsing the Web and watching videos. I'm not sure if this is a hardware issue or if it might have something to do with the Microsoft Edge browser. (I've also tried Google's Chrome browser, but can't really say that it made things any faster.) The storage space on this machine is pretty limited, so I'm thinking it would only suffice as a secondary device for most people. Even though the advertised storage capacity on the SSHD is 64 GB, I checked this morning and Windows tells me that there is only 29.9 GB of free space left. That's not very much, and the only thing I've downloaded or saved to the device is Google Chrome. That said, ASUS does provide 500 GB of Web storage space, which appears to be entirely free. So if you don't mind storing stuff in the Cloud, maybe you'll be alright.My biggest complaint about this ""laplet"" is the display. The size is perfectly fine, but the actual display seems like it could be a little sharper. I'm used to the Retina display on my Apple laptop, so maybe I'm just a little spoiled. But after a few hours of using this ASUS, I find that my eyes are a bit more fatigued than usual. Maybe it's something I'll get used to, though.The versatility of this laptop/tablet is really nice. I really like being able to use it as a normal laptop, and the keyboard has a nice layout and feel to it. The touchpad works well, too. It's also terrific to be able to rotate the display around and turn this computer into a tablet. The touchscreen works very well, and using the tablet is very reminiscent of using an iPad. The ability to use the Transformer as a notebook OR tablet, or in ""stand mode"" or ""tent mode"" is certainly a plus. (That said, I have yet to figure out how to make the display have the proper orientation while in tent mode. Every time I try tent mode, the display is upside down. I tried searching ASUS's support site for a solution, but apparently it's too early for there to be any support online for this unit. So I'm not sure if this problem with the display is a hardware or software problem. But hopefully it will be remedied sooner rather than later.)The ports and slots on this machine are also nice. On the right side you have a USB 2.0 port and a headphone/headset/microphone jack. On the left side you'll find the power input port, volume button, power button, a MicroSD card slot, a micro HDMI port, a USB 3.0 port, and a USB Type-C port. There is no optical drive, but that's certainly not unusual these days. (Even my MacBook Pro doesn't have one.) I've had no problems at all with any of the ports or slots, although I will say that I'm not a fan of how the power cord connects to the unit. The end of the power cord is small, almost like a mini USB cord. Getting it into the power input port can be a little tricky, and once it's in there, it's in there tight. I've already had a couple of incidents where I almost pulled the Transformer off of my desk because I got a little caught up in the power cord while the device was charging. (A connection along the lines of Apple's MagSafe connector would be so much nicer.)All in all, this ASUS laptop/tablet is a pretty nice device. Is it good enough to be your primary computer? Probably not. But it's certainly more than good enough to be a very formidable secondary machine. I think it will be especially good for traveling, or for other times when I don't need to have my primary laptop with me. For the price, I don't think you can go wrong.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U8JDWJ1OOJZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014854RBK#wasThisHelpful","R3U8JDWJ1OOJZ7","A2NX6MFZP8TM6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6MFZP8TM6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I know a lot of people here have complained about the top being loose, but I haven't experienced that. The top to my pitcher fits nice and snug, and I've never even seen it move when I've poured water, let alone come off. Likewise, I've had no problems with the filter not staying seated, either. Perhaps those issues were present in earlier runs of this pitcher, and maybe Brita addressed them. For me, this pitcher is top-notch.

"I'm a big fan of all kinds of jerky, and even love quite a few Jack Link's products. But I have to say that these Flamin' Buffalo Chicken Tender Bites are terrible.

"The Bose Wave Music System IV is the latest version of a product that has been incredibly successful for Bose. And there's no doubt as to why it's been so successful: the Bose Wave packs a lot of punch for something with a relatively small footprint, which makes it perfect for use in a bedroom, standard size living room, or anywhere you want to listen to great sounding music without sacrificing a large amount of space.The familiar design of the Wave has been tweaked nicely, and the concept--terrific sound made simple--remains the same. The super-slim remote is your control center for the Wave, so be careful not to lose or misplace it. If you do, you won't be able to operate the system very well (although you can turn the Wave on/off by touching the top front edge of the unit). All of the functions work very well, and operation is pretty intuitive. I was especially surprised at how nicely the radio--both FM and AM--performed. Getting stations to come in loud and clear was no trouble whatsoever.CDs may be on their way out, but if you're like me you still have a large collection of them. So it's nice to have a quality sound producer to listen to them on. (The slot-loading player works flawlessly.) Of course, it would've been great if this unit had wifi or Bluetooth capability, but those features are indeed available on a pricier version (Bose Wave SoundTouch music system IV- Espresso Black).My one minor complaint with this unit is something that has annoyed me with other Bose products in the past: There is no way to adjust the bass, treble, or even the overall tone of the sound the Wave produces. I understand that Bose prides themselves on knowing a lot about sound, but I think the absence of any kind of tone adjustment is just plain wrong. I appreciate quality sound as much as the next guy, but I don't think that Bose's idea of the best sound is necessarily what *I* want to hear. If I want to listen to my Tom Petty with a little more treble, or my Beatles with a little more bass, I think I should be able to do so. But I can't do that with this system. And that bothers me.Overall, the Wave IV is a very nice little system that will more than satisfy the ears of most people. I'm using it in my bedroom and it does a yeoman's job. The design is sleek, the footprint is small, and the sound is beautiful. It may be a bit pricy, but I think it's worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OXINDCZCKBJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IH6MBO#wasThisHelpful","R2OXINDCZCKBJP","A2NX6MFZP8TM6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6MFZP8TM6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I eat a lot of beef jerky, and Jack Link's is definitely one of the better quality mass market brands in the space. The original flavor is very tasty, with a nice, smoky taste and just a touch of soy sauce. The texture is great, too. It's not too soft or too tough, but just right.

"I went many years without drinking as much water as I should, but I corrected that behavior about five years ago after a bout of diverticulitis. Unfortunately, my new practice of drinking at least 100 ounces of water each and every day means that sometimes I get sick of drinking plain old water. So last year I started looking for a way to enhance the flavor of my water a bit.Enter Mio, which I decided to try when I saw it on my grocery store shelf one day. There were several flavors to choose from, and the idea of making my water taste better made Mio an easy sell. I started using it once or twice a day and continued to do so for about six months. One thing I didn't do, though, was read the label to see what the ingredients were.Fast forward to a few weeks ago. For at least a month or two prior to then, I had been having regular severe episodes of dry mouth and very badly chapped lips. I had no idea what was causing it and started to analyze what I was eating and drinking very closely. So one day I decided to look at the list of ingredients on the multiple bottles of Mio in my cabinet. To my surprise, there was one ingredient that just sounded like trouble: Propylene glycol.After water, the next most prevalent ingredient in Mio is ""propylene glycol."" According to Mio's website, propylene glycol ""is a common additive found in many products"" and ""is considered by the FDA to be 'generally recognized as safe' for use in foods."" While that may be true, after doing some more research online I discovered that propylene glycol is a solvent used in many pharmaceuticals, including oral, injectable, and topical formulations. It is also used in automatic brake and hydraulic fluid and industrial antifreeze. It's also found in the stuff they use to de-ice aircraft with. The Material Safety Data Sheet for propylene glycol warns users to avoid skin contact with propylene glycol as this strong skin irritant can cause liver abnormalities and kidney damage.And they want me to put this stuff in my water???But here's the kicker: One website told me ""since propylene glycol is considered a humectant (it collects moisture), your throat can become dry after use and potentially sore."" Dry throat means dry mouth, and dry mouth means chapped lips. At this point, I was pretty sure I had found the cause of my chapped lips mystery, so I tossed out all the Mio I had on hand. And guess what? In a matter of days, my lips felt normal again. The chronic dryness and pain that I had endured for far too long was gone. (Interesting fact: Mio products sold in Canada do not contain propylene glycol.)If you want an flavor enhancer for your water, steer clear of Mio and give Stur a try. It doesn't cost any more, and it comes with a 100% satisfaction guarantee. You really have nothing to lose, except for a somewhat suspicious chemical that is considered ""generally safe"" by the Food and Drug Administration. I made the switch to Stur and couldn't be happier...or healthier.

It is also used in automatic brake and hydraulic fluid and industrial antifreeze. It's also found in the stuff they use to de-ice aircraft with. The Material Safety Data Sheet for propylene glycol warns users to avoid skin contact with propylene glycol as this strong skin irritant can cause liver abnormalities and kidney damage.And they want me to put this stuff in my water???But here's the kicker: One website told me ""since propylene glycol is considered a humectant (it collects moisture), your throat can become dry after use and potentially sore."" Dry throat means dry mouth, and dry mouth means chapped lips. At this point, I was pretty sure I had found the cause of my chapped lips mystery, so I tossed out all the Mio I had on hand. And guess what? In a matter of days, my lips felt normal again. The chronic dryness and pain that I had endured for far too long was gone. (Interesting fact: Mio products sold in Canada do not contain propylene glycol.)A few days later, I came across Stur on the Amazon website. I was intrigued by the minimal ingredients in the product, and completely thrilled that it was all natural. So I decided to give it a shot. And boy, am I glad I did.After a couple of days with the Stur variety pack, I pretty much fell in love with all of the flavors. It's so nice to have something *natural* to add to my water when I want to mix things up a bit. And the best part? No sugar, no calories, all-natural ingredients, non-GMO, and gluten-free...and no propylene glycol!!!!!If you want an flavor enhancer for your water, steer clear of Mio and give Stur a try. It doesn't cost any more, and it comes with a 100% satisfaction guarantee. You really have nothing to lose, except for a somewhat suspicious chemical that is considered ""generally safe"" by the Food and Drug Administration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35IB0K3QZJGZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C1LXBFC#wasThisHelpful","R35IB0K3QZJGZV","A2NX6MFZP8TM6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6MFZP8TM6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hats off to T.J. English for doing some research, but if you're already familiar with the Whitey Bulger case there are no new revelations here. There have already been multiple books published on this subject--Whitey Bulger: America's Most Wanted Gangster and the Manhunt That Brought Him to Justice; Black Mass: Whitey Bulger, the FBI, and a Devil's Deal; and Whitey: The Life of America's Most Notorious Mob Boss, to name a few--along with a documentary film and the new motion picture ""Black Mass,"" which stars Johnny Depp. I was hoping to find something new and interesting in this book, but I was disappointed. I suppose if you're a newcomer to the Bulger case, this would be a decent read. But I got nothing out of it. To be totally honest, it seems like this book is an attempt by T.J.

"I think these AmazonBasics dry erase markers are just as good as the Expo brand, and they are priced lower than what a 12-pack of Expo brand chisel point markers would cost. That said, I was surprised to see--at the time I'm writing this review--that a 12-pack of Expo chisel point black markers (Expo Original Dry Erase Markers, Chisel Tip, 12-Pack, Black) can be purchased from a seller on Amazon for about four bucks less than these. And that includes Prime shipping. So, depending on what the price of the competitor's product is when you decide to purchase, these may or may not be a good deal.

"This grill brush is pretty darn good. The brush is nice and wide, and the configuration allows you to clean all the surfaces of the grates--on top, in between, and in the corners. I also appreciate the 18"" handle, which allows you to cover the entire surface of your grill without too much exposure to heat. Too many grill brushes these days are way too short. The brush is also sturdy. There's a little bit of give in the handle when you're pushing down during cleaning, but I think it should hold up fine. Plus, it has a lifetime guarantee against breakage. Still, my personal preference would be for the handle to be just a wee bit stiffer. But maybe I'm just nit picky.

"This is an aesthetically pleasing personal space heater that is very handy for use on top of or under a desk. I really like the design, which is a bit more contemporary than other space heaters I've had. It's also very simple to operate, with two round rocker switches on the back: one to turn it on and off, the other to choose between high heat (750 watts), low heat (375 watts), or fan only. It's also very lightweight and pretty quiet, and the automatic tip-over feature works well. I have to say, I really do like the fan only setting. Maybe that setting will allow this unit to be out all year long instead of getting shoved back into the box and put away for the warmer months. Lastly, this heater has a 3-year warranty, which is pretty darn good. I only have a couple of minor complaints. First of all, the fan speed for the high heat and low heat settings is the same. Not really a big deal, but because of that the only way to know which setting the heater is on is to look on the back and see which position the switch is in (I for low or II for high). I guess maybe I'm just used to heaters that have different fan speeds for low and high. Also, the heater doesn't come apart for cleaning. Again, not a deal-breaker, but I know that heaters like this accumulate dust and dirt on their blades over time. It would be nice to be able to take it apart to clean it on occasion. But again, not a deal-breaker. All in all, this is a terrific little heater that's great for a personal space!P.S. It's interesting to see how Apple continues to influence other company's packaging. On the inside flap of the box for this heater, it says, ""Designed, engineered and supported in Andover, Kansas.""

"I've tried a large number of grilling brushes in my four decades of grilling. Call me old fashioned, but the ones I keep coming back to are very basic.  But they just plain work. Every once in a while, though, I'll try something new, just to see if maybe someone's improved upon the simple designs I'm used to. This Grill Daddy Dirty Grill Killer is one of those brushes I thought I'd try.My first impression of this brush? It looks like something you'd see in a late night TV infomercial. But wait...there's more!I'm not sure who decided this brush was durable enough for cleaning a grill, but the first time I tried it on my Weber Genesis gas grill with stainless steel grates, the brush head bent at the point where the circular brush is connected to the square brush. But wait...there's more!To call this a ""steam-operated grill brush"" is very misleading. No, it's not steam-powered. And it can't even generate its own steam. The steam is created by water dripping out of the little water reservoir and coming into contact with the hot grill surface. Using this criteria, your kid's squirt gun is just as ""steam-operated"" as this Grill Daddy brush is. But wait...there's more!Speaking of squirt guns, do you remember how frustrating it was to fill up a squirt gun when you were a kid? Trying to get water from the faucet to go into that tiny little filler hole on the squirt gun? Well, if you've forgotten that experience, this grill brush will remind you of it the first time you try to put water in it. But wait...there's more!This thing is made in China and you can see and feel it right away. The plastic is cheap and the brush assembly is pretty flimsy. Add to this the fact that replacement brushes will cost you almost half of what you paid for this thing in the first place, and I think you get the picture.If you want a good grill brush at a reasonable price, try the Weber 6464 18-Inch Bamboo Grill Brush or the Weber 6494 12-Inch 3-Sided Grill Brush. Yes, they are very basic. But they work. And if you absolutely must have steam to help you clean your grill grates, then invest a couple of bucks in a spray bottle, fill it with water, and keep it by your grill. Not only can you use it to extinguish flare-ups, but when you're cleaning your grill you can spray it on the hot grates and generate your own steam to use with your Weber grill brush.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XH9EDL3WN7HY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVL6UAG#wasThisHelpful","R2XH9EDL3WN7HY","A2NX6MFZP8TM6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6MFZP8TM6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great idea. This Belkin Lightning to USB cable has a connector that's angled 90 degrees on the Lightning end, which is supposed to mean little or no strain on the wire.

I can't tell you how many charging cables my family has gone through in the last few years. Hopefully, this new design will put an end to the disposable charging cable! By the way, in addition to the angled tip on this cable, the cord itself seems to be thicker and more durable than most competitors. Belkin even offers a 2-year limited warranty on this item.

"I've been without a full-time job for a little less than two years now, after leaving a company I worked at for 24 years. The reason I left? I was tired of working a job I wasn't passionate about just to get a paycheck. When I was offered a buyout, I jumped at the chance, albeit with a bit of trepidation. As the months have gone on, I've done a lot of freelance writing, which is work that I love. And even though I don't make as much money as I used to, my life is more fulfilling.

Broken up into sections called ""Courage,"" ""Enchantment,"" ""Permission,"" Persistence,"" ""Trust,"" and ""Divinity,"" Big Magic teaches us how to deal with fear, how to say ""No"" to things you don't want to do and ""Yes"" to those you do, and so many other things that make living a creative life easier. ""You do not need anybody's permission to live a creative life,"" Gilbert writes. Stay focused on what you want, keep working at it, and it can be yours.For the record, when Gilbert talks about a ""creative life,"" she's not necessarily talking about a life in the arts. ""When I refer to 'creative living,'"" she states, ""I am speaking more broadly. I'm talking about living a life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear."" Isn't that a life that all of us would like to be living?Big Magic is not just full of sugarcoated positivity, though. For example, Gilbert is brutally honest when she says, ""You will fail. It sucks, and I hate to say it, but it's true. You will take creative risks, and often they will not pan out."" But that is part of the process and can be overcome, if you forgive yourself and don't let your ego get in the way. The important thing is to do something you love, because ""When it's for love, you will always do it anyhow,"" even if success never comes. That's what passion is all about.Gilbert tells us that ""the universe buries strange jewels deep within us all, and then stands back to see if we can find them."" This is an uplifting, informative book for anyone who aspires to hunt to uncover those jewels. Gilbert definitely has a way with words, and her words are so wise and impactful in Big Magic. I love the fact that each section of the book is comprised of relatively short essays and stories. It makes it very easy to pick this book up and read a bit when you only have a few minutes of time.""Creative living can be an amazing *vocation*, if you have the love and courage and persistence to see it that way. I suggest that this may be the only sanity-preserving way to approach creativity. Because nobody ever told us it would be easy, and uncertainty is what we sign up for when we say that we want to live creative lives.""Amen, Elizabeth Gilbert. Amen. Thank you for helping to guide me on my latest journey.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SSYE8N9Q7TDK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594634718#wasThisHelpful","R2SSYE8N9Q7TDK","A2NX6MFZP8TM6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6MFZP8TM6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife really loves this hair dryer, and she fell in love as soon as she took it out of the box. That's not surprising, since this blow dryer is pretty sleek looking. It's also got a cool finish, which the box calls a ""Soft Touch Finish."" Translation? It has kind of a matte, rubbery feel to it. The dryer's 1875 watts also produce some serious drying power, with two speeds and three heat settings. The bottom line? It dries hair super fast. One of the best features of this dryer is the removable air filter. It's simple to unscrew the filter on the back of the unit and clean out the accumulated hair and dust. It helps prevent that familiar burning hair smell from filling up the bathroom. My wife doesn't use the two included attachments--a diffuser and a concentrator--but it's nice to have them available. Add to that a rubber hang loop for easy storage and a FOUR-YEAR warranty, and you have yourself an impressive blow dryer!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R382ULS95MZ4KV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VRN7SB8#wasThisHelpful","R382ULS95MZ4KV","A2NX6MFZP8TM6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6MFZP8TM6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this toy for my 25-year-old son, who has been a Star Wars fan for pretty much his entire life. You're never too old to have cool toys, and this is a cool toy. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived, because it's bigger than it seems in the photograph. It's built well and would, I'm guessing, hold up to countless hours of play.

"This is the first manual coffee grinder I've ever owned. In the past, I've always used noisy, obnoxious electric models. The kind that wake up the whole house when you grind coffee early on a Sunday morning. Well, I think my family will be able to sleep in now. This Tanors Ceramic Burr manual grinder is the cat's pajamas! It's compact, easy to use and clean, and does a great job of grinding my coffee beans. I love being able to adjust the grind size for different coffee making applications. I'm not sure if I'd ever travel with this, but it's so compact that it would not take up much room if I decided to pack it in my suitcase. The travel bag it comes with is pretty cheap, but it serves its purpose. Nice that a cleaning brush is included, too. If you've never tried a manual grinder for your coffee beans, I'd suggest you give this one a try.

"I had read the bad reviews of this thing on Amazon, but I needed a cart this size in the worst way. When I saw it at my local Ace Hardware today, I thought about it for about 30 seconds...then figured I'd take a chance on it. After all, it couldn't be as bad as the reviews on Amazon made it out to be, could it? Turns out it wasn't. It was a hundred times worse! OMG. Who in their right mind could even design a product this bad? And even if that was allowed to happen, what genius at the manufacturer decided it would be a good idea to sell this thing? Did anyone associated with the company even try to put it together or use it??? I doubt it, because if they had this cart would never have come to market. Never. Ever. It's virtually impossible to assemble. The package touts ""no tool assembly."" Little did I know that that meant there was literally nothing holding this thing together. No screws, no clips, not even holes for ends to stick or snap into. It's all pretty much based on gravity. I felt like a circus juggler while assembling this cart. I was holding lightweight pieces of painted steel, but they may as well have been chainsaws. That's how hard it was to get this thing together. And after it was together, and the casters were popped on? This is the painted steel version of a house of cards. Yes, it's that flimsy. Shame on you, Whitmor for even making a product like this. What were you thinking?? If someone offered to PAY me $100.00 to use this, I would emphatically say ""NO!"" Needless to say, I returned this travesty to the hardware store. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT order this. If you do, I guarantee you will regret it with every bone in your body.

"At the age of 14, Jason Smith got his first taste of addiction. Literally. While his parents were away for the weekend, his uncle--a heroin addict who was living with Jason and his family--overdosed, and Jason had to perform CPR on him. Without going into too much detail, let's just say that the taste was unforgettable.The bitter taste of dying indeed.Three years later, Smith inadvertently stumbled upon the warm, comforting effects of drugs when he ended up in the hospital following a car accident that injured his back. One shot of Demerol and Smith was hooked.The Bitter Taste of Dying is a gripping, no-holds-barred memoir of Smiths experiences while in the throes of the beast known as addiction. He takes the reader along on his journeys to Europe, Mexico, and China, documenting his innermost feelings and the crazy, mixed-up thinking that goes hand-in-hand with drug dependency. Smiths days and nights are filled with desperation and recklessness as he constantly chases a high while simultaneously running away from life.Smith cant live without drugs, but he cant live with them, either. At least not in a manner that most human beings would want to live. His addiction is his constant companion through college, allowing him to shed the shyness and anxiety he felt while growing up. Drugs make his life easier, but at the same time they make his life a living hell.Some of the situations Smith finds himself in are nothing short of terrifying. His time spent in a Tijuana prison--where he was beaten by guards and given drinking water from a janitors mop bucket--and his encounter with the Russian mob had me overflowing with empathy. The lengths Smith goes to in order to stay high are beyond what most people can even comprehend.Jason Smith is a guy who manipulated every person in his life and every system he encountered, all for the sake of getting high. A guy who chewed on Fentanyl patches that were meant to be stuck on his arm, because his method gave him a quicker, better high. A guy who at one point wanted to die but didnt, because he couldnt even commit suicide right. His life and addiction got so bad that he was devoid of any feelings.But 16 years after that fateful shot of Demerol, Smith finally got clean and sober. As he states so eloquently: It took me losing everything to appreciate anything.Smith is an excellent storyteller and The Bitter Taste of Dying is an enthralling read. The end-of-chapter conversations with his sponsor, Bryon, are almost as compelling as the words that precede them. They add an insight that I havent found in most addiction-related memoirs, and show the evolution of Smiths thought process as he moves from addiction to recovery.Like so many people, Jason Smith turned to drugs when life and the feelings that go along with it got too hard to manage. Self-medication numbed him and allowed him to navigate what he previously thought was unnavigable. But hell be the first one to tell you that the magic didnt last.The Bitter Taste of Dying isnt just a riveting story of addiction and recovery. Its a story of self-discovery and hope, too. Make no mistake: Your life can be in complete ruins, but if you try hard enough you can rebuild it. The transformation of Jason Smith is proof of that. It may have taken him 16 years to find the light at the end of the tunnel, but the important thing is that he found it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LMFEMP7F55DA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WKU6FK2#wasThisHelpful","R2LMFEMP7F55DA","A2NX6MFZP8TM6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6MFZP8TM6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Panasonic RPHJE190K in-the-ear headphones are a good value. My teenage son goes through earbuds like they're candy, and buying more expensive models does not make economical sense. (I bought him a pair of $50 ear buds once...they lasted about two weeks before the wires broke.) Are these the best sounding headphones you'll come across? No. But they're far from terrible and actually seem to be built pretty well. The multiple silicone tips make getting a comfy fit easy, and the bass response is surprisingly good for something this inexpensive. I think they sound terrific, and my teenage son likes them. And he might be one of the toughest critics of all. Don't throw your money away on pricier headphones. Go with these Panasonics and save your money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11B8C7QE3CCBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C1911XS#wasThisHelpful","R11B8C7QE3CCBA","A2NX6MFZP8TM6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6MFZP8TM6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a 19-year-old son who has been using Axe products--body wash and deodorant--for the last few years. Maybe I'm just old, but every Axe product we've ever had in our house smells awful to me. The scent is just too strong and lingers for too long. To me, this Pre de Provence shower gel smells like an Axe product. To be completely honest, I was really looking forward to getting this product and trying it out. When it arrived today, I opened the bottle and took a whiff. I immediately put the top back on and won't be opening it again. Maybe I'll give it to my son. Because it smells like Axe. And, in my opinion, that's not a good thing. UPDATE: I offered the shower gel to my son and told him I thought it smelled like Axe. His reply? ""It does.""

"This Case Logic Intrata 15.6-Inch Laptop Bag is very functional and is perfect for my wife's 15-inch work laptop. The case offers some nice features. Among the ones we like the best are the slightly wider opening at the top and the shoulder strap that attaches at the back of the case. Both of these are great because it makes it a lot easier to remove the laptop from the case. The carrying handle that doubles as a luggage loop is nice, too. The padding in this case is not over-the-top, but it seems adequate for an everyday laptop bag. (A little more would've been nice, though.) The front zippered pocket fits the AC charger nicely. There's a phone pocket in there, too, but I'm not sure if my wife will ever use it. Nice to have the option, though. As far as appearance goes, this case is not going to win any fashion awards. But the black nylon material and the overall design falls pretty much in line with other Case Logic products we've purchased over the years. And, based on our experience, Case Logic stuff holds up nicely over the years. This is a nice, durable, functional laptop bag. Perfect? No. But way more than adequate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GB5MB0TCJ4DC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XREHXJM#wasThisHelpful","R2GB5MB0TCJ4DC","A2NX6MFZP8TM6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6MFZP8TM6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Confession: When I first ordered my Echo, I was very skeptical. I didn't think it was something I would use very much. In fact, when it arrived I thought seriously about returning it. I wondered if it was going to be one of those frivolous purchases I'm famous for. But after a couple days of looking at the sealed box, I decided to open it and try it. And I've been hooked ever since. I love to listen to music and I love to cook. The ability to stream music in the kitchen and control it all without touching the device makes it worth the money alone. No more having to wash dough or chicken residue off my hands before skipping to the next song! Between my iTunes library--which I uploaded to Prime Music for the $24.99/year fee--Prime Music, iHeart Radio, and Pandora, I have pretty much all the music I need available to me via voice command. Also... I am pretty picky when it comes to how my music sounds, and I must say I have been pleasantly surprised by how good the Echo's speaker is. I didn't expect it to sound half as good as it does.I primarily use the Echo for playing music, so all of its other features are like icing on a black, cylindrical cake. Weather reports, traffic reports, reading Audible books, making shopping and to-do lists, etc. All very cool and handy at times. Just like the Echo's remote!I love my Echo, and to be perfectly honest? I can't imagine my kitchen without it now! I'm sooooo glad I didn't return it!

"As the parent of a son who struggled through more than seven years of addiction, I have read countless books on the subject. There's no doubt that this is one of the best. In S.O.B.E.R.*, Anita Devlin and her son, Michael Jr., take turns telling the story of Michael's addiction from two different perspectives: The mother's and the addict's. This back-and-forth storytelling gives the reader great insight into what was going on in both of their minds during particularly difficult times. As a bonus, we also get occasional passages from Alex, who is the daughter, sister, and ""collateral damage"" in this addiction tale. What makes S.O.B.E.R.* so impactful is the brutal honesty with which all involved tell their story. Anita says the things that all parents of addicted children *think*, but often times keep to themselves. There is no filter between her thoughts and the words she writes on these pages.This is an intimate story. We learn so much about the Devlins and how Michael Jr.'s addiction slowly eats away at the foundation of their family. We also read the ""cost letters"" that a mother, father, and sister write to their addicted loved one. Again, nothing is held back. For example, Alex writes to her brother:""I listened to you talk about how you wanted to help your friends that were going through the same things you are...and the whole time I thought to myself, 'What are you talking about? You are more messed up than all of them, and you don't even see it.' The difference is, you are the luckiest sh*t in the world, because you have three people who are willing to take all the crap that you've thrown on us, and still stand up for you and want to help you at the end of the day.""Those are the kinds of feelings that engulf a family struggling with addiction. It's so common for family members to wonder why their loved one continues to do what they're doing, even though it's toxic to all the relationships they have. But Michael Jr. helps shed some light on why that might be when he writes, ""My mind is my problem, and drugs and alcohol were the solution that helped me to feel OK."" That's it in a nutshell. People don't use drugs because they *want* to become addicts or inflict hurt on their families. They self-medicate because they want to feel ""normal."" There is no intent to cause pain for others, and sometimes that's so very hard for a drug user's family to grasp.Anita also visits the importance of self-care, a concept that is too often overlooked by family members dealing with addiction. ""I've learned that the most important thing family members can do while we are waiting for the addict to want the help is to help ourselves,"" she says. ""We cannot handle what is happening without getting help. If we do not understand what addiction is, we cannot help our children. The anger and hatred and war we wage is not against our children but against the real enemy--addiction itself. A family must join forces for the battle, helping each other, not just the addict.""Addiction is indeed a family disease, and S.O.B.E.R.* does an incredible job of telling this family's story. If you are the loved one of someone struggling with addiction, read this book. If you know someone who is struggling with addiction--either their own or a loved one's--read this book. If you think addiction is a disease that only affects the addict, read this book. S.O.B.E.R.* is a monumental comeback story, full of love, fear, courage, honesty, and hope.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JJ7BZGWQWJ4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692331476#wasThisHelpful","R2JJ7BZGWQWJ4S","A2NX6MFZP8TM6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6MFZP8TM6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Hoover FloorMate Cordless Hard Floor Cleaner is a terrific product. Easy assembly, easy-to-follow instructions, and fabulous results. We have tried it on our hardwood floors, tile floors, and even our painted concrete basement floor. It performed flawlessly on all surfaces, and I honestly believe that the tile floors in my bathrooms are cleaner than they have EVER been. Like others have suggested, sweep or vacuum first, because it makes emptying and cleaning the FloorMate a lot easier. (We have three cats and are used to doing a thorough vacuuming before mopping.) One of the greatest features of this unit, though, is the fact that it's cordless. This makes cleaning so much easier, especially when using a cleaner that uses water. No more dragging that cord across a wet floor! But as much as I love the cordlessness (is that a word?) of this machine, that feature also leads me to my one small complaint: The battery just doesn't last long enough. When doing a thorough cleaning, I think I need about an hour. But so far the battery has lasted only slightly more than 30 minutes. Then it's time to take a break from cleaning and charge the battery, which takes a little less than an hour or so. It's just a little inconvenient. If this thing could run for 60 minutes on a battery charge, I'd have given it 5 stars. But 30 minutes or so of battery life forces me to knock 1 star off. Overall, though, it's a really nice machine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TCK65KOWV39K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWCU3JG#wasThisHelpful","R2TCK65KOWV39K","A2NX6MFZP8TM6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6MFZP8TM6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The hook did fit on my downstairs bathroom door, and the door shuts with only a little friction from the hook's plastic. So I'm using it...just not in the place I wanted to use it.

But there are a number of things that miss the mark, at least for me.First of all, I have no issues with the display, and--surprisingly--very few complaints about the Android operating system. It was pretty intuitive, though not as intuitive as iOS. Granted, that may be because I'm used to iOS.Here are some things that I don't like about this phone:*Personally, I think it's too big. I know that ""phablets"" are all the rage now, but I don't think I could ever get used to carrying and using a phone this big. I find it very awkward to hold it in my hand and talk on it. I do have small hands, so maybe that's a factor. I also find the phone quite heavy.*Quality of the calls on this phone are not as good as on my iPhone. The audio is just not as clear/sharp.*The screen itself--the actual glass--is not as resistant to fingerprints and smudges as my iPhone screen. I find myself having to clean the glass on this phone constantly.*The case provided with this phone is pretty cheap. Fortunately there are some third-party cases available.*The few times I've tried to take video with this phone, the quality has been poor. Simple video of my cat playing in the living room was choppy. I'm using a quality micro SD card, so I'm confused as to what the problem is. (On the other hand, the still camera works very well.)*Playing videos from YouTube and other websites seems to be a challenge for this phone. The actual video seems to play alright, but the audio is, in many instances, terrible. Full of distortion and static. It's frustrating, to say the least.That's a quick summary of some of the negatives I've experienced with the Blu Studio 6.0 HD. As with all electronics these days, your mileage may vary. That said, I'm a firm believer in ""you get what you pay for."" I just don't believe that a top-notch, 6-inch, unlocked smartphone can be had for $129.99 to $149.99. But maybe that's just me being skeptical.I've decided to keep using an iPhone for my wireless service. I am now using the Blu phone as a mini-tablet. Took out the sim card and it works great as something between an iPod Touch and an iPad Mini. So all is not lost!","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KOMM1GP4WXS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4#wasThisHelpful","R2KOMM1GP4WXS5","A2NX6MFZP8TM6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6MFZP8TM6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is absolutely the best safety mat I've ever used.  In the first place, it is LONG ENOUGH!  Most items of this type are only about half the length of a tub, and that leaves an awfully large amount of slippery surface. This may be TMI, but my spouse and I shower together, and we find the length a major asset.  Although other products I've used have a similar surface, this one seems to be especially comfortable for the feet.  Finally, of course, there's the color.  I love the lavender, as opposed to the clear plastic of my previous safety mat.  Since the time requirement on the review does not permit long-term use, I can't at this point testify to durability or long-lasting effectiveness, but I see no reason to suspect that this mat will be equal to or better than other similar products over time.Actually, in reading negative reviews after posting my own very positive one, I discovered that they mostly complained about the odor.  To be honest, when I first put mine down, though I didn't notice anything worse than the usual ""new plastic"" smell, my adult son, who happened to be visiting at the time, made a remark about the ""strange odor"" and was looking around the house trying to figure out what it was.  In our very large bathroom, however, I suspect it will not be a problem for us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24E9PJSIK8MMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V4QBE9K#wasThisHelpful","R24E9PJSIK8MMU","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book, edited by Sandra Taylor and Hazel Barnes, with an introduction by Sister Jeannine Gramick, contains 34 brief narratives organized around 6 themes: Family; Is Catholicism home?; A religious life?; A long journey; Significant events; and Working for understanding and acceptance.  The people who share their stories represent a large diversity of age, life circumstances, relationship status, and national origins; the shared theme, obviously, is their identification  past and present  with the Roman Catholic Church, as well as their self-identification with the LGBT community.This book is, I believe, especially timely, coming as it does during the era of Pope Francis, who is doing so much to bring a renewed understanding of Catholic teachings into the public awareness.  Although belief in the importance of the guidance of ones own conscience has long been a part of the doctrine of the Church, it is only since Catholicism began earnestly wrestling with the issue of sexuality in general and homosexuality in particular that this fact has become part of public discussion.  As anyone who has been following this discussion should be aware, the questions of contraception, abortion and divorce are all interrelated with the status of women and the morality of various forms of sexual expression not directly purposed for reproduction.  To the extent testimonies of LGBT people speak directly to the idea that spirituality and sexuality ARE in fact intended by the Creator for the purpose of increasing loving relationships among individuals even when reproduction is not involved, they indeed offer a major contribution to this discussion.In my own personal memoir, completed years ago before there were nearly as many resources on the theology of sexuality as there are now, I struggled with this same concern for the development of a perspective that allowed my conscience to deal with these questions.  I find that my own evolution parallels many of the stories shared in this book, which gives me a warm fellow-feeling; we are indeed a cloud of witnesses calling Christianity in general and Catholicism in particular out of the dark ages of unquestioning acceptance of a very flawed and limited view of Gods purposes for human sexuality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6FVJ65UMPGXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9088830150#wasThisHelpful","R6FVJ65UMPGXC","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cynthia Ruchti is another author whose work I consider myself blessed to have encountered via the Vine for All category of Christian Books.  Her deeply insightful and beautifully written novel As Waters Gone By, published by Abingdon Press, is another winner from that amazing publishing house.  Although it is my policy NOT to check on reviews by others before writing my own, I will not be surprised to discover that this one has received so many accolades mine will be merely icing on the cake.Of the numerous things that made this an extremely meaningful read for me, perhaps the most significant is the description of the conflict resulting from Maxs incarceration and Emmalyns ambivalent response to it.  As it happens, over the past 30 years or so, my husband Ray has had a ministry of ongoing correspondence with a large number of inmates.  He has visited several of them during their time of imprisonment; had telephone communication with some of them; and in several circumstances maintained contact after their release to various parole or probation situations.  Therefore I am absolutely able to verify the authenticity of Ruchtis description of the difficulty in communicating under those conditions, which forms such an important plot element in this novel.Although this book is deeply imbued with a genuine spirit of love, faith and hope, it is at no point saccharine or clich.  All of the characters are vibrant and realistic, in a decisively off-beat sort of way.  The discussion of Emmalyns own resentment of her mother's and sisters attitudes as they impact her own feelings and actions offers a powerful counterbalance and additional infusion of realism.  In all, Im very glad that the paucity of meaningful offerings on my Vine Queue led me to seek out this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC8MMOTSC64WZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426787278#wasThisHelpful","RC8MMOTSC64WZ","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Through the Eyes of a Lion by Levi Lusko is intense spiritual witness based on his familys experience of losing their five-year-old daughter Lenya to a fatal asthma attack a few days before Christmas in 2012.  Although I dont agree with all of Luskos theological perspectives, I deeply respect the power of his faith, and I certainly share many of the insights he offers in this heart-rending, powerful memoir.A major focus of this narrative is that unbelievable grief CAN be endured, and that to do so is to allow Gods love to transform it into powerful witness.  As long as life goes along smoothly, we may find that our assertions of reliance upon Gods love ring a bit false.  As is pointed out so effectively by the Devil in the Book of Job, why WOULDNT Job honor and serve God as long as everything was hunky-dory? Only if all the blessings were removed would the real truth be manifest.  Or, as a more modern clich says, what happens when the rubber meets the road?  Although all of us can relate to SOME challenges and difficulties in life, the testimony of those who have had such an extremely traumatic experience as the loss of a young child and yet have emerged with strengthened faith and deeper compassion is especially valuable.Luskos writing is both authentic and contemporary.  His use of current day references, including his references to movies, TV shows, and so on, should make it easy for those who are not overly fond of churchy language to relate.  No matter where a reader is on the spiritual journey, Lusko is a worthwhile co-pilgrim to encounter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MI6N06DPIRIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718032144#wasThisHelpful","R2MI6N06DPIRIR","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fans of the Impossible Life by Kate Scelsa is another of those books that I wish I liked as much as I hoped I would.  It is, according to the classification, one of the rare offerings in the Gay and Lesbian literature category.  It is also, as it happens, another iteration of teenage angst; all of the main characters exhibit various degrees of dysfunctionality.  Sebby, the most extreme of the three, is an unabashedly gay casualty of the foster-care system, a drug-addicted school drop-out whose worst problems began with a nearly-fatal bashing incident in a high-school locker room.  Mira, the daughter of a mixed-race professional couple with an over-achieving elder sister, is probably mainly suffering from self-image problems and chemical imbalance being improperly treated.  Jeremy, whose family constellation includes two gay dads, is really hypersensitive; it seems to me he could benefit immensely from some common-sense counseling, which his teacher Peter tries to provide, but with limited effectiveness.As Ive observed in several recent reviews, my biggest dissatisfaction with this narrative is the apparent complete idiocy of the supposedly rational adults involved in the story.  As a previous high school teacher myself, and a parent and grandparent, I found myself becoming more and more outraged by this factor.  Although the characterizations of the three young people are well-drawn and their motivations fairly explicit, one cant help but want to slap their parents and/or caregivers upside the head and shout, Wake up!  While this may be an honest depiction of the world in which many of us live today, it is certainly not one to celebrate.  In all, I found the tone of this story grim and, while perhaps dealing with important realities, not one I would return to for enlightenment or inspiration.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLHYJL63XDRDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062331752#wasThisHelpful","RLHYJL63XDRDH","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a book that Im more than delighted to have discovered in the Vine for All section during one of those times when my personal queue contained absolutely nothing of interest.  Of course, I will always go for things in the Gay and Lesbian category, but the special extra gift of Chinelo Okparantas Under the Udala Trees is that it deals with the pressing issue of being in the LGBTQ community in Nigeria, one of the African nations which have currently introduced extremely repressive legislation.The story itself is beautifully crafted, and offers wonderfully sensitive insights into the human drama involved.  As the narrative begins, in 1968, Nigeria is in the midst of the conflict with Biafra.  Her narrator character, Ijeoma, is eleven years old, an only child.  Her educated and loving father becomes depressed by the course of the war, and refuses to go to a bunker during a bombing raid.  He is killed, and Ijeomas mother becomes unhinged, and believes that the only way to keep her daughter safe is to board her with a couple in a nearby town while she herself tries to rebuild her life.  Regretfully, this arrangement isnt particularly nurturing; Ijeoma and another war-orphan child, Amina, are treated as servants  house girls  and are relegated to an out building, a one-room shack  as their sleeping quarters.  Having only each other, and no parenting of any sort, as the girls enter puberty they automatically establish a deep emotional bond that of course involves sexual exploration.  It should come as no surprise that when their relationship is exposed, all sorts of repercussions occur.Okparanta perfectly captures a number of significant nuances, including the confusion and destructiveness of the interaction of the native African cultural mores with the overlay of fundamentalist Christian homophobia.  Although Ijeomas mother has obviously, in her own self-absorption following the death of her husband, opted out of any role of nurturing of her daughter, she suddenly decides it is her duty to rescue the girl from the abomination of homosexuality as described in the Bible (KJV, no doubt).  Gay youth who  whatever their culture  have been subjected to such a barrage will recognize the oppressiveness of it, and will be able to empathize completely with Ijeomas ensuing trauma.Descriptions, characterizations, and the psychological and sociological aspects of this novel are pitch-perfect.  It is a brilliantly done work, deserving of full recognition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BMXXILDKP2DK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544003446#wasThisHelpful","R1BMXXILDKP2DK","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finally, a real triumph for e-books.  Having recently read and reviewed Tess Gerritsen's stand-alone novel ""Playing with Fire"" on Amazon (September 14, 2015), and discovering that her Rizzoli and Isles series was available as a ""bundle"" for a relatively affordable price, I decided to ""take the plunge"".  The real motivation for this decision was the awareness that at the beginning of November, we will be on a ""river cruise"" in Europe.  I wanted plenty of reading material, and didn't want to deal with packing books.  Although I plan to reserve most of this series for that trip, and have no intention of reviewing the books individually, I decided to go ahead and start reading now.  These books seem to avoid a common complaint I've recently had about other e-books, namely extremely casual and inadequate editing - no doubt because these have been available in bound format for a number of years now.  In any event, I am heartily in favor of the whole notion of re-publishing entire series such as this one in compact format, chronological order, and reasonable price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28NOPBV677NJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FIMYZEM#wasThisHelpful","R28NOPBV677NJA","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first time in several months of being eligible for a free Kindle download as an Amazon Prime member that Ive taken advantage of this perk.  In general, I have found the offerings less than appealing.  However, Here and There by Joshua Scher was listed as Experimental Fiction, and had the intriguing come-on Some quantum entanglements shouldnt be untied.  Since I am a one-time science teacher, and have been extremely interested in quantum factors both in terms of philosophy and physics, I decided to give Schers book a try.Although Ive read none of the other reviews posted on Amazon (when I commit to a book, I like to form my own opinion from scratch) I note that they are pretty evenly distributed across the entire spectrum.  I must admit that some of the authors ploys (such as pages of numbers) really put me off.  Also, in the Kindle format, the hand written notes and other reproductions that were supposedly part of Hilarys report were unreadable, and therefore annoying.  It appears they were used merely as fillers.  The basic premise, of course, is that Dr. Kerek Reidier has apparently developed a mode of teleportation that involves using the quantized properties of matter/energy and the patterns of consciousness.  Of course, both government and private enterprise are determined to exploit his discovery for their own agendas.  The two narrator characters who carry the story are Daniel Brand, and his mother Hilary, who is a theoretical psychologist presumably commissioned by the government to prepare an in-depth report on the accident that occurred when The Reidier Test was performed (and a catastrophic explosion resulted).  Daniels mother has disappeared, leaving her son with the rough draft of this report.  It is Daniels attempts to utilize this document to perhaps discover Hilarys whereabouts or eventual fate that develop the intricacies of the narrative.Stylistically, there are some brilliant passages, and the story-line is presented effectively despite much of the extraneous material.  Characterization and the interactions between the key characters are vivid.  The narrative style, especially as it involves interjections by both Hilary and Daniel, is confusing at times, but it is possible to sort these out with a bit of focus.  The reader should not, of course, expect a neat happy ending, but if one is willing to go with the flow, the story is a fair read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE9P6HTK48EQR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UMBGZFQ#wasThisHelpful","RE9P6HTK48EQR","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my personal religious and intellectual experience, there has been no greater joy than to investigate and perceive the overlap of science and spirituality.  I have never doubted the existence of an overarching creative presence in the universe, and at one time I began to define this as an Omnipresent Intelligent Being (OIB).  I do not in any way accept the fundamentalist interpretations that consider the Creation Myth of the Judeo-Christian Scriptures to be a factual description of the origin of our universe or life upon this planet, but I likewise totally reject the notion pseudo-science sometimes proposes that everything is purely accidental.  When during my young adulthood I discovered the writings of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (several of whose books Ive previously reviewed for Amazon), I knew I had encountered truth at a level much deeper than the superficial ideas involved in the current arguments between Creationists and Evolutionists.Therefore, with all my subsequent scientific and theological reading since, I have been searching for those writers who do in fact integrate scientific and spiritual insights in the same way Teilhard did, actually carrying his ideas forward as ever-new insights evolve in both areas.  Ilia Delio is one such writer that I am ecstatic to have encountered.  As both a scientist and a Franciscan Sister, Delio has all the necessary qualifications to continue to expand this dialogue.  Her writing is brilliant, thorough and completely readable.  In the past, the dissemination and development of Teilhards thought was hindered by the fact that his ideas were so revolutionary, the authorities of the Catholic Church (he was a Jesuit priest as well as a scientist) prohibited publication during his lifetime.  Thus he was unable to personally engage in the exchange of ideas among other scientists that is the lifeblood of the development and testing of theories.  Fortunately, the Second Vatican Council occurred shortly after his death when his work began to be published and translated, and thereafter his writings became more and more acknowledged among the new breed of theological thinkers which resulted from that Council.

"Without doubt, this is a theological study that will be completely rejected by many of those who most need to hear what Jeff Hood is saying.  On the other hand, it is definitely going to bring the Wind of the Spirit into other hearts that have been waiting and yearning for just such a refreshing.  At the beginning of the book, the reader will find glowing endorsements from nearly three dozen extremely diverse individuals, including Kittredge Cherry, whose comments initially led me to purchase this book.Hoods basic premise, the understanding that in the person and teaching of Jesus, God fully intends to confront and forever discredit the normative of human belief and practice, is not new.  What IS new is his use of the term queer as a noun, a verb, and even  capitalized  as a Name of God and the Divine Principle in Jesus and those who follow.  Although even those who, like me, agree with Hoods thesis may find that endless repetition of a term so often used as a pejorative is disturbing, I urge them to hang in there.  What Hood has to say is important enough to allow the concepts to come through regardless of the (intentionally employed) shock value of his vocabulary.I frankly acknowledge that I have never adhered to  perhaps a better descriptor might be been enslaved by  the normative concepts of law and conformity that bind so many people who believe they are following the Christ.  My parents before me were free thinkers, and when my dad Ted eventually became an active participant in a church congregation, it was only after informing the pastor that this action in no way implied acceptance of all the doctrines and premises of that particular group.  In his own mystical encounters with Cephas (St. Peter), Ted was told, Dont belong to church, belong to God.  Other aspects of my own life and belief have indeed led me to define myself as queer, which is a marvelously NON-DEFINING term indeed.  As a result, I can wholeheartedly applaud Jeff Hoods book as affirming my perception of what the Cosmic Consciousness  or in his term, the Queer  has in mind for the ultimate evolution of the human species.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S6OXWWFSAOA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1498221912#wasThisHelpful","R1S6OXWWFSAOA7","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Although The Telling by Jo Baker is described as A ghost story of the most unusual kind on the jacket blurb, I would really characterize it much more as two parallel stories.  There really is no connection in time or circumstance between the two protagonists, 19th century Elizabeth and 21st century Rachel.  The only connection is, of course, the Reading Room cottage in which Elizabeth lived and to which Rachel came in a time of extreme emotional stress following the death of her mother to try to dispose of the property.Both portraits of the women are vital and extremely involving, and the tone of the writing is authentic for each time period and set of circumstances, although there is no genuine overlap.  One gets the impression that Baker is really reaching a bit to try to convince the reader that something numinous is occurring, bringing in the typical signs of ghostly manifestation as experienced by Rachel during her stay in the cottage.  It is psychologically interesting, but not really convincing, and there is actually no reason given for Elizabeths haunting.  Obviously, she experienced a life-changing event during her early years in the cottage, but Baker makes it plain that she did not die young or, apparently, traumatically, so one wonders why the haunting.The most interesting part of the story for me was the description of the Chartist movement in mid-19th century England, and the discussion of the conflict between the church and the intellectuals of that era, because it echoes so completely much of what is happening in our own time.  Religious fundamentalists, far from supporting and uplifting the poor as the Gospel enjoins them, continue to pander to the wealthy few while simultaneously fighting the truths of science by mindless adherence to Biblical literalism.  Well, after all, only 160 or so years has passed; so perhaps this repetition of history is not really unexpected.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REO86MIM3GZP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080417265X#wasThisHelpful","REO86MIM3GZP0","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On more than one occasion Ive averred my growing interest in the memoir genre.  It is my firm conviction that everyone has a story, and that all stories are worth sharing and  as long as they are sincere and honest  should be accepted as non-judgmentally as possible.  Of course, that puts certain things off limits for reviewing.  I will not critique the beliefs, motivations or actions of the author, even though they may be very different from my own.Still, I believe that honesty on my part as a reviewer DOES require admission of the specific areas of my own inexperience and therefore to some degree lack of rapport.  Specifically, I have never experienced rape myself, nor has it happened to anyone near and dear to me.  In addition, my own philosophy and practice of parenting has been so diametrically opposite to that practiced by Mrs. Parker as described by her daughter that I really found it almost impossible to credit this behavior.  And, finally, Ive never felt the urge to attempt long-distance, endurance hiking; hence to even begin to accept that doing so is anything other than insane requires a significant stretch for me.Given these fiats, I have to evaluate Aspen Matis memoir as an astonishingly powerful piece of writing for a person as young as she is.  Her descriptions of her hiking experiences and the terrain she traversed are breathtakingly vivid.  The characterizations of her family members and the others she encountered during the journey are sensitive and engaging; even the not-so-charming characters are depicted with a certain sympathy and definite reality, including those who are presented only in brief vignettes.  Most important, the development of her psychological insight as the story progresses is incredibly authentic and valuable.  There really is wisdom here far beyond Aspens age.One thing only really bothers me at the end, and that is the ambiguity of what has actually happened with Dash.  There is only one comment in the epilog, and another very cryptic note in the acknowledgements, but this is a loose end that distresses me immensely.  Since this is an Advance Readers Edition that Im commenting upon, perhaps this concern will be addressed in the published edition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T54ZZFD2MJEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062291068#wasThisHelpful","R2T54ZZFD2MJEZ","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1.  Has a no frills look -- the outer case is utilitarian and functional, but it looks like it should be an internal hard drive -- definitely NOT pretty.  It's thin, which is good, but not particularly light for its size.  It does not come with a case, so carrying it around might be problematic as it could be easily scratched on the outside.2.

I would not consider this the kind of drive I would carry around with me.  The slowness of the interface, even though it says it is USB3.0, makes it impractical for use as a supplemental hard drive, but it would be fine for backup.  You would want to initiate the backup at night when you don't need to wait around for it to finish.Given the specified cost of >$50, I would rate it 3/5 because there are much faster (and sleeker) external drives out there in that price range.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R193UIJAH53RSO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5X3LTQ#wasThisHelpful","R193UIJAH53RSO","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although Ive read a number of books recently relating to the circumstances surrounding the incarceration of Jews and others in Nazi concentration camps during WWII, I found The Prisoners of Breendonk to offer intriguing and unusual insights.  The book is lavishly illustrated, many of the illustrations being sketches by Jacques Ochs, a prisoner himself.  Ochs had been the director of the Academy of Fine Arts in Lige, Belgium, and had published an uncomplimentary cartoon of Hitler, which led to his imprisonment.  Frankly, I think this book would be worth it for these illustrations alone, but of course the histories are fascinating, as are the numerous photographic illustrations of the prison camp itself.This book is both extremely readable and extraordinarily informative about many of the sidelines of a prison camp.  Breendonk, utilizing as it did a previously-built structure that had been one of a series of forts surrounding the city of Antwerp, was not a death camp as such, and had an intriguing arrangement of prisoner quarters in what had at one time been barracks for the garrison.  The individual insights and character studies  especially as enhanced by Ochs caricature portraits  are incredibly poignant.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T5HUWV89IC3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544096649#wasThisHelpful","R3T5HUWV89IC3Y","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The real brilliance of Vanessa Diffenbaughs We Never Asked for Wings lies in her exquisite character development.  The plot is fairly basic and very contemporary; Letty Espinosa is the American-born daughter of Enrique, an artist who creates breathtakingly beautiful feather mosaic paintings and Maria Elena, a super mom.  The elder Espinosas are undocumented, but have lived in the San Francisco area for over thirty years.  However, as the narrative begins, Enrique has returned to Mexico due to his mothers illness; when he does not come back to the US, Maria Elena decides to also join him in Mexico.  The trouble is that during the past 15 years she has completely taken over the rearing of Lettys two children while her daughter has become the family breadwinner, working as a bar tender at a watering hole in the San Francisco airport.Feeling deserted and unable to take up the parenting role, Letty goes into complete panic mode and chases her mother down to the border, eventually actually accompanying Maria Elena to the family estate, which has fallen into complete disrepair.  She tries to persuade the parents to return with her and resume care of the kids, despite the extreme danger posed by tightened immigration restrictions.  They refuse, and from this point on the story of Lettys struggles to become a functioning parent to 15-year-old Alex, a brilliant kid in an extremely unacceptable high school situation, and 6-year-old Luna, precocious but completely disequilibrated by the loss of her care-giving grandma, balloons into a major family trauma.  The story is gravely complicated by the introduction of a love-interest for young Alex, Yesenia, who also turns out to be undocumented and has a physical impairment that renders her the prey of bullies at school.A fascinating sub-plot involves Enriques feather collection, which he has left as a heritage (both the collection itself, and a rich depth of knowledge about bird migration) to Alex.Although the story deals with the plight of undocumented individuals and the circumstances of young women  both Letty and Yesenias mother Carmen  who have become unwed mothers and are struggling to rear children in extremely dire circumstances, this is only part of the problem.  A much greater issue for me is the lack of communication occurring between parents and children, and the way in which one persons over-protectiveness of another ends up backfiring seriously.  Hopefully other readers of this charmingly-drawn story will find, as I did, both entertainment and significant food for thought.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZWNN71ODLJYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=055339231X#wasThisHelpful","RZWNN71ODLJYW","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you have bought a book four or more times because you've given away numerous previously purchased copies, it says you think that book is vitally important.  My first encounter with David Ray Griffin's ""Christian Faith and the Truth Behind 9/11"" was on the ""Sale"" table of St. Phillips Cathedral bookstore in Atlanta, GA.  This was before I'd started reading and reviewing books for Amazon, but not before I'd begun to have my own serious personal doubts about the validity of the ""official"" findings of the government-appointed 9/11 Commission.That purchase was in fact a conscious-raising event of the highest order.  Griffin not only did an incredible amount of exquisite work in pulling together all the available information countering the ""official conspiracy theory""; because he is a theologian of great repute, he also managed to put the unthinkable into the context of all the other false flag operations by which those who aspire to empire have opened the way to the diabolical throughout the ages.I read and re-read this book many times, shared it, reflected upon it, and then read all the subsequent writings by Griffin I could acquire, many of which I've also reviewed for Amazon, including ""9/11 Ten Years Later""; ""Debunking 9/11 Debunking"" and ""Cognitive Infiltration"".  However, as it happens, I'd never shared my review of this book directly but only via references in reviews of my later purchases.  Having just purchased it yet again to replace the most recent ""lost"" volume which appears to have gone wandering amongst those whom I wished to introduce to Griffin's incredibly important insights, I will now remedy that deficit.If you sincerely CARE about the truth - especially as related to the 9/11 event - this is the ONE BOOK you need to read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28W3SKPBH2CJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C7F51TG#wasThisHelpful","R28W3SKPBH2CJK","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, it was my own fault that I ended up enmeshed in this book.  I didnt HAVE to choose to read it, although it was one of the few viable options on my Vine queue at that point.  Once I started, of course, it held the same morbid fascination as a multi-car wreck on the highway.Its too bad there isnt a dual rating system available, like they use for various sports competitions  one set of points for technical quality and one for enjoyment of the presentation.  Saul Blacks The Killing Lessons is pure horror from start to finish, and there is way too much collateral damage  but simultaneously, there is exquisite description and deeply appealing characterization.  Of course I know that the gruesome happens, and that normally sensitive human beings in law enforcement fields have to deal with the unthinkable and indescribable, and in the process become victims of PTSD.  Its just that in general Ive chosen to avoid the grimmest of the thriller type of narrative where all this is played out in gory detail.Anyway, this book is not for the faint of heart; but it IS masterfully articulated and vividly plotted.

"Stonewall: Breaking Out in the Fight for Gay Rights by Ann Bausum is a delightfully written, nicely illustrated and  of course  very timely bit of contemporary history.  It is designed for the young adult reader  what I guess we are now calling the Millennials.  I lived through all the events she discusses, and, although I was not actively involved in the LGBTQ community until a decade after the Stonewall Riots (my first Gay Pride March was the 1979 Lavender Anniversary celebration in Atlanta, GA commemorating Stonewall) from that point on I was very much aware of and involved with the ongoing push for Gay Rights.  Bausum is accurate and clear in her discussion and explanation of the many events which occurred.  I can only wish, however, that because she gave some attention to the oppressiveness of many Christian denominations which initially contributed to refusing to acknowledge the human dignity of LGBT individuals, Bausum had also mentioned those pioneering individuals and denominations who went against the tide and  just as in the Civil Rights Movement  changed the consciences of so many.Bausums book was, of course, published before the Supreme Court decision supporting Marriage Equality, but she accurately predicted that such a decision was inevitable based on the changing attitude of the populace at large.The one thing that I really DIDNT know about the Stonewall event which Bausum clearly articulated was that the police raids that sparked the riot were NOT specifically motivated by police cruelty but rather by corruption.  She explains that the order to Close down the Gay Bars in NYC was prompted by the fact that those bars were Mafia controlled, and an elaborate extortion scheme with international ramifications had evolved by means of which closeted homosexuals in the financial sector of the city were blackmailed into stealing negotiable bonds.  The Mafia not only paid off local police to keep the bars open, but also used threats of exposure of these well-to-do closeted patrons to fuel the stolen-bond market.In all, as mentioned, this book is both timely and well-presented, and is a worthy addition to Ann Bausums already impressive array of titles relating to the major social justice issues in our nation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH16X7ZB48T65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670016799#wasThisHelpful","RH16X7ZB48T65","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fatal Trauma by Richard L. Mabry,M.D. is a fast-moving medical thriller in the Christian Fiction category.  As such, it avoids the usual thriller pitfalls of foul language and explicit sex and violence.  Because the author is himself a doctor, the terminology and descriptions of the hospital setting are accurate.The initial incident in the story sets the scene as a man bursts into the ER of the hospital in which Mark Baker, the protagonist, works.  The man is holding a gun to the head of Kelly Atkinson, one of the nurses at the hospital, with whom Mark is falling in love.  Kelly is pushing a wheelchair containing the bleeding body of the gunmans brother.  By the time the ensuing chaos is over, the gunman and a security guard are also dead, and Mark and Kelly (along with other hospital personnel) have become revenge targets for the Zeta drug cartel, to which the two dead gangsters belonged.The story has a satisfactory number suspicious situations that turn out to be innocent circumstances, while in other cases evil lurks in unexpected locations.  In addition, the theme of losing and rediscovering a relationship with God carries through the plot of the narrative in an interestingly coherent way.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book without finding it overly challenging.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U88YY81W7TVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1630881163#wasThisHelpful","R3U88YY81W7TVG","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As stated in several recent reviews, I have become thoroughly delighted with Abingdon Press.  I have read a number of novels put out by this publishing house, but now Ive encountered a memoir that I believe to be absolutely superlative, Hidden Inheritance by Heidi Neumark.  This book combines deeply touching personal sharing with incredibly relevant theological, psychological and sociological insights.The author is a Lutheran pastor with a specific ministry in New York City at a shelter for LGBT and other abused and neglected youth.  Very recently, her daughter Ana found information on the Internet indicating that their family had Jewish roots and that in fact, Heidis grandfather Moritz Neumark had actually been Moses Isaac Neumark, and he and his wife Ida had been sent to the Theresienstadt (Terezn) concentration camp, where he had died.  Heidis grandmother Ida survived and emigrated to Switzerland, but during the entirety of her subsequent life (she died in the mid-1960s), there was no discussion of the circumstances of their war-time experience, and indeed, as Heidi Neumark did subsequent research, she became convinced that in fact her father had perhaps not even shared the fact of his Jewish heritage with his wife.Obviously, coming as a bolt out of the blue this revelation of family history proved to be a life-changing experience for Neumark.  As she went more deeply into available archival information, and indeed traveled to Germany to retrace the circumstances of her familys losses during the Shoah, the author also meditated upon the role of her own Lutheran faith in dealing with these horrific events.  She weaves together her own experience of dealing with this hidden inheritance and the traumas experienced by many of the young people in the shelter where she ministers in NYC.  The result is a deeply moving and extremely cogent call to awareness.  As those people who experienced the depredations of the Nazis and the incredible tragedies of WWII are passing from the scene, it becomes ever more relevant that endeavors like this narrative be undertaken by caring and sensitive descendants.  The fact is that many people, like Neumarks father and grandmother, apparently preferred to put the tragedies as far behind them as possible, avoiding bitterness but also avoiding sharing the truth.  We need to take seriously the adage that those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it; but how can we learn if history is hidden from us?  This is why I believe that efforts such as the one Heidi Neumark so lovingly details in this memoir are of vital importance to all of us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EWUCG6NUMVM4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1630881244#wasThisHelpful","R2EWUCG6NUMVM4","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the major perks of being an Amazon Vine reviewer for me has been the opportunity to become acquainted with Abingdon Press.  I have found that virtually every book I have chosen from the Christian Books and Bibles section of Vine for All has been interesting, uplifting, and thoroughly enjoyable.  Conversations with Saint Bernard by Jim Kraus, however, exceeds in excellence.The basic plot is of course simple and straightforward.  George Gibson, still grieving the death of his wife, plans a cross-country trip as a valedictory.  Alex Burden, after a precarious childhood with repeated heart surgeries, seems on the mend until it turns out hes allergic to his beloved dog Lewis.  Through the intervention of Providence working through Georges daughter Tess and Alexs mother Trudy, it eventuates that Lewis becomes Georges traveling companion, but much more as well, during the time it takes for Alex to take desensitizing shots.  The dog is psychic, or perhaps an angel in disguise, and serves not only to bring George in contact with several people along the way that he needs to meet, but also insists that he confront and deal with the truth.The story is lively, amusing while of significance relevant to the issues it resolves, and develops the special character of Lewis without overplaying the anthropomorphism.  Other characters, as well as the under-girding theme of how prayer does (and doesnt) work make this a story well worth reading and sharing with loved ones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R196MWU40JPM64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426791607#wasThisHelpful","R196MWU40JPM64","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little lantern is attractive and simple, but not terribly sturdy.  Also, since it only comes with one of the repellent pads, long-term testing without re-ordering would be difficult.  I do not look up the ""suggested price"" of items before making an evaluation, so I can't say if the item would be ""worth the price"".  A plus value is that it included the requisite batteries, hence I could test it without having to supply those myself.  The light is dim, and this would not make it useful for actual visibility in the dark.

"My husband is the coffee drinker of our family; there was a time when I actually refused to brew the stuff, because I thought the one who drank it ought to fix it.  Also, since we do not entertain a great deal, it is easy to ""make do"" with a much smaller coffee maker.  However, there are times when a larger capacity is desired, and one of our biggest concerns was the speed of brewing.  So the first thing we tested was the time required to process the full 12-cup capacity.  This was quite acceptable, taking only about 15 minutes.  Obviously, a smaller amount of coffee, under 4 cups (the lowest calibration on the carafe), brewed even more rapidly.  However, it was a bit difficult to evaluate the amount of water input needed for this smaller amount.  To be honest, I have not put the full capability of the computer control functions to the test; I'm much more of the ""punch a button and wait til the little red light goes on"" type.  However, the instruction manual (in 3 languages) is easy to read and thorough.  I would not hesitate to recommend this coffee maker to anyone who wants to prepare coffee quickly for a medium-sized group of people or a large family.

"Now this is an item which really ""works"" for me!  It is light weight and very easily assembled, which matters a lot to this 76-year-old.  I have used Swiffer products before, and one of my main concerns has in fact been that unlike vacuum cleaners, they didn't ""pick up anything but dust"".  The trap on this device really does work, though.  Most important for me is the low profile and ability to go under my king-size bed.

"Melvin Urofsky's ""Dissent and the Supreme Court"" is a fascinating and extremely timely history.  For a person like me who has no law degree and only a passing awareness of the history and development of the intricacies of Constitutional Law, it offers a great deal of enlightenment in a very accessible form.  Since as a Vine reviewer I'm reading the ""uncorrected proof"" version which lacks page references to the notes and other technical information, I can't make an immediate evaluation of its effectiveness for the serious student.  However, from the quality of the writing I can say emphatically that this book is extremely detailed and supported by voluminous research.  I especially appreciated the numerous illustrations (which, fortunately, WERE included in this proof version).  These greatly enhance the charm of what might otherwise be too academic.Admitted, in this ""Google"" era, it would be possible to look up many of the background details that Urofsky presents; however, I believe that the author's skilled compilation of this information following the important theme of his discussion greatly enhances understanding and enjoyment.  This is not a book to be read casually, but rather one to be studied and savored, which is what I am doing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BX3XITLBS2LB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=030737940X#wasThisHelpful","R3BX3XITLBS2LB","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The memoir Here Comes the Sun: A Journey to Adoption in 8 Chakras by Leza Lowitz appealed to me on many levels.  First and foremost, as a story of adoption, it resonates thoroughly, because I have an adopted son.  Unlike Lowitz, we adopted not because I was infertile (wed already had four children) but to balance our family (we had three girls and a boy who desperately wanted a bro).  Also, in those pre Roe v. Wade days there were many available children in various difficult to place categories needing homes.  However, though the situation in Alabama, USA was not as tight in the late 1960s as it apparently is in Japan today, we did run into some serious road-blocks that made it easy to empathize with the challenges Leza Lowitz faced.Once I started reading, I found the thread of yoga practice and philosophy running through the story quite valuable.  I also meditate (though not in the yoga style) and am keenly aware of the importance of this type of centering practice, especially as it applies to weathering frustrations of life like those the author encountered in dealing with the difficulties of achieving motherhood, especially in the Japanese cultural milieu.A final fascinating aspect of this story is Lowitzs merging of her own Jewish background with the spiritual path of yoga and the description of her encounter with the hugging guru, Amma, of whom Id heard before and whose ministry intrigues me.In all, this book is honest, charming, beautifully written, informative, and extremely well-balanced.  I have no hesitation in giving it the highest rating possible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32CZU35O6Y9H0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611720214#wasThisHelpful","R32CZU35O6Y9H0","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Occasionally I think a bit of a fiat is needed in assisting the reader to place my reviews in the proper context.  That is certainly true in the case of Speaking in Bones by Kathy Reichs.  When I first accepted the invitation to participate in the Amazon Vine program, it was after Id reviewed several books at the authors request.  These were books that Id selected to read out of personal interest, and in general the writer making the request had not achieved best seller status.  Although having reached retirement age with a large accumulated library of old favorites I intend to re-read for pleasure, there are still certain favorite genres and authors whose new works I have felt motivated to select.  The Vine program has opened up my horizons, encouraging me to read books I might not otherwise have encountered.  However, when asked to review a best-selling author, I am frequently a bit stymied; if the writer already has a coterie of loyal fans, what is the point of gilding the lily?As it happens, Reichs Temperance Brennan novels had not previously become part of my library, although for the past several years the TV series Bones has been one of the few shows that Ive watched with anything like excitement.  In addition, a number of years ago (before my reviewing interest began), I read almost all of the Kay Scarpetta novels by Patricia Cornwell.  It is nearly impossible, therefore, to evaluate this book without mentally referencing these other series.  I have honestly tried, but I find that I would have far preferred to have NO mental image of Tempe Brennan working at the Jeffersonian along with her merry band; the woman in this novel may bear the same name, but there the resemblance comes to a screeching halt.The most thoroughly enjoyable part of this story for me was the turn of phrase that was part of Brennans narrated thought-processes.  The author has tremendous skill with clever analogy zingers that keep the mental peregrinations of her protagonist, as well as much of the dialog, lively and amusing.  The plot is acceptably convoluted, and the eventual resolution relatively plausible.  Certainly, given the fact that the author is herself a forensic anthropologist, one cant challenge the accuracy of the technical information she provides, so the book also has a great deal of educational value in that field.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10TDWAKGPVNPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345544048#wasThisHelpful","R10TDWAKGPVNPJ","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After a long spell of other types of narrative, this is my second Sci Fi book in a row.  However, it could scarcely be more different than The Empress Game (reviewed 6/14/15).  This book is high tech with all the action focused on the problems with the computer in a revolutionary-design secret starship, the Ananke.  The action takes place not in some imaginary space empire, but in our own Solar System, where, apparently, human habitation has extended to the various other planets and/or their moons as a result of terraforming.  However, it seems that these various colonies established in the extremely inhospitable environments thereby provided, are exploited and oppressed.  The System  meaning the central administrative government ruling these domed environments, is totalitarian in the extreme.A good part of the story revolves around the efforts of Althea, the computer tech who was largely responsible for the design of Ananke, to resolve the computer malfunctions resulting from the introduction of a virus by the two intruders, Gale and Ivanov, who break into the starship at the beginning of the story.  In addition, the three-person crew of the ship, after capturing Ivanov, is subsequently taken over by Ida Stays, the System investigator who comes aboard to interrogate Ivanov and to try to establish his connection with the terrorist group which is fomenting revolution.  Whatever part of the narrative does not involve fruitless efforts to fix the computer is made up of exhaustive (and exhausting) descriptions of this interrogation.None of the characters, with the possible exception of Althea and the Ananke hersef, even border on the appealing or sympathetic.  Of course, shades of HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey, it should surprise no one to know that Ananke becomes human, and indeed begins to consider herself a god.  Again, this story is the first of a series; the announced sequel, Supernova, will doubtless hinge on further adventures of Althea and Ananke, since most of the other characters (with the exception of Ivanov and Gale) have been eliminated. This is not a spoiler, by the way, since it is referenced early in the narrative.Im a bit doubtful about the scientific accuracy of much of this narrative, especially the plausibility of colonies on the outer planets and their moons, and did find the inclusion of all the interrogation aspects more than a bit tedious.  However, there are some intriguing aspects of the story, particularly the inclusion of the Laws of Thermodynamics as section headings.  All in all, it was compelling and interesting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6QKMTF4QRIZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553394428#wasThisHelpful","R6QKMTF4QRIZ1","AJSA2D3Y76NXN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJSA2D3Y76NXN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a neat little FM transmitter that has a lot of cool options.  I like that this is quite small and doesn't stick way out from my cigarette lighter like some others do.  The design is nice and I like the blue and black colors of it.  The front piece with all the controls pivots on the cigarette adapter part so that you can adjust this to face various angles.  There is a knob and buttons on the front that work the controls and allow you to answer calls.  This also comes with a remote which is a nice added feature so that even someone in the back seat can change songs and such when you are using this device.  This has many input options which is great.  It accepts wireless, but also can be used with micro SD cards, TF, and USB and aux cord which is included.  You can also use the USB to charge up to two devices at a time even while talking or listening to music.  I found this easy to pair with my phone and the sound quality on my end was great for both music and talking.  The downfall that forced me to give it four stars instead of five was the sound quality on the end of the person I am talking to.  The microphone could be better on this because the sound for the other person tends to be a bit muffled and not always easy to hear.  Otherwise this is a great device that is easy to use and works well.  I received this transmitter at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review but that does not affect my opinion of it at all.  This is a great little transmitter and I would definitely recommend it:)!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VKMROC3A4VJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012N3C6OY#wasThisHelpful","R2VKMROC3A4VJB","A2QRB1E06FAZFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QRB1E06FAZFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These little inhalers are perfect for use on the go because they are smaller than the average tube of lipstick and fit easily in your pocket or purse.  There are six inhalers in this set that include stress ease, insomnia relief, breathe easy, mood lift, zen, and inner peace.  Each is made up of various essential oils to achieve the particular effect desired.  I have been very congested lately because I struggle with seasonal allergies and sinus problems and I have found the breathe easy inhaler to be my new best friend.  It is mild, but helps to clear my nose when I am feeling stuffy.  I love that it is all natural and I don't have to worry about breathing in any drugs or chemical.  These are super easy to use.  You simply remove the cover and place this by your nose and breathe in.  All of the great benefits of the included essential oils go to work right away.  This set has a nice variety and also comes in a really nice gift box making it great to give as a gift.  I would defiantly caution you to buy two though if you plan to gift these because you won't want to let them go once you get them:)  I received this set of essential oil inhalers at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review but that does not affect my opinion of them at all.

"I think that essential oil diffuser necklaces were a brilliant invention.  What better way to enjoy the benefits of your essential oils for a person constantly on the go.  I use my regular humidifier diffusers when I am at home and working at my computer but for many people, sitting in one place for a period of time during the day is not possible.  Many people have active, on the go lifestyles and I think this necklace is the perfect solution for those people.  Not only does it make a great fashion statement with the Aum design and classic black cord, but it smells amazing and allows you to benefit from whatever oil you choose all day long.  This comes with five little cotton disks that you can put your oil on and it opens like a regular photo locket.  You simply put the cotton disk inside and close it back up and you are breathing the oils benefits in no time.  This is also a great alternative to perfume.  I can be very sensitive when things are applied directly to my skin.  With my essential oils, I can still smell great without applying perfume each day.  This comes with a small bottle of inner peace oil which is a blend of orange, clove, germanium, lavender, and patchouli.  It has a light, relaxing scent that I really like.  This necklace comes in a metal canister case with a clear top and I feel it just adds to the great quality of this product and makes it great for gifting, but I would suggest buying two because you will want to keep one for yourself:)  I received this essential oil diffuser necklace set at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review but that does not affect my opinion of it at all.

"These are super cute little storage containers but they definitely are small so keep that in mind when purchasing them depending on your needs for them.  The listing mentions earphones and SD cards but neither will actually fit in these and that is why I gave them four stars instead of five.  I felt that the listing was a bit deceiving due to the wording.  That being said these are very cute and well made and do work great for other things.  They snap together snugly and are a nice heavy plastic material.  They would be great to keep a few tylenol or other pills in to take in your purse or tote bag.  I plan to use them for my daughter's earrings.  She does several sports that don't allow her to wear earrings for competition and she never seems to remember to take them out ahead of time.  We usually arrive at the event and she asks me to take her earrings for her.  I never have any good place to put them and they are kind of small to just stick in my pocket so these little cases will be perfect.

I am always yelling at him because he has a big truck and intentionally takes up four parking spaces when he goes somewhere so that nobody parks too close to him.  These come in different versions and the one I got has a donkey on it and says, ""See this Jackass?  Even he can park better than you can!""  These come in a sticky pad just like post it notes and you just peel them off and stick them to your subject's window or door.

"Nothing that you buy at the store in a jug compares to fresh squeezed juice straight from the fruit.  It not only tastes great, but it's great for you.  This juicer is awesome and perfect for achieving just that.  First off, I love the look of this juicer.  It is stainless and black in color and looks really impressive when setup on my counter.  And although, looks can sometimes be deceiving, this juicer works as great as it looks.  It has a powerful motor and sharp blade that juices harder items such as carrots with ease.  I like that this has an overheat protection built in so this will shutoff to protect the motor if it starts to get too warm while working.  This is very easy to use and works wonderfully.  Cleanup is definitely not the fun part.  This like most juicers I have seen does take a little more work to cleanup that it does to make the juice.  That being said I love that this juicer includes a nice cleaning brush making it much easier to get the excess pulp cleaned from the juicer.  I was also impressed that I received an email with detailed instructions to get the most from the juicer.  I told the best way to juice various items and gave helpful tips.

There is a large zippered compartment which also has an inner separating pocket.  There is a smaller zippered pocket on the front perfect for a cell phone or wallet and there is an elastic water bottle pocket on the side.

"This is the nicest set of styluses that I have ever gotten.  This is a set of four and they come in pink, purple, blue, and black.  The body of the stylus is made from stainless steel and aluminum so they are very solid feeling.  They have a clip on the side just like most pens that allows you to attach them to your pocket or a notebook.  The tips are interchangeable when they start to wear out and the set comes with four spare tips.  I have to be honest that when I received these I was a bit nervous about them.  The tip feels like a metal mesh and I was concerned it would scratch my screen.  I took the plunge and tried it and it ran across my screen as smooth as butter.  It is very high-sensitive and works great on both my phone and tablet screens.  Another thing I love about these styluses is that they have a small loop on the bottom end and included with the set are two short connector cables and two longer ones.  What I mean by connector cables is that they have the plugs that hook into your phone's headphone jack and on the other end the long ones have a small keyring type loop that can hook to the stylus loop.  The shorter ones have a lobster claw closure to attach to the stylus.  This is a great way to keep your stylus with your tablet or phone at all times.

"This monokini tassel bikini is not for the faint of heart.  If you have any body image issues then this is not for you because it is definitely revealing and meant to be a sexy item.  I think the design definitely succeeded in the sexy department and it is very well made and put together.  The material is silky feeling and stretchy and very comfortable the wear.  My problem is that it is not made for anyone with large breasts.  It has foam inserts in the cup areas which can be removed but there is not near enough material to cover and support large breast either with or without the foam cups.  I have a DDD breast and while the rest of the suit fit me like a glove, there was no way that my breasts were staying in this suit.  I don't see this as much of a design flaw because I am aware that most women who order this size will have smaller breasts that will most likely fit the suit just fine and so I didn't dock it a star for this, but I would definitely caution you to be aware of this when ordering.  Overall, I love the swimsuit and was sad that it will not work for my body type.  The design is very nice and definitely an eye catcher in the sexy department.  I received this swimsuit at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review but that does not affect my opinion of it at all.  This is a nice suit and I would definitely recommend it:)!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FRKRKP21V5BI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JP0ADQ2#wasThisHelpful","R3FRKRKP21V5BI","A2QRB1E06FAZFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QRB1E06FAZFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This glowing eye owl is super cool.  It is over a foot tall and very realistic looking for a plastic owl.  This is recommended for use in scaring away other small animals but I like it just a cool looking decoration as well.  It comes with mounting hardware so you can mount it to a pole or elsewhere deepening on your desired use.  I set it on the top step of my porch and love how its eyes glow at night.  It charges with the sun daily so you have to make sure you put it where it will get enough sun each day for charging so that it continues to glow at night.  As a prank, I put it just inside our bushes a couple of nights ago and totally freaked my kids out when they saw the glowing eyes in the bush.  It was pretty funny and my husband and I couldn't stop laughing.  I really like this owl and he is a great new addition to my porch.

"This is a great towel for yoga or any other exercise that causes you to break a sweat.  It is super soft and absorbent and I like to use it for toweling off my face and neck during and after my yoga class.  This towel is machine washable and dryer friendly as well which makes it super easy to clean and have ready for your next workout.  I really love that there is a zippered pouch on it also.  I put my keys and phone in it to keep them safe and out of sight at the yoga studio during my workout.  This is definitely one of my favorite yoga towels.

"I really like this leopard print mat.  It is very soft and plush and feels great on bare feet.  It is also very fashionable and fun.  My daughter's room has hard wood floors and I actually decided to put this right next to her bed just to add a little something to her room.  It is great to add a pop of fashion and color, but it also gives her something soft and warm to step on when she gets out of bed in the morning.  This is just what I wanted for her room because especially in the winter her floors sometimes get chilly and this fits perfectly beside her bed to catch her little toes when she first gets up in the morning.  I also love the non-skid backing so it stays right in place on her floor.  She loves it and loves the leopard pattern as well.  This mat could be used in so many different ways including as a bath mat for next to your tub.  It is very well made and versatile in its design.

"What I love most about this leather conditioner is that it isn't oily like so many others I have tried.  It leaves the leather feeling soft without that oily residue that so many others have.  I do wish it had a nice after smell but that being said it doesn't have a bad smell either so I can live with that part.  I love that it comes with a nice sponge applicator to easily apply it to any sized surface.  I used this on my leather boots and my leather handbag and was pleased with the results on both.  I like that this helps to protect my leather when I go outside in the rain or snow as well because it helps to make the items water repellent.  My handbag is old and has been starting to show some wear and age and I really felt like this leather conditioner restored some of its old life back to it.  My boots are newer but it still gave them an added shine that they didn't have before.  I have been impressed with the long term affect of this product also.  The shine on both my boots and handbag is still looking freshly conditioned after more than a week.  This product has my respect and works like it says it will.  I received this leather conditioner at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review but that does not affect my opinion of it at all.

"I am really impressed with this leather cleaner from leather nova.  It comes in a spray bottle making it super easy to apply and use and is a generous size bottle as well with a full eighteen ounces.  Included with your purchase is a microfiber towel that is the perfect companion to this cleaner.  You simply spray the cleaner on your towel and massage it into the leather to loosen dirty and grime.  This helps lift the dirt to the surface and then you can use a clean, dry cloth to wipe it away.  The bottle suggests waiting a couple of minutes for tougher stains before wiping them away.  We just purchased a new SUV.  It is new to us but is a used vehicle and the previous owners clearly had children and very messy children at that.  They didn't take very good care of the leather seats and although the dealership cleaned it before we bought it, they didn't do a great job.  I took this leather cleaner and went to work on the spots that were still noticeable to me and was very impressed with the difference.  I was able to get the seats looking almost new again and I really love that there are no harsh chemicals and smells in this.  I am quite sensitive to harsh smells and didn't find this to be bothersome when using it.

"I absolutely love everything about these solar LED string lights.  The first thing that I noticed that I think is an awesome feature is that the flower blossoms are a rubbery material.  This is genius.  Every other set of lights like these that I have owned, the flower part is a rigid plastic and a few flowers always end up breaking with normal use.  These are so much better and I feel will hold up a great deal longer due to this fact.  The lights themselves are beautiful.  They have a light blue tint to them and there are several lighting options.  They have a solar panel that also has the control buttons on it which are super easy to use.  There is an on/off button and a mode button.  You simply press them to use them.  With the lights on, you can switch modes and there are several to choose from.  You can have them on constant, twinkling, or several different flashing/blinking options.  These lights are really pretty and in my opinion an exceptional quality.

"This is a nice large package of privacy fence screen and the quality is excellent in my opinion.  It is a thin, tarp like material that even includes grommets for easy attachment to your fence.  This is black but the woven material is great for allowing air to still pass through.  We actually decided to use some of this on our outdoor dog kennel to help provide a bit of shade to our dog on the east side of his pen.  It still allows for air to pass in so he can benefit from the breeze in the summer but keeps some of the bright sun out.  This is thick enough that it definitely does provide a privacy barrier as well.  When our dog is next to it in his kennel, you can barely see him on the other side.  This would be great if you live in a neighborhood with relatively close neighbors and want to keep them out of your backyard business.

"I love that this bluetooth hands free speaker hooks to your visor.  I have had several of these and I like the visor location the best.  That being said, the one problem I have with this is the volume and that is why I gave it four stars instead of five.  The volume option needs to be louder.  I sometimes find it hard to hear when I am driving.  When I am able to hear it well though, this is a great little device.  It paired easily with my phone and the buttons are nice and large and easy to use for the functions.  I like the size of this overall and it fits my visor nicely.

"If you are looking for lightweight and compact then look no further because this is definitely the backpack for you.  This backpack comes zipped up as a small pouch.  You unzip the pouch and turn it inside out and you have a backpack.  The pouch it comes in is part of it and then becomes an internal zippered pouch within the backpack.  This is awesome because when you are not using this backpack it is a great way to store it and it takes of barely any room at all.  The backpack itself is waterproof and made of a material that is tear resistant as well making it great for hiking or outdoor activities.  The backpack while being able to be folded up so compact is actually quite roomy when opened up and can hold a change of clothes or small towel as well as small necessities like keys or a wallet.  There are pouches on the sides for holding water bottles also.  The straps are comfortable and adjustable for an easy fit.

"This is a great bluetooth wireless mouse that is super easy to setup and use.  This mouse takes one ""AA"" battery that is not included.  You simply install the battery in the bottom of the mouse and turn on the small on/off switch located near the battery compartment.  Make sure that your bluetooth settings on your computer are on to detect devices.  Press the connect button on the bottom of the mouse for a couple of second to let your computer detect your mouse.

"This is a nice yoga mat for the price if you just want something lightweight to put between you and the floor when exercising.  I only gave it four stars because it is quite thin and not a mat I would get for everyday workouts.  If you are going to be using it randomly from time to time and just want something to add a barrier between you and the floor then this is a decent mat for the price.  If you are a hard core yoga fanatic, I would spend more money and go with something more durable and thicker to give a more comfortable surface that will also last longer.

"This is a great set of silicone wedding rings.  They are solid black and each come in a small hinged plastic box which is great for storage or gifting.  The top of the box is clear so you can see the ring through the lid.

"This is a really fun set of flying helicopter balloons.  They are super simple to assemble and loads of fun for kids.  This set comes with paint to paint the propellers so that your kids can make them unique and their own.  My kids love to paint and decorate so this part was super fun for them.  Once you have them painted and the paint is dry which will only take an hour or so, you can assemble them and play with them.  I would suggest playing outside with them because they don't always fly straight and sometimes go quite high so they could definitely knock small items off of shelves and things like that inside the house.  Each helicopter is separated into its own bag with all of the pieces you need for that helicopter which makes it really easy to put them together.  The set is enough to make six helicopters and these would be a great party favor at a birthday party or a craft to do at the party.

The stand of lights is nice also and each bulb is LED for a higher quality and nice bright light.

"This Quadcore home electronic pest repeller is pretty awesome and has a lot of different uses.  I have purchased similar devices in the past but with much less options available in one unit.  This plugs right into a standard outlet for ease of use and has on/off control switches on the sides for each feature making it easy to turn on whatever features you want active and shut off any that you don't want.  There are four different options for pest control all built into this one little device.  There is the ultrasonic repelling which sends out a high frequency sound to repel insects and rodents.  What I like best about this is that it doesn't seem to bother my dogs at all because I was worried that it might.  There is also a switch to reduce mosquitos.  A third switch is electromagnetic and helps to repel pests that may be deep in your walls.  Lastly there is an air clean switch which puts negative charges into the air to help repel pests.  My biggest concern is spiders and we have also had a few mice get into the house from the garage so I turned on all of the switches except the mosquito switch and so far I have to say that I have seen less spiders in the living room where this is plugged in.  We also have not caught a mouse in the standard mouse trap in almost a week so this does seem to be making a difference.

There is plenty of room for my keys, phone, money, and meds as well as some small snacks or other items.  It has reflective pieces on it as well to add a safety feature while I am on the road so I can be seen more easily.  The waist strap is comfortable and adjustable and has a durable buckle to open and close it around your waist.  There is a thick foam type piece that backs the entire waist pack and goes against your body when you wear it.  There are vent holes in it and it helps to wick away moisture as you walk, run, or hike and keeps the sweat from building up between you and the waist pack.  This is a really nice feature.

"One thing I really love about this speaker is its size.  I have other waterproof speakers and they are much smaller than this one.  I like that this one is large and has big buttons and a digital display as well.  My other speakers don't have a display and I think that is a huge bonus in this one.  It has three large suction cups on the back making it very easy to mount securely to your wall or mirror for use without concern of it falling or sliding once in place.  To get started with this speaker it needs to be charged which can be done with the included standard USB charging cable.  Then you pair it to your device by way of your bluetooth menu.  Once paired you can play music from your device or receive calls using this speaker as a hands free device.  There is a built in microphone and an easy push button answering feature.  This is so handy because I can't even recall the number of times that I no sooner get into the shower and my phone rings.  Now I can answer it without reaching out soak and wet and worrying about drowning my phone in the process.  I also love to listen to music while I shower or have a nice bubble bath and this is a perfect way to do that without worrying about it getting wet.

"I am very sentimental and find myself keeping quite a few pieces of my childrens' clothing as they outgrow it on the chance that they may want it for their kids one day.  I put these items into storage tubs in our attic but I am finding the tubs filling up quickly.  These space saver vacuum bags are a great solution to this problem.  This is a very large set of fifteen bags so I was able to reduce the space needed in the tubs quite significantly by packing the items first into these storage bags.  This also helps ensure that they are staying clean and moisture free while in storage and nothing is able to get into them.  What I really love most about this bag is that it comes with its own manual pump which most other bags likes these that I have seen do not.  The set includes various sized bags to meet all of your storage needs.  It comes with one jumbo bag, three extra large bags, four large bags, four medium bags, two suit case roll up bags, and one small roll up bag.  These bags have a slider to close the top of the bag and a cap where you suck the air out on the side.  These are very easy to use and work great.  I received these vacuum storage bags at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review but that does not affect my opinion of them at all.  This is a great set of storage bags and I would absolutely recommend them:)!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EX570216F5MD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012KI8M22#wasThisHelpful","R1EX570216F5MD","A2QRB1E06FAZFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QRB1E06FAZFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really beautiful bbq tool set that is not only practical but looks great too.  It comes in a stainless case with a nice solid handle and two latches on the front that keep it closed.  It is a nice, heavy-duty case that not only looks impressive, but also is great for storing and protecting all of the grill tools.  This set includes a nice wide faced spatula that is great for flipping meats and also has a serrated edge that allows you to cut with it as well.  There is even a built in bottle opener for the griller who likes to enjoy a cold beverage while grilling up a great meal.  The set also includes tongs, a grill brush with extra cleaning head, basting brush, and even two skewers, and four pairs of corn holders.  I have never seen a grilling set that even included corn holders so I thought that was pretty awesome.  Each piece is stainless and built to last.  Most corn holders I have owned in the past had plastic handles and often cracked after several uses.  These are very rugged and the little points are very sharp and stick into the corn cob nicely.  This set would make a really great gift for the grill lover in your life and is quite an impressive presentation in its fancy case.  I received this grilling tool set at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review but that does not affect my opinion of it at all.

"These packing cubes are awesome and make packing so much easier.  I really like having things organized in my suitcase when I travel because it makes finding what I need so much easier when I get to my hotel room.  I often live out of my suitcase on vacation instead of unpacking everything and using the hotel dresser.  These cubes help to keep my clothing items separate and easy to find.  I use the smaller one for socks and undergarments and the other two to separate other pieces of clothing depending on what it is that I pack.  These are well made and nice sized packing cubes.  The zippers zip all the way around both sides so you can flip the top all the way back and have them wide open making them super easy to pack and use.  The zippers work great and close nicely but also move easily and don't catch.  The material of these packing cubes is durable but lightweight and they are a very nice quality.

"I can't say enough about how much I love this eye mask.  It is a bad time of year for me because I suffer from extreme allergies and I get severe sinus headaches and make it hard for me to even keep my eyes open without intense pain.  I had a bad allergy attack yesterday and my head felt like it was going to explode.  The pain was almost unbearable and then I remembered this eye mask.  I usually use my various compresses for cold therapy and had almost forgotten that this can also be used warm.  I stuck it in the microwave for thirty seconds and pulled it out and slipped it into the super soft zippered cover.  I then placed it over my eyes and forehead and put the strap around my head.  I couldn't believe how much the warm helped to relieve some of the pain and pressure on my sinuses.  It is not a miracle cure by any means but definitely made a big difference in my comfort level.  I laid down on the couch and just let the warm soothe my sinuses and was actually able to finally relax a bit.  The soft cover is so comfortable to use and it gently hugged my face without being too tight or uncomfortable but with the just the right amount of pressure.  I received this eye mask at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review but that does not affect my opinion of it at all.

"I was quite impressed when I received this microphone.  You really can't beat all that you get for the price.  It came in a nice reusable box that has a little tab that keeps it closed and nicely stores all the parts when they aren't being used.  The front of the box is a clear plastic so you can see what is inside without opening it and I think this would also make a great presentation for giving this as a gift to anyone who likes to sing.  The box includes the microphone itself, the wireless receiver, the antenna that attaches to the microphone, batteries, and also a cord for using it wired.  This is super easy to use.  You unscrew the base of the mic and install a battery and open the cover of the receiver and install a battery.  When using this wirelessly you plug the antenna into the end of the mic and plug the receiver into your stereo.  For wired use you plug the cord into the mic instead of the antenna and plug the other end into your stereo.  The button to turn on the mic is on the side and has two settings depending on if you are using wired or wireless.  I found the sound to be great and the reception to work very well.

"This is an awesome little FM transmitter that even comes with a remote.  This is so simple to use and works exceptionally well.  I have tried some of these in the past that pick up a lot of interference and you have to have a very dead station to get them to work, but this one was not that way at all.  It is a powerful little transmitter that actually worked on a station that I could hear some faint music on.  I paired it with my phone and was easily able to play the music through the speakers in my car with no interference from the station itself.  I love that the transmitter part can be removed from the part that plugs into the cigarette lighter.  It is magnetic and attaches firmly but is also easily removed it you want to use it without it being attached.  The part that plugs into the cigarette lighter has a USB port so that you can easily charge your device while using it with its standard USB charing cord.  Aside from playing music this can also be used for hands free calling.  This device is fairly compact too which is nice because it isn't bulky and in the way when being used.  I think that this works exceptionally well and is a nice design that is very well made.

"This is a nice little MP3/MP4 player at a very reasonable price.  This comes with a charging cord, ear buds, and even a wrist strap to attach and carry it with.  It's gold in color and comparable in size to an Apple iPod nano.  It has 8GB of internal storage and a memory card slot allowing you to expand the storage with up to 64 more GB.  This is small and lightweight and great for on the go.  You can also watch video on it.  It has an alarm and you can even record voice with the built in microphone.  There is an external speaker or you can listen with the included ear buds.  It can also be hooked up to external speakers with an aux cable.

"I got an embroidery machine last Christmas and have found that these tear away backings are actually somewhat hard to find in any of my local stores.  Even our local walmart doesn't carry these and so I have found that ordering them on line is the best way to get them quickly when I need them.  What I love about these is that they are pre-cut 8""x8"" squares.  A lot of what I have ordered the past is big bolts of it and needs to be cut down.  These are much easier to work with and are a great size for most projects I would want to do.  This set includes one hundred sheets so they last me for quite some time and are much cheaper than others I have ordered in the past.  The quality and thickness is perfect and I find that they are durable but also easy to tear away when I am done embroidering.

"This is a nice set of silicone wedding rings for men.  The set includes size 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 which is nice because if your weight fluctuates or your hands swell at all which many people deal with, you can just switch sizes as you need to.  Each ring comes in a nice little plastic hinged box which is also great for gifting or storing the rings.  The rings are solid black and a nice thick silicone that is durable but designed to break to protect your finger when needed.  These rings are great for guys who work with their hands or do a lot of outdoor activities.  If the ring snags on something it will break before injuring your finger.  This allows men to keep their hands safe but still display a ring showing they are married.  This set also came with a bonus massage ball which is nice and hard with little nubs all over it and feels great for massages.

"This organizer is awesome!! I crochet and order so much yarn it's ridiculous! I also start several projects, so I wanted something that would hold yarn for one or two projects and not have yarn all over the house.This is perfect. I am doing a project that calls for 4 yarns and it hold them nicely <I put 4 Red Heart Super Saver yarns inside, and they're pretty big>...the inside has a 4 way separator so your yarn doesn't get tangled. There are 4 holes on the top where your yarn comes out. There's metal grommets so your yarn also doesn't snag. And a handle so you can easily pick it up and carry with you.You can put 4 big skeins inside or you can put small ones...I did put 4 smaller skeins in one compartment <16 in all> and that yarn was safe until I needed to use the organizer.

"My husband & I started drinking coffee recently. One particular brand comes in vacuum sealed bags - but only in 8 ounce bags, so I order several at a time. I wanted something that would hold more then 2 bags because the bags take up a lot of cabinet space.I ordered the Cobalt first and the canister hold a ton of the coffee beans I have. I ordered 2 of the Rose ones for the ground coffee and for my Tea. This canister holds over 45 bags of my Tea...that's the amount I had and there's still room for more!! So far in the 2nd one I put 2 and a half bags of our ground coffee and it's perfect!The cap works just fine. If you don't push the ""button"" on the top side, you can't really push the cap on, nor does it come off.

"I have bought all kinds of Downy products and had stopped for a while because it's one of the priciest laundry products out there. I decided to give it another try with Downy Infusion because I liked to sound of the scents, and the price didn't seem to bad for the size of the bottle.Well, I'm a whole lot disappointed. I actually ordered 2 different scents, and the other bottle had tape around the cap so it didn't open during shipping and it was in a bag. This bottle only had a bag and the cap was almost off. It would have been a HUGE mess, but the actual softener never left the bottle. Why?The softener was the consistency of peanut butter and pudding. Seriously. To get this out of the bottle, I had to turn it upside down and pound the bottom of the bottle. I got a blob in my new washing machine and did a load of towels. When I opened my machine, not only was the blob of Downy was still there, but some of it came out and blobbed onto a towel. I put the towels through a rinse just to get the blobs to go away, and it didn't work so I had to hand rinse them.As far as the scent goes, it didn't have any.I can only hope that this is a bad bottle. The other scent that I bought is fine, even though that one has bad reviews for the same issue I have with this scent, so I don't know what to think.I can't honestly recommend this product that I can't use and had to throw away.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XF1U7B92SMDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008UQVEQU#wasThisHelpful","R2XF1U7B92SMDO","A158CH42BGFN68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A158CH42BGFN68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband and I ride our Harley at least once a week, and my hair is very long <down to my waist>. I'm always looking for cool ways to keep my hair protected, and keep it from getting knots in it. If you've ever ridden a bike and have tried to brush your hair afterwards - you know all about those knots!I have purchased a lot of these ! I like variety! I've purchased the really expensive ones and these cheaper ones. I have found NO difference in them. They're all light weight, they're all stretchy. They keep your head cool if you wear a helmet, which I do. I live in Central Texas where the past 3 summers have been unbelievably hot - 100 plus degrees every single day for almost 3 months. My head usually sweats so bad under my helmet that my hair is matted to my head....but using these headscarves my head doesn't sweat nearly as much. Not to mention that because these are long, they keep my hair knot free.I don't know about keeping your head warm because we haven't had cool/cold weather yet....but I will update once that happens.Honestly...this is just as good as the pricey head scarves.

"My Grandmother left me her entire Silver Set when she passed and I've done OK keeping it clean, but since we moved to Texas I guess the humidity has not been good for it because after 8 months it is all black...and I mean SO darn black. This set actually belonged to my Great Grandmother and is over 120 years old. It's gorgeous! I actually had to wash it first and that took some of the black off. There are several pieces to this set that have extremely intricate detail and nothing I do ever gets it super clean. I decided to get this brush to help get into those places.When I got this brush I thought - There's NO way this soft brush is going to do anything to my silver. Boy was I wrong!!! I put some cleaner on the brush and then started to clean the silver. I used it on one of the serving dishes that has this ""Grape & Vine"" design around the outer 3 inches of the plate, and then I rinsed it in warm water. I was AMAZED at just how clean the silver plate is!! It looks awesome. <My mother won't have a heart attack now if she were to see it!!> This plate is one of the oldest pieces so I know I won't ever get it 100% clean, but I know that would decrease the value...so I'm OK with that. The black that is around the design actually enhances the beauty ~ I think!When I was finished, I cleaned the brush with Dawn and warm water and it's ready for the next cleaning. I did notice a couple of hairs came out, but I attribute that to the hair getting stuck in the really intricate parts of the silver - so it was expected. But only a few hairs came out...the brush is still in great condition.Would I recommend this brush? ABSOLUTELY! If it can get my silver as clean as it did - you won' be disappointed! I cleaned the entire set - which took me 2 weeks <yes I have many pieces>, and it looks beautiful! I even cleaned some of my silver jewelry and it got into places I couldn't get and made it look brand new.I'll be buying more so I'm never without this brush!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GFAKX2KRJVG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001VEA6MG#wasThisHelpful","R3GFAKX2KRJVG4","A158CH42BGFN68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A158CH42BGFN68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It stays put - no coming off in the wind...which is another plus for me. I've had lots of traditional bandanas fly off in the wind. I also like that this wicks moisture away from my head while wearing it...no sweaty head on hot days and also - it keeps the warmth in on cooler days. AND I love that I can wear it many different ways.I've washed this 2 times and it remains in the same excellent condition as I got it in.If you ride a bike and are looking for something to protect your hair - this is THE hair sock to get - and at a great price too! <Harley dealers charge $25 for theirs!>I would definitely recommend this!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z1ZLONQ2T46E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMEVCCM#wasThisHelpful","R1Z1ZLONQ2T46E","A158CH42BGFN68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A158CH42BGFN68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started knitting/crocheting last year and have tried quite a few things to keep my hooks/needles, looms, etc.in, plus something I could put yarn or fabric in so when I'm working the yarn isn't rolling around on the floor. I bought a yarn jug and it works fine but the one thing I don't like about it is it constantly falls over.I received this caddy a few days ago and it is absolutely perfect. It has 3 pockets in the front for me to store anything I want...scissors, hooks...whatever...but the inside is what makes me happy! It has a slippery fabric in the inside so when my yarn or fabric is in there....it just rolls right out. No snags...I'm currently making a couple of rag rugs and my balls of fabric are quite large...at least 8 to 10 inches around, and they fit just fine inside with room to spare. I have a couple of pouches that have hooks on them, and I've got a bunch of tools in them, and the hooks fit nicely around the wood at each end, and they don't interfere with my fabric/yarn when I'm working.I saw somebody say this was flimsy, but in my opinion it's pretty sturdy. I have a lot of supplies etc in mine and it is in no way flimsy....it's very strong. As long as I take good care of it, it should last me a long time.

We have a Garden Jacuzzi that has 6 jets, but the jets stopped working about 4 years ago...so it's just a tub now. The jets in our tub used to do wonders for me. I would sit in it for 20 minutes every day, and it helped me move easier and decreased my pain.I don't know how I found this, but when I saw it, read the description and saw the price - I had to give it a try, so I ordered it.My husband and I set it up, which took all of abut 10 minutes. It blows up easy, and fast. We were able to fill this in just over 30 minutes or so. It really didn't take that long. I had also ordered all the chemicals I thought I would need and they got here the day before the Hot Tub..so I put everything in and we waited until after supper to get in it. I should say we put it out on our back porch, so it sat in the sun for about 7 hours. I live in Central Texas where the temperature has been over 100 degrees every day for 2 weeks now, so the water was 101 degrees, without even turning the heater on.We both got in the hot tub, and filling the water to the bottom fill line was perfect. The water comes up to our necks when we are both sitting. We turned on the bubbles, and let me tell you what....I wasn't expecting what we got. I was leaning my back on the wall of the hot tub and when the bubbles got turned on...they actually pushed me off the wall. The bubbles in my hot tub are STRONG. This Hot tub is BETTER then my bathtub jacuzzi. No...the bubbles aren't like jets in a jacuzzi...targeting your back or legs.....the ring for the bubbles goes 3/4 of the way around the pool and the holes for the bubbles are at the bottom...so the bubbles rise up. But honestly....this is absolutely PERFECT.Now I can put on my bathing suit and sit in the Hot Tub, with my husband, comfortably and when I get out I feel amazing. If I could post a video so you could see these bubbles - I would..I only know how to do photos.When we did turn on the heater...it only took a few hours to heat all the way to 104. But living where I do - I haven't had to do that in 2 weeks because the sun and heat has heated the water all by itself...and the temperature always reads 104, but we think the water is much hotter. We got it in yesterday, which was the hottest day so far and we actually had to go down slowly....the water was HOT hot hot.It took us a few tries to figure out what chemicals to add and when, but so far the water is clear, doesn't stink and checks out perfect on the test strips. We haven't had to empty and refill yet.I purchased a few repair kits just in case....but haven't had to use yet. And we haven't had to blow the pool up or the cover...they're both still blown up the same as when we first did it.All in all...this is the PERFECT Hot Tub for my husband and I. The price was right and we don't regret this purchase at all. If anything happens to this one - I would come right back and buy another one...maybe even the bigger one!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GL9FAZRQ25BY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HRT863U#wasThisHelpful","R2GL9FAZRQ25BY","A158CH42BGFN68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A158CH42BGFN68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Absolutely PERFECT!I have a ""Plum Crazy"" 2007 Dodge Daytona Charger with Black Interior. I had my windows tinted as dark as the law would allow. I live in Central Texas, where the past few summers, including this summer where the temperature has been over 100 every single day for weeks. The heat index is around 105 to 107. It is HOT!When I get in my car, it is so hot I can't breathe. We roll all the windows down, turn on the air and not only does it take minutes to cool off, but the seats are so hot <yep - leather> they burn your booty. Not to mention making fried sausages out of your fingers on the steering wheel.I saw this sun protector and purchased it immediately. With all the great reviews how could I not?!This fits my windshield like a glove. Truly, it's like it was made for my car. There's no excess, it's not too small <at all>...it's *Perfect*!It was 109 today with a heat index of 116. I had to go to a doctor appointment and was almost excited to get in my car. I was able to open up the car, get in without the use of my rescue inhaler, sit on my seats without burning the buns,  turn the car on and the air...no burned fingers/hands!! It took about a minute for the air to cool it off the rest of the way - and I was on my way.It stores nicely when not in use..and is as light as a feather.SO ~ I would not only HIGHLY recommend this sun protector to anyone looking to cut down the heat in their car, but I wouldn't hesitate to purchase more. In fact I'm getting one for my husband for his new truck.I'm THRILLED with this purchase!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EJGGUIHLP7ZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GSAUHB8#wasThisHelpful","R3EJGGUIHLP7ZK","A158CH42BGFN68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A158CH42BGFN68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered this gum from another online vendor and got a 1 pound bag, and not only do my husband and I love it, that little bag was gone i a week!!! So I came to Amazon to see if anyone sold it, and thankfully I found a few!I ordered several items from The Candy Peddler and they're fantastic! everything got here on time and perfect. This gum is awesome - my husband and I usually can't eat just 1 or 2...we grab handfuls! But - after 2 we need a little break because the hot cinnamon flavor gets really hot and spicy! I could say the flavor doesn't last long, but here's the thing - the initial hot and spicy flavor burst you get when you first start chewing last for a short while, but you still get cinnamon flavor after that, and for a while. It's worth it!I will be buying more from this seller soon!

"I LOVE my new Ottomon!!Need Storage?? This holds a TON of stuff...I currently have somewhere in the vicinity of 50 skeins of yarn and a few other items. This is well made, heavy, and is durable enough to sit on. My husband has sat on it and he's 250. It does have some weight to it, but it's not so heavy that I can't move it <I broke my back and neck and can't lift much> empty or filled, and it is filled to the top. It goes together fast with no tools required. You just fold it up, place the divider and put the top on. Simple. I love the amount of storage this Ottomon holds and it looks great in my living room.

"I've been looking for a blue wedge for a while now, and thought this boot would be perfect.The quality of the shoe is great - well made. As soon as I tried one on, I knew they would be shipped back. I wear a 6.5 but for some reason this boot was too small. I couldn't get my foot all the way in, and I didn't have on socks.  I also felt the heel was a bit taller....it says 4.25"" heel but felt taller.This is the first return I've made with Amazon in my 8 years of being an Amazon customer. It was very easy to do the return, they got it within a 3 days, and my refund was made the day I requested a refundAll in all, the shoe is well made and beautiful, and despite the fact the show was too small, I would purchase from this seller again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REWX22MDZS0DC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K1EAQNG#wasThisHelpful","REWX22MDZS0DC","A158CH42BGFN68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A158CH42BGFN68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since you can't make more then 1 review on a product, I have added a 2nd review of this pillow below my first. I didn't buy it for me but for my husband who has Sleep Apnea...First a little info about why I purchased this pillow for myself.I am a Disabled Veteran. I broke my neck and back while on active duty. I also have severe Fibromyalgia and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Since I broke my neck & back, I have ad 44 surgeries. 5 of those surgeries have been on my neck, and I am fused at C4/5, C5/6 and C6/7 and I have  Titanium Plates and Titanium Screws in my neck <and more in my lower back!> so it takes a lot to get me comfortable. I also re-broke my neck 12 years after the first time <re-broke my back as well the same time>. I am on a long list of medication, to include having a Pain Pump surgically implanted in my body that gives me Morphine 24 hours a day.I also haven't had a decent nights sleep in over 10 years, and I usually only get anywhere from 2 to 4 hours of sleep a night, and get cat naps throughout the day.. For the past 4 years, I've been sleeping on a couch because I cannot lay flat and I need very firm support for my neck <and back too>. We've been trying to find a good mattress so I can actually sleep in my own bed, but I haven't found one that is comfortable enough and gives me enough support for my back. I also can't afford the hefty $7000 - $10,000 price tag on a Sleep Number or I Comfortbed, that would be perfect for me.I can't tell you how any pillows I've purchased over the past 25 years...but it is a ridiculous amount. Just in the past 6 months, I've bought 8 on Amazon, and at least 20 from Walmart and other stores here where I live. I have spent a LOT. The pillows I've gotten have been nice, but they go flat and get lumpy after a few weeks and don't hold up to what I need a pillow to do for me. I came back to Amazon because #1 - Icannot go shopping like most people, and # 2 - there are so many different pillows to choose from, I thought there had to be one for me.That's when I found the Snuggle Pillow made by Relief-Mart. I read all of the reviews, which aren't many, and made the decision to try it out. How many companies will let you try out a pillow for 90 days, and if you're not satisfied - you can send it back for a refund?? None that I know of. So yes, this pillow is pricey and I don't make a lot of money from my disability pay and $70 is a lot for me to shell out for a pillow, but if I don't like it I can get my money back.Before my pillow even got to me, the company sent me an email thanking me for my purchase. They told me a little bit about who they are, and how the pillow is made an how it will come to me, and told me if I ever had any questions not to hesitate to email or call. In my 8 years of buying on Amazon, I have never had a company email me, EVER!My pillow came within the time frame promised, in a box that I thought - wow they really do shrink it a lot!! They included a sheet with infoabout the pillow, and contact information as well. I took my pillow out of the box and it was rolled up like a sleeping bag and they sucked ALL the air out of it! I have to say, this pillow is substantially heavier then any other pillow I've owned <and that is a lot of pillows!> but not so heavy that it's difficult to handle. It took a little while to puff up to it's normal size which was fine as I got it early in the day. I did not notice any kind of smell that was so horrible it bothered me. It is foam and shipped in plastic so I knew there would be a light odor, but it really wasn't anything to complain about. Besides, you can wash it if it does offend you. I just put a pillow case on it and used it that night.That night was the first night in over 10 years that not only did I get 6 1/2 hours of sleep without waking up, but I also didn't wake up. Due to the Morphine and Vicodin and other meds I'm on, I get hot and cold and usually wake up cold from sweating.Not only did I wake up NOT sweaty or cold, but my neck felt pretty darn good! I can't remember when I've had such a good nights sleep, honestly. I've had this pillow for 5 days now, and I have had the best sleep ever. My neck isn't stiff, and doesn't hurt when I wake upI got another email from the company 2 days after I got the pillow asking me if I liked the pillow. Honestly - that really blew me away. I love that this company uses all U.S. made materials in their products and that they do not outsource their employees. Not only that, but how many companies back their product, and a pillow at that for 20, yes TWENTY YEARS? If my pillow ever goes flat, I return it for a new one. That is incredible.Obviously I can't say anything about how it has been over a long period of time because I've only had this pillow for just a week...but I willabsolutely update my review after a month and every few months after that.I can't recommend this pillow enough. It's very well made with high quality materials and the exterior is extremely soft on my skin. The pillow is the best pillow I've ever owned and has given me the best sleep of my life since I broke my neck twice. The company obviously cares about it's customers because they've contacted me twice and I've only had it a week, so their customer service has far exceeded my expectations. A 90 day Trial with a full refund and a 20 year warranty?? AWESOME.I would do just about anything to get my health back, so to be able to get sleep, and a GOOD nights sleep at that, means a lot to me. To me, I would pay double what this pillow cost.I apologize for the lengthy review. I just wanted to anyone who reads my review to understand why I LOVE this pillow! Give it a try, you will not be disappointed!UPDATE Janary 29 2015:I purchased another Snuggle-Pedic Pillow for my husband. He has Sleep Apnea and uses a CPAP at night. He started sleeping on his back once he started using the CPAP, and he wakes up every day with a stiff neck and I think the people in the next county can hear his neck crack when he first moves his head/neck, not to mention he takes a lot of Motrin just to help loosen his neck a little every morning. I love my new S-P pillow, from day one, so I decided to get him one. He absolutely LOVES it. No more stiff neck, and the cracking has really been reduced. I haven't seen him take 1 Motrin since he got the pillow, so that's great.As far as I go - I still think this is the best pillow around. I am sleeping a minimum of 5-6 hours a night, which is far better then the 2-3 I was getting. It's made a huge difference in my health.UPDATE September 2015 ~ I've had this pillow for almost a full year now <got it Dec 2014> and I still LOVE it to death. Over the past 9 months, I've had the BEST sleep ever. Every single night I get at least 6 hours which has been a HUGE help to my health.I have washed it many times and it still looks brand new, and it still has the same fullness as when I first got it! There isn't one thing I could possibly say derogatory about this pillow. It is WELL worth every single dollar.Since getting our pillows, we were able to get a new bed <Thank you MF!!>that just makes everything about sleeping amazing. I no longer dread going to sleep!Thank you to everyone for all of your comments and help. I've had 5 more surgeries just this year so I didn't reply to a lot of you, but I did see the posts and appreciate all of your kind comments and help!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23MK04MDUGHD8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PBFP0S6#wasThisHelpful","R23MK04MDUGHD8","A158CH42BGFN68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A158CH42BGFN68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this to hold the 15 Chuggington train/cars I got my grandson for Christmas.I was going to wrap each one individually and decided against it...he is only 2 and I think it's easier for him if I wrap all the cars in the carrier. I took them out of their separate boxes and then opened the carrier to put them in, and the first one did not fit. I knew just by looking at the car and carrier that that specific car was too big to fit the small ""hole"".I guess I didn't pay attention to some reviews nor the description <not that it says only certain ones fit this carrier!>, and only after getting on here and reading it did I find that some do not fit.The one's that I bought that DO fit are: PUFFER PETE, JACKMAN, BREWSTER, MTAMBO, SKYLAR, PIPER, DUNBAR, FROSTINI, ZACH, HARRISON and ACTION CHUGGER.THE 2 THAT DO NOT FIT ARE: KOKO, AND PARROT WILSON.If you look at the ones you want to buy - remember the ones that have the MAGNETIC ball on the end do NOT fit this carrier.They will fit if you pull out the plastic DIVIDERS. I did pull out the last divider and put the 2 larger train cars in there.All in all, it's a cute carrier that holds most of what I ordered. It's pretty sturdy, although my grandson won't play with this until Christmas - so we'll see how it all goes. I'll update with photos after Christmas!I'd definitely recommend - just be careful on the train cars you get if you want them to fit this carrier!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E4O45ML4HQZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00381A1R0#wasThisHelpful","R3E4O45ML4HQZW","A158CH42BGFN68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A158CH42BGFN68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I make gift bags for everyone at Christmas to use as Stockings because there is at least 10 people at my home, and it's easier for me to put everything in a gift bag then in actual Stockings. So, I wanted to get a few small items for my granddaughter and grandson for Christmas that would fit in their gift bag stocking. I was looking at other toys and this popped up as a recommendation. As a child, I LOVED tops...but back then Tops were made of wood or metal or a combination!I thought it looked cool and really - for $6.50 - how bad could it be? I read a bunch of reviews, good and bad, and decided to get one. It got here yesterday and I am not disappointed.LOTS of reviews say how cheap looking or poorly made this Top is, and I sometimes wonder what people are thinking. It's not expensive, and it IS a toy, right?When I buy toys, I make sure it will be age appropriate and durable. I also take into consideration if they play hard <some kids are very destructive with their toys>.As with a lot of battery operated items in the market, if they come with batteries, most of the time there is a plastic piece in the battery compartment that you have to pull <it will be sticking out of the toy on the bottom> or take out <little plastic or paper pieces are placed on one end of each battery> so the batteries will work. This is one such item. Check your Top for a plastic piece and remove it - or it won't work! It doesn't state it on the box this Top comes in, but you can't miss the plastic piece sticking out of the top!!To operate, all you have to do is pull up the round metal knob on top and it lights up and spins. To turn it off you have to pull up again. If you don't do this - it will stay on until the batteries die. If you pull up and let go, it takes a few seconds to stop, but if you pull up and hold it, it stops immediately.The Top itself does not spin. There is another Top inside the outer plastic shell that does spin. On the bottom of the Top is a very small metal point <not sharp by the way> that once you activate the Top, you put it on the floor and it ""looks"" like it's actually spinning. The lights are pretty cool - you get all different colors and it's always changing.As far as the battery life - I haven't turned this on and let it stay on for hours to see how long the batteries will last, but I can say that when you get something that is battery operated, the batteries are ALWAYS extremely low quality. I almost always replace batteries immediately so I know the life of the battery will last longer.To get into the battery compartment, you have to flip open 5 little plastic ""tabs"" on the outermost sides of the Top. You can see 2 of the tabs in the photo. So far these have not just popped open <it's only been a day!>, but I am assuming if you open/close them enough times, they will eventually not close. I say this because there is a choking warning on the box, but there are no small pieces to this toy that would cause choking. I took the bottom cover off to see the battery compartment and no small pieces are in it. You have to use a Phillips screwdriver to open the battery cover. I don't know what, if anything, I am missing! No part of this toy is loose or would make me worry about choking <unless you have a child that had a throat as big as a cow as this is a good sized top - 3 1/2 inches wide by 2 1/2 inches from top to bottom>. HOWEVER - if your child is one who puts everything in their mouth - you may not want this because the 5 tabs could be bitten off - and THAT would choke a child easily, and break the toy.As far as quality, I think it's pretty good. I ALWAYS supervised my kids <when they were little>, and I always supervise my grand kids when they play with toys. They are 2 and 5 -- not old enough for me to just say - go play, and stay out of sight. Because this Top doesn't physically spin, the kids can either hold it in their hands and watch it,, or put it on the floor or a table to watch it.If you want a Top that you have to physically spin and it spins all over the place- this isn't for you. I myself wouldn't give this to anyone under 5, but it's up to you to give it to someone younger. If you supervise your child playing with this, I really don't see any problem.As with all toys, they will eventually break due to longevity or misuse, so to spend $6.50 on this <I have Prime so no shipping> isn't going to break my bank account!For me- it's worth the money, and I know my granddaughter is going to love this!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GL53V2PMI6CQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006K3L8CA#wasThisHelpful","R3GL53V2PMI6CQ","A158CH42BGFN68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A158CH42BGFN68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This has got to be the SOFTEST fabric I've ever felt. Seriously.I kind of thought that Microfiber would be like those kitchen towels that are fairly thick and are supposed to absorb...but this Duvet Cover is like a VERY thin Cotton that is the softest material I've ever felt.I got it because it's really pretty and came at a great price, and I was going to use over a comforter that got a little bleach damage in the wash. But now...I'm going to use it on a new comforter and use it on a regular basis.I wish someone would make blankets feel like this!! It feels so good against the skin. It makes you feel cool in the summer. I live in Texas where it is STILL 98 degrees out right now -October 7th... COME ON Mother Nature give us a break!I bought a Queen size in the Purple for our Master Guest Bedroom, but just bought the King size in Teal for our Master Bedroom.  I love that the Purple has purple, black and tan colors n white because you can get purple, black, tan or white color sheet sets, and the same with the King size <different colors obviously>, AND if you want - you can actually use BOTH sides of the Cover. The print you see in the photo is the side you'd use most often, but if you look closely at the BOTTOM photo <which is actually the Cover> you will see a little piece of fabric folded over the center of the cover, and that is what the other side of the Duvet looks like....a kind of ""skeleton"" design if you will. I think it's pretty cool! The buttons at the end of the Duvet would allow you t use ether side, so I like that.All in all, this is a beautiful cover at an excellent price, and the softest material I've ever touched! I definitely recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P3OMB3LEWX1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ZD94NW#wasThisHelpful","R3P3OMB3LEWX1I","A158CH42BGFN68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A158CH42BGFN68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew this would be big, but boy is it ever huge!It went together fairly easy. I didn't need any tools. For something as large as this, I kind of expected something a little more sturdy.I put it together in my living room. BIG mistake! I didn't have any problems moving to to our bedroom, but once there I thought I could start filling t and then put it in place. Wrong. Once I put some items in it, I tried moving it and the poles kept coming out.What a royal pain in the fanny. It's all my fault really. I should have put it together in the place I was going to put it. It really isn't sturdy enough to put together then move.That being said, once it was together and in it's final resting place, and I loaded it up with sweaters and other clothes items I wanted protected, it is holding everything quite nicely. No issues of bending poles due to heavy weight...and there is about 50 sweaters and sweatshirts and jackets hanging on the left. On the right is 2 hanging closet organizers full of blankets, towels and such. All 3 are pretty heavy, and again - no strain at all.I love the cloth cover as it will keep everything clean,but it is a thin cover so be careful not to pull on it as it may rip if handled too roughly. In my opinion anyways!I don't know if I can add a photo but I will try.If you're looking for an organizer for your closet, or need extra storage, or don't have a closet - this is perfect!

"I got these for my sisters wedding. We have some really awesome vases that are quite large so instead of filling with crystals or rocks, we decided to use these and some small LED lights that are waterproof. She just put 10 of these in some water and she couldn't believe how big they got. She loves them, and that makes me happy!A happy bride is ALWAYS a good thing!!Seller shipped really fast.

"I have to comment on this seller. I ordered these because I liked the colors. After a few days I came back to check on shipping and found out this was shipping from China. Not a huge deal for me, but instead of getting them within a week or 2...I was looking at a month. WRONG!!! I got these head wraps 10 DAYS after ordering! WOW I'm impressed!I got exactly the same wraps that were in the photo. I already have a few of these and absolutely LOVE them. They are super light weight and they are PERFECT under our helmets when we get on the Harley. But I also wear one when I'm cleaning or doing yard work. They are light enough to let your head breathe, unlike cotton. Any sweating goes right to the wrap but dissipates very fast. My head doesn't get sunburned at all and it protects my hair.I will absolutely order more from this seller. You cannot beat the price anywhere, and who can complain about the super fast shipping! I definitely recommend!!

"I've been using a B.E.Kabuki for years and I've kept it clean and in great condition, but it is quote harsh on my skin. The bristles are not soft at all, so I went looking for another.I've purchased items from E.L.F. before, but only makeup items, I didn't know they had tools. SO I saw this one and wanted to try it out.This is probably the softest Kabuki Brush I've ever felt, Seriously. It feels amazing on my skin. And the price? Are you kidding me? I spent $40 on my other Kabuki brushes, so this is a STEAL!Well made, great price. Works great with Mineral Powder makeup. Not for liquids tho!!

"I have a ton of birds come to  my back yard to feed, and I have 10 feeders all over the place, this one makes 11. I wanted a feeder that would feed the small birds I have, so bought this one.It's very well made. All steel, even the mesh. The top comes off without problem and is easy to fill.It usually take the birds that come to eat a few days to get used to a new feeder. It's been 3-4 days and not one bird has taken to this feeder yet. I've used Nyjer food and regular songbird food, and none of the birds have gone to it.I'll keep it up and continue to watch and see if they start going to this feeder.

"The jury is out with regards to these bird feeders.I love that these are well made of steel, and they're brightly colored. I like that they come with their own chain and hook ready to hang. And the twist off lids work easily enough and is strong.My only issue is the bird food doesn't stay in the feeders. It hasn't mattered what kind of food I put in these <sunflower, Nyjer, or regular food> it comes out very easily. I have to hold this feeder VERY still once I get food in it and take it to hang or else I always have a trail of food behind me.The birds seem to like it because even though there's no perch, the mesh gives them lots of places for their feet to hang on to it while eating. It took the birds 2 days to figure out it is a bird feeder, and the birds that come to my yard are definitely keeping bird food companies in business, but they only seem to go to this feeder once all the other 10 feeders are empty.I'll continue to feed the birds with this feeder, but it they continue to only use it once all the other feeders are empty...I'll just use these as hanging candle holders, as a votive will fit nicely in them.I'll update in about a month.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAZAIMIVYKE6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00480QFES#wasThisHelpful","RAZAIMIVYKE6I","A158CH42BGFN68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A158CH42BGFN68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love to feed the birds and have 11 feeders hanging all over our back yard. When I saw this 3 level feeder I wanted it right away. I have a lot of the traditional feeders but not a platform feeder.This 3 platform feeder is well made of hard plastic and steel hanger. I put it outside as soon as I took it out of the box.As i hung it on my Shepherds Hook and started to fill it with bird food, I noticed how the platforms didn't stretch much at all. And this is the reason for my giving this 4 stars. With bird food on each platform, it doesn't stretch enough for birds to comfortably eat.The top platform is big enough so that 2 birds can fit on it and eat, but any more then that and they would fight for room.The 2nd platform is harder for birds to get to. They actually have to duck to be able to eat. I've had quite a few birds go to this feeder and they don't seem to have a problem ducking and walking completely under the platform and eat. The bottom platform is pretty much the same as the 2nd - birds have to crawl underneath to feed.I have had this feeder up for 4 days now and the birds really seem to like it because I can't get bird food on it fast enough. I only wish the platforms were farther apart to accomodate the birds so they didn't have to duck under the platform above them.One CON - the Squirrels absolutely LOVE this feeder. There's no way to prevent them from getting the food either. Squirrels can climb just about anything.All in all, the birds seem to love this feeder so I'm happy with that. We'll see if they continue to go to it to eat!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WBS7BQK5WNRO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052B9T1I#wasThisHelpful","R2WBS7BQK5WNRO","A158CH42BGFN68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A158CH42BGFN68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a huge wallet I use in my ""regular"" giant bag, but was looking for a wallet I could use in my Cross Body Bag that I use when my husband and I go riding. I want as little in that bag to keep it as flat as possible because number 1- it hangs around my body so i don't want it to be heavy, and, number 2 - when I ride the Harley, I need my hands free.I ordered the Dragon Lily Pink wallet as not only do I love Pink, but it looked like a bright wallet in the photo.I LOVE this wallet!PROS: BRIGHT Pink Color ~ Makes it easy to see/find.  2 Zipper Parts  ~ One side has 11 Slots for Credit/Business Cards, The other side for Cash/Receipts etc.  ID Window  ~ Very easy to put in / take out ID Cards, Easy to see ALL of your ID.  Craftsmanship  ~ Well made, strong zippers, very good stitching <my pink wallet has pink stitching<, REAL Leather!CONS: No place good to put any coins.  You have to fold your paper money to fit it in the wallet.For me, I don't mind that this won't really hold coins as I have a coin ""purse"" for that. And I truly don't mind having to fold my paper cash. I am only using this wallet in my cross body bag and we don't get the Harley out but maybe 2-3 times a week, so I only put as much cash as we'll need to eat lunch or dinner.This wallet is really a nice wallet. If you want something to put your bills n that won't need folding, you need to look at other larger wallets. This is on a 4 inch wallet.I LOVE that it has so many slot for Credit or business cards. I have 16 cards all together, and some are doubled up - and they fit without any problems at all. No bulging of the zipper and the entire wallet looks great....not over stuffed. It's real leather so I know it will last a long time, provided it's taken good care of!Buxton makes good products, their quality is exceptional. I know some reviews complain of color combinations, but as long as it does what I want it to, I don't really care what color the stitching is!I would absolutely recommend this wallet to anyone! It's great!

"I don't usually wear blue eyeshadow, but my sister is getting married and my Maid of Honor dress is a very dark blue, so I wanted to find a dark blue color to try out.I love Loose Mineral Powder make up. It just seems to look better then cake shadows,, and it lasts a lot longer.Seller shipped quite fast. It came in a little pot in a cute little bag.I immediately got out my brushes and mirror so I could try it out. At first, I applied a primer to my eyes so the shadow would stay put as I usually do. Then I applied the shadow with a very small brush and applied as ""eyeliner"". Then I applied it to the lower part of my lids, and then I did it in the ""Smoky"" eye look. I like all 3 ways I applied it!The dark indigo blue color is a gorgeous DARK blue that has just a hint of shimmer/sparkle. At the end of the day <or evening> when I went to take off my makeup, the blue color has almost morphed into a very dark charcoal blue. It came off easily when washed using my Dove face soap.I have very bright green eyes, and usually any kind of blue shadow looks horrible on me. But this color blue is so dark it almost looks black.

"I saw a review of this smelling like Mildew, so was hesitant to buy it.SOOOOO Glad I bought this bag - It's AWESOME!!So it smells like leather..if it didn't have the leather scent I would not have believed it to be real leather.That being said, the smell of new leather is strong. IT GOES AWAY. ALL REAL LEATHER HAS A STRONG SMELL WHEN YOU FIRST GET IT.I got my bag 3 days ago and once I put everything in it that I wanted, I put it on the table next to my couch. By the next day, the strong leather scent was gone.I would never, ever put leather in a washing machine..the leather would be ruined. Any Leather I have ever owned, <and I have a lot>, I've ALWAYS taken to be Dry Cleaned. Leather gets destroyed with regular water and soap.I LOVE this bag. It has 6 - YES - SIX compartments for you to put your things in.1. In the front of the bag there is a small zipper compartment that opens up to reveal a window pocket for ID's and 3 pockets for Credit or Business Cards. I put my credit cards in those RFID Sleeves to protect them, and all my cards are in 3, and they fit perfectly! My Driver's License, Military ID and a Medical Card fit perfectly in the ID Window.2. On top of that compartment is another zipper that opens up to a full open compartment. I put a metal tin of Mentos Candies and a small LED flashlight, with plenty of room for more!3. Above that is yet another zipper compartment with more room then I know what to do with!! I put a pen, my inhaler and a few small items in this one. <My hand all the way to my wrist, fits inside this one!>4. On the back of the bag, there is an opening that my IPhone 4s fits into perfectly, or you could put cigarettes if you smoke.5. Above that opening <no zipper> is a zipper compartment that fits my cell phone as well <I use this one for my cell so when I'm on the Harley I won't worry about it falling out>, but you could put anything in it really..6. On the top of the bag is yet another zipper compartment, the main one. It's the entire length and width of the bag. I have a small cosmetic bag and a small coin purse that holds everything I need it to hold.I like using cosmetic bags / coin purses or similar items in bags like this so nothing will stain / rip / ruin the interior. If I were to put everything in the main pocket, it would be hard to find what I'm looking for, so I just use little bags, and I know exactly where everything is! Simple really.This ""Small"" Cross body bag is holding a TON of my things and you would NEVER know it has so much in it by looking at it. It's not bulged out and none of the seams are stretched.  This is a VERY WELL MADE bag with TONS of organization opportunities!Don't like the smell of leather and can't be patient enough to give it time to breathe, well that's a shame because this really is a great bag at a great price!Priced well for being a genuine leather hand bag that you can wear across your body, or put on your shoulder as the shoulder strap is very adjustable!I recommend it and if I ever want or need anther - I'd come right back here to get one! VERY happy with my purchase!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB3M000CEIIBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008D2N4GO#wasThisHelpful","RB3M000CEIIBE","A158CH42BGFN68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A158CH42BGFN68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this to put in my purse to put coins in, but when I got it. I saw that it was bigger then I thought it would be, so decided to use it for something else at first.I have a leather cross body bag that I use whenever we ride the Harley. It has 5 zipper compartments and I could put everything I need for short distance rides. It's not as big as my regular suitcase <LOL> but I want my keys, some kind of wallet, a small bag for lip gloss and small perfume, or whatever I want.My biggest issue with this small cross body bags is they're thin, and I have quite a few keys on my chain, and I always end up getting poked by my keys.This little Coin Purse is PERFECT for holding all of my keys!! So that's what I'll use this for.It will definitely hold coins if you use it for that purpose...it's made very well, the canvas is qute sturdy, and the zipper is a good, strong one. You'll save a lot of money in coins in this little bag...it's about 4 inches long by around 3 inches tall and 1 inch thick...it will definitely hold a load of coins.The price is right, the pink color I got is very pretty, and it's made well.

"My husband purchased me something almost exactly like this fro Harley. My hair is extremely long, to me waist, so keeping it together while riding is important. I HATE brushing the horrible knots out when we get home.I can either put my hair in a ponytail or just leave it down. It goes over my head just fine. It does stretch a little when doing that, but it doesn't make it too big to stay on my head.It's lightweight, very comfortable, and SO pretty! My helmet has pink flames on it, so this color goes well. Not to mention it's VERY bright so everyone will see the pink!There's no seams in it which is nice..no seam marks on my head or face. You can also put your hair in a bun and put this on and then tie a knot at the end so none of your hair falls out of it. Sometimes I wear it when I'm gardening or mowing the yard, or if it's just plain hot out and  want my hair up so I'm cooler. It really is perfect!I LOVE THIS! I just bought the dark blue too.

"I was VERY leery of these shades because I have never purchased a ""Paper Shade"" in my life, and wasn't sure that paper would be strong enough. After reading reviews I decided to give them a try.I ordered 3M Scotch Heavy Duty Mounting Tape, 1-Inch by 50-Inch with the shades because I wanted to be sure they stuck.I was able to cut them down to the ODD sizes I needed. My dining room has 4 windows - 2 in the center are considerably larger then the ones on each side of the 2 bigger ones. I was able to cut one shade in half and use those 2 pieces in each side window, and I was able to cut off about 4 inches of 2 more to fit the center windows.These were simple to install. Measure your window, cut with either sharp scissors or an Exacto knife.Pull off the strip covering the sticky strip <I did that and then added the 3M Double Sided Tape>, then simply put them up. These curtains, all 6 of them, come with clips that you put on the bottom of the shade to pull up and down the shade, without touching the paper. It took me an hour to put all 4 shades up, and I'm 100% Disabled so I don't usually do this stuff. But I was excited to see them up and didn't want to wait for my husband to come home from work to do it.I am actually pretty impressed with these shades. They look Amazing! You'd never know they are paper unless you get right up to them and feel them. They are definitely a high quality paper. I had these ugly, ugly plastic mini blinds that I paid a fortune for since they were such odd sizes, and these Paper Shades look like I spent even more!They aren't light ""Blocking"", but they do filter it. I have more light now then I did with the plastic mini blinds. It's a really nice ""glow"" light. I like that there's no string/handles, they're cordless. They provide complete privacy <nobody can see in or out> while not blocking out the light.What I like best though is No. 1 - the price is perfect! Where can you get 6 shades for under $40??? And No.2 - I can do this myself! And quickly! AND with no help from anyone. And for someone like myself who has to count on someone to help with almost everything - that's pretty awesome to me!Definitely give these a try!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39K8UTS2S3VUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SDX54M#wasThisHelpful","R39K8UTS2S3VUD","A158CH42BGFN68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A158CH42BGFN68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We took out the Sliding Glass Door that was in our living room and put in a beautiful Double Glass door that on the right side is just a giant window with mini blinds inside the panes of glass, and the left side is the same except it opens. The mini blinds look really nice, but I still wanted a curtain that would block out the light. Not ot mention our electric bill has been between $300- $400. <We have a 3900 sq. ft. home with LOTS of windows and doors>I wanted curtains that could block out most of the light, but more importantly - keep the heat out. I live n Texas and no matter where you are in my house, the heat just seeps in - no matter how good your windows are. If the sunlight can get in - it's HOT!I liked that it said these blocked light plus helps to reduce noise.My Black curtains were not wrinkled as much as others have said in their reviews. They come folded and in a plastic zipper bag. I unfolded the curtain and just hung them, and they looked great. No wrinkle problems at all. The Chocolate curtains were a little wrinkled but all I had to do was put them in my dryer with  a fabric softener sheet <I use Arm & Hammer Total, 2-in-1 Moist Dryer Cloths, Classic Fresh 40 Ct (Pack of 4) you can buy on Amazon> and leave it in for 3-5 minutes and they're perfect.Both of these curtains block out almost all of the light. Each side lets a little in, but what do you expect with a curtain?If you want 100% light block, then you'll need to tape them to the wall.As far as noise reduction, it is considerably less noisy now that I have these curtains up. I put the Black in our large living room and the Chocolate in the formal living room. We have lots of teens who drive with their stereos blaring and thumping at all hours of the day and night, and now the only thing we hear, or feel actually, is the base, and nothing is going to get rid of that.But the most impressive thing to me is that since I put these curtains up, our electric bill has gone from between $300-$400 - to $260 <the 1sy electric bill since the new curtains>. That's a BIG win in my book!I get Migraines a lot, more then anyone should, and now that the light and noise is so reduced - it takes less time for me to get rid of the migraines then before. <I need it very quiet and very dark>These curtains feel amazing. They weigh less then 2 pounds. You can add a swag or have Lace tops to ""decorate"", or leave them just as they are as they certainly aren't ugly! They're simple to hang....and the price is perfect!If you are looking for a pretty curtain that blocks MOST of the light and reduces the noise - THESE are the ones for you. Just be sure to order TWO because there's only 1 panel in each order!! I got the 95 inch curtains as my door is ceiling to floor - and they fit PERFECTLY. There is a half of an inch on top and on bottom that the curtain doesn't cover. Be sure to measure your windows or doors!I'm getting another set to put in our bedroom. I definitely recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E5RJQNWJCLK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002LARQUO#wasThisHelpful","R2E5RJQNWJCLK9","A158CH42BGFN68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A158CH42BGFN68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hands down the BEST brush I've ever used. Honestly.I am 50 years old and my husband and I get on the Harley at least 2-3 times a week. I have extremely long hair - down to my waist, and occasionally I like to ride without my helmet. I live in Texas and in the summer, the heat is just so unbearable & I hate  putting on my heavy helmet, so I go with a Bandana. Unfortunately, my hair gets such horrible knots and tangles in it, that when I brush my hair, I always come away with not just a massive ball of hair that my other brush pulls out of my head, but a nasty headache to go with it.I saw this brush while looking for another product and even though I have about 20 different brushes - I got it to try out. I am VERY HAPPY I did! I opened it up and used it right away. I hadn't been on the bike so I just brushed my normally wavy/curly, thick long hair. I felt like I was in a Spa getting a head massage! It felt THAT good! We did take a ride the next day and I wore just a bandana, no ponytail, as I wanted my hair to get all kinds of knots in it. It did get a lot of knots.I used the brush on my knotty hair and let me say this. I didn't feel one tug, there was no pulling, and when I was done brushing my hair, there was only a very small amount of hair in the brush. Compared to the huge ball I had been getting every single time with my other brushes - this amount is nothing. And even better - no headache! I also notice no static electricity in my hair - which is normal for me here in Texas.I. Am. Thrilled!  This brush is AMAZING. The way it is made is great...it holds nicely in your hand - very comfortable. The bristles are very firm. It's very easy to clean the brush after each use, whether you just pull the hair out or you put it in the sink to get a good clean brush...either way it's simple to do.I was able to get rid of 17 other brushes!! The ONLY problem now is when my husband saw the brush, he actually got excited. He has a brush similar to this one a long time ago and lost it. SO when he saw my new pink Crave brush - HE TOOK IT. He actually took it, used it, smiled at me, and I had to give it to him. So now I need to get one for myself.I have a granddaughter who is 5 with the most gorgeous, thick and curly hair you'll ever see and she's very tender headed. I can't wait to try this on her!!I am 100% thrilled with my purchase. The seller shipped it SUPER fast. And I LOVE this brush, as does my husband. The price may seem like a little pricey but honestly - I'd pay more for it - it's THAT good.THANK YOU Crave Naturals for making such a great brush!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XXDWNJFI20FZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CGN9LQ8#wasThisHelpful","R2XXDWNJFI20FZ","A158CH42BGFN68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A158CH42BGFN68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In case you don't know the basic plot for ANTICHRIST, here's a quick synopsis.  One wintery, snowy day, husband and wife HE (Willem Dafoe) and She (Charlotte Gainsbourgh) are making love, and hence don't notice that their young toddler has escaped his crib and climbs onto a table to look out their upper apartment window...only to slip and fall to his death.  Needless to say, this is a devastating event.  He (a therapist) decides the deeply depressed She needs to get away and he takes her to their cabin in the woods for some homegrown therapy.  Strange events and madness ensue.I don't think I've spoiled much, because I've only touched on the first few minutes and haven't even tried to explain what watching this film is really like.  It's tough to review such a controversial and confrontational film, but let me try in 3 ways.1)  As a story, the film is a bit of a failure.  The subject is immediately gripping, but the film doesn't really prove to be much about what happens as what is experienced.  The couple head to the woods and a series of events...perhaps supernatural, perhaps merely madness manifesting take place, resulting in the couple coming to a pretty severe crossroads in their relationship.  There is essentially no reason to see the film just to see how the story plays out.  There is, indeed, some graphic nudity and sex, but trust me...it is not enticing.  (Hell, by the end, it's quite off-putting!)2)  Deeper meanings.  Here's where director and proficient provacateur Lars von Trier really really goes to work.  On the simplest level, the film could be about madness brought on by grief.  She is barely able to put one foot in front of the other because of grief, guilt and fear.  He either doesn't feel much grief, or puts on this therapist hat so that he can deal with his wife and not face the grief himself.  Either way, his seeming lack of empathy doesn't help She feel better, and her animosity towards her husband grows.  Everyone grieves in their own way, and when a couple isn't on the same page in how their grieve, the marriage is damaged or destroyed.  But this, to me, is only the surface lesson.The film also seems to suggest that She is possibly evil.  Prior to the calamity, She  had been working on a thesis about how women have been portrayed as evil or Satanistic through the centuries.  She worked while in the cabin for a getaway with her son (HE did not come along, tellingly).  And she plastered the attic room with horrific images of women being tortured and killed for their evil natures.  But it appears She may have come to believe these images to be true.  She berates herself constantly for her guilt and evilness.  It could be that women are inherently evil, or that a SEXUAL woman is evil.  After all, their son died while she was enjoying sex.  And throughout the film, she occasionally practically rapes her husband, and these moments of brief physical release seem to be her only moments of relative control (not sanity, though.  Just harnessing her wildness.)  Have her studies and the events of her life rendered her convinced of the crazy notion that she is evil...or is she ACTUALLY evil, as VonTrier seems to hint.  We get ideas that she...may have been a little unhinged (especially about her son) prior to his death.  She seems to not only FEEL responsible but perhaps actually IS responsible for what happened.3)  Visually, the film has some stunning moments.  There are some scenes of beautiful slow-motion, in particular the opening.  (I liked the slow-motion better in MELANCHOLIA, but it's nonetheless quite something here too.)  There are many alarmingly disturbing moments (consider yourself warned that there are moments where you must turn away from the images on screen).  The actors give strong, committed performances, especially Gainsbourgh, who is really quite something in this film.  VonTrier, the director, is pretty effective in working his audience over.  VonTrier the writer is perhaps just a little too proud of himself and sometimes wallows in imagery or metaphors that are a bit too heavy-handed.I can only give the film, despite some strong elements, 3 stars because it is so deeply unpleasant to watch (overall) and because it is too clever by half.  I'm great with ""art films"" or ""indie films""...but VonTrier just tries too hard at times.  He's never yet done better than BREAKING THE WAVES...a movie with some humanity.  In the end, ANTICHRIST seems to hate both its main characters and we sort of do too...thus we are left with a film with no compassion towards the suffering parents.  Simply put, I didn't like that.By the way, I watched the Criterion Blu-Ray.  The movie itself looks and sounds great.  The essay provided is thoughtful.  The bonus materials are a bit skimpy, given that this is a fairly recent film.  There are a few moderately interesting interviews with the two stars...but the little ""making of"" videos are brief and very surface-level.  We don't quite get the ""academic"" dive into the film that Criterion gives us in their best releases.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26K1ZDK5U4U57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003KGBISO#wasThisHelpful","R26K1ZDK5U4U57","A2R1HAXRNU0QX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The movie JAWS is one of my all-time favorites.  I saw it as a young teenager and it just totally changed the way I saw films.  Everything about it was great, but one element I learned to appreciate more and more over the years was the performance of Roy Scheider.  He was the ""everyman"" in the film, and when I saw him in other movies over the years, that's kind of how he always struck me.  A bit unusual looking, but friendly and stolid.  So that makes his performance in ALL THAT JAZZ all the more of a revelation.  To say his Joe Gideon is larger-than-life is an understatement.  He's a brilliant director and choreographer who is failing miserably at being a father, husband, lover and ""good person.""  But he doesn't even care.  To him, life is a performance (for him, seduction is just an extension of the idea of performing), and he even choreographs his own inner musings as though they were stage productions.  He choreographs shows and he tries to choreograph life.  When this doesn't work out for him, he just starts over, heedless of the damage his failed attempts leave behind.  He works hard and lives hard.  He can tell he's very sick (too much smoking, mostly) but he also feels invincible.  As long as he can create, he will live.Scheider gets this all with remarkable detail.  He's playing a jerk/genius, hardly a new idea in films...but he gives him a down-to-earth believability that elevates the film.  And when Joe Gideon begins to realize he is in a creative rut, where his own ideas fail to excite him anymore (even as those around him applaud his efforts), he begins to see his life slipping away too.  If he can't be a brilliant creator and not just a rehasher of his own work...he can't stave off the damage he's done to himself.The best parts of the film are really the dance numbers.  The opening scene...a cattle call audition...is more chaotic and more memorable than the opening of A CHORUS LINE.  The use of ""On Broadway"" is classic.  Near the mid-point of the movie, Joe shows his producers his new choreography that features lots of sensuality and nudity.  It's a great scene and still feels a bit daring even today.  Ann Reinking gets to strut her stuff in several memorable numbers, and actress Leland Palmer also makes quite an impression.So why only 4 stars?  Well, this is a film about indulgence (or self-indulgence if you will) to some degree, and occasionally director/writer/choreographer Bob Fosse over-indulges a bit.  And unfortunately, it's mostly towards the end.  Joe is in the hospital, and as his situation grows more dire, his fantasies become a bit more elaborate.  The numbers where he's laying in his post-surgical bed, watching as an imaginary, healthier version of himself directs various numbers geared to tell Joe how he has wasted his life OR the grand-finale set on a TV variety show soundstage simply go on too long.  We get the idea in about half the time Fosse takes to show it, and the choreography is among the LEAST imaginative of the film.  The climax is just drawn out.  (Although the final few seconds of the film are nicely and concisely done.)Also, I found Jessica Lange (who is a great actress), as the ""angel of death"" character Gideon imagines is waiting for him to be far too willowy and diaphanous and soft-focus.  She makes for, in my opinion, a silly metaphor.  Not Lange's fault, so much as the director.  Maybe it felt fresh in 1979, but not so much now.Speaking of fresh, if you can possibly see the film (as I did) on the Criterion Blu-Ray...DO!!  It is fantastic.  The colors pop...all those awful, wonderful Danskins and male dancers wearing tube socks.  The '70s show-biz look if a blast to look at.  And the sound is fantastic.  It's just at 3.0 surround track...but it still fills up the room.  And the bonus features are very plentiful, including a great interview from Tom Snyder of both Fosse and Agnes DeMille.  These two greats of the stage, both innovators in their time, are just amazing to watch together.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLPF9GMRS5JAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KE3B6NI#wasThisHelpful","RLPF9GMRS5JAJ","A2R1HAXRNU0QX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Shannon is simply terrific at playing the ""creepy"" guy...the one with perhaps a normal exterior, but whose inner life is deeply troubled.  Usually, he delivers these shadings in the service of relatively nice guys (REVOLUTION ROAD, TAKING SHELTER [maybe his best role] and BUG, for example).  These are all nice guys with issues.  Shannon lets us see the surface and also the anguish just below.  Whether it's a gaze that doesn't quite meet your eyes, or a furrowed brow or just a turn of phrase...he's never less than riveting and just a little scary.In THE ICEMAN, he has found the perfect character...one that no one but him could have played as well.  While his lead role in the remarkable TAKING SHELTER is perhaps his most layered performance; his role in this true story is perhaps the most tailor-made for him.  Which IS ironic, since it's a true story.  Shannon plays a cold-blooded killer for the Jersey mob.  Over the decades, it is estimated he killed over 100 people.  In all manners of death and without remorse or pity.  And without any seeming enjoyment.  His face is a blank stare.  When he is threatened with death, he has virtually no reaction beyond mild curiosity...and when he kills, there is even less going on.  But when he is temporarily sidelined, he becomes like a caged animal, literally pacing and on edge and ready to explode.  Killing clearly is his way of exorcising some kind of personal demon.At the same time, Shannon is married and has a lovely family he cherishes above all else.  His feelings, though a bit tightly contained, seem genuine.  He loves his wife (Wynona Ryder) and never strays from her.  His daughters are the light of his life.  He keeps them sheltered from what he really does, and provides for them well.  He is a bit of an odd-bird, even to his wife...but certainly no one would suspect what he really does.This is a dark and low-budget film.  There is little sunshine to be found, and given that much of it takes place in the '70s, it has an extra sheen of grime that comes with all the polyester.  And the plot itself is pretty straightforward.  We know (because the first scene shows us) that Shannon will be caught, but because he is surrounded by other low-life thugs who seem even more petty than him, we actually sort of root for the guy.  The story is told through his eyes almost entirely, and we cannot help but side with him just a bit.  There is, I reluctantly admit, something a bit gripping about seeing someone who is a master at what he does at work.Shannon is the main reason, by far, to see this film.  He is mesmerizing throughout.  Ray Liotta  has a significant role as the mob boss...doing the exact same character he's been doing for about 20 years.  Ryder is fine...the role is hardly one that would revive her career, but it's good to see her in something where she isn't making fun of herself too.  Best of all is Chris Evans as another hit man, who embarks on a years long collaboration of sorts with Shannon.  His personality is all flash and sparkle...and Evans, normally such a straight-laced good guy (CAPTAIN AMERICA, anyone?) looks great in the '70s garb and hair.  He's busting out with energy, creating a stark contrast with Shannon's contained rage.We find out very little about this true to life character.  We get a tiny glimpse at what may have broken in him, but no sense of what makes him so casual about killing.  His love for his family seems genuine and shows real emotion.  Yet he appears to be a sociopath of the first order.  The two sides of him make for an uneasy reconciliation for the viewer, which I feel only adds to the power of the film.The climax of the film comes fast and surprising.  And Shannon finally gets a chance to let loose...and it's a thing of power and rawness.  And unlike with his silly character in MAN OF STEEL, when this guy sees his life instantly collapsing, his outcry of rage and horror is chilling.I highly recommend this film, although it does have a bleak outlook on life and humanity.  I didn't feel depressed at its conclusion (not at all, it is so well done), but I wasn't exactly uplifted!  [By the way, James Franco receives pretty high billing in the film and is on the cover of the disk.  He is in exactly one brief scene.  Just to warn ya.]","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37JH6BCPBZBXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D5XC8VS#wasThisHelpful","R37JH6BCPBZBXT","A2R1HAXRNU0QX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CHLOE is a very implausible movie, but it has a classy sheen and some high-class actors.  It comes from director Atom Egoyan, so it has artsy overtones.  But at its heart, it is trashy fun, almost in the FATAL ATTRACTION vein.Julianne Moore is a tightly wound OB/GYN, married to handsome music professor Liam Neeson.  The two have built a good life on the surface, but they have a troubled teenage son (Max Theriot, later from TV's BATES MOTEL) and are no longer physically close.  Moore is convinced her husband is having an affair, and she hires a prostitute (Amanda Seyfried) to make the moves on her husband, to see if he responds.  It's a dangerous game and Moore finds that this relationship between her husband and the hooker seems to bring her closer, erotically, to her husband.  While all the characters have roughly the same screentime, this is really Moore's movie, and she does a solid job (as always) balancing between her dismay at her arousal and being drawn further into these unfamiliar feelings.  I've deliberately kept this a bit vague, because I don't want to spoil the various entanglements that ensue.  But as I said, she's playing a dangerous game with her own emotions and the emotions of others.  It all culminates in a bit of an over-the-top climax, but it does come somewhat full-circle.Not only is Moore good, but Seyfriend is beguiling.  I wouldn't say she gives a great performance, and her character is far too ""wise"" in knowing the secret hearts of others...but if we look at this film as more of a psycho-sexual thriller and less of a drama, her performance makes more sense.  Neeson is solid.  And Atom Egoyan, whose SWEET HEREAFTER and EXOTICA are great movies, does do a good job of giving the film a sense of being more important and having more to say than it really does...but it's really entertainment first and thoughtful a distant second.If I could, I'd give the film 3.5 stars.  It's worth seeing, I think, but not something you should drop everything for.  It's a very adult movie, obviously, and does have a few graphic scenes and some graphic language.  But it is good, clean, ""dirty"" fun.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R299KF09NDFA0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037QGS0K#wasThisHelpful","R299KF09NDFA0C","A2R1HAXRNU0QX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've said it before and sadly, I must say it again...some perfectly okay horror films have been much diminished by having silly or incomprehensible endings.  Sure, every movie wants to do something like leave room for a sequel...but too many horror films (in particular) seem to fumble their conclusions/climaxes.  Finding a satisfactory resolution for something that's already requiring more suspension of disbelief than usual is just tough.AS ABOVE, SO BELOW certainly falls into that trap. It has an excellent set up...a group of young adults sets out to explore the catacombs below the city of Paris.  This is actually a premise that could be rooted in reality (like the setting of THE CHERNOBYL DIARIES).  And there are some early thrills in these explorations, although they also felt a little bit like poorly done rip-offs of better scenes in THE DESCENT.  We get plenty of creepy images, featuring hooded figures or weird groups of women.  And when things start going poorly, we can actually sort of believe these guys would keep moving forward because their ""leader"" is a driven archeaologist wanna-be (Perdita Weeks) who has already been shown to have a propensity for driving ahead regardless of the danger, like a reporter in war zone.  So her companions follow her just a bit blindly, until things are suddenly so bad, it's time to go back.  Only, of course, the trip back is not nearly as simple as the trip down the unexplored caves and hallways.The film has atmosphere aplenty.  If you've got a surround-sound system, you should be quite impressed by the sound design.  Certainly a few jarring moments.But there are real head-scratching moments and things left unresolved.  For example, for a good chunk of the film the main characters are joined by a mysterious man who was apparently a catacomb-explorer himself, but had disappeared quite some time ago.  Suddenly he appears, and it's clear (at least to the viewer) that this guy is not right in the head.  Then suddenly, he commits a horrible act and is abruptly gone, never to be mentioned or referenced again...despite what he did.  It's a creepy character with no-payoff or explanation.  Good setup...bad execution.There is also some code-deciphering in the film (remember, the lead is a third-rate Indiana Jones) that makes no sense.  And in the end, many of the threads of the film are left unexplained in a particularly obvious way.  I think the film THINKS it has told us something, but in the blurry, hand-held filming and screams and frantic editing...something is lost.  Something like logic.The director of the film made one of my guilty-pleasure favorites, QUARANTINE and showed much more skill and even gave us a real ending.  Nothing brilliant, but solid throughout, with some actual intelligent performances.  AS ABOVE, SO BELOW is a step backward.  Moderately entertaining overall, but I certainly cannot actually recommend it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SZFZ2321I3I0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5AICVQ#wasThisHelpful","R3SZFZ2321I3I0","A2R1HAXRNU0QX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You know, for $2 a napkin, these are not bad.  They do not ""fake"" being linen, so if you need your guests to think they are eating with fine napkinry (is that a word?), these polyester substitutes will not work.  So bear that in mind.What I do like about them is that they will dress up a modest table, and because of their price, you could order a couple of different colors, depending on the china/dishes you were using.  We have the brown, and they would go with pretty much anything.  They look crisp and are easy to clean afterwards.  They are NOT absorbent, so if you get a spill, don't expect these guys to do any heavy lifting.  They give a table a nice appearance and are a good way to dress things up.  But they'd also do well in a more upscale picnic basket too, in my opinion.  This is another product that is great with the right expectations.Not sure one can say much else about them!

"As a 52 year old adult, I'm probably not the target market for this toy.  So I let a 9 year old boy give it a whirl on my behalf.  He did need adult supervision putting it together.

We were shooting across the length of a medium size house...down a long hallway and into this kid's bedroom.  The darts flew straight and true and hit the back wall still going at good speed.  I do worry just a bit that kids thinking they've got something more like a Nerf toy MIGHT be able to actually hurt someone a little...but overall, this is an excellent toy that lives up to its promise entirely.  As a note, the darts it comes with LOOK like Nerf darts, but when we tried the Nerf darts from another toy, they did NOT fly much further than they usually did with the Nerf toy.Oh, and the other cool thing?  You can fire TWO darts at once.  THAT is a blast.  And when they hit their target, they are only slightly further apart than they started on the gun.  It's actually pretty amazing the force and accuracy of this toy.  We (all us adults) were quite impressed.  And the 9 year-old was THRILLED.  Yes, the toy is pricey.  But if it sounds up your alley and you have the funds...I don't think you'll be disappointed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OP0EJHWHAKPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5YA2TY#wasThisHelpful","R2OP0EJHWHAKPG","A2R1HAXRNU0QX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A LONELY PLACE TO DIE is a low-budget thriller that almost completely overcomes the limitations of its budget because it uses the magnificent scenery of the Scottish Highlands as almost a special effect of its own.  Some of the most gorgeous scenery I've seen in a film outside of a LORD OF THE RINGS film in quite awhile.  The land is gorgeous looking, but also sparse and forbidding.  It's the kind of place that reminds you that the wild really still is WILD.At the beginning of the film, we meet three rock climbers scaling one of these tricky mountains.  There is a mishap and a near disaster ensues.  It gets the heart pumping, but also helps establish the pecking order of the characters.  They soon meet two more friends and we discover these 5 companions have met up in this secluded area to hike and to climb.  The next day, they head out on their journey, and adventures ensue.  I don't want to spoil anything, which is tough...but let's  say that while nature continues to be demanding, they run into more danger via happenstance encounters with some REALLY bad folks.  They also have the misfortune to find someone in danger and take it upon themselves (as good citizens of the world) to help that person...much to their personal cost.  The film is man vs. nature, man vs. man, and man vs. himself (or at least, his closest friends).Once events begin to unfold, they move quickly and almost unrelentingly.  We've never gotten more than sketches of these characters, but it's enough for us to pick up on the dynamics and to begin to appreciate that people show bravery and competence in different ways.  Towards the end, the film becomes particularly violent, and by no means is this a movie for children.  I enjoyed the thrills in the earlier parts of the movie a bit better, but overall the action was satisfying.Unfortunately, the characters also sometimes do things that aren't always logical.  Yes, they are under duress, so some silliness can be excused, but honestly, a couple of the folks act as though they've never seen a movie with crazy killers before!  And I have to say the very ending of the film is a significant let-down.  A real ""huh"" moment for me.  Maybe I missed something, because there are a lot of competing accents in this film...but one of the characters introduced very late in film just does something that appears to fly in the face of the motivations established earlier.  I apologize again for sounding vague...but part of the fun of the film are some of the unexpected places it takes you.  They aren't ""twists"" necessarily, but just some interesting, amusing or exciting alley-ways.The film IS gorgeously shot.  Yes, the scenery helps, but the filmmakers also knew they had something special and they made the most of it.  The physical competence of the characters is very visceral and convincing.  The actors at least seem like they might know how to rock climb.  No one gives an Oscar worthy performance, but everyone is very solid.  Melissa George stands out as the ""good guy"" and Sean Harris makes an excellent villain.  He's competent at being ""bad"" to be quite dangerous, but Harris gives him a bit of the psycho edge too...so we know he's smart but liable to do something a bit stupid because it suits his looney streak.Not a perfect film by any means.  But if you want something a little grittier and more rooted in the ""real"" world than many Hollywood action blockbusters, but still nice and exciting, I hope you'll give the sadly overlooked A LONELY PLACE TO DIE a look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSDANK9XBUEPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006JSY2GU#wasThisHelpful","RSDANK9XBUEPA","A2R1HAXRNU0QX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not a very adept assembler.  Even when following directions, I can struggle.  Sad to admit, but true.  But this chair came together for me in about 10-15 minutes.  Everything fit together as it needed to and I was overall very pleasantly pleased.The chair itself is fairly utilitarian.  It is not the handsomest task chair I've ever seen, but the black at least makes it all look crisp, clean and functional.  This is an OFFICE chair.  It says, ""I'm here for you to accomplish business with.  I'll support you and let your roll around your desk area.  I will not bring a sense of design fashion to your space.""  And that's okay, because it DOES feel good.  I'm not terribly picky about my office chairs...when I walk into a new office, I generally make peace with whatever is there.  But I do like this chair and the lower back support it provides.  It doesn't have a lot of sophisticated adjustments that you can make, but I found it quite nice right from the get go.  I haven't used it long enough to testify to its durability, but it sure has a good, sturdy feel.  You can really feel the difference between this chair and a more standard $80-90 task chair from Staples.  While this piece of furniture will never make me do backflips BUT is delivers in the important ways.  I recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H22NIV8GYUTG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVKEZQQ#wasThisHelpful","R1H22NIV8GYUTG","A2R1HAXRNU0QX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is NOT a tablecloth for fine dining situations.  It is a polyester fabric that for all the world feels almost like a shower curtain.  It looks like a woven cloth, but it also looks like a picnic tablecloth.These are not bad things, per se.  Just set expectations correctly.  For a more informal dinner or perhaps if you're also entertaining a bunch of kids, this is a great choice.  It's EASY to clean up, yet dresses up a table nicely. I see it working very well for party situations, when you're trying to match your party dishes to the cake to the decorations (and now, the tablecloth).  These tablecloths, in general, are fairly inexpensive, so I can see a situation in which you might have a small handful, so you can select the best color for a specific occasion.  And YES, they would make excellent clothes for an outdoor dining situation as well.  Again, cleanup, either via spot cleaning or in the washing machine, is pretty painless and pretty effective.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UQ1185H0V8D9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R68JMH6#wasThisHelpful","R2UQ1185H0V8D9","A2R1HAXRNU0QX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This products works.  It is not a MIRACLE worker, but after just two days of use, my teeth are whiter.  I'm very happy to be seeing results so quickly, and this is easier to use than the whitening strips (and theoretically, you can even whiten teeth no one can see).  So for efficacy, I give this 5 stars.I dock one star because of the price.  You'll see that I received a free sample of this product, and based on my limited time use, I can heartily recommend it.  But I'm not wealthy, so I doubt I would keep this stockpiled in my bathroom.  It's just ""too rich for my blood"" and even if I had more money, I just can't imagine actually spending it on this.

"This is a big kitchen towel.  Considerably larger than what I'm used to (and probably what you're used to).  So look at the measurements before ordering and decide if that's right for you.  If size-wise you're good, then I highly recommend the towel.  It's a bit ""expensive"" I suppose, but the quality is there.  It is a very attractive towel (I had the pewter, and it was very nice and subtle).  And it absorbs very well, which for me and kitchen clean-ups is non-negotiable.  I like to be able to wipe down our ample counters, and have the towel actually soak up the water, not just shove it around (like you get with some cheap towels).  This thing does the trick!  And because it's cotton, it also seems to air dry very quickly.I don't even mind the size.  When not in use, we fold it and hang it from our dishwasher handle, and it looks great there, because the stainless steel goes well with the towel.I see no downsides to this item!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI8HEF9TAUN7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UABQJC2#wasThisHelpful","RI8HEF9TAUN7","A2R1HAXRNU0QX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is very tasty tea!  I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I saw the title ""CREAM Early Grey.""  Would this be like the Chai Latte's I've had, where something resembling milk or cream is part of the k-cup experience, resulting in a literally creamy beverage that is also cream colored?  And also, I have to admit that while I occasionally like Earl Grey as a change of pace, I'm not the biggest fan.But I was very pleasantly surprised. First, this tea does NOT come out cream colored.  It's a black tea.  But it has a creamy feeling in the mouth, almost silky.  It is also a very mild tasting Early Grey, not nearly as strongly tasting and scented as I associate with Earl Grey.  I was very pleased by the texture and taste.  The smell was mild as well, I should mention...not quite as engaging as a ""normal"" Early Grey.My only significant issue is price (hence docking it one star).  I'll admit right here, I was sent this item for free as part of the Vine Program.  But, as much as I enjoyed the tea, I will not be purchasing any morenot at its current price.  Pay a buck or more for ONE k-cup is just too much for me.  My budget is such that a daily 60 cent k-cup is a bit of an indulgencebut I cant see my way clear to these higher prices.  Others will obviously have no issues, and thats great too.  But to me, its tough to give 5 stars to something I wouldnt buy again (whatever the reason).

"First of all, this braiser LOOKS amazing.  As soon as we pulled it out of the box, there were lots of ""oohs"" and ""aahs.""  The white enamel is so crisp and clean and inviting, and the overall design is very pleasing.It is advertised as ""light cast iron"" and in my opinion, it doesn't really look or feel like cast iron.  If you're thinking this will fool someone into thinking you're cooking witih cast iron, that isn't going to happen.  This is not to say it doesn't look and feel and perform great...it just doesn't look and feel like cast iron.  In part, this is due to the non-stick finish on the inside.Functionally, it's great as well.  We've had a very short time, but I like that it's deep enough for cooking bigger pieces of meat.  Big hunks of roast, or lots of chicken...with plenty of potato and veggie room.  It works like a deep skillet, but also like a casserole.  It cleans up very well.  Its a sturdy, attractive piece of cookware that I believe will see a lot of use in our household!One tiny little complaint.  The product description says this comes with a cookbook.  The cookbook is a tiny, flimsy little thing with about a dozen recipes, MOST of which dont involve the use of this brazier at all.  The recipes seem quite lovely, but we had hoped for more that would actually pertain to our new brazier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU4N0CRF77SJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LN6WR4C#wasThisHelpful","RU4N0CRF77SJ9","A2R1HAXRNU0QX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS is a blast.  It's a low-budget spoof of low-budget reality shows (including shaky, hand-held camerwork, spotty lighting and questionable zooming) and it focuses on a group of room-mates who happen to be vampires.  The concept is amusing, and for the most part, the execution is excellent.  The film is a bit of a one-joke wonder...but these guys have found every variation of the joke/conceit, and made them work.We're introduced to four vampires, sharing a ramshackle house in Wellington, New Zealand.  Part of what was amusing is that the vampires come from various parts of the world, and are given outrageous accents...none of which are New Zealand.  You've got the old-school Dracula-like vampire from Romania (or thereabouts), a decadent play-boyish type (or at least playboy wannabe) who reminds me of a sleazy, greasy, less suave & attractive version of Eric from TRUE BLOOD.  Then there's the European dandy, who is relatively new to being a vampire and still pines for his long-lost human love. Finally, and to me, funniest of alltheres Peter, the VERY ancient vampire who looks just like Nosferatu from the silent film days.  This vampire only hisses, he cannot speak, but hes one of the best sightgags Ive seen in awhile.Much of the movie just shows these roommates squabbling, grappling with petty vampire problems and looking for a party.  Their immortality has rendered them indifferent to housework and easily bored.  As any full-length one-joke movie must do, eventually some plot is introduced as a brand-new vampire is introduced to the mix and the group must grapple with the training and responsibility for this insolent newbie.  Complications ensue.The movie is just under 90 minutes long, but Ill admit that it occasionally feels stretched.  Inevitably, the joke must grow a little thin, and once in awhile, I felt that thinness.  What keeps the movie fun 97% of the time is the characters.  We actually grow to take an interest in these guys, and there are a few genuinely touching moments by the end.The film does show some blood, but it is only graphic enough to remind us that were dealing with vampires.  It doesnt dwell on the violence, but you never feel its shying away.  The language can be rough, and overall, this is not a movie for kids.This little film, which few will see, turns out to be a delightful, engaging and frequently hilarious surprise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JR6N9AHMAZPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RY823YW#wasThisHelpful","R1JR6N9AHMAZPE","A2R1HAXRNU0QX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WILD is a simple story, told with economy against a beautiful, but sometimes sparse and stark scenic background.  Reese Witherspoon plays Cheryl Strayed, a young woman torn apart by grief over the loss of her mother and the consequent behavior she embarks on including infidelity and drug-use.  She is a smart woman with a nice husband, but apparently without the emotional resources to weather the storm of her loss.  Her path could easily have taken her to an early and ugly death.But by good fortune, Cheryl has at least enough on the ball to recognize shes near the bottom, and her plan for redemption is to walk the 1,000+ mile Pacific Crest Traila tough trek for experienced hikers, and a brutal one for Strayed, who doesnt have the know-how.Despite this being a true story, the basic premise has the ring of clich.  A personal journey of redemption, as this troubled woman is both worn down and built back up by the impersonal harshness of nature.  And thats true.  But it is told amazingly well, has far more humor than you would think, and features the best performance of Reese Witherspoons career.  She is never anything less than magnetic, and her face shows you all you need to know about what shes thinking and experiencing.  Witherspoon clearly connected with her character, and shes a marvel to watch.  Its easy to take her for granted as a performer sometimes, but WILD will remind you that behind the frivolous faade of characters like Elle in LEGALLY BLONDE, Witherspoon has a unique presence that she can bring to bear for the right material.I didnt know much about the Pacific Crest Trail, and I assumed Id just see one vista of startling beauty after another.  But a lot of it is desert, and it isnt always glorious.  Sometimes it seems dry, dusty, windy and unforgiving.  Watching Cheryl cope with the early days of life on the trail, trying to set up her tent, trying to make decent food, forcing herself NOT to give up, is much of the drama of the story.  But its done so well, and with such a strong dose of welcome humor that were with her all the way.There are lots of flashbacks in the film, so that we understand to some degree what Strayed is going through.  Many feature scenes of her with her mother (Laura Dern, playing what seemed to me to be a variation of her nutty character on ENLIGHTENED).  Clearly, Strayed relied so heavily on her mother for love, courage and stabilityand when she loses that we see her unmooring.Its heavy stuff, but I cant emphasize enough that Witherspoon and director Jean-Marc Vallee (the excellent DALLAS BUYERS CLUB) bring big doses of humor to this film.  Life on the trail also brings plenty of chance encounters with amusing characters and amusing circumstances.  The film never drags and while the journey of personal redemption theme is an old chestnutthe landscape, the approach and the lead performance make this a must-see, in my book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RTISA6SC8WMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RVC0S1G#wasThisHelpful","R2RTISA6SC8WMU","A2R1HAXRNU0QX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Maybe this concept has existed for years, but I've never seen it.  But to me, this ""over-the-corner"" colander is one of the most obvious improvements to a standard kitchen product that I've seen.  WE LOVE IT!The typical collander sits in the middle of your sink and it's tough to find good room to work around it.  Essentially, the sink becomes useless for other purposes as long as you're draining something in the collander.  This OXO product hangs on the corner of the sink and thus the rest of the sink is free to work on.  If you're rinsing various vegetables, as you finish, just toss them in the collander to drain and you can just keep working.  It's such a simple concept, but we've just been thrilled with it.This particular product is very sturdy and it grips the sink REALLY well.  No chance of it getting top-heavy and tipping over and spilling into the sink.  Not really much chance of accidentally bumping it and disloding it either.

"I'm a guy.  A 51-year-old guy.  So I am not a shampoo snob by any stretch.  I like my hair, which I was every day, to be clean.  And I don't want to smell perfumy.  I don't worry or notice things like ""full body"" or ""damaged"", etc.This Herbal Essences shampoo fit my modest standards very ably. In particular, I liked the smell.  It's actually fairly subtle and just little fruity.  It's a nice pleasant smell that is absolutely NOT perfumy or ""artificial"".  (Although I'm sure the scent is to a large degree artificial, it doesn't immediately come across that way.)  It lathers up very nicely, and overall simply gives me what I am looking for.  I'm sorry this isn't much help to many out there...but if you, like me, dislike overbearing scents, then you should be well pleased by this product.  I'll certainly buy more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPOPUCVW43ZIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP25LBW#wasThisHelpful","RPOPUCVW43ZIE","A2R1HAXRNU0QX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heres MOVING DAY (at least the set up) in a nutshell.  An elderly couple in their 70s has decided to downsize their east coast home and move to something smaller in California.  Theyve had successful lives and hes had a successful career.  Kids are grown and doing well.  Family business handed over to the capable eldest son.  Time to pack up the expensive antiques and valuable paintings and slip into a pleasant, well-deserved retirement.  And when the movers show up a day early, it must be that the couple has simply mis-remembered the day.  And the movers are so polite and competent anyway.  And sure enough, the next day, the REAL movers show up.  And Mr. & Mrs. Stanley Peke are suddenly bereft of all their earthly possessions, a lifetime of memories gone.But the thief has underestimated Stanley Peke and unknowingly tangled with one tough and determined old bird.  And therein lies most of the drama of MOVING DAY.Author Jonathan Stone gives us an excellent set-up for his interesting but uneven thriller.  I really dont want to spoil much more, but lets just say that Stanley Peke is much more than just a successful, upper, upper-middle class businessman.  He has an interesting back story.  And interesting motivations for what he does.  Stone, unfortunately, spends HUGE (and I mean HUGE) amounts of time justifying Pekes actions to the reader.  Yes, a 72 year old man should probably not be taking the law and detective work into his own hands (and leaving everyone out of the picture).  But we get a clear picture of the type of man Peke is early on, and MUCH of this internal monologue is just the same thing over and over, simply presented in slightly different ways.  Stone tries too hard to make us believe this old codger would do the things he does.  As a reader, I was super frustrated, because this caused the plot to grind to a CRAWL.Stone also spends a lot of time trying to inform us about the back story and motivations of the criminal mastermind Nick.  A bit of this is admirable and interesting, but for awhile, I worried wed spend the entire book just bouncing back and forth between the two characters as they think about their pasts and how their present is motivated by it.  NOTHING HAPPENED for huge chunks of the book.Towards the end, some of the psychological buildup has a bit of payoff (although really for PekeNick becomes more generic as the novel progress).  And events to finally begin to move swiftly and mostly satisfyingly.  There are numerous tense moments, and I have to say the final 25% of the book was well-done: tense and exciting.  But honest-to-goodness, the explanations of the motivations and thought processes CONSTANTLY throughout the book were just too much.  Im glad Stone was so excited by his characterbut too often he spends way more time TELLING than SHOWING.  Often Pekes actions and words are all we need to understand himbut no, we have to have it painstakingly told to us.MOVING DAY, I believe, could easily have been 20% shorter and have much swifter and more gripping, and no less psychologically complex.  I do not regret taking on this book, but Id hesitate to try another book by this author.(By the way, I mostly experienced this as an audiobook.  The narrator was good, but spoke very distinctly and slowly.  This was very aggravating, but I set the speed on my Kindle Fire to 1.25x and it was perfect.  Still caught all the nuance.  No one sounded like Alvin Chipmunk.  So theres my tip to audiobook listeners.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6LVJ6EXAQ8X8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FN2KR3U#wasThisHelpful","R6LVJ6EXAQ8X8","A2R1HAXRNU0QX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very serviceable chai tea.  I'm not a tea fanatic and frankly I enjoy the scent as much as anything when making hot tea.  And I'm a bit lazy, so usually, my hot teas (whether black, green, chai, earl grey, etc. etc.) are via a k-cup.  Fast and easy.  Hot.  Nice smell.The Tattle Tea Chai is, to my untrained palate, a step above k-cup chai tea or an inexpensive grocery store chai.  It certainly has a strong and pleasant scent, both in the bag or after brewing.  Loose leaves, of course, do smell better than a tea bag that's been sitting on a shelf for weeks.  I won't say, though, that this is the best tasting chai of my life.  To me, the taste was not as strong as the scent.  I had hoped for more of a spicy kick.  It isn't bad...and again, it's better than cheap stuff (which is what I generally have), but I've sampled better at Teavana or even from a ""fancy"" coffee shop.  For me, it would not be worth the extra money for the slight improvement in taste and the inconvenience of making loose-leaf tea (I told you I was lazy about my tea.)  It's perfectly fine, and I'm sure the less lazy won't mind the extra effort.I've spent so much time describing my own tea habits so that, hopefully, you can put my thoughts into proper context.

"Overall, this is a very nice scale.  It has excellent features like measuring BMI that are, for me, a first.  I've had more ""old school"" scales all my life, so this was a fun toy to play with.  Frankly, though, for me, just weighing me is still what I'm most interested in!But it delivers what it says it will, and it's very nice and sturdy looking.  My only issue or warning relates to the set-up.  BE CAREFUL.  Don't even touch the thing until you've read the first few steps of the set up.

"Badminton is one of those games that people of all ages and athletic abilities like to play.  Not necessarily play well, but it's fun.  You don't have to have incredible ability to participate and theoretically it can be played just about anywhere outside where you can find a flat surface (and hopefully minimal wind!).  But you really need to have a net to make it fun.  And this is where Zume Games has stepped in.This set weighs only a few pounds and is easy to carry.  When it arrived, I challenged my daughter and myself to see how fast we could go from complete ignorance of its contents to actually playing the game.  Try 5 minutes.  EVERYTHING you need is in this zippered case which is the size of a large briefcase / small suitcase.  There are 4 rackets, 2 birdies, a net and the expandable poles you need to hand the net between.  The poles also snap into the case itself, which serves as the base.  (By the way, it takes about 2 minutes to take down and put away.  3 if only one person is doing it.)Let's be clear.  This is not a regulation sized net.  It is meant to allow a group of a casual players to just quickly start playing with a minimal of hassle.  It's lower than most nets (great for kids) and not as wide (great for smaller places).  This is the kind of thing you take on a picnic or outing...or quickly throw up in your yard when you've got some company over.  We love it and have already had lots of fun.The rackets, I will admit, are pretty cheap.  And don't encourage kids to hit the actual net...it doesn't look like it would do well under abuse.  But it truly lives up to the description of ""portable"" and I'm just completely thrilled with this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPTEMK3KGGJGU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EFY9EYU#wasThisHelpful","RPTEMK3KGGJGU","A2R1HAXRNU0QX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the years, I've used various versions of Pinnacle to try to wrangle my home movies into something resembling entertainment!  Until I received 18 Plus, I had been using 16 for a couple of years.  My overall feelings about this program have never really changed.  It is important to note:  I am not a filmmaker.  I have no commercial applications I'm trying to fill.  I have no aspirations to be the next Scorcese.  But I like to film a lot on vacations and such, and because I'm such an amateur, I usually end up with lots of pretty boring footage.  My goal is to simply trim that down into something entertaining, with some sub-titles where needed, a bit of humor injected via effects, etc. and the ability to add music where appropriate and to turn that music up or down.  I will use other features AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE.  I don't sit around wondering where features are.  I don't think about what is MISSING from the program...I think about how easy (or not) it is to use what I do have available to me.To an amateur like me, Pinnacle provides LOTS of options and choices and for the most part, they are easy to use.  I find the program to always have been fairly intuitive.  (It won't make you a great filmmaker or editor, that's still up to the limits of YOUR artistic ability.)  But if I want to drop an .mp3 into a specific section of the video, it's a piece of cake.  Want a fun title menu?  Take your pick of scads of pre-made one?  Need subtitles?  Well, you've got thousands of choices.I know there are simpler programs out there, but for various reasons over the years (came free with a new camcorder, was on sale, etc.), I keep ending up with Pinnacle.  And of course, it's usually the latest or next to latest version.  So here comes my difficulty.  I generally don't own the most up-to-date computer.  Currently, I have a 4 year old Dell laptop.  It works great for almost everything.  But boy, oh, boy...when it comes time to actually render the video onto disc...watch out!  Usually I'll start rendering a 30 minute video when I know I'm leaving the house for a couple of hours.  The process is VERY slow, and often (33% of the time), I end up with either an error mid-stream that scraps the whole process OR there's an error on the disc, and mid-way through, it stops working.  But I'm pretty confident it's because I'm asking my computer to stretch to the edge of its limits.  If I went back to version 11 of Pinnacle, I'd probably be in great shape.  But I wouldn't have all the fun extras!Pinnacle is pretty good, in my view, of providing lots of templates (whether for titles, sub-titles, scene changes, etc.)  It's these bells and whistles that I enjoy, but getting them no doubt drops my rendering experience down several pegs.  But blank discs are cheap, so I'm willing to endure some failed renderings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PF0TDVZJ0ALE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OW2PJ5I#wasThisHelpful","R3PF0TDVZJ0ALE","A2R1HAXRNU0QX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We love this product.  In our home, traditionally, the storage area under our kitchen sink has been a bit of a disaster.  We are far from sloppy people or poor housekeepers, but nonetheless, wet things frequently have gone under there.  Sponges.  Dish soap with the lid not quite closed all the way...so when it tips over it leaves a slippery puddle, etc.  In fact, when we moved not too long ago, we found warped wood under out sink and had to repair the area.  Just a pain in the rear, and it looked bad too.This non adhesive, rubbery stuff is a bit like shelf liner, but it is more substantial too.  It exists because apparently we aren't the only people with spills and messes under our sinks.  It goes on like a breeze (the most complicated thing is cutting the piece to the size ou want with a pair of scissors!)  It just goes down and it's done!  If we do make a mess, it doesn't soak through to the wood below, and because of the rubbery material, it's easy to clean up.  It reduces noise a bit too.Our color is taupe and it really blends with just about anything.  While our cabinet doors are wood, the floor of the cabinets are white and this is a good compromise color.While under-sink liner is not exactly a product I think a lot about and is hard to get enthusiastic over...this is a solid product that delivers exactly what it says it does.

"This is an okay toy, but it's a battery hog (required a bunch of batteries up front) and we found the RC controls to be a bit problematic.  But in the end, the replay value of this toy just wasn't that great...and that's really why I'm only giving it 3 stars.  One can deal with less than wonderful RC (heck, a little kid can just move this thing around by hand if it comes to that)...but all the destroyer really does is fire these green balls and you're essentially using this blast to try to knock down some of the little figures.  Oh, and the little figures are done failry poorly.  Granted, they are small, but the level of detail seems pretty low (and for a Star Wars toy, this is pretty surprising).

"It works just as advertised.  You plug one end into the cigarette lighter of your car.  And just like that, you have TWO care outlets.  We'll use it for longer car trips so we can each charge our iphones using our pre-existing car chargers (My wife has one that lives in her car and I have one that lives in mine).

"Does exactly what it says it does.  It is a no-frills, no-perfumy smell ointment that is a step above being a moisturizer.  A moisturizer, in my mind, is something you can apply liberally over large parts of your body, such as arms and legs.  It's good for modestly dry skin, might smell nice, and is almost more of a psychological comfort than anything.  HOWEVER, Aquaphor is meant, in my opinion, for the targeting of truly dry, cracked places.  It gets in deep and if your cracks are too bad, you can even feel the sting of it working.  It is NOT glamorous...it's more medicine than a toiletry item.  Cracked ankles, feet, elbows are great spots for using it.  It does leave a little bit of a greasy residue on your hands when applying, but other than that...it's a nearly perfect product.

"I've enjoyed Dove soap bars over the years.  The white bars are about as perfume free as you can get.  It's like cleaning yourself with a silky cream.  We've generally used Dove just for our faces though and stuck with ""regular"" soap for everything else.The body wash gives you pretty much the exact same experience and feeling as the bar.  It all depends on how much you like Dove soap.  It's certainly gentle and has a very mild smell.  It does feel moisturizing.  My only hesitancy is that I've always questioned how good Dove was for just simply cleaning off dirt.  (Not that I'm particularly dirty.)  It's a psychological thing for me, I think, but sometimes with Dove I feel like I'm cleaning myself with a body lotion, not a soap.Note that the 34oz bottle is pretty darn big.

"This review is geared primarily to folks whove read the book, but nonetheless, Im going to try really hard to avoid spoilers, but just the fact that everyone knows GONE GIRL has a spoiler to be avoided at all costs sets anyone up to expect something major.  If youve read the book, you know what Im talking about.Lets say this:  the middle-of-the-book twist in GONE GIRL was more effective in the book.  It isnt poorly done in the movie, but this is an instance where WRITING (done correctly, which author Gillian Flynn did) is simply more effective at obfuscating than a movie can ever be (even though Gillian Flynn wrote the screenplay).  But its still fun.The book is also noted for an ending that many found dissatisfying (myself included).  While I understood what was happening, and even the social commentary being madeI was dissatisfied that Flynn couldnt pull of something more impactful.  The book is SO very well written that theres no denying Flynn has significant talentbut she wasnt quite up to her own ideas of the story should wrap up.  The movie, in this case, handles it a bit better.  I wont say if the ending is DIFFERENT, per sebut in this case, I felt the visual medium actually served the story better.Now that we have that pussy-footing out of the way, what about the movie overall?  Well, Im happy to report that the film is extremely solid and utterly gripping throughout.  Director David Fincher is undeniably a director of great strength.  He handles tone well, and he handles MOOD well.  His films are always impeccably crafted, and he handles the color grey (in all its shades) very well.  (Think about how much grey is in PANIC ROOM or GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO.)  I cannot fault his work here.  But where he has REALLY succeeded is with his cast.  I loved everyone, really.Ben Affleck has never been one of my favorite actors.  Hes certainly improved later in life, (and no doubt he has proven himself a really fine director), hes a bit bland.  A charming guy with a gloss of insincerity over almost everything he does.  I think of one of his better performances (in ARGO)that character spends most of the moving PRETENDING to be something else, and he also hides his feelings & tension from the hostages hes trying to free.  He seldom shows his real persona.  Its that trait that works so well for him in GONE GIRL.  Hes seemingly our heroyet were also not surprised when some darker things come out.  Hes charming.  Hes superficial.  Theres a famous scene in the book when Afflecks character is first being interviewed by the press (after his wifes kidnappingno spoilers).  He smiles, because hes uncomfortable knowing what to do in front of the cameraand this smile causes suspicion and dislike to fall upon him.  Affleck handles this perfectly.Rosemund Pike will be revelation to some.  Ive enjoyed her in a wide variety of roles, and shes certainly had a varied career that never quite made her a breakout.  She did action in DOOM (yes, DOOM!), she has done period pieces in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, comedy in THE WORLDS END and more.  But she is a striking presence and a marvelous cipher in GONE GIRL.  Her porcelain skin (and Ive NEVER, EVER used the adjective porecelain before) makes her seem delicate and lovely.  But her eyes allow her to go across all spectrums of emotion (again, cant be more specific without spoiling).  I would not have picked her for this critical role, but Fincher did, and he was right.My favorites, though, are two supporting characters.  Kim Dickens (recently in a minor role on SONS OF ANARCHY) is simply terrific as one of the cops investigating the case.  Shes exactly the sort of cop wed all want if WE were accused of a crime we didnt commit.  Fair, forthright, not willing to jump to conclusions but also very quick to put two-and-two together.  Her role was not flashy, but she steals almost every scene shes in be the power of her competence.  And Carrie Coon (who I didnt really know before) plays Afflecks sister.  Its a pretty pivotal role, and she gets everything out of it and more.  She takes an already excellent character in the book, and makes this multi-faceted woman unforgettable.  Id like to say she should be nominated for Best Supporting Actress, but well see if shes remembered come awards season.Also fun:  Neil Patrick Harrishes a bit of comic relief, but hes such a delight.  Tyler Perry as Afflecks attorney is completely credible and engaging.  I could almost see a TV series coming out of this character.  Patrick Fugit, as Kim Dickens partner, is fun as well.  Hes the more jump-to-conclusions cop and his snarky asides serve the film well.  Only Emily Ratajowski (of Blurred Lines video fame) is poorly cast.  Her character in the book (no spoiler from me) is more fleshed out, and thus she has little to work with.  An actress of her limited skill is unable to make these meager pieces into a likeable characterand the story is more effective when her character is a bigger part.I highly recommend the movie.  It isnt a message film.  It wont stir lively social debate.  It wont make anyones Greatest 100 Films of All Time list.  But it delivers exciting, thoughtful, funny, fast paced and tension filled drama and is a wallop of pure movie entertainment.  And boy, after this drab summer at the movies, that makes this film all the more welcome!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA6XEIR634MSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4USLK8#wasThisHelpful","RA6XEIR634MSD","A2R1HAXRNU0QX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I still remember the days when ""contact paper"" was a huge pain in the rear.  Not only did you have to cut the piece to size, but getting it in place without wrinkles, or being crooked, etc. was a challenge.  The new trend in shelf liner is these squishy, sticky sheets that are much more simple to peel up and restick if you mess up.  Overall, they are easier to put in place and I like the extra feature that the items you then put in the drawer or on the shelf are less likely to slide around themselves, because the liner creates its own tackiness.This particular product has less plastic and more ""air"" than most of this type that I have seen.  I have to admit, I'm not sure I like that.  It still works, but it looks, to my eye, a bit cheaper.  Air is free...plastic or rubber is the added ingredient.  One might argue that this product is better for the environment, but it just doesn't look as nice in a drawer.I've used it in our new home in some shelving in the garage and such, but have elected NOT to use it in our kitchen.

"One of my main gripes about plastic trash bags, particularly those for tall kitchen containers, is their tendency to not stay in place.  Slowly, the bag begins to creep up around the lip of the trash can and a corner or two starts to sag into the container.  It's a petty thing, but I want to be able to open the lid of my can and easily throw trash in without missing the bag!  If I hit the inside of the container, I ought to be hitting the darn bag.Some of these new Hefty bags have this ""gripper"" feature, and it seems to work pretty darn well.  It hugs the edge of our kitchen trash can much better.  I've not yet had one slip as described above.  Yea!!  Victory!!I'm not a big fan of scenteded trash bags...sometimes the scent can be pretty bad and it gets on my hands when putting in a new bag or throwing out the trash.  I like the idea in THEORY, because who wants to smell their trash?  But in reality, some of the scents out there (such as lavender) are too perfumy.  This ""Clean Burst"" scent is less offensive for me, so I give that feature a tentative thumbs-up too.Finally, these bags are ""ultimate"" because they can carry much more without breaking.  I can't really speak to that...it's pretty rare for me to overstuff even the cheap bags to the point where they rip.  This Hefty bag SEEMS like it is sturdier...but I have no experience in testing its limits.These bags are pretty pricey.

"These are really lovely.  I'm afraid there isn't a lot I can say about a teatowel...but my wife and I really like these.  They're very plain, simple and attractive.  Not fussy at all.

"These clothes feel like something from a bygone age.  Many products describe themselves as basic or simple...but these clothes live up to that.  They feel like an all natural cross between muslin and cotton (I know, weird).  They aren't the softest in the world, but they aren't abrasive.  They ARE oversized and can practically be used as a little table cloth for a small table.  I can see using them as clothes for picnic tables or other casual dining (I imagine them being issued to individual guests at a crawfish broil in a backyard).  They are meant to be like dishtowels, but they are much bigger.I haven't had them long enough to know if they eventually stain.  They SEEM like after cleaning up some messy spills, it might be difficult to get them back to their natural white color.  Perhaps that's why you get so many in the pack.  I don't think these will last for the long haul, the edges are not finished off totally, so I can already see a little bit of fraying.  But again, they have a 19th century kinda feel to them, so the fraying only adds to the charm.My major issue is that these don't suit the decor of most modern kitchens, in my opinion.  I like these, but we don't display them...we still have our usual dish towels that were purchase to compliment our kitchen.  BUT, that doesn't mean we don't use them...they are kept in a handy cabinet and have many purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKGMTS63HNV47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IYIVZFO#wasThisHelpful","RKGMTS63HNV47","A2R1HAXRNU0QX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We had a newly purchased HP 15.6 inch laptop, so when I had the opportunity to acquire this item, it felt like the stars had aligned!  And when it arrived, it looked great. Sleek and shiny.So with much anticipation, the application of the sleeve began.  It did not work.  Simple as that.  The 15.6"" laptop would no longer close quite all the way, and frankly, we had to stretch the material SO tight to just get it on, we were worried about damaging the computer.  To give the benefit of the doubt, I should mention that our laptop has a somewhat large bezel (the edge around the screen).  Not all 15.6"" are quite the same.  Perhaps with a slightly smaller bezel, it would have worked.  But it says 15.6"" and we have a 15.6"", so I'm not willing to cut much slack.And on top of everything else, it smelled bad!  I think  that was actually the final straw that had us take the darn thing off.  It didn't fit right and it stunk.  Why keep it??!!I'm not going all the way down to 1 star, because I can still see someone with a slightly smaller computer getting this to work, and if they had a not-so-keen sense of smell, they wouldn't mind.

"I read most of the reviews on this shirt and for me the shirt fits nicely. I'm 6' tall and weigh 165 athletic build. This is not a snug fitting shirt and its not overly loose. The photo of the model on this shirt pretty much is how the shirt looks on me. Its long enough to tuck in if I wanted too.The material is on the thinner side so that's why I gave it 4 stars. If the material was a bit thicker it would have been perfect. Its soft, very comfortable and the tag on the neck does not scratch or irritate you.

"I got the blue ones...great color. I've been wanting to try silicone versions because the regular plastic trays seem to chip and crack the actual ice. The silicone trays hold more water making it take double the time to freeze. I also had a difficult time getting them to pop out of the tray. While its flexible, one corner gets stuck when you try to work the opposite corner.I'll be honest and say that these are just ok. They are real big cubes and take up a lot of space in your glass so you'll get less of your beverage. These are probably great for one of those short wide glasses with your favorite liquor. but for everyday, they are a little bit of a hassle in my opinion.

"These are really great cutting boards. They are solid and have a good weight to them so they aren't moving all over the counter when cutting stuff. The large one can tackle just about anything and there's plenty of room for cutting multiple items. The smaller one is more narrow and i've used it as a cheese platter. I cut some slices and put it on the table so people can cut themselves their own slices.They are definitely worth the price and are of great quality. The thickness of these boards is also great and they don't feel cheaply made. Bamboo will outlast regular wood and doesn't nick as easily from your knife. After a while the boards might fade but just get a real high quality bamboo oil and they will refresh to brand new again.If there are any stains i use a little baking soda and cut a lemon or lime and use that to scrub the boards to sanitize them and get out stains.+ i received this item at a discount for my honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WXNLN7EHNO2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016APUWJM#wasThisHelpful","R2WXNLN7EHNO2O","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When i got the box i immediately said to myself how heavy it was. The packaging was really nice although large, its definitely a sign of quality. The box did have a glue chemical smell which i thought was strange. The watch itself is also very heavy, thick but striking to look at. Its a very masculine watch at the same time being elegant.Nice gold accents on the face with big hands that are easy to read. Day, date and 24hr mini faces are on the face of this particular watch. One thing i found was that you can accidentally hit the quick buttons and make the date, day and 24hr bump ahead by mistake. Kind of unnecessary buttons in my opinion. It doesn't make any kind of tick tick sound which is nice because i usually put my watch on the dresser at night and theres nothing worse then hearing that faint tick tick when you are trying to sleep.This is definitely a watch for a bigger guy because of the size of it. If you have a smaller wrist it will feel like you strapped a brick to your wrist because its so big and heavy. For me its a little larger than I like but once on it is nice and comfortable. It definitely can be a casual and dress watch because of its looks.The watch is water resistance to 100 feet but because its so nice i wouldn't want to get it wet like that. You will need to bring it to a jeweler or watch repair place to get the battery professionally replaced to keep the water resistance intact.I'm a watch collector and this one is a very nice and different addition to my collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HB77NTCZMQ1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011N5PRUS#wasThisHelpful","R2HB77NTCZMQ1E","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What an excellent laptop briefcase bag. Its made tough for daily use and also for travel. I use it for travel because its sturdy, comfortable to hold and most of all its compact. I can fit my 15"" laptop and my iPad plus all the cords and accessories needed for both and it still has room for much more.There are many of compartments both outside and inside. There are even compartments inside of compartments. One compartment has a small strap with a clip at the end to keep your keys from getting lost in the bag. Pens, papers, misc items, there's room for all of it or a compartment too.Upon first glance, you can tell that the bag is made very very well. The zippers are thick and the metal parts are heavy materials too. I highly doubt these will ever break. It has faux leather accents on the handles, bottom and shoulder strap. It comes in nice colors too.  The sewing is perfect, no loose threads or uneven seams. You also register the bag with Tumi which can return your bag if it gets lost. (probably empty but its  a nice thing they offer).The only issue is its so expensive most cannot afford or would want to put that much money into a briefcase.  However, it looks expensive, the materials are high grade so you do get high quality for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZL51X4YS9028/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XC7TMS4#wasThisHelpful","R1ZL51X4YS9028","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had expected the printer to be larger but epson has done a great job in keeping the profile of this one small. Because its able to handle 11x17 its going to be wider than the usual printers that handle only 8.5x11. It doesn't have a sheet feeder on the top so this saves some size on it. Most people who get this printer aren't concerned that it doesn't have the paper feeder on the top. You bought this to make 11x17 prints as well as scan legal sized documents.One of my favs on this printer is that you can print right on dvd/cd's. I make a lot of discs so its a great way to label them rather than writing on them and have them look junky. You can print on just about every paper size up to 11x17. Its a fast printer as well although when you use it on photo paper and high/fine settings it will run slower than just plain paper but thats acceptable because the prints look amazing.Copy scan, print wireless, AirPrint from iPad, iPhone android smartphone. There is no faxing but really who does that anymore. Its got a nice 4.3 touch screen which really makes life easy, no million buttons like older models had.This printer takes 6 inks...yes 6...the usual CMYB and the addition of light cyan and light magenta. So refilling standard inks will run around $65. if you go for the XL capacity inks be prepared to spend about $16 per cartridge or about $90 in the multi pack. Luckily for me black and magenta always seem to be the ones that run out so i can just buy the inks as needed.This printer is a great machine that does a great job on 11x17 size as well as the standard 8.5x11. So if you are looking for a great all around machine that can handle larger format, definitely give this one a try. Epson really makes great printers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7ENE3OWGEH10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU5Y1O#wasThisHelpful","R7ENE3OWGEH10","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have the larger Cameo which is awesome. The new smaller Curio is best for card making, embossing, etching. It can only go up to 8.5x12 by purchasing a separate cutting mat. It comes with an 8.5x6 which should be fine for most. It comes with one cutter and a fine and wide embossing tool. The etching tool is another separate accessory. You also get an embossing mat (as well as the cutting mat) in the kit and of course the software, plug, usb cord, free trial to the design store and 50 free design downloads.If you have or are familiar with other Silhouette cutters, then this one will be easy to figure out. It also uses the Studio software. It comes with the disc but i would download right from the website to have the latest version.The hardest thing is to configure the cutting, embossing, etching settings. What i mean is that you need to have the paper type, thickness, depth etc. I was cutting stickers that I printed and it took me 3 tries to get it right. First i had the cut depth too deep and when i peeled the sticker sheet off the mat, the cut outs were stuck to the mat. I also had problems with the stickers peeling while the machine was cutting and getting stuck to the cutter tool. If you buy other paper not made by Silhouette you will have a lot of trial and error to get things just right.other reviewers recommended watching videos on it...although this is a brand new machine (at time of this review) and there aren't any curio youtube vids yet...you can get the same info from the cameo vids.Both the camera and curio has a little learning curve but once you get that all down its a breeze to use. If i had to choose which is better i'd go with the cameo, its got a larger platform and you can do vinyl, and pixscan.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JF19S82FUAYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOU0W4K#wasThisHelpful","R3JF19S82FUAYY","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very elegant and inexpensive nice watch. the face is nice and easy to read. the hands have that glow stuff on them so you can read it in the dark. The band may need to be sized if you have a small wrist. this will have to be done at a watch repair/jewelry shop.the watch comes wrapped in plastic to keep it from getting scratched up. Its a little difficult to unwrap it all so have patience. The watch is water resistant to 165 feet but I don't know anyone who will wear this type of watch and go diving. Being its that waterproof, i doubt you can replace the battery yourself. Again it will have to be brought to a professional jeweler. There is a 15 year limited warranty and the inclosed instructions mention $15.00 fee when you send it back to the manufacturer for repair.Its a nice watch for a gift or for that someone special but know that you will most likely need to have it sized.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IHDUNZBU9E0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JXGQFC#wasThisHelpful","R1IHDUNZBU9E0L","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This speaker is a bit larger than expected. Its not as portable as others on the market. I think this would be more the home speaker. What I really like about this is that the clarity of the sound is definitely superior than most. I have a Braven 805 speaker and its smaller but the volume really over powers the NYNE. This was a bit of a surprise to me. Comparing them, the sound of the Braven was a bit more muffled as it didn't have the clarity in the treble as the NYNE. The NYNE is definitely a winner in sound quality as it was crisp, clear and booming bass.This has a few cool features like the NFC pairing which was a simple tap and it worked great. I do like the larger buttons on top. Each button is for its own function no multiple function buttons to confuse or mess you up. It has a nice carrying handle in the back built in. You can also charge your USB devices with the power bank in the back. It also has an external aux 3.5 plug for non bluetooth devices. Hands free calling, 10 hour battery life. There's also an additional on off switch on the back that keeps the top buttons from being pressed when not in use.Overall its a super sounding speaker. The deep bass actually blows air out of the back port. Its a decent price point for the size speaker and sound quality.its got rubber coating on the sides and top. The grating is metal.  Its not as portable as others because of its size.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V7YD01WLIYAV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JFMLS0#wasThisHelpful","R2V7YD01WLIYAV","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"B+W makes some of the best filters for your camera lenses. This one in particular is fantastic. Its pretty thin which is great as it doesn't add further length or weight to your lenses. The quality of the metal and glass is top of the line. You need to have a top of the line polarizer on your expensive lens or your wasting your time. Inexpensive flyers are inferior quality and will only make your photos less sharp.You also can't get just any polarizer for digital cameras as they won't work correctly. There are linear and circular versions. Its a little involved to fully explain but basically digital cameras need the circular type for proper metering and exposure. Its easy to use and you see the results thru your eye viewer or screen (eye viewer is better). Just slowly spin the filter(its able to freely move even though the filter is screwed to the lens) until your glare disappears  or lessens. You can fiddle with it to your desire.Because the filter is slightly tinted, you will lose about 1-stop which isn't a big deal as other filters can block 2-3 stops. You will be very happy with this purchase its worth the extra money. Your photos will be stunning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AFHILQBTTSAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PH78GOI#wasThisHelpful","R2AFHILQBTTSAR","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read all the reviews before ordering this. I have tried so many other products over the years to extend my summer tan. Some had great color but smelled like rotten fruit. Some smelled ok but were orange. The scent on this one is a bit strong when you first apply it. Its not quite a masculine smell so some guys may want to pass on this. The Xen-Tan works a little differently than other products as you apply it and then after an hour or more you shower it off. This does help get rid of most of the scent.After a few hours your color will develop. I used the special Xen-Tan mitt to help apply the product. The Xen-Tan is a gel not a lotion so it goes on clear which makes it difficult to see where you've applied it. There was no rotten fruit smell afterwards which is a huge plus. I do however feel that it is a bit orange for me. Most people would be ok with the final color but i found in certain lighting it was a bit orange. I've used other products that were either more brown or slightly a red tone which I prefer. That's just me being picky.I recommend that you apply it lightly making sure you cover everything you are putting it on evenly so there are no streaks. Watch out when applying to fingers and toes. Make sure you get into all the creases etc or you'll have streaks. Then after 1 hour shower it all off off. Everyones skin is different so you don't want it to be too dark at first. You want to build up your color or it will look fake. And if you get the mitt, dampen it a little first and you will get better results.Don't get me wrong, this is overall a great self tanner that smells nice when applying and then doesn't have that rotten fruit smell afterwards. Its a little pricey but the overall experience using it was good.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JER3EZXSZ20X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1CL2HK#wasThisHelpful","R1JER3EZXSZ20X","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I mainly use it for the scraping slicer. The pit remover didn't work that well because when i slice the avocado, the pit is horizontal but the pit remover is vertical so it needs the pointy end in but you can't do that with the way its designed. It's hit or miss with that feature. The knife end worked to slice the avocado in half but I still felt more comfortable using a regular knife to cut it in half and then remove the pit.The scraping slicer is the real star for me.

"I really like this trimmer. Its very well made and sturdy. Charging to full is only one hour which is great because I never really plan ahead when i'm going to decide to trim. So waiting an hour for a full charge is great. It also has just under an hour of continuous use. I don't have a beard so i'm only using this to trim my hair and body.I found that the adjustable length dial is great and easy to use. I can adjust it for my sideburns and the back of my neck to get just the right length. I like to taper my hair in spots so this is great because there is no switching plastic clips for everything. Trimming body hair is the same you can adjust with no searching for the right size clips.This is one of the better made trimmers i've used over the years and most convenient that you don't have to change clips. No, you can't do everything with it because the adjustable clip only extends so far but for guys with real short hair this is great. For me, I still use a scissor to trim the top of my head but use the trimmer to do the back and sides.In the box you get the trimmer, 2 clips one for hair and one for beard, blade oil, blade brush and a pouch to hold everything in. You can since the blade to clean but the trimmer is not water proof so no using it in the shower.Definitely one of the better trimmers available and the quick charge is a big plus.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZU85COT3Z021/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U3A1X0S#wasThisHelpful","RZU85COT3Z021","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"this is a great spotlight. It has a swivel lamp and solar panel so you can situate it just right to light and charge. It also has two light settings so if you don't want it super bright you can use the low setting. I have it lighting up a cold hardy palm tree that I got in the spring. I wanted to highlight this plant as its not really common where I live. It does a great job lighting the tree I only wish the ground spike was just a little longer so the light is more sturdy deeper in the ground. Its real easy to set up there's only two pieces and like i mentioned it can be tilted perfectly to adjust how you need. It does need direct light to keep it charged but believe it or not, i initially charged mine under a lamp all night because when I first received it we were having bad weather and didn't want to set it up in the wind and rain.Its a very inexpensive way to hi light and showcase something in your yard!*received this at a discount for my honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R151TE9KYY2VGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X69YJWM#wasThisHelpful","R151TE9KYY2VGS","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I""ve been using my old Brita pitcher for about 7+ years now. I finally got this new one and its a bit easier overall to filter water. You only have to rinse the filters now instead of soak them. The filling port is re designed a little smaller but still easy to fill and helps with keeping overflowing under better control. It also has a LED display to monitor the life of the filter. I did not see any way of replacing the battery for the LED so i think after it dies you either have to just deal with it or buy a whole new pitcher.The pitcher is a little wider than my old one but still has a great compact design. My older one was a slim 7 cup version so this is slightly larger in width being its 10 cups. The main lid doesn't quite fit tightly and the spout flap always pops off for some reason. Filled up to capacity this thing is on the heavy side so be careful or don't fill it up to the max.I use the water in my coffee machine, for drinking, baking and cooking, ice cubes etc. We have slightly hard water where i live so its important to make sure I have filtered water until the day I can afford a whole house filtering system.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TE90URADP5O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAG8M5I#wasThisHelpful","R1TE90URADP5O","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This stuff really works. It says 3-5 sprays but for me that's too many and its too strong.. 2 is plenty but for some people 3-5 may be needed. I have another scent, they seem to have similar smells, must be a base ingredient in all of the scents. It should last a while its a good size bottle and if i'm only using 2 sprays i'll have it a while. I have the Juniper woods and the Heavy Dooty.The bottle style has changed and the one problem is that when spraying it leaks from the inside of the sprayer. It gets all over your fingers and being its strong, its not easy to get off your skin. They make a smaller version but if the sprayer is the same as this one, its not travel friendly because it leaks.It really does work and will continue using it. I also have it in the guest bathroom so there is no awkwardness.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10UX6PM1J7QRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RW6S75K#wasThisHelpful","R10UX6PM1J7QRA","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very well made heavy nozzles. I like the one that you can dial the spray pattern most. Its got a good feel to it when you twist it. its not one of those cheap plastic twist caps its nice hard rubber. Its got plenty of different patterns to choose from. I mostly use jet and shower and they work real well.The grip is rubber and the handle is metal. This is great because the plastic ones always seem to crack halfway thru the season. Also the screw tension is also metal not plastic as well.These will last quite a long time i'm sure. I do however bring my spray nozzles inside during the winter months. I do not leave them on the hoses even if the hose is detached from the spigot.Its a great set of sprayers, well made and sturdy. If you are an avid gardener and use them multiple times a day then these are probably for you. They will hold up to how you expect them.*got these at a discount for my honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DLLD5FL0C6PS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X1W82QS#wasThisHelpful","R3DLLD5FL0C6PS","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Its a bit complicated in todays world to get this camera up and running...first is you are current with some of todays tech, you don't have a cd drive for the driver/program disc.... fortunately if you go to the Trendnet site they have everything you need there for both mac and windows. There is a brand new camera firmware update as of 9/4/15 but you need to have it wired to your network because if you try and update wirelessly it may not work anymore. There are also Q codes on the page so you can go right to the app stores for your smartphone. (http://www.trendnet.com/support/supportdetail.asp?prod=235_TV-IP862IC)Its a bit of a lengthy process to get the camera up and running from wires, to software to updates, configurations etc. I don't think this would work for someone who isn't real tech savvy. I am and found things to be a bit annoying. I have a D-Link also and it was  way faster and easier to setup. The big selling point with this camera is that it has the tilt and pan. This one camera can take the place of one or more depending on where you put it. I can now look into 3 areas where as to do so with a still camera i'd need probably 3 separate cameras.The resolution is 720p and looks pretty good during the day and well lit rooms. The night vision is acceptable but not great. It has two way audio, a spot for a micro SD card if you want to record right to the camera. Both web and phone app remote viewing and controlling of the camera. (the app is free). It has motion detection and can send video clips to your email to notify you.I really like the pan and tilt but its a big camera compared to others and its way to complicated for most people to setup. This is probably good for an office or business where you can move the camera to see around. Just not sure its for the average person because of the complicated setup process.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34B18UH1VBAUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HPR7UEK#wasThisHelpful","R34B18UH1VBAUW","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My PS4 came with a 500gb drive which at the time was fine but over the last few years the games are bigger and save more data and I had only 1.9 gb left on the drive. This hybrid drive doubles my capacity and should also run and load faster.Installation was super easy. All you need to do first is make sure you have the latest PS4 update on your system and then get a large enough usb drive to do a full backup of your system via the system restore/backup settings on the PS4 (need a 500gb drive). If you don't do this you cannot save settings, users and most of all, all the game updates, DLC, and the games themselves. If you don't do the full backup you will have to reinstall every game disc and then all the updates and DLC from the internet. you will also still need to save your saved game data but one by one which takes long. I recommend just do the full backup. This all in one backup will take 3-4 hours though so set it up and leave it.Once that's all done, power down, unplug and then slide the left side cover off. Once the cover is off there is one corner screw to remove and then the drive slides out. Its in a metal bracket and there are 4 small screws to remove. Just reverse all those directions to replace the drive. (https://support.us.playstation.com/articles/en_US/KC_Article/Upgrade-PS4-HDD/)Once that is done you need the PS4 boot files to restore the operating system to the new drive. (https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/system-updates/ps4/) i recommend watching the youtube vids to show you this process because i had a slight problem that was ridiculous. You cannot use a large usb stick. I tried a 16 and it wouldn't work on the PS4. I needed to use an old 2gb stick and it worked no problem. Its not a complicated process but its precise and you need to be correct on settings etc so watch the vids. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkIyCXbiGZs)The drive is definitely faster not majorly but enough to notice. I've only had it (at the time of this review) for a few days but everything is fine and haven't had any issues. I still saved my old drive just in case of anything but I don't foresee it. From what i can tell you can get up to 600mb per second read/right on this drive which is pretty fast for a hybrid HDD. If it was a full SSD i think it would be even faster.For all owners of the original PS4's before the new 1 tb drives systems, this is a great drive made for Playstation and with a little time and patience, you can have a larger drive to keep you from running out of storage and bump up your drive speeds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R199AK6V03IALE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0149QDBY2#wasThisHelpful","R199AK6V03IALE","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How fun this machine is...Its actually very easy to use and make your own rubber stamps. The kit only comes with 2 rubber stamps and at time of this review (Sept 17, 2015) There aren't any refills available until Nov 2015. The refill stamps are around $10-22 depending on what sizes and if you buy the refill with the wood bases. Inks will run around $12.00.After you install the software which looks similar to their Studio for the Cameo Cutter, select the stamp size and then all you have to do is add your graphic and text. Its pretty easy to figure all that out and make adjustments etc. There are a few free graphics that come with the Mint which download when you turn it on. Once you are done and your Mint is connected via the includes USB and AC plug, you click start and then feed in your stamp template. I mistakenly put the template in first and then hit start and it did not print.You can of course add your own graphics and images but know that it turns them into a dot matrix so photos will not have the best quality. You can choose a few filters to help make your image look better.Another hint is that when applying ink, try to only put it on the letters because anything that is not printed (which you can tell by the grey color on top of the black rubber) it will not soak into the stamp and you will have a smeared dripping mess. Put just a little on first and then when it soaks in add some more but don't saturate it. you can mix and match colors to your liking or just one etc. there are black, yellow, blue and red supplied in this kit.This is a fun and exciting way to customize rubber stamps for just about any occasion. the possibilities are only limited to your imagination. Crafters are going to love this big time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WDAAQCFUR6RO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZSQX63O#wasThisHelpful","R1WDAAQCFUR6RO","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Setup wasn't real easy, i'm a tech savvy guy and it took me 30 min to get it up and running not the 60 seconds its promoting. First you need a Nest account, that was quick and easy, then I tried to setup via smartphone and it couldn't connect to the cam. I then tried to setup via my computer and it couldn't find my wifi. Went back to the smartphone and finally got it to work.Once i got it up and running the video was nice and clear at 720p. It has an excellent wide view in nice vivid color (when its during the daytime). There is sound and you can also talk thru the cam via your mic on your phone or computer.It comes with a 10 foot USB cord and plug so you really need a plug where ever you will place the cam. I didn't like how hot the cam gets. I'm worried it could melt my blinds or something else. I have another cam (D-Link) and it does not get hot at all.Is it worth $200..i don't think so. While it has nice video and the talk/listen feature, smaller footprint, its just a cam. To record anything you have to get a plan that's either $100 or $300 per cam. So this makes it way too expensive overall. I can only do live viewing then.If you are looking for a high end cam with great video and sound in a simple design, then this might be good for you. If you want to record anything then you have additional costs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R178Y4FYINA1IT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBJGUA2#wasThisHelpful","R178Y4FYINA1IT","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These remind me of those real nice soft sheets from a 4-5 star hotel. And if you have never stayed in a high end hotel, when you get these sheets you will feel like you are!They feel cool on your skin and are breathable. The fitted sheet has deeper corners which is great because they won't bunch up in the middle and leave the long sides of the mattress exposed. The flat is wide and long enough too. The pillow cases fit great also and do not slide down during the night.They have nice satin stripes on the ends, they are wrinkle free and are great for allergy sufferers.For the price, you can't beat the quality of these sheets.

"First, the box is bigger than expected which was great because i knew it was filled with lots of goodies! This is a mega kit...it comes with 5 figures and 2 clear ones (death star and republic symbol). Of course the game (PS4) and the base. The figures alone are collectable and fun to play with without the game too. You can buy other figures to add to all this and play for hours.The game play is so exciting and fun. The characters move smoothly and makes me feel like i'm watching the cartoon only better. Driving the vehicles around is also fun. This is the kind of game that has a long life because of the switchable characters. When my nephews come over they immediately want to play the game.The graphics are really great. I have the PS4 version and have really gotten into the Disney Infinity world. More on the Star Wars  stuff though because to use a lightsaber and drive the vehicles is like a lifetime dream come true being I grew up with the Star Wars movies.If your a collector, get this, if you are buying it as a gift for a fan get it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NYM8FH4ZO3JC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZSJU97C#wasThisHelpful","R3NYM8FH4ZO3JC","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many reviewers complained that you didn't get the plants...ummm plants need light and water because they are living things. How could the kit have them included and be stored on shelves till someone buys one and then hope the plant is still alive? Of course the plants don't come with the kit, but if you fully read, you'll find there is a coupon code to get 2 free ones that they send within 5 days.I like this kit. It comes with lots of things to customize your air plant globe. The rocks were nice and the moss is also bright and interesting. I wasn't sure what the saw dust looking stuff was or the white chalky looking rocks were but after going to their web site i found out. I think that the kit should have instructions and also a list of what everything is that comes with this kit. I really didn't want to have to go online to see a video and figure out what the bags of stuff was.Its a mini kit and the fragile glass globes are small but for a desk or area where it doesn't need to be big these things will look great.P.S. when the plants finally arrives 7 days later...they sent only one large one not the two small ones.

"Very sturdy. I was surprised how heavy it was. You could use it as a hammer. Its well made and because of the heavy metal, it doesn't take much to squeeze the lemon.

I have a plastic one from the dollar store and every time i used it i thought it would snap at the seam. This one is completely metal and the seam is nice and strong.Its a nice larger size so the lemons will fit and limes are a even easier. Its got a rubber handle which makes it comfortable to grip.

"This particular model has a lot of bells and whistles in a smaller compact design. This is great for a student or someone who doesn't need a larger printer with more conveniences like a document feeder or double paper trays.The touch screen is  great and is more responsive than previous Epson models i've had. It also has Wireless, Wi-Fi Direct, Mobile Device Printing, Built-In Card Slots, Front USB Port. 2.7"" Color LCD & Touch Panel. No faxing though in this model...but no problem because i couldn't tell you when the last time I faxed something.5 ink tanks so you only need to change the one that is empty and for me its usually the main black ink. One of the big pluses for me is the cd/dvd on disc printing feature. I make lots of backups and movies and love that i can make a great printed disc.The wifi printing has become a standard on most printers these days but Epson seems to be the easiest to configure in my opinion especially that I use a mac. iPhone, iPad no problem, android too.Printing is fast, scanning is fast, options for borderless which is another standard these days because most people print photos more.Price is a little high on it though and at the time of this review, the new 410 inks aren't available on Amazon or even the Epson website....huh?","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B8CPVG4TA3GG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU62T2#wasThisHelpful","R2B8CPVG4TA3GG","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wanted to try out this pillow as i seem to get new ones every 6 months or so. I have a feeling this one will last quite a long time. Mine didn't come in a carrying case as some reviewers mentioned. It came rolled up in a thin plastic wrapper. It does have a washable zipper cover though.After fluffing it up for a few minutes (which is very important), and repositioning the foam pieces inside, it had a much better shape. I also let my pillow sit in the open air in the garage for 2 days to air out the foam rubber smell. Some complained that it was real smelly but mine wasn't after airing it out. Give it a chance it will go away.Its a nice big queen size pillow and fits in the same pillow case size just fine. It does squish a little but conforms to your face and neck well. I don't use it as my main pillow but as a side pillow and for when i lay on my stomach.It is however expensive but, this will last longer than regular pillows and also hold up longer. Its hypoallergenic and dust mite resistant as well.

"I've been using more aromatherapy the last few years to help get a handle on my anxiety attacks. I'm a big fan of Lavender, especially for a sleep aid.  I dilute this with a dry spray oil and lightly mist my pillow every night. Its calming and relaxing. I also (using the included dropper) a few drops in my daily shower which makes the aroma fill the bathroom.I've read that its also great for bug bites and minor skin irritations, acne and to also repel insects. I've made a spray with distilled water, witch hazel and a few drops of lavender to help keep my face hydrated and acne free.I also use a few drops in my ultrasonic diffuser. I just add the usual water and then a few drops of the lavender oil and it fills the house with its great scent. Since this is 100% its very strong so you will dilute it most every time. This kind of lavender is slightly different scent wise. For me, i get the lavender with a slight pine scent at the end. Being there are around 39 varieties of this plant, many will have slightly different scents.You get a real large bottle and a nice eye dropper.

Although they were a little tight, they were stretchy enough and i didn't feel like i was being squished.They are breathable and absorb a little sweat which is nice also. They are very well made, i checked out the stitching inside. They also wash well, no issues so far. Great pair of pants overall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25NRI801I76UE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RU77UI#wasThisHelpful","R25NRI801I76UE","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Because of its smaller size, I wasn't too sure how the sound would be. But much to my surprise its pretty good.The size reminded me of a chocolate bar (but real thick). It was super easy pairing it to my iPhone. With a full charge you'll get about 5 hours of music. it has the capability of being a speakerphone too so you can get calls thru it. Its super lightweight also.There are 3 buttons on top to control your music. Play/pause/phone call pick up/hang up and the next/previous track which also doubles for volume (just hold the button longer). One of the sides has the power button which has a light up status LED. It also has the micro USB in to recharge as well as the mic for calls and a headphone jack.The sound is actually good. Being that there are 2 active and 2 passive speakers (4 total) so you'll get the highs and the lows from bass too. Now of course for its size it won't have the best sound and at higher levels its all distorted so this isn't a boom box. This is more for travel or smaller rooms where you don't need to pump up the volume. This is great for dorm room, hotel room, kids bedroom, beach etc.Its not water resistant and dirt will get inside the screen so be careful where you put/bring it. Its outer shell is completely made from anodized aluminum (like cookware)  so its got a tough exterior.Overall its a lightweight smaller speaker that has good sound. Its not a mini boombox but decent enough to do a good job for most. Price is right too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18S20ESCPJMIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XLSS74O#wasThisHelpful","R18S20ESCPJMIT","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why didn't i get one of these sooner? What a simple painless way to take a temperature. No more putting something under my tongue for 5 minutes. This infrared thermometer dies it in 2 seconds.Its real easy to use and there's nothing to setup. Just point and click. Some of the things that are great about this is that its backlit so you can see your reading in the dark. Its easy to hold and the buttons are easy to push. There are 2 modes one for body and the other for an object (probably a baby bottle). There's a speaker so you can hear the tones. You can also use this to test water temp and other things for your infant/children.The device comes with starter batteries and a nice pouch to store it in. The instructions were easy to follow too.

"First impression is that they are a well made pair of jeans. you can see that the sticking bot inside and outside is perfect. They have a nice smooth soft feel to them again both inside and outside. The color is a nice blue also.The waist size was slightly small I got the 32x32 but would probably try the 33's. I can wear them but they are just a bit tight. so no desserts when wearing them...lol. The style of these jeans have a looser leg and seat too. Since they are carpenter jeans they are designed for working where you square or kneel a lot.Overall they are comfortable and a real nicely made pair of jeans.

"What a great and easy way to add some flair to your landscaping. I just got a really nice palm tree that is about 3 feet high. I wanted to use this solar led light to highlight the plant at night. It is a great and easy way to do so. There's no wiring necessary and don't have to worry about plugging it in etc. The solar light had a dusk to dawn sensor in it so it goes on when it needs to. There's an on off button as well and it even has a blinking function. The light can get fairly bright and with full sun can last almost the whole night.Everything is waterproof so this can also be used in a pond/fountain or something like that where the light is submerged. My only wish is that i would have liked if it came with 2 strikes/posts because i would like the light to be off the ground. Although it is weighted (light led) I have a mulched area where the light goes and i'd like it to be just above all the mulch rather then partially buried.*I received this item for a discount for my honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R310XON1JPBBR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBQ3YBA#wasThisHelpful","R310XON1JPBBR3","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"this has a very masculine smell. For me i get the tobacco and citrus immediately. After you are towel dry, i had a citronella scent left over above all the other scents. I'm sure it will be different on everybody.  It also lathers up ok (better than others i've used). I use one of those net puff scrubbers and it sudsed up fine. But, the bottle is a little on the small side so its not going to last as long as other brands that have a higher lather.The bottle says its free of parabens, DEA and phthalates. And says for hair and body. I personally will only use it for my body. I have other products for my hair and only trust them as they are specifically for hair only.I have and try many shower gels, this one definitely has a unique fragrance and its quite nice. The big problem is that its way too expensive for everyday use. I don't think i'll buy a new bottle either because i can get around 4-5 larger Dove Men's Care (which lathers more and you use less) for the price of one of the Provence.I'm not knocking the Provence, its good, I enjoy using it and the scent with how the scent notes change.

"I own the macbook stand from this company and its fantastic. I jumped at the chance to get the iMac stand too. The stand ads 2 inches which is for me, just the right amount. In the past i was using text books to raise it up a bit. But now i get this great stand with a drawer. The drawer is fantastic and is as long as the base so you can fit pens and a few other things to keep your desk less cluttered with stuff.The aluminum seems to be the same as the iMac so it matches exactly. I also like the nice rubber top and bottom so the iMac doesn't slip. there is also a vent on the top as well as the front and back. the back is more of a port to feed your charging cable thru as the pic on the box shows an iPhone in the drawer.Another plus is that having the iMac raised 2 inches really does help with putting other needs right under the computer.

"What an amazing kit. There are 5 tools in the kit along with a nice sturdy case. There are 3 double ended loop extractors and 2spoon extractors. Unfortunately, there are no instructions/guide as to what each tool and the tip does and what to use it on. Yes, i know its for blackheads but there are all different shapes and sizes.I've been experimenting with them to see which ones did the best job. I found that the loop style ones were real easy and all you needed to do was basically swipe or comp the areas and it got a bunch of gunk. I found the loops to also leave the least amount of redness and irritation when done better than the spoon styles where it leaves circle red marks from the pressure.There are plenty of videos online to see how to use the tools.I really like them and also they are easy to clean using hot water and a little soap.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FYUZJ4RROR55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZDOCD08#wasThisHelpful","R3FYUZJ4RROR55","A30X750M8V1XXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X750M8V1XXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I find it works best on a nice sunny day. Don't spray it when its going to rain, you want this stuff to penetrate and soak in well even though it says it only needs 2 hours to be rain proof.The best part is that its pre mixed and ready to use.

"I really like this brush. I have an old bulky braun that the battery is starting to go on. This Remington is like half the thickness which is much easier to hold. Plus, its lighter than I thought which is another great thing.It has a great LED light letting you know on/off, charging/charged. It also has LED's to let you know which cleaning mode you are in (there are 3, clean, sensitive, massage). It also has the usual built in 2 minute timer and will pulse every minute letting you know.It comes with a nice slim travel case as well as an extra brush head (along with color bands) as well as the charging base. I did find that the charging base would tilt over slightly when the brush was in place. It seemed to be too light in the back and it knocked over easily.Another observation was that it does take around 16 hours to charge fully. You can do a quick 1 hour charge and get 2 days use but 16 hours is a bit long in this day and age.It does a great job cleaning. There is so much sonic stuff going on to help loosen plaque and anything else. Its just the right size and gets into hard to reach areas with no problems.

"I first need to tell you why I trust and why schools, government offices, hospitals, industries such as technology, manufacturing, scientific and so forth use Kimberly Clark.  I once worked for Kimberly-Clark in QC department. I have friends and family that also have various positions in the company. I know from experience that Kimberly - Clark has the best Quality Control dept on every product that leaves the warehouses. The company practically has taken a lead in the USA and international with the best, safest, quality made products ranging from paper towels to sterile packaged items used by most of the top medical centers. The value of having the best made products always available is the idealism behind this well ran company. I live near of The CDC, which is one of Kimberly Clark's most important customer.""Kimberly-Clark 02021 Scott Hard Roll Towel"" is 100 percent recycled and rolled tight to allow the 400' length that fits well in many 8"" roll dispensers. The 02021 is a bit heavier than other brands. I believe 12 rolls weighs 25lbs. You can compare to other brands but Georgia - Pacific was the biggest competitor that makes a similar paper towel.If Kimberly Clark's products, even plain paper towel rolls are good enough for such agencies and can compete in price, I recommend it for your business, agency, schools and even residential dwellings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18DOD3Q2O95LM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VD1GF2#wasThisHelpful","R18DOD3Q2O95LM","AO09RWV40IX78","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO09RWV40IX78?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In my many years of owning Invicta watches, I feel that they are underrated and have gotten a bad reputation because of the early days of poorly made products by Invicta. Today and since the last 6-7 years many quality control issues are in place. I love the Invicta Quartz watch. The last automatic I owned was not that great. This 21556 is a beautiful and decently made timepiece. I like everything about this watch except the size, the case is too large. I am not referring to the linked band. I have removed links to fit my wrist but it looks ridiculous because of the 50mm case on me. I am not small at 6' tall and weigh around 180 lbs. I do have normal to somewhat slender wrist and the case is ill fitting and doesn't provide a nice look.I accepted this watch thinking it has a 40mm case because I own a couple of 40 mm watches that fit well and look nice.

"We have found the Boneco P500 highly helpful with improving our room air quality. We have it in our living room which is about 300 square feet, it helps my family with reducing dust and allergies. It is very quiet and we do not notice any airflow sounds as it quietly purifies and cleans the air. Although this is not a whole house air purifier, it works well for rooms around 250 square feet or less.Built and designed by Boneco of Switzerland the P500 won the 2015 Red Dot award for product design. It is sleek, quiet, and has a European appearance. The remote control is very helpful and easy to use. The smart digital display tells you the fan speed and air quality inside the room. It is placed in the room near the sofa where we sit and we noticed very little air movement or sound. It looks and performs beautifully.There is a prefilter screen to help having to replace the main filter. You have three choices for the main filter to choose from: baby, smog, and allergy. However, it comes standard with the allergy (A501) filter. I have not tested the other two choices of filters, which can be bought at Costco. It runs on regular 110-120 volt residential electric outlets.I realize that 500 dollars is a lot of money but this product is well worth it for our family's use. We are considering purchasing at least one more for the bedroom to help eliminate dust allergies as we sleep. My family loves this P500 Air Purifier by Boneco because after two weeks of usage, we have noticed less allergic reactions to dust, making us feel better and without having to take as many allergy medications.If you live in an area like we do and have year round seasonal allergies, I highly recommend this product. I will update you as soon as I try the smog filter, to see how it performs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BKTJKVQTDDV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010WVVZK0#wasThisHelpful","R2BKTJKVQTDDV0","AO09RWV40IX78","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO09RWV40IX78?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love creative endeavors. I was excited to try out this ""Moldable Plastic"".  I enjoy not only making items, but repairing and recycling vintage items. This plastic can give good results, however the time and effort it takes to get those ""good"" results is not something I enjoyed or that I would continue to pursue. The main drawback of this product is the SHORT time you have to work with it after you finally have it melted and mixed sufficiently to work with.Second, It takes a long time for the beads to melt at 150+ degrees. Using 150 degree water, by the time the beads  are turning clear, the water has cooled down and the melted plastic is starting to harden. The water needs to be warmer than 150 degrees to get the plastic warm enough to be pliable for any length of time. Then you run the risk of it getting to hot to comfortably handle.The color pellets come in 5 shades. The red and yellow are obvious, but the green, purple and black are so close in their look to each other that it would be helpful if they were marked. Mixing and blending the color beads takes time and I found I had to remelt my ""glob"" several times to get the color even.I did managed to repair a hole in an antique Salesman's Sample Wood Burning Stove. I discovered that I could take a cigarette lighter and re-melt the applied plastic to smooth it and form it after being applied to the stove. I was also finally able to create a ""brown color"" that matched the color of the stove I was repairing and used clear for part of the repair that was silver. What I thought would be a 30 minute project tuned into 3 hours. I like the concept of ReMoldables and feel it is a product with potential. I am hoping some changes can be made to the formula to extend the narrow time frame there is to use Remoldables, before it starts to harden.

"This toy school bus has entertaining ""bump-and-go"" movement. If you are not familiar with ""Bump-and-Go"" toys, when they are bump into something they automatically back up and go forward until they get clear of the object / objects they bump into.

"I have never seen anything quite like this toy! It is just the right size for little ones to tote around and play with! When you touch any of the four buttons on the front, it plays music! Each button produces different sounds and the top of the bottle has a light comes on and blinks on an off while the music plays. For example on  the bottle I received one of the buttons has a ""Frog's Face"" on it. When pressed it starts off with ""ribbet, ribbet..."" then plays music. Another button has ""Hands Clapping"" on it, that starts off with clapping and then a different tune plays. The melodies are upbeat. There is no ""OFF"" button. They music stops when it is finished and stays off until another button is pressed.This bottle is approximately 6 inches tall. It has two handles on each side perfect for little ones to grasp easily with one or both hands. I don't know any child that doesn't like to push buttons. This allows children to be able to pick and choose from the buttons. The top does not come off, this is just a PLAY toy that is in the shape of a bottle. It required two AA batteries that are accessed with a screw on panel. I like this for safety reasons. It comes with batteries installed and ready to play. I just had to remove a plastic strip.

"I never have enough hangers for hanging skirts and pants. I was excited to get this set. I am not a fan of ironing so I hang the majority of my laundry right our of the dryer while it is still just slightly damp. These hangers allow me to easily center my clothing and hold it securely. There is nothing worse than hanging clean clothes and having them fall off the hanger onto the floor. This has happened before and I didn't realize it right away and the clothes wrinkled and had to be re-washed. These hangers are also great for hand washables, lingerie, gloves and my husband's insulated socks.I ordered the the 5 pack. Each hanger is 12 inches long. They have clamps on each end that are approximately 2"" x 1"". The clamps are spring clamps and and easy to open. Four of the hangers I received have soft pads on the end of the clamps and one of the hangers has teeth. Not sure if all packs get a variety or not, but I am pleased with the way they hold and grip.  I received this set for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

She loves dressing dolls and these 4"" dolls are the right size to be the ""children"" in her ""Loving Family"" dollhouse. This set includes 4 dolls and 4 tubs of modeling clay, so it is perfect for individual play or for sharing when friends are over. This set woudl be great for a slumber party activity.The modeling clay comes in white, pink, blue and orange. You can mix and match the colors.

"I saw this tape right after seeing some pretty cute tape crafts on pinterest, coincidence?  I think not.I used some of this tape on clothes pins, they looked super cute afterwards and it was easy and quick.  So my next tape craft I wanted to try something a bit harder, so I used some to cover the plain black border of my wipe board wall calendar. Pizazzle!Then I used some to label the storage boxes in my basement.  It made the boring boxes of computer supplies and Christmas decorations look nice.  I don't mean Martha Stewart nice, but it was a lovely improvement.The tape rolls aren't very big and I think I will look for nicer colors next time.  These are just too disco for me.  But other than that, it is a pretty and useful tape.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XRC9RMNN05LG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y4S5QXU#wasThisHelpful","R1XRC9RMNN05LG","A8GR4PH5NW96V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8GR4PH5NW96V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not the best toys or treats.This toy features one of the worst cat play designs I've ever seen, it wobbles if pushed.  Whoever designed it hasn't spent much time around cats or they'd know that cats are chasers more than nibblers.  The hunt down and pounce on their prey, there's just no reason for pouncing on a heavy, plastic dreidel'ish thingy.Even after showing her that the more it moved the more cat treats would spill out.  Also, about those cat treats, my kitty didn't care for them.  Our cat likes treats so much that she comes running just from the sound of a plastic container crinkling.  She slid across the floor like Ty Cobb when I was sprinkling a few dried cranberries on my oatmeal  from a very crinkly package.  So, she is extremely interested in kitty treats, but not these ones.  She left several behind and couldn't be induced to eat them.By every measure, this is not a good purchase.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24EUHZ4BA9O7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YX3HZDU#wasThisHelpful","R24EUHZ4BA9O7P","A8GR4PH5NW96V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8GR4PH5NW96V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the best book of the year.  My reason for labeling it such is because my kid, danced with excitement, grabbed it from me and dashed to his bedroom to read it.How many books make kids dance with joy?Best of all, he asked me to read it too.  This is the seventh Captain Underpants I've read.  When my kid first discovered them, we'd bring them home and then spend a couple of nights taking turns reading the pages.  I don't know when he started to read them without me, but it was kinda sad.  I loved propping pillows against his headboard, our heads leaning into the book as we both tried to outdo each other by making sillier and sillier voices.So this was a wonderful return, at least partially, to those younger days.The captain, George and Harold are even more ridiculous than I remembered them.  Like the other stories, small things turn into big problems and George and Harold handle things with their usual sense of the ridiculous.  Like all the other books, they are prankster slackers and spend a good deal of time trying to get out of school or make it more interesting (their idea of interesting is definitely on the unapproved list).  This time around, a teacher has turned evil and the entire world is in jeopardy.So if you want to get some valuable kid time, buy this book and curl up for a giggly good time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRCEI39RYHCMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545504929#wasThisHelpful","RRCEI39RYHCMN","A8GR4PH5NW96V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8GR4PH5NW96V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a timely book as it is a very hot summer and I've not wanted to use my oven or stovetop for anything.the recipes fall into two categories for me;1.  Real cooking, you assemble ingredients that wouldn't be good alone or uncooked and make a meal of them.2.  You assemble various leftovers to remake them, ie, leftover roast chicken, leftover pulled pork.Luckily, there are an ample supply of the first kind to keep me reading because, to be honest, I don't need any help making refried beans topped with cheese.Most of the directions require just three steps;Step one; get your ingredients.Step two put them in a mug.Step three, put the mug in a microwave.Why did that just remind me of SNL's Dick in a box skit?Anyways, I like the thought of using my microwave for more than just reheating my coffee and tea.Here's a sampling of some of the recipes I am most interested in trying out;Apricot poached in Earl Grey Tea with GranolaWarm Peanut Noodles with Scallions (I usually have all these ingredients on hand, so, bonus!)Shrimp with Garlic, Lemon and Parsley (Shrimp IN A MICROWAVE!)Coconut Rice with Chickpeas and Garam MasalaThai Curried Pumpkin BisqueBanana Caramel PieApple Caramel CakeCherry Brown BettyWarm S'mores Dip with berriesNutella Cake (do you need more reasons to have Nutella in the house?)A lot of the recipes have ingredients I usually keep in the pantry so that makes these recipes ones I could see myself trying soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33ULQYGFEVPM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627109161#wasThisHelpful","R33ULQYGFEVPM2","A8GR4PH5NW96V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8GR4PH5NW96V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very very short cable.  My hubby told me that some people want super short cables for their devices.  He said it's a style thing, not something that him or I understand.  But if that is a feature you especailly want, then this cord is for you.It looks armored, so I am hopeful that our cat wont be able to chew through it, something that keeps happening, sigh.

"Lovely kitchen towels.  They aren't colors I'd usually pick out for my kitchen, honestly anywhere in my house, I'm not a fan of brown or tan since I grew up in a desert area, I need greens, blues, pinks even orange and yellow are preferred.  But they are a high quality, the recessed diamond pattern is a classic that always uplevels a room, in my opinion and they are the perfect size to cover a loaf of proofing bread or to cover up a plate of warm tortillas.The care instruction on the label says to tumble dry low.  Tumble Dry LOW?  How the heckola will anything ever dry that way?  I put them in with some yoga pants and shirts for thirty minutes and they came out ready to use and looking great.Just in case you care, I would, I'm picky this way.  Some cheap products have a front side and a back side, the back side has a faded look and is very obviously the side that wasn't printed or meant to face outwards.  Nice fabrics don't have this.  I'm sure there is a technical textile term for this, something to do with weft and weave, anyways, what I'm saying is this is a high quality fabric and both sides of the towel are pretty.Also, they are absorbent, I bought some pretty printed towels a few years ago (they had peppers on them) and I think they were polyester and they would not absorb water.  It was like trying to use a plastic bag to dry a newly washed plate, it didn't do anything but move the water around!  So irritating.Great, classy towels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RONOLXPIZSLYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DU6UMWM#wasThisHelpful","RONOLXPIZSLYW","A8GR4PH5NW96V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8GR4PH5NW96V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love zombie books and yet I find so few that I really like.This book combines three things I really love about zombie stories;1.  Interesting, flawed characters to root for2.  Zombies showing up to muck up everything3.  fast paced action mixed with strong world building and character development.As an added bonus Fredsti has added a few twists to the zombie genre, well, at least they are new to me, first off being the covert government group working to contain the outbreak and past outbreaks around the globe.  Sort of a zombie fighting Medicine sans Frontier, but with a different foreign name and a past that would rival the Knights Templar for secrecy.Into this maelstrom of guts and biting enters the main character, Ashley Parker, she's  30 something, divorced college student.  She has an attitude and isn't afraid of confrontation.  She's back at school after suffering through an especially harsh strain of the flu, or so she thinks.  What's especially great about Ashley is she is a strong friend and speaks up for herself, this is no shrinking violet afraid to hold a gun.  She throws herself whole heartedly to her new life as a zombie slayer.Usually with a book like this the character would do something dumb and sentimental to save her boyfriend or wouldn't believe that the zombies she encounters are killers who are too far gone to be saved.  It is definitely one of the strengths of the novel.Also is the fast pace of the story.  From infection to attack to training, it all moved along at a cracking pace.  It was a book that I started to worriedly check the bottom corner of my kindle to find out how much of the story was left.  I was loving the book so much that I didn't want it to end.  When I got to the 80% point, I had to get online to find out if there was a follow up book yet.Now that is a book I can recommend one that has me searching out the next book by the author.Read this if you like The Mark Tufo series, World War Z, Apocalypse Z and the Newsflesh series.  If you are looking for action, thoughtful and smart people trying to deal with the outbreak in the fastest and cleanest way, then this is the book for you.  If you don't want a lot of angst and hopelessness, again, this book pays off.  But if you like that in your stories, or a bit of philosophical rambling then this book just wont fit you.Also, and I can't even believe I have to say this, but this book has flesh eating, zero brained zombies.  They don't drive cars, use guns or do anything at all to suggest that they have brain cells firing.  These are mindless, brain eating corpses and they don't move very fast, not running full out swarms of  bull*&^! zombies like I saw in the World War Z movie.But as anyone who read the tortoise and the hare, the steady, shambling  pace of hungry zombies can quickly overtake a human running full out because humans have to stop to rest occasionally, zoms never do.Also, the characters call the dead biters zombies from the beginning, there are too many times that I get tossed right out of a zombie book because apparently none of the characters have ever heard of a zombie before.In every way this book was super fun and interesting and I can't wait to read book 2","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RABFA3KM8EYGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005C5M4MU#wasThisHelpful","RABFA3KM8EYGF","A8GR4PH5NW96V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8GR4PH5NW96V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I should have stopped when I was ahead.  I tried combos vanilla filling pretzels and in a glut of foodieness I determined that my life would be better with all the sweet flavored combos so I bought these, for an exorbitant price, I might add.They are, in a word, vile.They smell like a cross between vanilla candles and powdered non dairy coffee creamer. In fact the stuff inside of the combos tastes like someone decided to mix salted caramel coffee creamer powder with a glob of melted candle.Even after I spittooned the loathsome treat, my tongue felt coated in fakey sweetness, sorta waxy with caramel creme.  Shudder.Also, I found out a couple of weeks after buying two packets of these pretzels that they sell them for much less at the mini mart!I took these to a meeting and people were split about half and half, half thought they were a delightful salty sweet sensation and the other half swore at me profusely while rinsing their mouths out with day old coffee.So, give it a go, will you be a yay or nay person?","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28GD7OJH881O7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QDUPB50#wasThisHelpful","R28GD7OJH881O7","A8GR4PH5NW96V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8GR4PH5NW96V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a really big and powerful fan.I just had to let you know so that no one buys this for a stuffy bedroom or a hot kitchen.  It might blow the pillows from your bed or the food off your plates if you use it in the kitchen or bedroom.Right after we got this fan, our washing machine started to leak, leak is such a small word for the huge pool of water that ended up in our basement.  After pulling up the pad and the carpet the linoleum underneath looked a little bit wavy and the basement smelled like mildew.  So we opened the two tiny windows (ours is a partially submerged basement, not sure what the technical term is, I'm from california and most people don't have basements there) and set up this portable wind tunnel.  We left if running for four days to dry out the basement and it worked like a charm.  No more dampness and very little smell after cleaning with a solution of water, tea tree oil and bleach.I'd like to use this near my treadmill, but I'm trying to figure out the best way to place it so that it doesn't blast anything that doesn't need blasting, like houseplants or the printer.  I like a lot of airflow when I'm working out.  Our house has air conditioners but in the summer the living room is pretty warm and so I can't use my treadmill past noon or I sweat like an ice cube in the desert.As for assembly, I set my 15 year old to the task and he only needed a tiny bit of help, mostly to hold it together, it's pretty big, while putting some force into it.The controls are great, so you can regulate the level of blow-y-ness.  A great big fan for larger rooms.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAVG5N6SQJ0H2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VLXH7BU#wasThisHelpful","RAVG5N6SQJ0H2","A8GR4PH5NW96V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8GR4PH5NW96V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The shirt is a softer cotton than we were expecting and the purple is a bit darker than it appears online, a little closer to aubergine than to royal purple but other than these two changes, both of which are wonderful, this shirt is perfect.

"I haven't used powder in years.  I have terribly dry, sometimes reddish irritated skin and a dry powder seems like the exact opposite of what i need to put on my face.But, I like to give new things a try and the spf 29 really lured me in.My first impression was that the powder would be too dark for my pale freckle prone skin.  The dark powder that was ground was a match for the suntan colored knee highs my sweet grandma Florence used to wear, but I was hopeful that the ivory powder mixed with it would magically blend in with my skin.It went one better, the color not only blended it seemed to even out some of the pinky freckly bits of my face.My skin is sensitive, so the first time I used it was right before a shower, I wanted to make sure it didn't have fragrance in it, it doesn't and that it wouldn't make me itchy, it didn't.The next time was for a real day on the go, I wore it to the bowling alley for a day with the kiddos, my friend and I sipped sodas while our kids bowled and ate fries and chicken strips.  The bowling alley we go to is old, their only form of air conditioning is ceiling fans and so the uncomfortably warm, fried food scented air became positively sweltering as the afternoon moved on.  For the first part of the day the powder was light and comfortable, but once I started to sweat it felt a bit itchy.So  don't think I'll wear this to hot places.  But since I live in the Pacific Northwest, this means this should be good for most of the year.As others have noted, the powder comes with a micro foliation tool, in other words a makeup brush.The product says it minimizes aging, I didn't notice that effect, just light skin evening coverage.  All in all a nice product at a not so nice price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QLOLXXOA1L2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SH8YXTQ#wasThisHelpful","R3QLOLXXOA1L2C","A8GR4PH5NW96V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8GR4PH5NW96V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My hand hesitated over the number of stars, since when you click on five out of five stars, the words, 'I loved it,' pop up and love has no part in the complex mix of emotions I feel about this novel.First off I should say that it took me almost three months to finish this book, not because it was slow or badly written, it's because I had a creeped out sensation that grew as the story progressed.  From the callous guards and the terrifying specter of what existed outside the walls versus what was locked into the building, well, it was a bit much for me to take in.I decided early on not to read this at bedtime, the story lingers and my dreams were disturbing, full of stressful situations and hidden monsters.  But trying to find the right time to read became a fruitless search as each time or situation turned out to have it's downsides; reading on the bus meant I was too distracted to get off at my stop, while cuddled up to my hubby on the couch wasn't right, I needed more solitude to read.When it comes down to it, this is a book about survivors.  About the crushing weight of despair of people who have watched the world destroyed and are left with only terrible options.  The fact that these options take shape in one little monstrous girl is what makes this book so horrifying.  That good people would be driven to such terrible acts to save humanity was a terrifying thing to read about.

"Oily, gritty and weirdly bitter.About a year ago my husband went on a neutral food diet, the philosophy of the diet was that the meal replacement shakes would have zero flavor,  therefore, your hunger trigger would be sated by the calories and fat, but that because of the lack of flavor, you wouldn't feel a craving for more.The shakes were made of canola oil, unflavored whey powder, corn flour and a few other bland healthy things and then were combined into a shake that tasted like nothing but gritty, flour-y water.  My husband didn't seem to mind it and he offered me a taste, assuring me that it wasn't too awful, but it made me vomit, right there, in my kitchen.  I puked up the vile shake-like concoction (barely made it to my trash can) and vowed never to trust my husband, taste-wise when he says, 'it's not too awful.'These cookie butters tasted like the abysmal shake my hubby made plus they were bitter and really oily.  Also, they didn't smell good.  Really, you can't discount your sense of smell when it comes to food.In every possible way these cookie butters are a failure; they don't smell good, they don't taste good and they do not look good upon opening, as they all had little pools of grease on top.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7UXDSH2VUL83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEZMCGW#wasThisHelpful","R7UXDSH2VUL83","A8GR4PH5NW96V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8GR4PH5NW96V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've already washed it a few times and since he was at a very stinky-perfumey place, I had to add a teensy amount of bleach to the wash water once and it came out looking the same.I bought it for my husband for his 40th birthday and he loved it.

"Great air filter, the pollen sensor aspect is especially amazing.  I wish it had something for molds, we've had such back and forth weather lately that I'm sure the air is filled with molds that never get burned off by cold or heat.This air filter is a little quieter than our other filters.  There is less lit up buttons, which I think is better, the one we had in our room was lit up like a christmas tree and sometimes it seemed a bit over the top.  The filters are pretty standard and cost about the same.I really have noticed a difference after putting this in our living room.  I have a lot of allergies in the summer and spring, not just sneezing, runny nose and itchy eyes, but something really icky, itchy.  Sometimes I have to get up in the middle of the night for a dose of benadryl, or if I'm worried bout waking up in the morning, I have to slather on some hydrocortisone cream.  But everyone has hives knows that you have to be careful about overuse of hydrocortisone cream.Anyways, my itchy hives have been milder this year.  I can't tell you how wonderful that is, the crazed itchyness would keep me awake at night, sometimes it woke my husband up too (all of my shifting around in bed and itching) so gross.Great product for anyone worried about indoor air quality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PC9TRK0R1WK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LG8BQAI#wasThisHelpful","R3PC9TRK0R1WK8","A8GR4PH5NW96V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8GR4PH5NW96V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now here is the Charlaine Harris that I fell in love with back in the days when people had aol accounts and Tom and Nicole were still a couple.Unlike the first book in this series, the mystery takes up real space in this story.  Like all the Harris books I've loved before, things start out pretty mundane, Manfred meets with a client in Dallas to do a personal reading. Everything would be very normal, well, normal for a psychic who gives advice to paying customers, until his client dies and he's implicated in the death.This is where all the worldbuilding from the first book comes into play.  Personally, I really hated, HATED the first book in the series.  The characters were boring like an iceberg lettuce salad, especially considering how many dangerous and powerful paranormal creatures live in the tiny skidmark sized town.  But, I digress, all the boringness makes it so the reader doesn't have to mess with it in this story and it is so much better this way.Manfred isn't quite the adorable sexy imp that flirted up a storm with Sookie in the Southern Vampire series, but in this second book he is a bit more interesting and I like that he is really working again, not just telling the reader about his emails and website updates.Plus, this is a team up novel, something I've always liked about Charlaine Harris her characters ask for help and bring others into the mystery.  It bothers me when people try to solve everything themselves, it doesn't ring true, humans are sociable creatures we crave the company of others and it's only natural to share something as big as a client dying.I wouldn't have naturally thought of pairing Manfred with Olivia, but their opposite natures reminds me a bit of when Sookie had to ask Eric for help.  So much fun to read.All in all an enjoyable afternoon read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O1SP9HM59C80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425263193#wasThisHelpful","R3O1SP9HM59C80","A8GR4PH5NW96V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8GR4PH5NW96V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review for the black, ladder back chair with a vinyl padded seat, not the wooden seat.Just wanted to make clear which chair I am reviewing.Okay, here goes, this chair is okay and almost perfect.Here's what I like about it;1.Very sturdy design and a bit heavier than I was expecting.  My last chair was wood, it had cross beams near the bottom and I liked to rest my feet on them.  So would anyone under seven feet tall, which made it so disappointing when the cross beam broke and compromised the chair leg (there was a smallish crack in it and the chair seemed wobbly).  With metal frame and overall great construction of this chair, I can rest my legs with peace of mind, no broken chairs for me!!!2.  Looks exactly like the photo.  All black and the exact dimensions that were listed here.Here's what I didn't like;1.  Missing hardware.  there was spots for six screws to secure the seat to the base and yet only two screws were included.  Sure, it seemed sturdy, but why not have all six points locked down?2.  this is not a seat for lounging.  In fact, the butt space is a on the small side, even my skinny teen found the seat to be a bit wee.  I will still use it and be glad to have it, but it feels a bit like you will slide right off if you don't sit up straights.For the price, this is a pretty good chair.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JCFU59M51Y6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BLSEH6I#wasThisHelpful","R1JCFU59M51Y6W","A8GR4PH5NW96V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8GR4PH5NW96V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"his reads less like a novel and more like a series of blog posts.  I think if it were set up that way, the strange time jumps and the unrealistic way the main character reacts to the increasingly scary encounters with the supernatural wouldn't seems so, well, dull and not at all creepy.I really, really wanted to like this story. I love ghost stories.  I'm a huge fan of Supernatural, Poltergeist, etc.  I even checked out the youtube series this book is based on, The Haunting of Sunshine Girl and was delighted to find out there are some crazy fans of the series, but it just isn't good storytelling here.A few more thoughts I had about the book;1.  She doesn't seem worried about starting at a new school with no friends.  Very robotic and unsympathetic character.  Even the most outgoing person would be a little worried, they'd think carefully about their first day outfit, they might have walked by the school early and checked out the school website, to get more of a feel for the school.  I might be projecting my feelings here, but I can't imagine others being that different about something like this.2.  She gets along great with her mother, in fact, she says she's her best friend.  Would a best friend make you stay in a house with a dangerous ghost?  Or, more likely, not be concerned for your mental health if you think the house is haunted?.3.  The cute boy and insta friendship/lurve.  Ughh, it is just not cute, romantic or fun.  In fact, it just came off as an add on, more strangely unreal storytelling.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWAW23VI5F362/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1602862729#wasThisHelpful","RWAW23VI5F362","A8GR4PH5NW96V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8GR4PH5NW96V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sweet baby Cthulu, these are tasty.I saw these at Walmart and kinda laughed, I mean the whole concept of a vanilla stuffed, crunchy, salted pretzel seemed silly.  Ridiculous even.  So I bought a bag to take to a friends house as sort of a joke, like 'here's some ridiculous pretzel thingies.  I dare you to eat one!'  Well, we all, (okay, not my husband) loved them.In fact my friend said they reminded her of the girls in the dorm, how they'd buy a carton of frosting and then dip pretzels into it.  Which, honestly, did not sound good at all, premade frosting + pretzel sticks =  ick!  But now I'm wondering.I've always been a pretzel fan.  I like peanut butter pretzels, whole wheat honey pretzels, sourdough pretzels, soft pretzels (I even learned to make them at home), pretzel crust pizza.  Pretzel strawberry salad (it sounds awful but is always the first thing to disappear at potlucks).  But really had me doubting is the Combo label.I absolutely hate combos.  The cheddar flavored ones are horrid.  But the pizza filled ones are simply appalling.  My roommate in college loved them.  Girl probably got half of her daily calories from pizza combos and yoohoo (one of the world's worst beverages, imho.  On a sidenote, have you noticed that the only time you see people drinking yoohoo its in a movie?).  They are one of a very few ready-to-eat snack foods that I completely reject.  But I have also noticed that people who like pizza combos also tend to really like processed cheese in a can.So back to these combos that I freaking adore.  I was expecting the vanilla filling to be kinda dry and crumbly, like the peanut butter filling in a peanut butter filled pretzel.  But the filling is actually a little softer, closer to the filling inside of an orea.  Also, the pretzels had mostly intact salt crystals which added a ton of extra crunch.  The combo of salty pretzel and sweet filling was phenomenal.They have the exact same dimension of regular combos (bite sized) and come in smallish bags (my friend and I finished off a 6 oz bag in a little under an hour) and I think that is definitely a good thing because one bag was listed as six servings, each serving was 130 calories.  I am going to have to do several hours on my treadmill to work that off, sigh.I just found out that these Sweet & Salty combos are not limited to vanilla frosting flavor, there is also a salted caramel creme flavor and I haven't been able to find them anywhere except here on Amazon.These combos bring my total of tasty new food finds to one this month.I think everybody should try these so that the Mars Company doesn't pull this product before I've grown tired of them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UV9AZIR8G8WZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QDU8UKS#wasThisHelpful","R2UV9AZIR8G8WZ","A8GR4PH5NW96V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8GR4PH5NW96V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the first automated kitchen thermometer I've used.  I had an old fashioned meat thermometer, but over time, it became less and less accurate.First off, if you are like me, immensely lazy, this thermometer is just more work to use.  The old style therm is just a rinse and stick it into some meat kind of deal.  Here you have some set up.  I was busy getting a pot roast ready for the oven, so I got my husband to set it up.  He said it was pretty straightforward and easy.The only downside was that I thought it was something you could set up at the house and then leave.  I was out of green onions and garlic so I thought we'd have time to walk to the local grocery store, pick them up and get home before the roast was done.Not so fast!  The range on the stick therm devices isn't much farther than my backyard.

"I loved book one of the Chronos File so so much that I was pretty sure I'd love book two as well.  But, there was a tiny wisp of doubt that without the mystery of time travel, of the Cyrists, of Kiernan and all the things that had changed time into the bizarro world that Kate had to try and save/fix.  In other words, I was worried that Time's Edge might fall into that most terrible of things, a second book slump.I'm delighted to say that I like this book even more than book one.  I had to go back and read book one, I mostly skimmed through a bit, I was in a hurry to get onto this book.  The ending of book one was a little melancholy in my opinion.  If you haven't read it yet, you should read it BEFORE reading the rest of my review.Alrighty, let's get started!First off are Kiernan and Trey.  Because of what Kate had to do to save herself and at least try to salvage some of the timeline, namely her mother and father, Trey was lost.  He just does not remember her at all because they didn't meet yet.  But Trey is such an awesome guy that it seems like, with some work, the two of them could be a couple again.To be honest, I love Trey, he's a nice boy, very helpful and handsome.  In other words, the stereotypical YA Fantasy novel boyfriend.  He pretty much always agrees with Kate, he's always gentlemanly, caring, thoughtful and non threatening.  He's also not terribly interesting, he doesn't challenge her and I never really thought, that on Kate's part at least, that she ever had to worry that he was crazy in love with her.  I like at least a little uncertainty in my book romances and for Kate/Trey there is none at all.So even a tease that Kate might not end up with Trey was enough to keep me flipping pages long into the night.  Once you can wrap your head about multiple timelines, multiple lives lived by Kate, well, it certainly kept me interested.This book, even more than book one shows how easily every little change can have huge effects.  Kate is a careful person and she more than most people knows that she is walking a fine line between destroying or saving the world.  The ethics of tampering with the timeline is a central theme but so is her relationships with everyone around her.  Relationships that subtly change each time she changes something.I got the feeling in this book, even more than in the first that time travel should never have been attempted, the temptation to meddle and the possibility for disaster are too great for most anyone to resist.Now my thoughts on the villains of this book; Pru and Saul.  Neither is a mustache twirling monster, yet they are so evil in their intentions that it was like watching a tiger rampaging through a village snapping up children to eat, it was hard to see how the people around them couldn't figure out what they were.Still, the search for the chronos keys and Kate's race to stay ahead of the Cyrists was completely engrossing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37QIQSP2GLRII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477825827#wasThisHelpful","R37QIQSP2GLRII","A8GR4PH5NW96V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8GR4PH5NW96V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The way this bike attaches makes it difficult or (in my case) impossible to attach to a bike with handbrakes, if you have a manual - peddle backwards brakes bike, this would be perfect.The next time I take my bike in for repair or a tune up, I will bring this basket in with me to see if the guys at the shop can figure a way to work my brake lines away from where this basket attaches to the steering column and handles, but so far, it wont work.Also, the bottom connection is hard to make, one side was infinitesimally smaller than the other side, the top part, where you slide the basket in works perfectly.  Also, if you are like me and wanted to use this basket for shopping, where you would take the basket into a store, buy what you want to buy and use the basket instead of the proffered bag, then proceed out to your bike you will discover a really irritating problem.You will need to remove the contents of the basket before replacing the empty basket onto your bike.  The reason for this is because the items in your basket will obscure the tiny holes that you have to line up with the gear to fasten the basket to the bike.  Then you could re-add the items to your basket before heading back home or wherever it is you wish to go.I think this bike would be good for those old timey bikes, the kind with the wide, leather touring seats.

"Something about this story seemed a bit familiar.  All weekend I couldn't get the feeling that I'd read this book before.  I chatted with my husband, but he said it was highly likely and he'd read lots of sci fi with similar scenario.Finally, I revisited my bookshelf and aha!  I found three books with super identicle storylines.The first book is The Warrior Heir by Cinda Chima Williams, about a boy who finds out he is part of a giant game where people with powers compete for dominance.The second book is The Maze Runner by James Dashner.  The third is The Decoy Princess and the fourth is The Game by Monica Hughes, it turns out, I've read a lot of these stories, because I thought up two others later that night when I was making dinner.But the problem is that I didn't really care for the writing style or the characters in this book.I forced myself to keep reading, I know how easily bored I can get with a book,  I've often given up on a story after just a few paragraphs only to come back to it later and then love it to pieces (Hunger Games, The 5th Wave.But, Endgame just never really sparked for me.  The premise of the story wasn't very believable and since the characters all seemed one dimensional and forgettable, I was left with a big ole book of blah.I gave up reading after chapter four.

"This is one of my favorites and the first time that I've used an entire tube of lip color, usually I have to throw them away because they've become too old and it isn't a good idea to keep old cosmetics.I don't wear makeup everyday, but lipstick or gloss are my thing, I have full, pale lips with an icky lavender color to them, so whenever I feel especially in need of a color perkup, I reach for lipgloss.  But some glosses are just too greasy and some lipsticks are too hard and chalky for my often dry lips, this is somewhere in between.I even get compliments on it, something that never happens with other lip colors.  Best of all, if you put on a light coat it just looks like a healthy I-just-went-for-a-brisk-walk glow.I can't attest to its staying power, I usually forget I'm wearing it and go about my day doing all sorts of lip color wearing activities; eating, sneezing, making rude fart noises, drinking coffee, but I haven't noticed that it disappears any faster than my regular clinique color; Shy (that's the name of the color, simply awful, right?).One of the perks of buying Clinique lipsticks (the only ones I buy) is that they are fragrance free.

"Not as square and sturdy as I'd hoped.  They are however, exactly the color you see on your screen, a pretty blue like you see on a hazy winter evening.  The strange thing about the baskets was the scent.I was a little worried that they'd smell a bit musty or mildewed, but instead they smell like freshly picked lavender.  Not the noxious lavender candles you can buy at a certain mall candle store and not the lavender essential oil which I find so sharp and offensive, they smell like the real deal, floral with a hint of hay (I live not far from a Lavender farm, in the spring, when the flowers are first blooming, the smell spreads to everything, our clothes, our food, it's nice.  I usually don't like the smell of flowers.)The baskets have a tendency to lean inwards a bit and I'd be loath to use them in a damp place- like the bathroom.  But I'm using the largest basket to hold gloves and the two smaller baskets are holding small desk items.The texture and color are unique and I like them a little more than I thought I would. I'm not usually a natural weave, earthy products kind of decorator (when it comes to cleaning and toiletries, I am though), but I'm surprised at what a nice contrast they make to the glossy glass and hard wood that I usually lean to when it comes to storage items.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D6SUFJVFVJKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LN72ZTS#wasThisHelpful","R2D6SUFJVFVJKZ","A8GR4PH5NW96V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8GR4PH5NW96V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A fast winter read.While this was a quick and mostly satisfying read, I had a few problems with the resolution, the bad guys, the good guys and the entire set up for this book.  But somehow, even with these marks against it, I finished the book in two days and generally was entertained.For the good;1.  The heroine, Britt.  She's determined, thinks ahead and is vulnerable in ways that were believable.  In the beginning of the book her reactions to the events that happened once she and her best friend were stranded on the highway were real and honest.  As the story went on I thought she seemed a little too stoic.  But this was a minor quibble.2.  Britt's inner thoughts, I found so much to relate with here, in spite of the fact that I am not a teenager, not heartbroken about a  boy and have never desired a mountain backpacking vacation.  The way she talks about her relationship with her ex, Calvin and even more revealing, her friendship with Korbie.  I've experienced the girl competition with a friend and I'm afraid my reaction was the same, shock, that there was a competition and disappointment, that my friend thought of me in that way.3.  The mountains.  There was a certain amount of desperation because of the scenery. When you plop a modern person into the mountains with no handy space heaters, bathtubs of hot water and refrigerators full of food, it can feel like the end of the world.  The setting of the story took on a life of its own as it forced the characters to act, harshly and quickly to the threats of death that were approaching with each chill breeze.Now for the bad;1.  Why drag along your shopping obsessed, I can't go outside without my makeup friend to a hiking trip?  Of all the vacations to avoid, reluctant vacationers is high on my list.2.

"The Lynburn Legacy series is one that I'd seen at the bookstore and it was even recc'd to me on Amazon a few times, but it took me several months and too many book duds before I gave this series a try.  Boy am I glad I did, because it so much better than I thought it would be for two super cool reasons;First, the main character, Kami Glass, is sassy.  She's a smartass, wisecracking fount of asides and questionable wisdom.  I freaking love her.  There isn't enough sass in YA fiction and reading the first book in this series, Unspoken, illuminated this terrible void.  There is an abundance of angst, naivete, melancholy, straightlaced prudery and needless rebelliousness but pert and cheeky girls, not so much. Every situation Kami encounters she faces with a witty rejoinder and brave effort.Second thing I love the most is the intriguing worldbuilding.  On the surface, Sorry-in-the-Vale is a normal, boring English village.  But in reality otherworldly events have shaped the village and its people in surprising ways, Not the least of which is Kami and her imaginary friend (secret voice in her head that turns out to be a real boy, sorry for the spoiler, but Untold is the second book in the series and the voice-in-the-head mystery is revealed in book one).  The worldbuilding is doled out in small amounts, so you don't have to wade through chapters of explanations about what the world is like and why.The strangeness of Sorry-in the-Vale (Best name ever, am I right?) explodes when the plots of book one come to a head, leaving me breathlessly waiting for book two, hallelujah, Ms. Brennan is a fast writer.  Hearts are broken, evildoers revealed and Kami is left alone as the one person she thought would always be on her side has left her.Right off book two jumps into the battle with Scarecrows that reminded me a bit of a Doctor Who episode; The Family of Blood.  Anyways, the story goes on from here with Kami doing her best to protect the people she cares about.More secrets are revealed and the battle for the Vale isn't just on the horizon its starting.  Now that the Lynburns and magic have returned, the reader realizes that the village was never what they thought it was and that magic was always meant to be there.I can't help but comment on Kami and Jared, the main pairing for the book.  There is definitely some romance but I'm not sure if there will be a happily ever after for this couple, either way, I love the book and the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VLDLTDM6VMJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C4BA3WS#wasThisHelpful","R1VLDLTDM6VMJZ","A8GR4PH5NW96V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8GR4PH5NW96V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not sure how to rate this.  I would say 5 stars on the hoodie but 1 star on the condition of the one I received.I have two of these  in gray and brown in size L and XL and both have been a little huge since I first purchased them.  Since I have lost a good deal of weight I chose to order the small in black.  It was sold and shipped by Amazon.When it arrived the package had been taped up haphazardly with packing tape and I could see it was folded down the middle and wadded up in the bag.  Not a good sign.  When I opened the plastic bag I could see it was not black but gray.  That would have been okay.  The tags had been removed and were laying in the bag. I slipped it on and while it fit with a short sleeve shirt underneath I knew it was too small to wear a sweater. I immediately got it ready to put back in the bag  When I was folding it up to send back  I really became disillusioned.  It had white matter on it that appeared like hardened sugar from a glazed donut. It also had pet hair and lint on it.  Obviously it had been worn and was not in new condition.I do intend to reorder as this is a very unusual occurance with anything from Amazon.  I do realize it had a reduced price but if it indicates it is a new item it should be in new condition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18EKFZVJK3W8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEOODHW#wasThisHelpful","R18EKFZVJK3W8X","A27FP0S5QH7GNE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FP0S5QH7GNE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It took 11 days for these earrings to arrive which was within the timeframe offered at checkout.  They were definitely worth the weight.First let me say they are not the dark color shown on your screen.  I did not expect them to be.  Carnelian is a orange red and not so dark.  Mine came in exactly as I expected.  The stones are evenly matched in color, quality, and size.  The silverwork is flawless with unique post design.  They have a substantial post but I did need to replace the back to a larger disk back to hold the earring post in the correct position.  The post is at the bottom of the top section and they wanted to fall forward.  Once a larger back was in place the earrings were worn all day without moving.  They are light in weight but heavy in prescence.I have ordered from Novica before and each time I find what I receive to be well worth waiting for!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L044564I1MTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HHCQPS#wasThisHelpful","R2L044564I1MTX","A27FP0S5QH7GNE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FP0S5QH7GNE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For some time I have noticed this ring and thought it was a little plain but when on sale at 40%  off decided to give it a try.  I had just purchased another item from Carolyn Pollack in smoky quartz and needed a ring to match in silver.I was so very pleased when I opened the velvet type bag and saw this ring.  It is a real beauty.  It is all silver with zero oxidation.  There is intricate silverwork under the setting and down the shank of the ring.  The stone is rounded and not faceted.  I have a 8 carat smoky quartz in gold and this stone is much larger than that one.  I do wish the carat weight had been mentioned in the description.  Please take a moment to look at the views which show this ring at different angles to see its real beauty.  If I had done that sooner I would have tried this ring sooner.

"I have several KitchenAid peelers which I use daily.  Since I collect Fiestaware in a variety of colors for my kitchen I thought this would be a nice addition.I received the sunflower and it does match my sunflower Fiesta dishes.  It also appears very well made.  However, it is much heavier and bulkier than the KitchenAid peeler.  FYI the KitchenAid weighs in at 2.3 ounces while the Fiesta weighs in at 6.1 ounces.  Due to this weight I feel it very awkward to handle when peeling.  It is also 1 1/4 inches longer than the KitchenAid and this makes it more difficult to use as well.  However, the blades on both are the same length.This is one of those items I should have returned but didn't.

"This is quite beautiful with lots of intricate details.  It is fun just to stare at and find all those details.  It features a large enhancer bail which should accomodate up to 8mm beads or pearls.  The bronze outline as well as the brass around the stone accentuate all the highs and lows of the silverwork details.  I have the brass colored cord necklace already which it suits very well.  Unfortunately as sometimes happens with natural gemstones my stone has a large black spot at the center of the lovely rhodonite stone.  Looks as if someone took a Sharpie and colored a spot.  I will be returning this but am unsure I will reorder due to the size of the pendant.  It is almost 2 1/2 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide and weighs in at 30 grams.

"I first purchased the matching Pietersite earrings and loved them so much that I purchased the matching ring.  The stones in both items were just beautiful. Rich glossy dark brown with flecks of gold.  I had never seen Pietersite before but was quite impressed with their quality.  After admiring the necklace and enhancer for a few months I finally decided to purchase.First let me say that Relios, Southwest Spirit, Carolyn Pollack and American West are all under the same company umbrella.  Anything you purchase is of impeccable quality.  They have wonderful customer service and guarantee their jewelry for life.  This necklace was no exception.  The stones are large without any flaws, the silver beads are of a substantial size and offset the brown stones beautifully, the clasp is unique and will accept any of the medium and large enhancers, the enhancer is lovely and of substantial size.  My only problem was the stone in the enhancer  has a great deal of gray matrix in only the top half of the stone.  While the bottom half is the rich dark brown with gold flecks like my ring and earrings. No one else might ever notice but I can tell it even at a distance.  The other beads in the necklace also have a great deal of the grey matrix which is fine but I wanted the enhancer to match my ring and earrings more closely.  This is just one of those things that happen when you are dealing with natural stones.  If my ring had the same matrix I would not mind.I have ordered another necklace and enhancer in hopes that I will find a more suitable stone.Update.  Unfortunately the second necklace had even  more pronounced grey matrix both in the enhancer and the beads.  While it is just lovely with beautiful stones, it doesn't come close to matching my dark brown earrings and ring.  This happens in dealing with natural stones.  I think for now I will have to pass on this lovely necklace.  If I could receive one colored like the photo I would be very happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XEM97BR2MHR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A3IGQNY#wasThisHelpful","R2XEM97BR2MHR4","A27FP0S5QH7GNE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FP0S5QH7GNE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You can even add the bracelet to this necklace and have a 26"" necklace.  All of it together is a real WOW!  The stones are varying shades of red with carnelian, jasper, and red bamboo.  Red bamboo is really bright red while the carnelian is an orangy red and the jasper a deep burgundy.  The stones are well matched and flawless.  The clasp is well designed and works effortlessly.

I have other matching red pieces from Relios and thought this would compliment them.  I was exactly correct.  It matches the ""color collection"" perfectly as well as the multigemstone 18"" toggle necklace.  Just a tip...it can be attached to the 18"" and makes a longer necklace.The sterling cap is ribbed and there are intricate designs on the remainder of the clasp.  It opens and closes securely.  Keep in mind that you can add the enhancer charms for even more versatility.  The stones are varying shades of red from the orangy red of carnelian to the bright red of the red bamboo.

It has a oversized enhancer bail with beading as well.  The back is silky smooth.  While it is named a ""cross"" design to me it appears more flower like.  What a fiery statement this makes.

"I had ordered the pietersite earrings from Relios and liked them so much that I decided to try the ring.  I am glad that I did.While I am not a ""western"" sort of gal I was concerned about this design.  However, it was unfounded.  This ring is appropriate no matter what your style.  The rope detail allows this to match up with other Relios designs with ease.  The ring is a knuckle to knuckle style with a large glossy pietersite stone.  If you have never seen pietersite of this quality it is definitely worth a look.  My stone had lots of flakes of golden in it and it is just stunning.  There are open spaces beside the stone and this gives your finger some air and adds to the deminsion of the ring.  It is extremely comfortable and very eye catching.  I am seriously considering the matching enhancer and necklace.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N1FHOD31UBF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A3IGU9E#wasThisHelpful","R2N1FHOD31UBF3","A27FP0S5QH7GNE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FP0S5QH7GNE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been eyeing these earrings for several months as I thought they were particularly lovely.  These are some of the largest in the Relios collection and I decided they were going to be something I would wear often and worth the investment.When they arrived I was pleased with the silverwork and the size.  However, I found the stones disappointing.  The lapis were beautiful evenly matched stones, the turquoise on one earring had some darker matrix while the other earring the turquoise was without matrix at all.  Then there is the amethyst in which I was most unhappy with.  The amethyst stones on both earrings was very pale lavender.  Not nearly the rich color I was expecting.  With the lapis and turquoise stones being such rich colors the amethyst appeared even paler.  Somehow the amethyst appeared not to go well at all.Regardless of the stones I would have returned this earring as it was just too heavy for my ears and drooped forward even though these have a substantial back.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UHNI0J9YPK6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009ZFBN7U#wasThisHelpful","R1UHNI0J9YPK6I","A27FP0S5QH7GNE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FP0S5QH7GNE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purchased this ring to replace a malachite ring that didn't fit any longer.  It is part of a matching ensemble of enhancer, malachite bead strand, earrings and bracelet.  Those pieces are a beautiful dark rich green.  They have no light green at all.  I knew I as taking a chance finding a ring with the exact shading but was hopeful.When I opened the box I was disappointed by the stone.  It has a design that looks like half of a knot hole with lots of very light green that almost appears white.  While the stone is a very substantial size and is smooth as silk it doesn't come close to matching my other malachite pieces.  The silverwork is beautiful and the ring is very well made.

"Was unsure how to rate this shoe.  It is a very well made shoe although it lacks any arch support.  The leopard design is very cute with mixtures of grey, black, taupe and chocolate brown in the print.  It would match lots of outfits and would be appropriate most any season.  The elastic band is done in black.Normally I wear Clarks and Vionic shoes and wear a 9.5M.  SInce I have not worn a pair of Bass shoes in quite a while I decided to order both the 9.5M and 10M in an effort to find a good fit.  Tried the 9.5M on first and was surprised that it was too short and rubbed my toes and noticed that it was a bit wide and gaped open on the sides of the arch area.  Then tired on the 10M.

I buy from all and feel confident about the quality, craftsmanship, and customer service.This is one of the enhancer pendants and it will readily fit over a variety of chains and beads.  I am not a ""green"" person usually but found this shade of green looks great with summer colors of fushia, yellow, aqua, etc.  but looks equally at home with brown and mustard yellow as well as black.It is well made and finished beautifully.

"I ordered this dress in a size 10 and size 12.  Both fit similarly but the 12 seemed to be the best fit and that is the one I kept.The dress is very nicely manufactured with smooth seams and quality fabric. You cannot see through this fabric and could easily wear without a camisole or slip.  The jacket is a heavier weight and would go nicely with other clothing if you have something that would match.  The color is a beautiful navy just as the online photo indicates. I ordered this for an afternoon wedding and it was perfectly appropriate.I had this a few weeks prior to the wedding and had tried it on when it arrived.  I should have double checked as I didn't realize the way the bodice is cut.  It is very low near the arm holes and I did not have a single bra that the top of the bra did not show!

"This was my first purchase of Cobb Hill brand shoes.  The had a look about them that reminded me of Clarks shoes and when I saw this one so deeply discounted I siezed the opportunity to try out the brand.I ordered my usual size of 9.5M in the blue/teal color.  I was not disappointed when it arrived.  If I had not known better I would have thought it a Clarks shoe.  The quality of the leather and the styling and attention to detail were not overlooked by Cobb Hill.  The color really is very teal and will look good for fall.  I liked the tread and the heel design as well.As far as the sizing...I found it to be spot on with Clarks as well except that the right shoe seemed a bit wider than the left.  Not usual for me when purchasing shoes.  The right shoe seemed to slip a bit when walking as well.  I have ordered another Cobb Hill similar style in the narrow width to see if it works better for me.  If so I may return these for the narrower width since I don't plan on wearing them until fall.

"I had been looking for a nice pair of brown shoes to wear with a maxi skirt, leggings and dress pants.  Saw this at a phenomenal price and took a chance.My usual Clarks size is 9.5M (I am on the narrow side of M) and these fit perfectly!  They were as if made for my foot.  The elastic goring allows for easy on and off. While they have a ""shootie"" appearance I think they would go well with most any apparel.  The photo does not do justice to the strips of leather across the front of the shoe.  One is suede, one is smooth leather and one strip is snake print.  The inside of the shoe is very plush and sued as well with good support.  Having had knee replacement I can no longer wear high heels and found this shoe height to be ideal for everyday wear.I loved this shoe so much that I immediately ordered the black suede option even though it was $16 more!

"I have very mixed opinions of this shoe and have not decided if I will keep it or return.  I have been searching for quite some time for a nice grey leather shoe to wear with grey dress pants.First, sizing, I usually wear a 9.5M in Clarks shoes and found this one fit perfectly in width and length.  I found it a bit snug to try to put it on without unbuckling and if someone had a high arch they might have to unbuckle every time putting it on.  I would have had room to wear only a thin sock.Secondly, support.  There is virtually no arch support in this shoe. That is not an issue for me since I always have to put an orthotic arch support in all my shoes.Thirdly, structure.  It is a very well made shoe that looks very high end. However there is no cushioning around the ankle area and it feels rough to the skin. I believe wearing them for any period of time would cause blisters.Fourth, looks.  While it is ""menswear"" inspired it has a femine appearance as well.  The photo does not adequately depict the cutout design on the toe area.  Those circle cutouts are filled in with glossy black!  It really takes away from the appearance of the shoe in my opinion.  Almost as if something has been spilled on the toe of the shoe.I have tried this shoe on several times and just can't warm up to it.  However, the color is just what I was looking for minus the glossy black fillins on the toe.Ultimately I decided to return.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R377ZDHET492CW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWZM0IQ#wasThisHelpful","R377ZDHET492CW","A27FP0S5QH7GNE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FP0S5QH7GNE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I checked with the local watch shop and they did not have a navy 24mm replacement band for my Guess watch.  So I took to Amazon to try and locate one.  This was the only one in the 24mm size in navy and I quickly purchased.  It arrived quickly and in good condition (or so I thought).My husband had no trouble removing the old band and getting this one ready.  He first put on the section that is longer with the holes.  It was a little difficult and a very tight fit.  The other section took him almost an hour to put on and required him to cut a part of the band off where it attaches to the watch.  The back of the band lining ends were not cut from the portion that the pins slip through and this made this side of the band quite a bit thicker than the other side.  He actually had to put this side in a vice and smash it together to get it to be thin enough to siip on my watch.Yes I would have returned had I known it was going to take this much time and be this aggrevating.  Bottom line is the band was not properly made but we didn't know that until well into trying to put it on the watch.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4VCJ40M684X0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002EEP61S#wasThisHelpful","R4VCJ40M684X0","A27FP0S5QH7GNE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FP0S5QH7GNE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had watched this item for a while and was interested in purchasing for my two cats.  They love to follow things like my Roomba around and thought this might interest them.It arrived well packaged and in good condition.  You must have a screw driver to put the batteries inside. The one I received had a white and dark brown hamster and the ball was not pink as pictured but rather a clear blue color.  Naturally my cats could have cared less about the coloring.The ball is easy to open but you do have to match up the hole to close it securely.  It rolls around really good on hardwoods and tile but is sluggish to almost stopping on carpeting.  The hamster does not make noise as the zhu zhu pets do.  You do hear the wheels rolling.Others had mentioned using it without the ball.  The hamster only goes around and round in small circle if you use it without the ball.My cats are interested in this and it keeps them occupied for a few minutes but they quickly lose interest and walk away.  Keep in mind you have to take it out of the ball everytime you want to turn it on or off.  I am not sure how much use the plastic knotches and holes will hold up.

"My daughter purchased one of these first and recommended it to me.  I wanted to try microwave potato chips and needed a mandoline slicer.  The price on this one has varied from $16 to $22 over the past couple of weeks and I was able to purchase at the lower price.This comes from Norpro which is a reputable company I have purchased from before.  There are a variety of blades but I have only used the regular blade which is very sharp and makes quick work of slicing potatoes.  It also comes with a juicer attachment.  It does unfold and stands securely.I will say that I do not like the mechanism and the guard that holds the item to slice.  It is very unstable and your vegetable (or fruit, cheese, etc) must attach to the four prongs inset in the guard. Most of the potatoes I have used did not fit properly as they were either too large or too small. For me, very few items have fit securely and I find myself using my hand instead.  You have to be exceedlingly careful to to slice your fingers!For use once in a while this is fine as long as I am careful.

"Hands down this is my favorite knife of all time.  I orginally found this knife at a discount store and was intrigued as the packaging indicated it was perfect for slicing tomatoes.  Even though I balked at the $12 price tag I decided to try it.  I was amazed to find out how much these knives retail for and have since purchased one everytime I find one less than $20.It is the perfect size and weight for everyday slicing of veggies and fruits.  It will slice a tomato paper thin as well as onions and anything else you put in its path.  My husband has since found a set of these in a larger more rigid size that are great as well.  Henckels knives are certainly worth every penny.  I recently purchased one and sent to my daughter who wanted a good knife.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XP34VN62C1HJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000TPCX6#wasThisHelpful","R2XP34VN62C1HJ","A27FP0S5QH7GNE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27FP0S5QH7GNE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of my favorite kitchen gadgets.  Having arthritis in my fingers makes opening jars painful sometimes.  Then sometimes there are just jars no one with reasonable strength can open!  This is a lifesaver for me.  No more frustration at trying to start a recipe only to find you cannot open a key ingredient.  One note:  this will not open jars with less than 1"" diameter (think soy sauce bottle) but there is one available from Kuhn Rikon that will fit some of those smaller size bottles if that is what you need. It is called a multi function jar opener.

"My daughters and I are all on the whole 30 program and thus chop, slice, and dice a variety of veggies and fruits daily. One daughter complained that she didn't have enough knives.  So, for her birthday I selected this set as part of her present.  They were a huge hit.  She loved the cheerful colors as well as the selection and the fact that they had covers for each of the blades.  My other daughter wants a set too.

"Well, this was a disappointment. I was sent a sample for an independent review, and I trusted the size chart. Big mistake! I asked for my usual size Medium but Meaneor must have changed suppliers because this top is easily two sizes too small for me. The top part (shoulders) is only a little tight, but the sleeves are really narrow and there is no space at all for my hips. So when they say slim fit, that is code for cut straight. If your hips flare out, as mine do, this top was not made for us! To add to the size issue, the cuffs and bottom edge of the jacket are made of the same material, instead of the more traditional elasticated ribbed knit, so there is no stretch at all and I could hardly get my hand inside the cuff.It's a shame because the top is really pretty, and it deserves the 4 stars I've given it. I like the zip detail, the studs and the hood. The fabric seems of good quality and is a lot heavier and (I think) warmer than I anticipated. The colour (I have the Lake Blue) is also lovely. It's just that the cut will only suit a certain type of figure and is not forgiving or adjustable. And if anyone at Meaneor is listening, it would be an idea to include a hip measurement for this style of garment, just to give us a hint, because according to the size chart, this jacket should have fit me. To help you decide, I've just measured the inside of the hip hem for a size Medium and it's 34 inches or 86 cm.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE6L0KL8H7HET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CK8G8K#wasThisHelpful","RE6L0KL8H7HET","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My review relates to the Inateck hard drive enclosure - Model FE3001.  I received a sample to allow me to test and review this brilliant new hard drive enclosure.These cases essentially turn any 3.5 (and also 2.5 in this case) internal SATA hard drive into a portable external drive, and are invaluable to retrieve data in case of computer failure.  What is different about this model is the aluminium alloy skin, which makes the enclosure a bit heavier than the usual plastic, but takes full advantage of the metal's heat dissipating properties.  As a state-of-the-art product, there is UASP support, providing top blazing speeds of up to 6GBps.  In practice, operating speed will depend on your set-up and attached device, but the specs are certainly impressive.  It also comes with a fast USB 3.0 interface, retro-compatible to older standards.My old pc has now been superseded by a brand new tower, so this caddy arrived at a perfect time, saving me the chore of wiping the old drive clean before safe disposal.  Instead, I have acquired a really useful removable hard drive for backup storage.The caddy is a solidly-built aluminium alloy case with a USB 3.0 Micro B port, power input and two small LED lights (blue for activity and green to confirm power). Also in the box are a very capable-looking USB cable (1 metre long), a 12V adapter for direct connection to a wall outlet, a small screwdriver, screws and foam pads to stabilize the drive, and a very clear manual in English and German. Installation is really simple: open the shell, place your hard drive inside, aligning the connectors, secure laterally with the screws (the same way as when mounting a hard drive inside a tower), slide the whole thing closed and secure the side with two screws.You then plug the adapter into a convenient outlet, connect the FE3001 to your computer via the supplied USB cable and turn it on. USB 3.0 protocol is backward compatible with older USB standards. Everything about this caddy is geared towards flexibility and compatibility.In action, this drive case delivers impressive speeds for both read and write operations, and as I would have expected, it performs much better with my new tower than my year-old laptop (both running Win 8.1). I have tested other Inateck products and, without exception, they are reliable and well engineered. This top quality piece of kit will be in constant use now as a backup removable drive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TWT9LQR4NQJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UAA4J6G#wasThisHelpful","R2TWT9LQR4NQJ5","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very happy with these leggings which, for a change, are actually long enough for my legs.  I'm 5'8 (1.73 m), not exceptionally tall but, somehow, I have trouble finding leggings that cover the ankles.  I received a sample pair for an independent evaluation, and when I tried them on, was very pleased to see that a size S/M is just about perfect for me.  The other available size is L/XL and might have been just as good but I went with my waist size and they fit me like a second skin (my usual dress size is US 8).  They don't quite reach my waistline but I find them really comfortable to wear, all day, with a long sweater or loose top.  They look good with just about anything.I got them in Black and they are a nice thickness, not exactly thermal like fleece, but warmer than some others I have.  Actually quite dressy and they have a nice bit of stretch, the knees don't get baggy after I've been sitting for a while.  Easy to wash, I used a cool setting and they did not shrink at all.  Despite the low price, finishing and stitching are very good.  If they had them in dark blue, I would certainly buy two or three pairs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R204HAXM2F32IV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015E21R2I#wasThisHelpful","R204HAXM2F32IV","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since I started using one of these acrylic organizers last year, I have become sort of addicted.  When Kurtzy extended an invitation to try out their version of these products, I was curious to see how it would compare.Their range includes a number of acrylic organizer in different shapes and sizes so there is a great choice depending on what you want to store.  However, it's difficult to decide what gets the star treatment:  cosmetics, make-up, creams, jewellery, sewing notions?  I have lots of small objects that benefit greatly from being organized in a see-through display that looks this pretty, so this is my third one.It is a small chest with four drawers, two wide (22 x 12 cm approx.) and two half size, side by side.  The soft mesh fabric keeps your stuff from sliding about but can be removed if you don't need it, or you can use your own fabric liners, lace or even paper.  Originally I envisaged using this to store small electronic components such as short USB charging cables, plug converters, mp3s, Bluetooth transmitters, and the like but, having filled it with jewellery to take my photos, I think I've changed my mind.  See, that's the problem.  These units are too versatile, and too decorative!The materials used are of  very good quality:  the clear acrylic plastic is solid and quite thick; the drawers slide smoothly and retract fully into the box, giving good protection from dust; the moulded handles of the same clear plastic are easy to grasp; there's nothing cheap about it.  The chest sits squarely on a table or vanity and I found that one of my old make-up organizers fits perfectly over the top, making it into a 2-tier little cabinet.  I was hoping to find one with slots large enough for bottles of essential oils.  That would be terrific, as I have more than 40 sliding about in a large box.  Maybe the one for nail polish bottles would work?","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B2HBITU8VR00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144IJ8OW#wasThisHelpful","R2B2HBITU8VR00","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set of writing instruments was sent to me for evaluation, and I was really looking forward to trying them out because I am somewhat of a pen aficionado.  However, what could have been a really good quality product falls short on several levels, as I will explain.  The box is quite nice, bi-coloured and pretty enough to give as a gift.  Inside, however, the presentation drops a little in quality:  the two pens are loosely held by a ribbon, and three extra ink cartridges are floating about in the box (there was one more inside the pen).  It looks like a last-minute addition, rather than a well thought-out package.Both pens are chunky and smooth, made of brushed stainless steel and they look identical.  I like thick pens and prefer them to overly-skinny ones that are difficult to hold, however, these pens are fairly heavy and, once the cap is in place, they don't feel terribly well balanced.  To make matters worse, the cap does not lock very well and sometimes falls off while I'm writing.The ballpoint writes beautifully and has a smooth point that simply glides over the page.  The medium-fine point is exactly what I like best and, as one expects from good pens, it brings out my best penmanship.  The fountain pen, however, the one I was really interested in, for some reason refuses to work.  I have owned dozens of fountain pens, from my school days on, and have done everything I can think of to clean and prime this pen, but to no avail: the ink simply does not flow into the nib.I'm sure it's a fluke, because others seem to have a different experience, but I have to review the item I was sent, and this fountain pen is defective.  It might be that the ink is partly at fault and that brings me to the last reason this set loses points.  There is no indication, either in the packaging, or online of the type of refill that would be suitable.  So, once the current ballpoint cartridge is finished, I have no idea what to buy to replace it.  As for the fountain pen, I have wasted three cartridges trying it coax it into writing, and don't know what refills I should get.So, with regret, I can only award three stars, mostly because the ballpoint pen is really lovely.  At the current price of $20 (including shipping), these should be a decent buy, but I would prefer to spend a little more and have two working pens, rather than just one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDHU6DY5VLL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144HA4R8#wasThisHelpful","RDHU6DY5VLL4","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last year I got a similar organizer for some of my smaller make-up items and it has literally changed the way I do things in that department.  No more searching through make-up bags, or messy drawers.  So, when offered the chance to try out this two-tier organizer for review purposes, I was delighted to accept.There are two pieces: the base unit consists of two shallow drawers lined with a soft, plastic mesh material to stop things sliding about; the top tray is divided asymmetrically in several small compartments:  four small slots (ideal for lipsticks, lip glosses and tubes of mascara), a curved open section (where I keep lip balms), two more slots at the back with higher sides (for make-up brushes, for example) and an open section for larger items, like nail polish, jars or perfume bottles.  As you can see, this variety of compartments offers a lot of flexibility to hold small items and all the bits and pieces that get lost in larger containers.  The drawers are small (18 x 10 cm) and hold a couple of compacts each; they would also be ideal for bracelets, necklaces, hair clips.  We all have our small treasures that are difficult to store and these perfectly see-through organizers become quite addictive.  Also useful for sewing and craft supplies, jewellery, ribbons.  Once you have one, you will find lots of uses for it.This is a good quality item:  the clear acrylic plastic is thick and solid;  the drawers slide surprisingly easily.  The only thing that could be better is that the top unit only barely sits over the drawer unit, and could be dislodged by a careless movement.  It would be nice if the top could be made to slot in a little more securely. Apart from that small criticism, I find this holder incredibly useful and really pretty to look at, regardless of what you fill it with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R395DS2YTZBIUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144IJN92#wasThisHelpful","R395DS2YTZBIUB","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This beautiful, magically-folding-away guitar stand was sent to me for an independent test and evaluation, and my husband was very happy to receive it as he was one stand short of requirements.  He wrote the following review based on a test period of two weeks, including taking the stand along to a friend's place several times.The stand is extremely light, being made of aluminium.  Once folded and stored safely inside the pretty travel bag, you can carry it by the strings over the tip of your little finger.  There are three metallic finishes:  red, dark blue and silver.  I asked for the blue one, it's a gunpowder shade, very elegant.The most impressive thing about this stand (apart from its feather weight) is how easily it folds in and out.  And I mean, really smoothly.  The feet extend both front and back, the legs pull up to the perfect spot to rest your instrument on, and the rubber treads adjust to the various shapes of whatever instrument you place on them, and lock it into place with a couple of rotating little rubber wings.  It holds my large acoustics as solidly and securely as the thinner but heavier electric guitar.When I first placed a guitar over the backrest, I thought it might be a little dodgy, with the stand being so light, but it's actually very stable and functions perfectly well as a permanent holder, but with the added convenience of portability and adjustability.  Clever design, top quality manufacture and covered by a Lifetime Guarantee. I think it's great!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E1848G6NZLJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K17YFBW#wasThisHelpful","R1E1848G6NZLJ7","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sent to me for an independent test and evaluation, this guitar capo truly is deluxe.  Since my husband plays guitar and I don't, this review was prepared by him.The first thing that impressed me about this capo is the weight.  It's not a negative, in fact, I love the authoritative air of this small but solid-looking accessory.  I selected the colour Bronze and that in itself is a luxury.  Other choices are Black, Gold, Silver and Coffee.  I think Bronze looks fantastic on my guitars, it really looks classy.My old capo works on a ratchet principle and I'm never quite sure that the grip I've forced is going to be maintained.  This capo locks on by means of a strong spring and I find that really confidence-giving.  The inner surfaces are lined with a grippy silicone, smooth on top where it contacts the strings, and ribbed below to better hug the neck of the guitar, very gentle on the finish.  Incidentally, this capo is suitable for other stringed instruments as well (ukelele, bass, banjo and mandolin). I looked at the differences between the Deluxe and the Standard in a pack of two and, although I was tempted by the jazzy colours (especially the blue), I decided that I could not pass up the combination of zinc alloy body and steel spring.In use, the capo is brilliant and I'm enjoying it so much that I might be tempted to use it much more often.  Until now, capos have not been all that important to me but when you get one that works like this one, it makes you want to use it all the time.The presentation is first class:  nice box and a beautiful little protective pouch with drawstrings, nicely made to hold the capo safe and snug in transit.  Really top quality capo, and covered by a Lifetime Guarantee.  I can't see how anyone would not love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FQSL9IKREHU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VOQQDH8#wasThisHelpful","R2FQSL9IKREHU9","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I accepted this brilliant piece of kit for testing, I did not realize just how versatile it is.  Packaging is neat and unfussy.  In the small box, as well as the device itself, are a very short 3.5 mm audio cable (about 4 inches long), a good-quality USB cable with a micro connector for charging the internal battery, and a very clear manual in English and German.The idea is to create Bluetooth connectivity with equipment that is not so equipped; all you need is a 3.5 mm audio port (the place where you would plug in your earphones).  There are many similar gadgets around, however, where this tiny device really shines is that it has a dual mode: it is both a Transmitter and a Receiver.The booklet explains very extensively how to use in each mode, but basically TX is Transmitter mode and RX is Receiver mode and there is a simple slider on the side to switch from one to the other.  As per instructions, I plugged it in for an initial charge which took maybe two hours (using a USB wall charger).In use, I found it to be very dependable and very easy to pair in both modes.  Battery life and range are as advertised.  For my purposes, a once-weekly charge is all that is required. The sound is surprisingly loud and very clear, and it can be regulated from the source. Sound quality will depend on the source but I was surprised by the complexity and layering that emerged.I'm really impressed with this excellent, invaluable device.  With it I can listen through headphones to my vinyl records, or play music from my pc (which does not have Bluetooth) while I exercise, without disturbing anyone else around me, or take the sound with me on the terrace.  A very successful solution to integrate your old favourite equipment with newer technology.  The quality is well up to the standards I have come to expect from Avantek.  In my experience, all their  products have been faultless: reliable, easy to use, and well built.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCYUTXJXDAKIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0119DAPVA#wasThisHelpful","RCYUTXJXDAKIY","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent a sample of these briefs for my husband's expert evaluation.  His favourite style is short-boxer or briefs, so this model appealed to him.  Since he dislikes restrictive, overtight garments, his main considerations are cut and comfort, and that depends a lot on the fabric.  Here the combination of 95% smooth cotton and 5% Spandex makes for a breathable garment with enough stretch to fit closely and move with the body without being restrictive.  The wide waistband is elastic and very comfortable.  The closed pouch at the front is well executed and gives light support without compression.  The briefs in person are just like in the photos, they do not extend down the thigh and remind me of a well-cut racing swimsuit.There is a wide selection of colours and I chose the Blue which is a bright, saturated shade very faithful to what I see on my monitor (see my photos).  The white and black contrasting accents look sharp.  With a waist measurement of 32 inches, or 82 cm, we were in between sizes, so I chose to go up one and asked for a Large.  The briefs fit perfectly, which makes me think that they may run a little small.After an appropriate testing period, my husband finds them very comfortable, and well made.  The quality of manufacture is comparable to DIM and similar brands he has tried and, so far, they have come through the wash without losing any of their elasticity or colour.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZL48HFCBYNSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014GVNJJ2#wasThisHelpful","R2ZL48HFCBYNSB","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A silicone mould with 12 really detailed flower shapes, of a size best suited for small muffins, finger food, gelatine desserts and similar little mouthfuls.  It works particularly well for sticky recipes such as cheese muffins that are normally very difficult to extricate without breaking.I received a review sample for evaluation, and at first it seemed strange to put something like this (i.e. not metal or glass) in the oven.  I already had experience of baking with silicone mats, but somehow the mould seemed more risky, more prone to melting.  Anyway I shouldn't have worried, it worked beautifully.  These moulds can handle extremes of temperatures, from -40C to 230C, that's -39.99F to 446F - quite a wide range!  I really like that it allows me to bake without the use of butter to line the mould and without struggling to turn out the little cakes.Also very good for ice cubes, but best suited for long drinks, iced tea and summer punch because the ice cubes it makes are double-sized.  I measured the capacity and it takes 300 ml (10 fl. oz.) of liquid to fill the 12 flowers to the top.The only thing that needs attention is that the silicone is very soft and you need to put a tray underneath when the mould is full of water or whatever mixture you fill it with, on its way to the freezer or the oven.  However, the results are certainly worth that small extra step.  It's also extremely easy to clean and you can boil it to disinfect it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPST0TLD1DLFN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHKE7QQ#wasThisHelpful","RPST0TLD1DLFN","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This beautiful set has gift written all over it. But the lucky recipient could just as well be yourself. It is certainly the sort of thing I would pick for myself, when looking to start painting with acrylics. It's also a great way to refresh you old supplies, as in my case. I used to paint a very long time ago and now that I want to do some more, I find that my old brushes are in poor shape and my old paints are dried up and useless. This comprehensive set was sent to me for review and it could not have come at a better time.The set includes a proper-sized wooden palette, which I think is so much nicer than a disposable plastic dish, not least because it is shaped to be held in your hand. Whether you paint out of doors or inside a room, having your paints close to you is definitely an advantage, especially if you use an easel. There is also a very fine assortment of twelve tubes of acrylic paints (12 ml), gorgeous, saturated colours that are easy to mix and a pleasure to handle. And to give you plenty of artistic choices with the application, twelve acrylic-appropriate brushes are provided of two different types: six each with nylon and bristle heads. The brushes are also of very fine quality, with smooth and very long wooden handles and tight ferrules that keep the brushes from shedding.Acrylics are also the most versatile medium, they can be used to mimic watercolours or oils or something in between. They also lend themselves to the most inventive uses because you can use them to paint over wood, canvas, fabric, ceramic and many other supports, as well as the more traditional paper pads.

"I have never really mastered watercolours, even though I started painting with them early on.  In school we had those tin boxes with small pans of colours and my dabs of tinted water never stayed within the lines.  My efforts were horrible, even I could see that.  Later on I discovered oils and everything changed.  You could go over your mistakes, many times if necessary.  Once I painted a nice bowl of fruit on top of a failed Bay of Naples.  Same with acrylics, thick pigments you could mix and the ability to overlap.  I had nothing more to do with watercolours.When I was offered a box of these watercolour paints to review, my first thought was:  how come they're in tubes?  I discovered that it is because they are quality paints.  What I was using was scholastic grade.  Proper watercolours come in tubes.These watercolour paints are a lot more liquid than either oils or acrylics but they can be mixed!  A whole new horizon has opened up and I am now joyfully experimenting with them.  On the other hand, they are supposed to be the easiest of paints for children to play with, you can even fingerpaint with them (this brand makes non toxic paints, so no worries there), but I still consider them the most challenging of mediums, and I'm really looking forward to conquering this new technique, while having more fun than I thought possible.There are 24 premixed beautiful colours in the box.  So you can tackle almost anything while you get the hang of mixing your own hues.  Perfect for encouraging latent artistic tendencies in novice painters.  The tubes are small (12 ml) but there are so many that they should see you through the initial stages until you figure out which ones you use the most.Like acrylics, these paints are water-based so they dry fast, and cleaning up is easy and painless with just soap and water.  What defines quality with watercolours is, apparently, their ability to resist fading in time.  It's too early for me to comment on that, but the lifetime guarantee, which the maker extends on all purchases, gives me a certain confidence.  If you or your kids are exploring their creative potential, you might consider this purchase as a good way to start.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30L0T32925749/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QCC2AD0#wasThisHelpful","R30L0T32925749","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this cheeky, neon-hued little bikini, wonderful for catching the best tan.  Although the top has the triangle-shaped cups, the foam inserts make it into almost a push-up, certainly an enhancing effect.  The bottom is really small, Brazilian cut (which means that half your bum will be visible) but also low in front.  Not for the shrinking violets, but if you've got some moxie, you'll enjoy showing it off!When this was proposed to me for review, I was hoping that the colours might be more subdued than in the photos (after all I had chosen the Blue option), but in real life the predominant hues are shocking pink, lime green and yellow.  It sounds adventurous, and it is.  It's quite striking, the print is like an explosion of tropical flowers and foliage, and I'm starting to like it more and more.  It looks really great with a golden tan, of course, but you will soon get one if you wear this!The fabric is lovely, a beautifully elastic blend of 80% polyamide and 20% spandex, and fully lined; good quality and well finished.  The style is my favourite because with string ties above and below, it will adjust to fit you perfectly and the two triangles are free to slide along the tie, so you can position them as you wish.  The frilly bits are fun and very feminine, and enhance an already pretty design.Compared to other bikinis by the same brand, this one seems to me to run small, so go for one size larger than normal.  I usually take a US size 8 but I ordered the Small (instead of the Medium) because I wanted a really tiny bikini for private sunbathing.  Even so, it fits smaller than I expected, especially the bottom.  The current price of around $40 is quite reasonable for such an item.  So, if you like the look of this bikini, you should not be disappointed, in fact you might be surprised at the quality.  It's tiny, bright and happy and very comfortable to wear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JJY3FYWS9YOM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LL407RK#wasThisHelpful","R1JJY3FYWS9YOM","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This small but atmospheric solar-powered LED light fixture is quite different from many others I have reviewed.  I received this unit for testing in early autumn, and it was great to see that it charged fully with only 6 hours of sunshine (the instructions say at least 8 hours are needed).  I'm sure the subsequent days topped up the charge but the lamp was operational the very first night and lasted until early morning.Physically it is quite a small unit (about 5 inches across and 2  inches in depth) and very lightweight with 3 LED bulbs.  It is designed to clip onto an average gutter and comes with an appropriately-shaped metal clip, a thumb screw with wingnut, a small screw and, in my package, a long mounting screw as well.  The instructions are made clearer by diagrams and are easy to follow.These are the features that make this lamp different from others I have come across:1. There is an On/Off switch that needs to be set to On for charging and operation2. The special bracket, designed for gutters, gives a useful alternative mounting option to the usual wall attachment3. The light is very blue and more of a glow than ambient illumination4. It is activated by darkness, not motion; the light stays on until daylight or the On/Off switch turns it off5. It runs off a rechargeable AA battery (already in place) which may need replacement after 8-12 months of continuous useThe cone of light is fairly narrow and concentrated, it is intensely blue and looks wonderful at night.  This lamp is sold singly but also in multiples, up to 5 in a pack.  I think it looks prettiest when there are several, for example, around a terrace or along a fence line.  The main consideration, as usual with solar units, is to select a sunny location.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5L5NUKC81CUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JO5G6PU#wasThisHelpful","R5L5NUKC81CUS","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Moroccan Argan Oil seems to be the ingredient of choice for hair products but it comes in as many types as there are brands selling it.  This Moroccan Treatment is a heavy dude with the amazing ability to sink into my hair without making it heavy.  Since I was contacted to evaluate this product for review purposes, both my husband and I have given this hair serum a thorough testing, using it exclusively for the past month.I really like what it does for my hair, I love the immediate shine it gives, and the softness that comes a few minutes later.  Naturally, if I put on a lot, my hair looks greasy and becomes heavy, but I only do that when I use it as a hair mask to be washed away after an hour or so.  Actually that sort of intensive treatment is becoming less necessary.  After a couple of masks to undo the damage of a summer of daily swims and a lot of sun, now I tend to just add three pumps to my mid-length hair, either dry or damp after a shampoo.  It has really made a huge difference to my coloured hair (bleached by the sun), but it seems to work equally well for my husband.  The scent is lovely but not overly feminine, so men can use it, too.  One of the best hair treatments I've tried so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R474KRUT1XLUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZJURGI#wasThisHelpful","R474KRUT1XLUP","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hyaluronic Acid has become the obligatory active ingredient in any anti-ageing formulation deserving of its name, however, the variations are limitless.  In this version, sent to me for evaluation and review, the pure ingredient comes in the form of an almost odourless, fairly liquid, clear gel that is easily absorbed by my skin.  But, more importantly, this serum instantly and visibly tightens my skin (you could call it a face lift effect) and causes the cream or lotion that I apply on top to be swallowed up in a way I have seldom seen.  I know from experience how much moisturizer my face can drink up with, or without, a serum.  This product makes my skin twice as thirsty!  I could not believe it the first time, I thought my face must be particularly dry.  But now I see that it is a feature of this product, as I regularly need to follow up with twice as much as normal of my chosen skin care.  The result is a visibly more nourished face and neck and a noticeable smoothing of the lines and wrinkles around eyes and mouth.The bottle is dark and stylish, elongated to accommodate a sizeable glass dropper.  While this allows precise dispensing, it is difficult to get the last of the gel out of the bottle.  Also the dark, opaque finish makes it impossible to see how much product is left, so I have no idea when I need to buy the next bottle.  Anyway, that is my only minor criticism of an otherwise excellent product.  The bottle contains 30 ml (or a little over 1 ounce) of serum, which is pretty standard for this class of skin care.  At the current (heavily discounted) price of less than $17, this is great value for money.With age, my skin has become fragile and ultra sensitive to harsh ingredients.  This serum has not caused any irritation, redness or other adverse reaction, even applied to the tender skin around the eyes.  In fact, my face feels refreshed and toned after I apply it, and more than ready to absorb the product that follows.  I think it bears repeating that a serum is a carrier, it facilitates absorption of whatever you choose to put on your skin afterwards.  A seriously proactive serum like this one should not be applied by itself.  Depending on your age and the state of your skin, you can choose the potency of the moisturizer that follows.  In my case, I often layer two products and I find that this serum easily allows both to sink in where they have a chance to do some good.  Top quality serum which gives immediately visible results and more durable ones over time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A1N73D4L94QR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014WHIPWG#wasThisHelpful","R1A1N73D4L94QR","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have looked into a lot of lip plumping products because, along with many other undesirable changes the ageing process has brought, thinning lips is one that I can't help noticing every time I catch a glimpse of yours truly in a mirror.  I tried a few products, usually in the shape of a tinted lip gloss, but results have been disappointing and usually very temporary.  Others seem to burn and actually damage the fragile skin of the lips, so I have given them a wide berth.  When I was offered a sample of Lips to review, I accepted with a certain interest and, as usual when I am testing, I discontinued all other similar products to properly assess any effect.The container is very sleek (in Simon & Tom's signature style) with the product in a small tub at the bottom and a nice little brush that slides and locks into the stem which grows out of the lid.  A great way to cut down on contamination.  To ensure that the brush is always easy to extract, I put a tiny dab of vaseline at the point of contact on the stem. The creamy gel looks pale apricot in the jar, but is actually colourless on the lips.  It is wonderfully silky and soothing but not gummy or sticky like some lip balms.  The first day, I noticed the tiniest tingling (which I attributed to the Cinnamon Essential Oil) but after that I have felt only a fresh, soothing sensation.  If you are not into lipstick, it is tempting to use this throughout the day in lieu of a lip gloss, but the directions warn against it.  The packaging is a bit vague but the Amazon product page clearly says to apply it to clean lips only twice a day, morning and evening in my case.After regular use for almost two months (yes, there is still some left!), I have to say that it has improved my lips in a subtle but visible way.  The greatest change happened in the first three weeks, and now we seem to be in maintenance mode.  It didn't change my mouth shape in any way, but it has restored the volume that used to be there in my forties.  For me that's already a big deal.  I've just had a new passport photo taken and it's curious to see that, although my face shows more wrinkles, my mouth actually looks younger than it did in the old photo from five years ago!  I will continue to use Lips and will buy it again once my sample is finished because I like what it does for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R199MWJVAJ6Z04/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010KWYU76#wasThisHelpful","R199MWJVAJ6Z04","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I read that Mike Scott was going to publish his autobiography, I was intrigued.  As well as being one of my favourite musicians, his refusal to play the media game has made him a figure of mystery and unexplained contradictions.  Also, rock star memoirs tend to be a very mixed bunch, but it's not often that we get the straight goods from the pen of the concerned individual and, as in this case, from someone who seems born to write.This book is a fascinating read.  The style is charming:  introspective, intense, lyrical, humorous, self-deprecating but with a kind of proud integrity.  The structure is intriguing:  each chapter begins with a flash-back in the present tense.  Imagine flipping through a photo album, looking at a snapshot (or perhaps a short video-clip) of a particular occasion and then reading about the circumstances surrounding it.  This is not a continuous narrative and each episode is deliberately selected but I felt Mike did not shy away from prickly subjects, such as the logistics of taking a band on the road, the difficult decisions he had to make involving contracts, other band members, managers, booking agents, musical choices.  It's amazing to see how much influence some of these support players have on the success of a musical release.I really enjoyed the glimpse we are given into the passion which drives the music, often to the obliteration of everything else.  It was fascinating to read the story behind some of the songs:  the lengthy evolution of  The Whole of the Moon from a look at the sky for inspiration and a couple of lines on the back of an envelope to a charismatic, unforgettable musical creation;  or the tensions building to boiling-point and erupting in the first draft of Fisherman's Blues; or how personal turmoil produced the most exquisite compositions about love and its dramatic demise.  The Spiddal sessions and the months in Galway read like a true otherworldly adventure then the book becomes a page-turner.  An unexpected bonus:  as I progressed through the book, I listened again to the songs mentioned and found that the knowledge gleaned from the stories added so much to my enjoyment of the music and helped me appreciate its deeper layers.During the promotional drive, Mike Scott gave numerous readings and interviews, and emphasised that this book was all about the musical journey that started with him at a very early age and continues to shape his destiny to this day.  I was, therefore, surprised by the personal nature of the narrative and the honesty with which Mike bares his soul in recounting salient points in his life, even when this candour doesn't flatter his image.  I think he actually relished the chance to shed some light on his personal spiritual journey and to dispel the misconceptions that inevitably arose.  However, there are limits to the disclosure.  Mike Scott is clearly a private person and respectful of the people in his life, so it's not surprising that there is none of the usual gossip about kiss-and-tell groupie romps.  His two wives, naturally, make an appearance but are not discussed in tabloid-style detail.  Tucked in the middle are a few (too few!) black-and-white photos and at the end, a quirky appendix.For me the disappointing aspect is that the book ends around 2000, leaving a substantial portion of his story untold.  While this could point to a possible sequel, Scott himself has been non-committal, saying only that these missing years are still too raw to become book material.  Perhaps he wanted to wait and see if there was something sensational to write about after  moving back to New York in late 2012.  After all, he has said in interviews that the current Waterboys are hungry for recognition, so perhaps with a fire still burning in his belly and his creativity apparently in full flood, his mature self will manage that most elusive of musical miracles, the come-back with new material.  Already his Appointment with Mr Yeats has been remarkably well received by critics and public alike.  The Waterboys in their new incarnation could well be the breath of fresh air that the currently dismal music scene so badly needs.Meanwhile it will be interesting to see what kind of havoc this fun-loving, but formidably-focussed master of his trade can wreak with the wind back in his sails.  Because one thing is clear:  for Scott the music always came first and his perception of what his Muse required to manifest herself has shaped his life and philosophy.  If you enjoy a fascinating real-life story, exquisite prose, original turns of phrase and vivid pictorial descriptions, as well as an insight into the mind of one of the most gifted and unorthodox musicians of our times, this book will not disappoint.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNTV04YDWJ1AA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D81VR7I#wasThisHelpful","RNTV04YDWJ1AA","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Out of the many options on this page, I am reviewing the one called Style1.  It's a pretty babydoll made to enhance any body shape.  This would be a perfect choice for ladies of demure bust dimensions because the lace that forms the bodice and goes round the neck is elastic.  It will fit anyone and make you look sensational.The rest of it is see-through, as you can see from the photos, but not super-short; on me a size XL reaches to mid-thigh (I'm 5'8, and my usual size is US 8).  Actually I needed a size L but, unfortunately, it's not available, so I went higher when I should have gone lower.  After washing it, I can see that this style runs big.  For such a flimsy item, it's very well made and very comfortable to wear.  The matching g-string is very basic, just a simple triangle in the same fabric, and some thin elastic.  An inexpensive way to make yourself feel glamorous and a super gift.

"I love to leave my windows open whenever I can and enjoy the floral scents drifting in from my garden, especially when lavender and honeysuckle are blooming. That isnt possible, however, on really hot summer days when I have to confine myself to the house and turn on the ventilator. I managed a good compromise, during a recent heat wave, by adding some lavender oil to my diffuser. I could revel in the fresh flowery scent and stay cool at the same time.  Not only did I find pleasure in the scent, but the lavender helped to calm my cabin fever.Lavender is sometimes referred to as a ""first aid kit in a bottle"". It has many homeopathic uses, but is perhaps best known for its calming and relaxing effects, for treating restlessness, insomnia, nervousness or anxiety, depression, and even high blood pressure. I started using Lavender Oil to improve my sleep.  I rub a drop on the inside of each wrist when I go to bed and it seems to help with relaxation, and shortens the amount of time I have to wait before falling asleep.  It is also a great option to apply on any small cut, abrasion or burn to soothe the pain and reduce the scar when it forms.  It is one of the few essential oils that can be safely applied to the skin without diluting.This oil comes in a dark glass bottle to protect it from light degradation and preserve its active properties over the long term.  With the integral dropper under the cap, you can dispense it with precision avoiding spillage, waste, and especially contamination. This is a top-quality, therapeutic-grade essential distillate, not a perfumed diluted product, so it is effective in small quantities, just a few drops at a time.I have tried several brands over the years and this one is up there with the very best.  It's the real thing, and costs a lot less than at my local pharmacy.  I received a sample for review purposes, but will buy from Aromata again because of the absolutely top quality and purity of their oils.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B9N6FTTFVVNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TP4L326#wasThisHelpful","R3B9N6FTTFVVNT","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A whiff of this oil as you open the bottle is like smelling a freshly peeled orange. Thats no surprise since it is 100% pure, cold pressed from orange peel. The clean, citrus scent of orange oil might be its most appealing characteristic and hence is used in many cleaning and personal hygiene products. Try adding a couple of drops to your own unscented products.  A drop combined with your face cream will enhance its effect by encouraging collagen production, reducing puffiness and facilitating the release of toxins (good for acne conditions). If you like to relax in a hot bath, add 3-4 drops of orange oil to enhance the experience (no more than 4, however, as it can be irritating to the skin).And, of course, you can use it in a diffuser to spread the aroma throughout a room. One of the main benefits of orange oil is to relieve anxiety and put one in a positive mood, but it is also greatly beneficial, in winter especially, to combat respiratory problems.  In aromatherapy it combines particularly well with spicy oils like cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and rosewood, and intense ones like cypress, juniper, jasmine, and frankincense.The dark glass bottle that this oil comes in protects it from light degradation and preserves its active properties over time.  The integral dropper under the cap allows easy and precise dosing and ensures that the oil remains free of contaminants. It is important to stress that this is a top-quality, therapeutic-grade essential distillate, not a perfumed diluted product, so all you need are a few drops at a time.  I'm glad I had the opportunity to test this excellent product in exchange for an honest review.  Some orange oils are harsh and others too sweet.  I will buy this brand again because of its purity and beautifully balanced aroma.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QD9PXX9WSCTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SEL99SG#wasThisHelpful","R1QD9PXX9WSCTN","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this saucy little slip.  It's see-through, super-short and adjustable with a ribbon that ties around your neck, halter-fashion.  The colour is one of its main attractions for me, I adore this bright bluebell shade.  A tiny little g-string is included, no more than a triangle in the same fabric, held up by thin elastic.  A little basic, but it matches.  The slip has a wide band of gorgeous lace embellished with gold thread which sets out the bust area and the satin ribbon is very silky and glamorous.Size-wise, based on bust measurements, I asked for an XL.  It's a touch big for me but I think it's the design more than anything.  It looks best on a well-endowed figure.  So the size runs true.  For the price it's a steal, and the quality is fine.

"This review refers to the simple pH Tester Kit, a sample of which I gratefully accepted for evaluation purposes.This is an excellent pH testing kit, complete with everything you need not just for now and next month but for the long term, because the tester is already calibrated and only needs refreshing in exceptional circumstances (i.e. after heavy use and/or after a prolonged period of non-use).  To address recalibration, four pouches of buffer powder are provided.The kit is housed in a transparent plastic case containing the tester itself (with batteries already loaded), a screwdriver for physical resetting, four pouches of buffer powder (2 each of 6.86 and 4.01 pH), and a short and basic manual.Operation is simple:1. remove the protective cap2. make sure the electrode is clean by using some distilled water3. dry the tip and switch on4. dip the bottom inch or so of the tester into the liquid you are testing (essentially the part that is covered by the cap); for something like swimming pool water, the easiest way is to put some of the water in a glass5. wait a bit until the reading on the small screen stabilizes6. turn off, wash the electrode again with distilled water and dry before storing with the cap onThe tester must not be immersed in water beyond the mark, so the glass method seems to work best.I had always suspected our tap water of being hard, so was surprised to see readings of 7.10 to 7.46.  The swimming pool water was similarly close to perfect.  But I knew that already as the water clarity gave a good indication.Compared to our previous method involving drops of coloured liquid, test tubes and comparing shades to faded colour charts, I think the digital display and readings of numbers with two digital points is a vast improvement.  For our purposes, this tester kit delivers all the information we require in a really user friendly way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RFU3MEWFSBB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X95DO24#wasThisHelpful","R1RFU3MEWFSBB6","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:46 MinsFantastic sound reproduction, deep bass, crystal clear treble, soft and round vibe and satisfactorily loud.  Very impressive for this style of headset.

Around the central button is a discreet LED light narrow band which lights up blue and red to signal various conditions.The fit is a little less than secure on me because I have a fairly small head and the rear wire is a bit stiff.  I have to make sure to brush my hair completely out of the way and actually tuck the upper wires over the tops of my ears otherwise the padded cups slip away.  It's not that they are too small or tight (the rear wire's position can be moved at the back of your head), it's just that the shape tends to glance off a little.

You can be listening to music and when you receive a call, the headphones put the music on hold, bring in the call and let you answer it (and end it) by pressing the multi-function button.  The redial function may be a bit hit and miss, though.  Battery life is fantastic.

"A beautiful short robe featuring a traditional oriental design of peacocks and flowers.  Although the fabric is polyester, it has the smoothness and cool appeal of silk, and it's an absolute pleasure to wear.  The photos give a very good representation of the many different colour combinations, all very tastefully realized in saturated and jewel-like tones.  A sample robe was offered for my evaluation, and among all the gorgeous shades, I chose the Lake Blue.  In person, it is very like the photos, perhaps a touch more turquoise.The standard of manufacture and finishing is excellent, neat seams and no loose threads or visible imperfections (see my detail photo).  With an unstructured garment like this one, a good fit should be easy to accomplish.  The major differences between sizes are in the overlap and the length of robe and sleeves.  Still, I have found the size chart to be very accurate.  I asked for a Medium which fits me perfectly (I normally wear a UK size 10, US 8, French 38).The big advantage of this delightful little robe over real silk is the easy care.  It can be machine washed using the cold-water, gentle cycle, low tumble-dry care I normally give all lingerie.  At this low price, it's a little indulgence that any woman would be very pleased to receive, or buy for herself  most likely in different colours!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHLX88O79BM71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JHRDSC#wasThisHelpful","RHLX88O79BM71","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thanks to the latest fabric printing processes, this adorable sweater makes me feel like I'm wearing an oil painting.  ZLYC have a large variety of these crisply graphic sweaters, some featuring photographic art, but to me the really irresistible ones have these designs that look like a beautiful oil painting on a canvas.  There is another one I adore, called Art Oil Painting, which is an interpretation of a favourite VanGogh painting.  This one features swans in flight (I love swans) and roses (I adore roses).  When I saw these together, I knew this sweater was made for me!  A moody midnight blue and purply background anchors the birds and flowers and gives the whole design the appeal of a warm summer's night.Speaking of warmth, this top is very versatile and comfortable bridging that mid-season gap when a T-shirt is not enough, but a wooly sweater is too much, but don't expect it to keep you warm and cosy (unless you wear it over some thermal underwear).  The synthetic blend of 88% Polyester and 22% Elasthane is super smooth and feels like thick woven silk, if you can imagine such a thing.Size-wise, since I was sent a sample to evaluate, I have given feedback to the vendor that I believe their size guidance could be improved.  As it is, they state that a Small size fits a US size 8, UK size 12.  I would disagree.  My usual size for tops is Small, or US 6-8 and UK 10 and this sweater in size Small is only just big enough for me in the body, and the sleeves are a bit short.  If I were any bigger, it definitely would not fit.  So, until they change their size equivalency, just go up at least one size when ordering and you should be okay.  Check out my photos, keeping in mind that I have a rather short upper body in relation to my height of 5'8.  The soft sheen of the fabric, together with the gorgeous, saturated colours and beautiful design, make this top rather unique and a sure attention-getter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1115QGPHFMAAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPQQEWI#wasThisHelpful","R1115QGPHFMAAZ","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, as there are three different styles on this page, let me say that I am reviewing the plain dress with half sleeves and scoop neckline.  I was over the moon with the other maxi dress (Meaneor Women's Long Full Length Racerback Tank Dress SLEEVELESS SCOOP NECK MAXI DRESS Dark Gray M) that Meaneor sent me for review, and was hoping for a similar item, but I'm very sorry to say that this dress is just not in the same league.  The cut is fine as far as the half sleeves and the scoop neck, but the empire waist is a compromise that does not work for me.  It's too low to be below the breast-line and too high to be anywhere near my natural waist.  Also, because there is a lot of material dragging on that elasticated point, it does not hang in a flattering way.Secondly, I can see that it's meant to be dressed up or down according to your mood, but for a solid colour it's just a bit too plain and with that awkward waistline, it's impossible to wear it with a belt (which is my usual strategy to give personality to a plain outfit).The deal-breaker for me is the fabric.  I got the dress in black and the fabric is flimsy and has a strange sheen which I find unattractive.  Perhaps in a brighter colour the material looks different, but in black it's just not quality enough.  It is stretchy and lightweight so it should be comfortable to lounge around in, but being polyester, it doesn't breathe like a natural fabric.  I have other black clothes by the same brand, but they are nothing like this.On the plus side, it's long enough to be called a maxi even on someone reasonably tall.  I'm 5'8 and normally wear a US size 8.  I got this in Medium and I find that the top fits as I would expect and the hem reaches my feet, which is not always the case with long dresses.  Meaneor have come up with lots of interesting styles and fabrics.  This isn't their best.  Sorry to be so critical, but my reviews must necessarily reflect my honest opinions, otherwise they are of no value to anyone.The dress has been well received by other reviewers so, perhaps in a different colour and on a different figure, it works.  I just hope to have given enough information for you to be able to make up your own mind.A free sample was provided for review purposes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YZMMQOZUVCZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YZSXQSG#wasThisHelpful","R2YZMMQOZUVCZ5","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This quirky top instantly appealed to my flower-power soul. I was offered a sample for an independent evaluation and review, and it was difficult to choose a colour. I really liked the Cream one, but in some photos it had a pink cast so, to be on the safe side, I asked for the Coffee which turned out to be a lovely soft shade of caramel brown. I'm hoping that it will look equally good on pale, wintry skin as it does on a tan.Straight out of the storage bag, the top had a lot of loose threads so I had to snip those off before trying it on. It is a rather delicate garment and weighs next to nothing. The main fabric of bodice and sleeves is made of very loosely woven lace anchored by a very open crocheted square over the decollete while the crochet work at the back features two large openings. As a multiple cat owner, I view this as a highly snaggable top. But then again, it's got so many holes already, one more would not really be noticeable!Because it's so obviously sheer, I like to wear this as an embellishment over a plain tank top or bandeau bra rather than mess around with invisible bras. That way it is very versatile because you will get a different look depending on what you wear underneath. Pairing it with white or cream is always classy but it can look quite interesting over a dark colour, like black, green or midnight blue. Since the top is available in many other colours, there are lots of possible combinations. I could also see this over a form-fitting plain bodysuit, or over leggings, jeans and many types of trousers.The other obvious way to wear this is as a swimsuit cover-up, although it's not really long enough on its own, and might need a pair of shorts. I haven't washed it yet, but I can see this as being a careful hand-wash exercise followed by drip-drying. Now the thorny issue of what size to order: my usual size is a UK 10, US 8, and French 38. So far a Meaneor Medium has been perfect for tops and dresses, although with trousers it's more like an XL. It sounds bizarre, but that's been my experience. I have this top in a size Large and I think it's the perfect size for me. So if you fancy this lovely lacy top, you can trust the size chart. I think it's beautiful and so nice to wear.

"These loose and flowing trousers were sent to me for an independent evaluation and review, and I was quite shocked to see that they are almost too long for me. I normally have trouble finding trousers that are long enough for my legs, although I am not exceptionally tall (5'8 or 1.73 m).  I have to say that they probably sent me the wrong size (3XL, when so far I have found that with this brand a Medium fits me well).  I normally wear a US size 8.  According to the size chart an XL or XXL would have been more in line with my hip measurements, although my waist is on the small side.  Anyway, the fabric is elastic and very comfortable to wear.  It's a lightweight jersey type cotton blend, super soft and flowing, and quite thin.  They are cut immensely large, with an extreme bell bottom shape so, if you dislike restrictive garments, you will love these.I am very happy with the way they feel, they are extremely comfortable, breathable and are perfect for the shoulder season, not too hot, not too cool.  I find them perfect for lounging around and very comfortable for working out and yoga, but the extremely wide legs may get in the way of more active sports.  I got them in black and I find that they also work for casual outings, shopping trips, etc. depending on your personal style.  I like the very high waist, which makes them easy to pair with a lot of different tops.Despite the low price, finishing and stitching are good (see my detail photo).  I found a few loose threads but they were easy to snip off.  The care tag is pretty standard:  Wash below 40C, hang to dry, low iron, no bleach.

"Well, for a change I can say that these casual pants are actually long enough for me.  At 5'8 I'm not exceptionally tall but often have trouble finding trousers that are long enough for my legs.  I was very surprised when I tried these on and found that they are actually just about right.  The size may have something to do with it (I was sent an XXL, when so far I have found that with this brand a Medium fits me well) but, considering that the waist is very comfortable, it has worked out fine.  The fabric is a lightweight jersey type cotton blend but super soft and flowing, and the cut has a lot of drape.

According to the size chart's hips measurement, this size XXL was the best fit, although my waist is a lot smaller, but I am very happy with the way they feel, they are extremely comfortable, breathable and are perfect for the shoulder season.Despite the low price, finishing and stitching are good (you can check it out in my detail photo).  There was the odd loose thread but you can snip it off in a second.  The care tag is pretty standard:  Wash below 40C, hang to dry, low iron, no bleach.

"Argan oil has been a beauty staple for eons, and it's currently enjoying a well-deserved revival as a wonder treatment for both hair and skin.  It seems to be everywhere but I have found that products containing or based on Argan Oil can be extremely different in both quality and effectiveness.  This particular one is pure, 100% cold-pressed Argan Oil (as with other oils, cold pressing produces the best quality) and just about the lightest version I have tried so far.  I bought it at a significant discount for independent testing and review and, as is my habit, I discontinued all other similar products and for the last four weeks I have focused on this one uniquely.Argan Oil can be used on the body and even on the face, but it is a classic hair nourishing treatment.  My hair can use all the help it can get.  Age has certainly affected the shine and elasticity, but not the volume, so when too much sun or chlorine dry the life out of it, I'm left with a mass of very brittle, frizzy hair that looks fried and unruly.Although I use excellent shampoos and conditioners, I found that adding a few drops of this Argan Oil after my shower to damp (or even dry) hair makes a huge difference.  Also, since I avoid daily shampoos, my hair seems to be able to absorb repeated applications without getting heavy or greasy. I do like the subtle shine I see and the immediate smoothing action.Once a week I use it as a a hair mask treatment (meaning that I apply a scant teaspoonful to my shoulder-length hair until it feels fairly oily and heavy).  I then wrap my head in a hot towel and leave the oil on for a few hours before shampooing and conditioning as usual.  The results are very good and, after a few treatments, my hair is already softer and, dare I say it, more flowing.I also like to use this oil on my legs as a softener for dry skin; it penetrates quickly and leaves behind a pretty sheen.  And it's wonderful as a carrier oil; you can add a few drops of your favourite essential oils and the resulting mix will allow a little time for massaging before being absorbed.I have also tried it on my face but my skin is mixed and it works best for me as a night-time moisturizer.  A very small amount gives my face a welcome softness without clogging my pores.  Another good application is as a localized treatment for hands and nails, massaged into the cuticles at night-time.Beauty by Earth products have all the things I look for in skin care:  they are free of parabens, GMO, gluten, soy,  artificial additives and colouring agents.  They are not tested on animals (a biggie for me) and, on a superficial level, I love the gorgeous, organic packaging.  It's biodegradable but I have kept the boxes because I love the parchment look and the elegant line drawings.  If you use Argan Oil and are ready to buy the next bottle, you might want to try this lovely oil.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK1TI4NGORUL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I134Y82#wasThisHelpful","RK1TI4NGORUL5","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After many years of reckless suntanning and more burns than he can remember, last year my husband went to see a dermatologist about some skin pigmentation and raised bits that looked concerning.  The doctor treated a number of the anomalies with liquid nitrogen, gave him a couple of prescriptions for ongoing care and advised more caution when sunbathing.So, for the first time ever, we went looking for physical sunscreens and more serious protection than our usual tropical suntanning oils.  We bought a couple of sunblocks and, when I was offered a substantial discount on this product with an invitation to evaluate and review it, I felt qualified enough to accept.So, after a suitable testing period, my personal view is that this sunscreen is a very capable product that addresses the needs of fair and delicate skin seeking protection from the harmful effects of the sun's UV rays.  Ideal for children and those who burn easily, and essential for people who work outdoors in situations where prolonged sun exposure is unavoidable.  As for me, while I understand the dangers and embrace the idea in principle, I am not overly keen on the white cast (titanium dioxide is the pigment that makes house paint and oil colours blindingly white).  This is a common problem with sun blocks but, at least with this cream, you can tone it down to a minimum if you use a small amount and spend time rubbing it in.The texture is thicker than I expected and a bit glue-like and the scent, well, not something I would choose.  However, on the plus side, it has remarkable stickability and we found that it persisted after long swims in the pool and an hour in the sun.  My husband, who typically turns red before tanning deeply, managed to avoid the lobster stage, and I loved the skin softening action of the inactive ingredients:  aloe vera juice, safflower seed oil, castor oil, coconut oil, shea butter, argan oil, jojoba seed oil, Vitamin E, green tea extract and cucumber) extract.  So top marks for the natural ingredients, excellent sun-blocking performance and water resistance, but I still dislike the slightly ghostly tinge.Beauty by Earth is a new entry in the fast-growing sector of natural skin care and their products tick all the boxes for me:  free of parabens, GMO, gluten, soy,  artificial additives and colouring agents.  Also of great importance to me, it's not tested on animals and, specifically with regard to this sunscreen, I am pleased to see that it is not only safe for children, but also for marine life and the environment in general.  If you are looking for a superior sun block cream with no harmful ingredients, you might want to give this a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SOR040CDJ45W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFNDWSY#wasThisHelpful","R1SOR040CDJ45W","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very striking long, flowing dress made of very sheer, unlined chiffon.  The fabric features a strong, vibrantly-coloured print of oversized tropical flowers and foliage in three colourways.  I chose the Blue for my evaluation, but there are other colour combinations.  The fabric is very see-through (look at the sleeve in the photos) and unlined.  I actually think this is an advantage:  I once had a chiffon party dress with a similarly bold, flowery print, only knee-length.  The dress was fully lined with a shorter slip in black taffeta, leaving the sleeves and part of the hem to show skin.  It was beautiful and I wore it a few times on holidays for dinner and dancing.  Unfortunately, the taffeta lining was so flimsy, it was soon in shreds and, because it was sawn together with the chiffon fabric, I had to throw the whole dress away.  This dress gives me the option to wear it as is over a bikini for a beach party, or over a slip or bodysuit for a more formal occasion.  The design is very pretty and feminine:  very full, flowing skirt, puffy sleeves anchored by a narrow cuff with two buttons, elasticated waist and a super-long, sash-type belt, designed to wrap twice around the waist.  That's the good part.This dramatic dress has a few design problems which, depending on your physique, may require modification.  I must stress that I received the wrong size, by mistake, so my observations might have been different had I been sent the size Medium I asked for.  Instead I have a size XL, so I can only comment on that basis.  The length should have been good for me (I'm 5.8 or 1.73 m), however, the hem has been cut unevenly and is longer on the left and back side and shorter on the right and front side.  While an oblique hem adds interest to a shorter dress, it does nothing for this length.  The only way this 8 difference would make sense is if the dress were shorter in front (showing more shoe) and longer at the back.The waistline is also just about right for me, however, the belt has been attached way too high, barely under the armpit and it is so heavy that it pulls down uncomfortably on the left sleeve.  The sleeves are a bit too long for me and the cuff is too wide (as I would expect with a dress two sizes too big), however, the armhole is not as wide as you would expect so I wonder how it would fit someone proportionally bigger than me.  The bodice is massively too large for me, although it is designed to be a snug fit.  Since it is left open with only a small overlap at waist level, it requires a button or two or a much bigger overlap to avoid gapping open.  Fine over a swimsuit but does not work if you are wearing a bra (for the photos I have used a brooch to close it).  Since it is so dramatically large, I wonder how much smaller it would be in my correct size, or whether the many complaints are justified that only a very big-chested figure would fill this top. I can try and make the few adjustments necessary to make this dress wearable, however, the point is that the cut and design could be so much better.I was offered this dress for evaluation with a request for an honest, unbiased review, which is what I have done.  However, the manufacturer has also indicated an openness to criticism, so I have passed along my suggestions to them, in hopes that they will revisit the design and apply some basic modifications which would make this potentially lovely dress as good as it looks in the pictures.  At this price, one does not expect a perfect custom fit, however, the basic proportions of the average female shape should be observed.  I am confident that this dress will soon be available in a much improved form.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KLSUGAPRIR75/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011KFJLBC#wasThisHelpful","R3KLSUGAPRIR75","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What an absolutely brilliant idea!  Washing bras and intimate apparel is never a glamorous business, but putting them out to dry can be so much more fun when you slip your pretty little nothings on this well-designed and well-made drying hanger.  Suddenly, your lacy bras and knickers look like textile art!  I must admit that nowadays I buy lingerie more for the look and aesthetic value than for the practical side.  My years of wearing sensible cotton underwear in neutral colours are over.  The older I get, the more I want to have beautiful things around me, and hiding away my favourite undies seems like a pity.  With these beautiful hangers I can display my best bra and panty sets inside a closet, and enjoy looking at them even when not in use.And now for the main purpose of drying after washing:  hanging delicate underwear in the usual way, with pegs on a line of drying rack, often results in snags and pulled threads.  These clever hangers are engineered to give both rigid and unstructured bras the perfect shape, keeping them securely in place with smooth clips that will never harm fragile lace.  In addition, there are little hooks to suspend any matching or unrelated knickers and thongs.  The higher clips also work well to secure the straps of slips and other delicate tops, both in the drying and display phases.  To make a very good design even better, the hook part of the hanger has an opposing tongue which makes it difficult for the hanger to accidentally blow off the line in a wind.I have tested these hangers with lingerie, tank tops with spaghetti straps that slip off ordinary hangers and even bikinis, of course, because swimwear needs drying much more often than bras.  Securing the clothes on these hangers is really easy and I can then hook them on the clothesline or drying rack, or even inside my shower if it's raining outside.  I love them!A one-size-fits-all design is never going to satisfy absolutely everyone, but these drying racks manage to span many sizes from A to D cups, and I think they might be useful for even larger bras.  As for price, for less than $12, you get two hangers, one pink, one red.  I got a sample set to test and review, but I will certainly buy more because choosing which bra gets the display spot is just too difficult.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5Y2UXEWUHPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013QLNVDC#wasThisHelpful","R5Y2UXEWUHPE","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a love-hate relationship with earbuds.  I love the lightness and ease of simply slipping them on, as opposed to fitting bulky headphones over my head and (in the case of sports models), tucking the wire behind my ears.  I hate the fact that my ears seem to be difficult to fit, with most earbuds jumping out as soon as my head moves.  Unfortunately, these very capable-sounding earbuds are just not made for me.  I spent a very long time experimenting with different positions, angles and settings, changing the tips and studying the photo.  If there is a trick to getting them to stay put, it doesn't work for me.  I simply can't get them to stay in my ears!It's a shame because the specs are terrific and when I accept a product for review, as I did with this headset, I like to put it through its paces and give it a proper road testing.  But, faced with the inability to keep the headset on my head, I feel unable to comment meaningfully on the operational aspects and certainly on the sound quality.So all I can do is describe the product briefly.  It comes very nicely packaged in a small hard shell case with a zip closure.  Inside is the headset, a succinct manual in English, 3 extra sets of tips (giving you 4 choices in all), and a non-standard micro USB charging cable.  I did notice, as others have, that the micro connector is longer than usual.  This is not an issue as long as you don't lose the original cable, but it could be annoying if you do misplace it, as all your standard micro USB cables will not reach deeply enough to make a good connection for charging the twin batteries.  And this is the big extra that makes this headset stand out from the crowd.  It has two batteries, giving an amazing total autonomy of 12 hours.As with similar headsets, there is a tiny integrated microphone for hands-free telephone conversations.  Unlike other earbuds, the commands are on a sleeve, located a few inches below the right earbud and joining the main wire to the right portion.  I'm not an expert but this seems to me to be asking for trouble, introducing a potential break point along the wire.  Also the positioning of the buttons on a movable portion of the cable (basically dangling close to your face) seems to me less than ideal.  I'm used to commands set on the right earbud, where a little resistance makes operating these tiny buttons a bit easier.  However, since I was unable to properly test this headset, this is simply an idle observation not backed up by experience.I see that this headset has been well enough received, so my conclusion is that, if you can wear it comfortably and stably, then you can take advantage of its many state-of-the-art features. As for me, we didn't really get along.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYV90PCBMRBQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U8SZFQ8#wasThisHelpful","RYV90PCBMRBQ7","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since I've stopped heavy-duty gardening my use of earbuds has dwindled, but I still use them to cut the dullness of my exercise sessions, and any time I'm walking somewhere.  I love the lightness and ease of simply slipping them on, as opposed to fitting bulky headphones over my head.  Unfortunately my ears are difficult to fit, and most earbuds I've tried refuse to stay put, especially if I jump around.  This Sonixx X-Fit headset seems to be the exception.  I've put it on this afternoon as soon as the strimmer came out of our shed, and I must say it's doing a very good job of minimizing the snarling outside!As far as sound quality, I thought it was a tad sharp at first, but I'm getting used to it.  I love the clarity and the volume is so loud I've had to turn it down a lot.  I'm hearing layers and detail, but for me the bass is disappointing.  I guess I prefer a rounder sound.The Bluetooth performance is staggering.  I have tested dozens of Bluetooth devices and I'm familiar with the usual cut-off limits.  Our house is made of stone and these thick walls could stop a bulldozer.  Normally the Bluetooth signal can cross one wall and a half, then it cuts out.  With these I was in the kitchen, two full rooms away, before I lost the audio.  Also, I turned them on today meaning to connect to my tablet, but before I knew it, they had paired with my laptop in another room and across a thick wall!The packaging deserves a mention.  This headset comes complete with a very attractive hard protective case, tiny but big enough to house the headset, the charging USB wire, and a range of additional fitting accessories (3 sets of ear tips, 3 sets of stabilizer wings, and 2 ear clips).  The manual is basic but understandable.  When I was offered these sports earbuds to evaluate, I did not expect a lot, given the price.  Having done a bit of testing, I really like them.I don't have a compatible phone to test the answering capabilities, but I do appreciate the voice indications of Power Off, Connected etc.  I really like the supple wire connecting the two ear pieces, which makes them essentially independent, but is also short enough not to get tangled up in things or in my hair when I leave it untied.  With some models, the wire is stiff and too long for my head, and it makes the ear pieces pop out, which I find highly irritating.  I also like the sweat and water resistant design (the USB input is sealed by a rubber cap).So, my conclusion is that I am very happy with this headset.  It works well, pairs easily with all the devices I have tried, it fits my ears and stays comfortable for long periods of wearing it, the sound is above average, the price (currently under US $25) is pretty low, the tiny case is easy to carry around, and the battery life (about 8 hours) is extremely good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EJYPCYLMH4N3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C70J2RS#wasThisHelpful","R1EJYPCYLMH4N3","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Many years ago, I used to amuse myself copying and re-interpreting paintings I admired.  Then life got so busy that my oil paints got packed away.  Just recently I dug up my remaining supplies and found them sadly lacking.  By some happy coincidence, Daveliou, a specialist manufacturer of art supplies, asked me to try out and review some of his new products.  I am delighted to say that the art supplies I received are of the best quality and perfectly suitable for both beginners and established painters.This set of 24 assorted paintbrushes, housed in a lovely purpose-made canvas holder, would make a fantastic gift for a budding painter, or for someone like me, who is taking up painting again after a long break.  The assortment includes all the basic brush shapes (flat, round, angle, filbert and fan) in the most popular sizes from 2 to 12, in four materials: pony, camel, nylon and bristle.  There is everything you need whatever your medium (oils, acrylics or watercolours).The canvas carrier has 24 pockets sewn to precisely accommodate the brushes supplied.  A fold-down flap protects the tips and can be secured with Velcro tabs, after which you roll the whole thing up and tie it with the attached double string.  What an excellent idea!  My previous arrangement of dropping the brushes bristle side up in an old coffee can was okay for the drying period and for short-term storage but useless for carrying my supplies any distance.  Invariably, something would fall and go missing.  Boxes and plastic bags were messy and destructive, so this tidy and organized solution is one that makes a lot of sense.Daveliou sell a similar paintbrush carrier minus the paintbrushes.  It is very similar in materials and construction, except that the 24 slots are of different sizes, which is very convenient if you like to use very large paintbrushes and palette knives with their bigger handles, as the 8 central pockets are quite a lot bigger than those in this holder.Apart from the clever design, this paintbrush carrier is quite beautiful, made of sturdy but supple cream-coloured canvas, nicely finished with matching canvas binding and stamped with the distinctive Daveliou lion logo.  As a bonus, the fabric is washable.  In use, the brushes feel great, the wooden handles are smooth and well finished but don't appear to have been varnished.  Some of my older brushes have a thick glossy finish which invariably flakes off.  The ferrules hold the bristles tightly so that there is no shedding and I can paint with confidence.  This set sells for an amazingly low price and it's unbeatable value for what you get","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q3MP56QEJDEC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQUOX46#wasThisHelpful","R1Q3MP56QEJDEC","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After many years of artistic inactivity (at least of the painterly kind), I have recently dusted off my oil paints, turps and palette, and unearthed an unused canvas to abuse.  Coincidentally Daveliou, a specialist manufacturer of art supplies, proposed some of his new products for my evaluation and review.  Talk of a happy coincidence!  It only took one look at the Amazon product page to see that these are products of the highest quality.This particular paintbrush holder has been meticulously crafted in heavy-duty canvas fabric in a clever design, so that your favourite 24 brushes (and palette knives) can be tidily and comfortably slotted into individual pockets.  You then secure the fold-down flap with Velcro tabs, roll the whole thing up and tie it with the attached double string.  Genius!  Previously, storing and carrying so many brushes meant chaos, with a high possibilities of losing or damaging some of the brushes.  With great attention to detail, 16 of the slots are narrow, 4 are medium-sized and the middle 4 are quite large, so that handles of various thicknesses can be accommodated.  The empty holder can be washed easily to keep it looking fresh.A similar paintbrush carrier is available from the same supplier, complete with 24 assorted paintbrushes, but there are some small differences, the main one being that the slots of the one with the brushes included are more uniform in size and the 8 central pockets are not extra large, so if you already have tools with very thick handles, this empty holder is your best choice.Apart from the functional aspect, this paintbrush carrier is quite beautiful, made of creamy-coloured canvas, nicely finished with matching canvas binding and embellished by the gorgeous Daveliou logo, embroidered in shiny thread.  What I'm describing is the perfect gift for the budding artist or serious painter in your life.  Now that I have started using it, I can't imagine going back to carting my painting implements perched in jam jars, wrapped in plastic or thrown around in boxes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN7HRQDWH6UHV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QAK8JUW#wasThisHelpful","RN7HRQDWH6UHV","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This serum is something special.  I adore skin care based on rose extracts, and this serum is the most concentrated product of this type to come my way.  Proposed to me for evaluation and review, it has blown me away with its intense aroma and visible firming action.  Two pumps is all I need for my whole face and neck.  The serum is very liquid and penetrates really quickly, so much so that I can often go over the same area (like around the eyes) adding more.  It has a pulling and firming action which seems to instantly diminish the appearance of deep lines and wrinkles.  My face is then more than ready to accept the nourishing and hydrating cream I happen to favour at the moment.  Whatever I apply, it will sink into my skin much more easily than without the preparatory step of the serum.Something else which is typical of rose extract is the purifying action on skin impurities.  My mixed skin appears to be coping well with the drying effect of sun and wind, and I notice very little shine in my T zone.  I also find this preparation very soothing right after derma rolling, when my skin is somewhat tender.The brand may be new but everything I read about them reassured me:  solid science, powerful natural and, mostly organic ingredients, avoidance of toxic additives, full money-back guarantee and, very important to me, no animal testing.  The formulation of Rose Renew includes 10% Hyaluronic Acid Serum (anti-ageing ingredient par excellence), Rosewater, Rose Absolute (rose petal essential oil obtained through solvent extraction), Rosehip Seed Oil, MSM, Kojic Acid and Glycol Acid (these last three help with skin discolouration and loss of elasticity, and minimize the appearance of lines and wrinkles).After three weeks of regular use, morning and night, I'm really pleased with the condition of my skin.  I have been using top quality skin care for over two years, so my gauge of effectiveness is to see my skin looking as good as before, which is certainly the case with this serum.  The other, even more important test, is that my face looks fresher and more hydrated AFTER the serum as compared to how it looks when I get up.  The toning and perking-up effect is very noticeable.The clean and sleek plastic bottle holds 33 ml (slightly above the usual for a face serum) and the pump works very well to accurately dispense the liquid.  The current price (less than $23) is extremely reasonable for such quality and a fraction of comparable products from well-known brands.  Based on my usage, I expect the bottle to last three months, which makes this great value for money.  Definitely one I will be buying again once my bottle is finished.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN2359M5ZM7MW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJ4U5CE#wasThisHelpful","RN2359M5ZM7MW","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't normally use lip balms, preferring clear lip glosses. But these delicious beeswax sticks, which I bought at a discount, have just changed my mind.  The all-natural, almost edible, ingredients are exactly what I look for in skin care and make-up.  They are all reassuringly recognisable:  Beeswax, Coconut, Castor and Sunflower Seed Oils, Aloe Vera, Vitamin E,  Lanolin, Shea Butter, Cocoa Seed Butter, and Natural Aromas.  I also appreciate the cruelty-free stance.The box of twelve tubes includes an amazing assortment of all-natural flavours, including: Green Tea, Asian Pear, Pomegranate, Acai Berry, Honey, Vanilla Bean and Peppermint.  I have started to use these lip balms as primers, to place a protective barrier between my lips and whatever dubious ingredient may lurk in cosmetic lip glosses.  I don't know if it's enough, but it makes me feel like I'm at least trying.  Or, when a high gloss is not required, I simply add a touch of lip liner pencil to the lip balm on my lips to provide all the pigment I need.  My husband, a big lip balm user, tells me that this formulation is the smoothest and most melting of all the brands he has tried (quite a few over the years).  He has switched to these new flavours without any prompting from me.Packaging is gorgeous, as usual with Beauty by Earth, and they have thoughtfully labelled this beautiful assortment a Gift Pack.

"This is one of those simple items where quality and good design are not so obvious  until you compare it to something less well-made.Quality features:-  the rounded edges: very safe for pools with liners-  quality plastic material: any time a pool-side item lasts more than one season, it's a good sign-  sturdy netting:  ditto  I have seen netting that frays or develops holes or comes away from the frame in a matter of weeks-  V clip which secures net head to any standard telescopic pole:  a potential weak link, some are so slack that they allow the net head to rotate with frustrating results.  The clip in this model springs back well when attached and holds the net in place.Although this is a surface skimmer, it can just as easily be used to remove the occasional bug or leaf from the bottom and if your pool has a liner, you will appreciate the smooth contour.  The netting weave is tight enough that it will hold all types of debris and insects.  With no special care, you can expect to get several seasons' use out of this humble product.  Ours lasted three seasons (years) and only gave up a week ago (the netting came away from the frame all around, so basically material fatigue).  Interestingly, our deep net skimmer (bought at about the same time) is still in perfect shape.  I attribute the difference to the fact that we keep this flat skimmer out by the pool during the summer, whereas the deep net one is kept indoors, away from the sun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SKW355FC2OYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KPLHLRO#wasThisHelpful","R1SKW355FC2OYN","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The all-natural, almost edible, ingredients are exactly what I look for in skin care and make-up.  They are all reassuringly recognisable:  Beeswax, Coconut, Castor and Sunflower Seed Oils, Aloe Vera, Vitamin E, Rosemary extract, Stevia extract (best known as a sweetener, extracted from the leaves of a plant in the daisy family), Lanolin, and natural Brown Sugar and Vanilla flavours.  I also appreciate the cruelty-free stance.I have started to use these lip balms as primers, to place a protective barrier between my lips and whatever dubious ingredient may lurk in cosmetic lip glosses.  I don't know if it's enough, but it makes me feel like I'm at least trying.  Or, when a high gloss is not required, I simply add a touch of lip liner pencil to the lip balm on my lips to provide all the pigment I need.  My husband, a big lip balm user, tells me that this formulation is the smoothest and most melting of all the brands he has tried (quite a few over the years).  He has switched to these new flavours without any prompting from me.Packaging is gorgeous, as usual with Beauty by Earth, and the line drawings on the parchment-like cardboard remind me of illustrations in medieval herbal books.  As lip balms go, these are superb and certainly the best tasting I've tried.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KVHKQ1749GZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMRPG5O#wasThisHelpful","R3KVHKQ1749GZC","A234YLAS2MYYWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A234YLAS2MYYWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"'The Memory Painter' is one of those books that is nearly impossible to review - at least it is for me. There are so many aspects to this novel that come together to create a beautifully crafted and unforgettable story. The plot is what drew me to the book initially - it spoke of past lives, two people who love one another and always seem to find themselves together in their several past lives, and a fascinating mystery that promised to journey across time, space, and the entire world. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I did have pretty high hopes for the book before I began. Looking back, I had no idea what I was getting into. The novel far surpassed any kind of expectations or hopes I may have had for it - and then some. It blew my mind in the best kind of way - and I'm still thinking about it long after I finished. This isn't merely a novel that is read - it's an entire experience that will leave a lasting impression on the reader.As I mentioned, there are so many concepts and various aspects that make up the book - each one entirely intriguing and deserving of being spoken of, but there simply isn't enough room to do so - and I certainly don't have the ability to do it any sort of justice by writing about it. I can only touch on a few of the topics and hopefully I'll be able to explain some of the reasons this novel had such an impact on me as a reader. There are two main characters - Bryan Pierce, a reclusive artist who has 'episodes' where he slips into the past and becomes a person from a different time and place. When he wakes, he has the recollection of that person's entire life - along with all of their knowledge and skills, which usually include being fluent in a foreign language and having the abilities of the person he became - which included creating clocks and being able to recite entire pieces of literature in their native tongue. Our second main character is Lindsay ""Linz"" Jacobs - a geneticist who is working on a huge project dealing with memories. Linz has been plagued with the same nightmare since she was a little girl - one about a woman in ancient Rome being burned at the stake. When Linz attends an art exhibit at her friends' gallery and sees her nightmare brought to life on canvas, she knows she has to talk to the artist who painted it. When Bryan and Linz meet, there's an instant connection between them - and Bryan is able to recognize Linz from every lifetime that he's remembered. Thus the mystery begins in earnest - with the two trying to figure out what they're experiencing, why they are always together in these memories, and to figure out exactly what happened to a group of scientists from the 1980s that created a drug that made all of this possible to begin with.Although the book is told from the third person point of view - which is my least favorite writing style - the main characters were well written and had very distinct personalities and traits. By the end of the book, I felt as if I truly knew both of them - which I normally find difficult in books written in this POV. The real treasure and beauty of the novel is in the plot and the way the author carried it out. I found every single aspect of the story captivating and I couldn't get enough of it. I loved learning about the various past lives that Bryan and Linz remember - they are written with such precision and attention to detail that I could close my eyes and feel as if I were there too. The whole concept of time travel and past lives both captivates me and boggles my mind at the same time. They're both huge topics with so many different variations and possibilities that I find it hard to wrap my mind around them. The author was able to open the door to these ideas and allowed us to get a glimpse inside without being overwhelming. I do have to admit that the writing did take a little bit to get used to. The use of the third person point of view along with the parts of the book that contain the jumps backward in time were a bit hard to get used to, but once I became accustomed to the style, I was able to easily slip inside the story and the world(s) the author created. I can't even begin to describe the different lifetimes that we get to read about during the book - or even the story that occurs in the present with Bryan and Linz - because I can't seem to find the right words at all. And, like I said before, I wouldn't be able to do the book the justice it truly deserves with my thoughts and feeble attempt at a review.I can only say that this was one of the best books I've ever read - for so many different reasons. It's wholly unique and captivating, and will leave the reader wishing it wouldn't end as well as making a last impression. There's so much involved in the story - little details and things I know I missed - along with wanting to experience it all over again. I know without a doubt that I will be re-reading this novel several times over and will probably discover something new each time. I can't recommend this book highly enough. The author mixes together such a wide variety of genres that there's a little bit of something for everyone inside it's pages, and I believe that readers of all types of fiction should get their hands on a copy of this book. It's a beautifully written, thought provoking, and mesmerizing masterpiece that will surely become a huge hit. The fact that it's the author's debut novel also blew my mind. There's absolutely no way I would've guessed it myself. The writing shows a truly natural talent and the story is simply magnificent. This is an author to keep your eye on - if this was just the beginning of what she's capable of, I can't wait to read what she comes out with next!Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TJLNWJ49US4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125005303X#wasThisHelpful","R3TJLNWJ49US4V","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 Stars'Charmed' is the second book in a thrilling young adult paranormal series. The story picks up where the first left off - with our main character, Indie, having barely escaped a series of brutal attacks with her life. Her best friend, Paige, was taken by the crazy (and now dead) Leo - and Indie is still doing everything in her power to find her and bring her home safely. Indie feels that it's her fault Paige was kidnapped, and is determined to do whatever it takes to fix it - even when she finds out that Paige is actually in an evil alternate dimension of Los Angeles. It's a horrible place filled with the worst and most dangerous witches, warlocks, and sorcerers. Indie's determined to find a way into Los Demonios - which is basically a prison located in the underworld. In order to save her friend, Indie will have to team up with some dangerous people - not to mention a hot sorcerer. Will she be able to get into Los Demonios and find Paige before it's too late?I'm a seriously huge fan of any book dealing with witches and witchcraft, so this book (and series) immediately grabbed my attention. I'm glad that they did, because this series is very well written with a perfect blend of multiple genres, which will definitely appeal to fans of all types of fiction. Indie is a fantastic main character for the book (and series). She's intelligent, strong, caring, devoted, loving, and full of determination. The first book showed a lot of character growth for Indie, and I enjoyed watching her mature throughout the story. In this installment, she continues to grow as a person - as both a regular person and as a witch. There are more tough situations that she has to deal with throughout the story, like going to Los Demonios to rescue Paige, that bring her character close to breaking - only to have her come back stronger than ever. I liked watching Indie continue to grow and to be more confident in who she is as a whole - both normal teen and witch. I was able to immediately fall right back into Indie's world within the first couple paragraphs of the book - and it felt like I had never left. Everything was written in detail with great attention to detail and vivid imagery - to the point where I could easily close my eyes and imagine myself going through the story with Indie. Another huge aspect for me was the author's use of first person point of view. I talk about the importance of point of view in almost every review, because I truly believe that it plays a major role in how the reader experiences the story. First person POV is by far my favorite because the reader gets to really know the narrator - who is usually the main character as well - on a deeply personal level that can't be achieved in any other way. We get a look inside their minds - how they are experiencing everything that's happening during the story, along with their fears, hopes, dreams, inner thoughts, memories, and so much more. The bond that the reader is able to create with the narrator with this writing style is incredibly intimate. It also gives the story a conversational tone, which I think makes it flow more naturally and helps the reader to immerse themselves fully into the book.Everything about this book was fantastic - it surpassed any expectations and hopes I had for it after reading the first one. The characters - including the major and even some minor ones - were all unique with their own personalities and traits. The setting was basically just like our world - except for the whole witch/warlock aspect. But in this book we get to experience the underworld for a while in Los Demonios. The author did a wonderful job transporting the reader into this magical and terrifying place, just as she did with the rest of the book. The story had a quick yet natural pace, except for when things were getting really suspenseful and full of action, and it made it even faster. I found myself devouring each page to see what was going to happen next and ended up reading the whole book in one sitting. It's definitely a page-turner that's full of everything you could ask for - action, adventure, excitement, paranormal aspects, witches, fantasy, and even romance. Because of this great blend of genres, the book will appeal to fans of all types of fiction. There's a bit of something for everyone inside. Overall, I definitely recommend this book (and series) to all readers - especially those who love stories about witches, along with paranormal and fantasy fiction. The only thing I hate about series is having to wait for what feels like forever for the next installment to come out, which is what I have to do now - but I'll deal with it because I can't wait to see what's going to happen in the next book!Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LV8MERIZLCO3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385743394#wasThisHelpful","R2LV8MERIZLCO3","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Off the Page' is a cute and light-hearted young adult romance that blurs the line between fantasy and reality. The book is considered a companion novel to 'Between the Lines', but can be read as a standalone. I hadn't read 'Between the Lines' beforehand, and I could follow everything that happened just fine. Looking back, I wish I would have read 'Between the Lines' first because it gives a better understanding of the characters, their relationship, and the obstacles they had to overcome to get Oliver into Delilah's world. Although not completely necessary, I would highly recommend reading 'Between the Lines' before jumping into this one.I found this novel to be a wonderful romantic distraction from what I normally read. I don't usually go for contemporary romance, but the synopsis for the book had me instantly curious as to how the story could be passed as realistic. I'm definitely glad I gave it a chance! Sometimes you just need a break from your usual genres, and I admit that I can be a ridiculously sappy romantic given the right situations. I found a perfect blend of both romance and fantasy within these pages. The characters were well written - especially our two main characters - Delilah and Oliver. They both have very distinct personalities with obvious flaws, strengths, and weaknesses. I could almost immediately connect with both of them, especially Delilah, from the very beginning. The secondary characters in the book were also written in a rounded, distinct way that made them seem just as realistic as the main characters did.The book is written in first person point of view, from three different characters - Delilah, Oliver, and Edgar. The story is broken down into separate chapters/sections, depending on who is narrating at the time. If you've read any of my reviews, you know how much point of view matters to me. First person POV is, by far, my favorite style. The reader gets to know so much more than just the surface story - we're privy to the narrator's inner thoughts, emotions, hopes, dreams, fears, everything that makes them unique. This style also allows the reader to see the story unfold from the narrator's perspective, which can be entirely different than another character's would be. By using first person POV, I really believe that the author takes the story to a deeper level. In this novel, we have the opportunity to truly get to know and understand three different characters - and how each one of them responds to events in the story. By the end of the book, I felt like I really knew our three narrators, which created a strong connection with each of them individually and made them feel very realistic. It let me experience the story from three differing sides, along with seeing how each character felt and reacted during the book. It was an exciting experience as well as a roller coaster ride of emotions - but I wouldn't have it any other way.The plot of the book is fascinating - mainly because of Oliver's character and how he came to be with Delilah. If you put all of that magic and fantasy to the side, you're left with a beautiful story about true love, obstacles that people have to overcome, and what happily-ever-after really means. Like I mentioned above, this was a huge roller coaster of emotions for me. I found myself grinning like an idiot at the book during some parts, while during others I was close to tears or crying my eyes out. It was written with such detailed description and imagery that I was able to slip inside the story almost instantly at the beginning. I felt as if I was right there with the characters as everything in the book happened - and I felt what they were feeling, whether it was happy, sad, confused, or a mix of different emotions. There is no way that I could have simply read this book - it was an experience that will stick with me for a long time to come. I can't say enough about this book, but my only regret was not reading Between the Lines first. I would have had a better understanding of all the characters - from the main ones to the smallest of appearances - along with more knowledge of the history behind the story and how it all came to be. I very highly recommend this novel to every reader - even those who don't normally read this genre. It's an enchanting story written with amazing talent, and everyone should experience it. I definitely recommend it to fans of contemporary fiction, fantasy, and romance - you really need to read this book!Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ9DQ41UQ9ONA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553535560#wasThisHelpful","RQ9DQ41UQ9ONA","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'The Girl at Midnight' was by far one of the most imaginative and original books I've read this year. The story follows the Avicen people - an ancient race that lives deep underneath New York City - and uses their magic to keep hidden from humans. Except for a little girl who comes across their seer late one night in the library. From that night on, the Avicen has been the only family that Echo has known - and she's incredibly devoted and loyal to them. She makes her way in life by stealing and then selling the items on the black market. Echo's known about the centuries-old war that's been going on since way before she was born. So when the war threatens to come to her home and involve her family, she decides that she can't just stand by. She remembers the myth of the Firebird - the one entity that has immense magical ability and is the only thing that can stop the war for good. Having been a thief for the majority of her life, Echo sets off to find and take the Firebird - no matter what it takes.I was immediately intrigued when I read the synopsis for this book and knew that I had to read it. The story was entirely unique and I absolutely loved every page of it. Our main character, Echo, was an interesting choice for a heroine. I loved how the author immediately shows the reader that Echo isn't anywhere near a perfect person - we learn right away that she's a thief. Aside from her bad habits and flaws, Echo has several redeeming qualities as well. She's smart, quick on her feet, determined, and incredibly devoted to the Avicen who took her in when she was a little girl. Her loyalty and love for these people is her driving force throughout the book. Once Echo learns that there's a threat to her adopted family, she doesn't hesitate to act. The Firebird is nothing but a myth, but it seems to be the only way to finally end the war - and Echo decides that if it's real, she's going to find it and bring it back to save her people.There's so much that happens throughout the novel that I can't possibly touch on all of it. I loved learning as much as I could about the Avicen people - their history, the war, their characteristics, everything. The author created such a realistic and magical world for the book that I felt like I was inside the book alongside Echo the entire time. I was able to connect with Echo right from the start and was sucked into the story after the first couple paragraphs - and I didn't want to come back out after I was finished. The novel is a fantastic mix of several genres, which will appeal to readers of all kinds. There's action, adventure, fantasy, mythology, magic, paranormal, and contemporary topics. Since the story is told from the third person point of view, we don't get to know Echo or any of the other characters on a very personal level. I really wish that it had been written in first person POV with Echo as the narrator - her character is layered and getting a better look into her thoughts and emotions would have made it a much deeper experience for me. That's my personal opinion, of course, as I always prefer the first person POV for fiction. Surprisingly, I was able to really identify with Echo during the story and found myself slipping easily inside the novel despite the third person POV. The writing was phenomenal on all levels. The author used vivid imagery and detailed descriptions to create Echo's world - which definitely helped me envision it all so well. The pace was quick and picked up even more speed as the story progressed. It has a natural flow and nothing felt forced or fake, which is saying something considering the fantasy and mythology aspects. Overall, this was one of the best books I've read this year and a new favorite of mine. I'm ridiculously excited that this is just the first in a series - I can't wait to see where things are going to go. The only negative part is the long waiting for the next installment. Very highly recommended for fans of all genres, especially action/adventure, mythology, and fantasy. You definitely don't want to miss this one!!Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OQFHD3JOQRYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038574465X#wasThisHelpful","R2OQFHD3JOQRYN","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Jesus Swagger' is a thought provoking look at Christianity targeted towards teens and young adults. It answers several questions that a young person might have - about life, religion, God, and other important topics. The book's goal is to have the reader examine their own lives - how they live, act, think, and their faith - to see if they're being the true Christian that God wants them to be, or if they are merely putting on a show for others - pretending to be the devoted Christian that they want others to think they are. The book is written with some slang - even the title contains it - and it seemed a bit silly to me at times. However, given that the book is geared toward a younger audience, I'm sure that it fits well in that age category. Otherwise, the writing is easy to understand and personal - it feels like the author is speaking to you directly when you're reading. This writing style should prove to be an effective method for a book dealing with these topics. It will also help the teen readers to identify with the author and put the lessons discussed on their level. Recommended for Christian teens and young adults who are trying to be more 'real' in their faith, as well as those readers who are curious about the religion in general.Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review through the Book Look Bloggers Program.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7GLGOQZFIZ4Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718021991#wasThisHelpful","R7GLGOQZFIZ4Z","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 Stars'Swept Away' is a perfect summer read for fans of YA contemporary romance. The story follows our main character - Mandy Sullivan - as she faces a long and boring summer alone with her best friend away at camp and her brother staying at college. To help the time go by faster, Mandy takes a job at the local lighthouse. Imagine her surprise when a cute guy requests a private tour on her first day. Mandy and Oliver instantly click, and then proceed to spend more and more time together doing things they both enjoy - like biking through the woods and going to the local festivals. Mandy's doing her best to channel Cynthia's (her best friend) confidence and flirtatious personality, but as the summer progresses and Mandy's feelings for Oliver continue to grow - she'll find herself battling insecurities and trying to keep her heart and mind open to a possible relationship with someone who's only going to be in town for the summer.Although the story is pretty predictable and you basically know what's going to happen before you even open the cover - this book turned out to be a quick and sweet summer romance that had me smiling until the end. Mandy is a great main character for the story. She's kind, smart, down to earth, and a devoted daughter and friend. She has flaws like everyone else though - she's incredibly insecure (especially when it comes to guys) and lacks confidence. She starts out expecting another boring summer filled with the same routine and the same people she's known for the majority of her life. When her best friends, Sam and Cynthia, start dating, Mandy just doesn't get how they feel. She's never felt that way about anyone and now she's starting to feel like the third wheel. Then Cynthia takes off for camp and her older brother decides he's not coming home from college, Mandy's summer keeps looking dimmer and dimmer. That's when everything in the book turns around. Mandy meets Oliver - and something between them just clicks. She doesn't really know how to act around him, so she relies on how her best friend usually is around guys to help her navigate these new feelings. Mandy can feel herself falling for Oliver - but she's afraid that her heart will get broken when he leaves at the end of summer. We definitely see a lot of character growth throughout the book with Mandy's character. She starts out as a clueless girl who has never been in love, and during the story we see her grow and change in ways she never imagined. I loved watching Mandy and Oliver as they became friends and then so much more. It was sweet and honest, which made it feel incredibly realistic.The story is told from Mandy's point of view, which is perfect for the novel. We get to experience everything that happens through her eyes while getting an inside look at who she really is. We learn her hopes, dreams, fears, insecurities, and her inner thoughts and dialogue as the story goes on. By the end of the book, I felt like I really knew Mandy - which (again) made the story feel all the more authentic. Since the novel is told from the first person point of view, the pace felt effortless and the flow was completely natural. It wasn't too fast or too slow - it maintained the perfect speed for readers to know what's going on, to feel what the characters felt, and to identify and empathize with Mandy. Reading this book was like reading a journal entry from when I was a teenager in a situation like hers, which brought back a lot of different memories during the story. It also felt like Mandy was telling me personally what was going on - it was very conversational in tone, which was also a factor in immersing me into the story. As I mentioned at the beginning of this review, the plot is not unique or original, but rather predictable. The author sets it apart from the other books in the genre by having a realistic main character/narrator who pulls you inside of the story right away. I think of it kind of like watching a romantic comedy - it's obvious what the ending will be, but the reason you watch it anyways is because you want to see the events and story line that lead up to that ending. This book, along with many others in the genre, are the same as those movies - at least for me. Overall, it was a sweet YA romance that will make the perfect summer read. Definitely recommended for fans of the genre along with those who enjoy chick lit and contemporary fiction as well.Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UYCQV8Z4BMMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481436082#wasThisHelpful","R2UYCQV8Z4BMMF","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Neverland' is a sweet modern day retelling of Peter Pan. It follows our main character - Livy - as she attempts to come to terms with her little sister's death. Even though it's been months, Livy can't move on with her life and spends her free time at the Seattle Children's Hospital, visiting and reading to the patients - which helps keep her memories of her sister alive. Enter the cute and mysterious Meyer - who intrigues Livy and promises her a life of adventure and good times. Livy isn't sure if she's ready to let go of her sister yet, but Meyer's world is seductive itself - and Livy finds herself having to choose between the fantasy of Neverland and the real world; where she just might be able to find the strength to live and love again.I've been really loving the trend of fairy tale retellings that's been happening lately, and this book only adds to it. It's a modern day retelling of Peter Pan, which I thought might be a bit weird and would turn into some kind of fantasy. The author wove a magical story that was able to combine this well-known tale with a contemporary setting - which made it not only feel realistic, but possible as well. Our main character, Livy, is incredibly easy to identify with right from the very beginning of the book. The author uses first person point of view - from Livy's perspective - to tell the story. If you've read any of my other reviews, you know that this is by far my favorite writing style. It worked perfectly with this book because we get to experience everything that happens alongside Livy, as well as getting to know her character on an incredibly personal level. We get to be inside of her head during the whole book, so we hear her inner dialogue along with more personal thoughts and feelings - her fears, hopes, dreams, the intense pain and grief of losing her little sister, and the exciting feelings that Meyer brings out in her. By the end of the book, I felt like I truly knew Livy - it's like she was a real person instead of just a character in a story. The flow and pace of the story was smooth and natural - it felt like Livy was telling me what happened in a conversation.The story line is a true roller coaster of emotions - one that I fully experienced, which is unusual for me. I felt Livy's emotions - both good and bad - as if they were my own, and had visceral reactions during the entire book. I smiled, laughed, swooned, cried, and just about everything in between. When I react this way to a book, I know that I've found an author with true talent - which is precisely what happened with this novel. I loved Meyer's character and the way he was with Livy. He had so many different sides to his personality that it felt like I knew him just as well as Livy did. I can be a real sucker for romance, and I have to admit that this book brought that out in me. I loved watching Livy and Meyer as they see each other from afar then finally meet, and then as their relationship grows and blossoms during the rest of the story. But it's not just the romance between Livy and Meyer that makes this novel so fantastic. It's literally everything about it - from the writing style and the rounded characters to the setting and the flow of various emotions it evokes - and everythng in between. To me, it wasn't just a modern day retelling of Peter Pan - it was so much more than that. It deals with some very difficult topics - like grief, the death of a loved one, cancer in kids, and feeling invisible. It's not just about the hard things in life though - it also speaks of finding yourself, letting yourself be happy, falling in love, and accepting the things we can't control in life - to name a few. To me, this book was the perfect blend of romance as well as showing the full spectrum of human emotion and the ability to heal. It's so hard to try to describe what this novel became to me - probably because it's so much more than just a contemporary romance or a fairy tale retelling. It was beautifully written with a compelling story line, realistic characters, and a story full of hope, acceptance, and love. That's the closest I can come to describing how this book made me feel - aside from the huge emotional roller coaster of the story itself - and what I love about it. I can't recommend this book highly enough to fans of contemporary fiction as well as readers who enjoy fairy tales, retellings, romance, and books that deal with serious life topics. You don't want to miss out on this book!!Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WUF51703AF1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1508846480#wasThisHelpful","R2WUF51703AF1W","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 Stars'The Secrets We Keep' is a gripping young adult contemporary novel that asks the question - what would happen if one twin sister took over the identity of the other? The story follows identical twins Maddy and Ella as they go about their normal teenage lives. Although they're twins, they are complete opposites - Maddy is popular and outgoing, while Ella is quiet and would rather sketch than hang out with lots of people. Even though they don't have very much in common, the twins are incredibly close to one another. The story takes a tragic turn when an argument causes the sisters to get into a fatal accident - one in which Maddy dies. When Ella wakes up in the hospital, full of guilt and surrounded by people who all believe that she's Maddy, she quickly decides to take on the role of her sister. As Ella delves deeper into Maddy's personal life, she discovers that her sister had lots of secrets and she might not have been the person Ella thought she knew. Ella's left with one choice - come clean about her true identity or take on Maddy's for good.This book is one of the ones that instantly grabs you from the very beginning and doesn't let go until long after you've finished reading. I was sucked into Ella and Maddy's world from the first paragraph on - and I got so wrapped up in the story that I ended up reading the entire book in one sitting. Although the plot isn't completely original, the author sets the book apart from the rest by creating incredibly realistic characters and a story line full of secrets, lies, mystery, and some romance. I loved both of the twins - Maddy and Ella. Although Maddy dies in the story, we're able to get to know her through Ella's thoughts and memories. Each of the girls has a distinct personality with flaws, strengths, and weaknesses - among many other things - that set them apart from each other. It does sound a little cliche that one twin is the pretty and popular one, while the other is quiet, shy, and does her own thing - which is sketching in Ella's case. Even though some of these aspects weren't wholly unique, the intimate details of each girl and their lives - along with the story that follows Maddy's death - certainly made it stand apart for me. I loved discovering the truth about Maddy alongside Ella. Nobody is exactly who they seem to be on the surface, which plays a large part in the story. There were definitely some twists in the plot that I didn't see coming, which made me rethink some things I thought I knew about the girls. I love that the author added in these twists to keep us on our toes. There's definitely a bit of mystery going on in the book and I really enjoyed trying to get to the bottom of it all with Ella.Although this book has some serious twists and suspense, it was also a book that focuses on the twins and their bond to one another. That being said, the book was definitely somewhat of an emotional roller coaster for me. Having that deep of a bond with someone, losing that person - the grief, guilt, loss, pain - it definitely had my emotions all over the place. Some places were happy with good memories, while other parts focused on the not so great things that happen. Ella's emotions are incredibly vivid and written in a way that touched me in a way that most other books don't. The writing was incredibly well done. It had a fast pace and a great flow that made it basically impossible to stop reading once things got going. The author used a great amount of description and attention to detail that brought Ella's world to life, and made it very easy for me to slip inside the book and experience it all as if I was there myself. There's a bit of something for everyone mixed into the novel, so it will definitely appeal to fans of most genres. Even if this type of story isn't your normal go-to or favorite genre - I highly encourage you to give it a shot. I honestly don't think you'll be disappointed in the least - actually the opposite. I very highly recommend this book to readers of all genres, especially those who enjoy YA contemporary fiction, mystery, suspense, and thrillers.Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TQ3V2SAC8U70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374300461#wasThisHelpful","R2TQ3V2SAC8U70","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Lucado Treasury of Bedtime Prayers' is a beautiful book that children of all ages will enjoy. It's full of prayers for all kinds of situations and circumstances - from bedtime to playtime, happy or sad, or just normal days. Each prayer has a definitive rhyme scheme, so it makes them easier for kids to memorize and repeat back later. The book is also full of beautiful illustrations on each page. They're full of color and will definitely catch the attention of all children - especially the smaller ones who can't read yet. In my opinion, this book can be used for children of all ages. When they're really small, they will enjoy looking at the gorgeous pictures while you read the prayers aloud to them. Over time, as they begin to learn how to read on their own, this would be a great resource on practicing reading skills - with the rhyme scheme of the prayers, it will be easier for the child to use the new abilities they are learning as well as finding a good learning system that's unique to them. With older children, they will be able to practice by reading the book to others. With such wonderful prayers - which could also be described as poems - and the incredibly beautiful artwork, this book is sure to be a huge hit with kids and adults alike. It would also make a great gift for a baby shower or a child's birthday.

"'The Fearless' is a captivating young adult dystopian thriller that will have readers eagerly turning the pages to find out what will happen next. The story follows our leading lady - Cass - as she tries to live a normal-ish life with her younger brother Jori on Hope Island - an island that houses survivors of the Invasion. There's one major rule on the island: Nobody can leave and absolutely nobody can enter. Cass can remember the day of the Invasion like it was yesterday - not seven years ago. She remembers seeing the Fearless and the horrific things that they caused. So when the island's security is compromised and Jori is taken by the Fearless - Cass knows what she has to do. She has to leave the island to travel the unknown and horrifying world outside so she can find Jori and bring him back.When I first read the description of this book, I was instantly intrigued. It sounded like a perfect blend of dystopia and thriller with an original plot. I haven't read any of the author's other works before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Happily, I wasn't disappointed in the least. The author does a great job creating a truly terrifying dystopian world where a drug that was supposed to help soldiers during and after serving has a severe side effect: most of the people who take it lose the ability to feel fear. The drug soon escaped the military's hands and was given to tons of people across the globe - infecting them with the same outcome - the loss of fear. I think the world the author created for the book is terrifying because, if you think about it, this could actually happen in our world today. Who knows what kind of drugs the military and government are working on? And a side effect of aggression that morphs into loss of fear is capable of occurring now. There's honestly nothing about how Cass's world came to be that isn't possible of happening to our society right now. That's a really scary thought. We see how fast the world disintegrates and falls into chaos - forcing people to hide in order to keep themselves and their families safe. Again - not very far-fetched, in my opinion. I loved learning how the drug came to be, how it changed from being a helpful medicine for soldiers into the dreadful poison that creates the Fearless, and how people live in a world so frightening.Cass is a great main character for the book. She's ten years old when the Invasion happens, so she remembers what the world was like before the Fearless overtook it. She also remembers the horror of the Invasion itself - the panic it caused worldwide, all of the destruction that happened, and having to move to Hope Island to be safe. Because of this knowledge, Cass is a down to earth teenage girl who is incredibly protective of her little brother, Jori. She will do anything to keep him safe and out of harms way. She's always on her guard on the island, just in case something were to go wrong. She's a loving and kind person who will do whatever it takes to make things right or to fight for what she believes in. We see her character grow throughout the book as she goes to find Jori - she matures both mentally and physically in the outside world. By the end, Cass is a very different person from the one at the beginning of the book - having to fight to stay alive changes her in a lot of ways, not all of which are easy to see.The plot was fascinating, just like the description promised. Like I mentioned above, the world that the author created freaked me out because it was so realistic and could actually happen. The story is fast paced with loads of action and lots of suspense. I found myself reading as fast as I could to see what was going to happen next. Cass's journey to find Jori was full of obstacles and problems that always seemed to get in her way. The Fearless were freaky and one of the best parts of the book. I think it's because of their grotesque behavior and odd appearance that had me so fascinated. It was like a wreck - it's gruesome and terrifying, but you just can't stop yourself from watching. The one thing I did notice was that some of the dialogue seemed choppy and didn't sound like a normal conversation. When I came across parts like this, it pulled me out of the story a bit, which then took a little while for me to get immersed into the novel again. This is solely my opinion and I'm sure that other readers had no issues with it. For me though, it broke the trance-like state that a good book can put you in several times and each time I had to get myself back into that mindset. If the dialogue was more natural and flowed easily, I would have given the book a higher rating. Overall, this was a solid YA dystopian thriller that fans of both genres will enjoy, along with those who like suspense, action, and science fiction. It's a great book for anyone to read and I highly recommend it to everyone.Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T18ST5ZEMFZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385744471#wasThisHelpful","R3T18ST5ZEMFZJ","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this moisturizer! I have combination skin, and it's hard to find a facial lotion that will effectively moisturize without leaving a greasy look. This product solved my problem! I love that it's all natural and not harsh on your skin. The lotion is marketed to get rid of and prevent wrinkles - more of an anti-aging effect. I personally don't have wrinkles (yet!) so I can't comment on how the product works in that capacity. I found that it does leave my skin feeling incredibly soft and smooth, and I'm starting to notice my skin tone even out.

"I love these socks! I enjoy doing yoga, so the non-slip bottoms were a huge selling point for me. If I didn't want to use my mat for any reason, these socks let me continue without worrying about slipping. Another thing I love is how universal they are. The socks are black, which matches pretty much everything. I can wear them around the house and not have to worry about slipping on my wood floors. They're very comfortable and fit well. I definitely recommend these socks for anyone - use them for yoga/exercise or just as socks with bonus non-slip bottoms.Disclosure: I received a sample of the product in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XR20B7MQAL32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TF7EBIQ#wasThisHelpful","R2XR20B7MQAL32","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'The Perilous Journey of the Not-So-Innocuous Girl' is a young adult novel that effortlessly blends several genres together to tell the story of Marguerite - an upper class French debutante who has the kind of life that other girls can only dream of. Marguerite is the main character in the book. For a large portion of the book, she is spoiled, haughty, and doesn't do what she's told. Marguerite does have redeeming qualities too - she's intelligent, loves her father and her friends, and is definitely a free spirit with a bit of a wild streak. Her father is throwing her an official ""coming out"" ball so she can be formally introduced into society and begin looking at rich young men as possible husbands. Only Marguerite doesn't want it - the ball, the snotty families with their sons - who all have some sort of fault, and being paraded around like a prize animal by her father. That night, her best friend since childhood - Claude - tells her that his military orders have changed and he has to leave in the morning. Marguerite is heartbroken at the thought of losing Claude and (not surprisingly) she realizes that she's in love with him. He (of course) loves her too, but isn't good enough for her and nobody would allow them to be together. Marguerite has a huge fight with her father, which ends with him sending her away to a school for women like her. She wants nothing to do with this lifestyle and only wants to be with Claude. So (naturally), she hops on a ship and follows him to New France, so they can finally be together. The journey proves to be much harder than she expected, both physically and emotionally, but if she can make it to New France and Claude - she can finally be free.As you can probably tell from my summary of the book, I found the plot to be rather mediocre and not very original. It's basically the story of two people in love, who are from completely different ways of life (the whole star-crossed lover thing), and the journey and obstacles they must overcome to be together. This type of story has been told a million times in a million different ways. This is no different - it's the same plot only it's been altered to the author's taste. I'm not saying that this is a bad thing - everyone loves reading about the star-crossed lovers, including me. I'm just pointing out that I thought the plot was pretty obvious and is one that has been written so many times that it gets lost among the others just like it. The writing was well done and had a natural flow. For some reason - and this is all on me and has nothing to do with the author or the writing itself - I just couldn't lose myself in the book. Usually I'm able to slip inside the world the author has created and completely immerse myself in it. That just didn't happen with this one. I can't pinpoint any specific reasons or issues I had - the writing just didn't grab me at the beginning.Marguerite was an interesting main character for the book. She's defiant, a bit wild and reckless, but also caring, smart, and a loving daughter and friend. I was able to identify and empathize with her character throughout the book. She takes a lot of risks and faces tons of danger when she decides to follow Claude to New France. She basically leaves her entire life - which is a nice posh one - in order to follow her heart and to be with the guy she loves. I have to admit that I'm a romantic at heart and I always love these types of stories; where one person risks everything to be with the one they love. I'm a sucker for it every time - and this was no different. I loved watching Marguerite and Claude's relationship grow - from being childhood friends and then falling in love with one another. It might have been a bit cliched, but I liked it anyway.The last thing I want to talk about concerning this book is the world the author created. This is one component of the story that blew me away completely. The story takes place in an alternate history - one filled with awesome steampunk gadgets and inventions. I don't often have the chance to read steampunk fiction, so I ate this up. The author did a magnificent job building this world and incorporating all the different aspects of both history and steampunk. I loved reading anything and everything about Marguerite's world - it all captivated me. There's such detailed descriptions of things - especially the steampunk inventions like the bots, Marguerite's cricket toy, and the aerships - to name a few. I felt like I could see these contraptions right in front of me as if I were there. Steampunk in general has always fascinated me and this book was full of it. Needless to say, I loved learning about everything that had to do with it - from the small things to the bigger and more impressive ones. Learning how they worked, what they looked like, and any other details about the devices had me truly enthralled. Honestly, it's because of this amazing world and the intense attention to detail that kept me reading this book. None of the other aspects seemed to grab my attention like the steampunk world blazing in front of me in all of it's shining glory. I feel like I'm not describing it right or using the right words to capture it, but I'm doing the best I can. It left me speechless and filled with wonder. Overall, this was a good book with a plot that was mediocre and a bit tired - but the writing and world building brought it back and gave it the spark I needed to stay interested. Recommended for fans of fantasy, science fiction, historical fiction, and those who enjoy steampunk.Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E76HSC3SNFMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692337342#wasThisHelpful","R3E76HSC3SNFMN","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'The Crimson Gate' is an exciting sequel in a gripping young adult science fiction/dystopian series. It continues to follow our main character - Harlow - as she attempts to find and stop her evil twin before she wreaks chaos on the world. Harlow's double, Isiris, is acting as Harlow and was just named the Matriarch of VisionCrest - a very powerful religious group that her father had led. Isiris is taking advantage of her new position within the organization and plans to unleash a supervirus that will kill all the members of VisionCrest and erase all traces of the group's existence. Harlow must find a way to escape the temple she's being held captive in, and then she has to find the Resistance - all before Isiris' plans are acted out.Just like the first book in the series, this installment was a phenomenal mix of several different genres, specifically dystopias and thrillers. The plot picks up pretty much where the first book stopped, which made it easier for me to fall back inside the world the author created and to experience the story alongside Harlow. The story continued to be very original and hard to describe. Harlow continues to be a fantastic main character, even with her obvious flaws, but she also is a devoted friend and daughter who will fight for what she believes in and will do whatever it takes to make everything right. She's very smart, strong - both emotionally and physically, and she's willing to risk her own life for everyone - from the people of VisionCrest to the general population of her land. I found the rest of the characters to be well written, if not a bit predictable at times. Isiris proves to be a worthy adversary with strength, intelligence, and a plan of her own. Aside from these small predictabilities, the rest of the story was well written with tons of suspense and twists, which will keep readers on their toes. The author wrote with great attention to detail, vivid imagery, and a fast pace, which kept me eagerly reading to see what was going to happen next. Overall, this was a unique and fascinating sequel that fans of several genres will enjoy getting their hands on - highly recommended!Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LR5FV19H51A3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=073874204X#wasThisHelpful","R2LR5FV19H51A3","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Shadow Scale' is the highly anticipated next installment in a thrilling young adult fantasy series. It continues to follow our main character, Seraphina, as she adjusts to the knowledge that she's half-human and half-dragon. She's honing her special skills so they aren't so sporadic and visions don't take her by surprise any time they want. As Seraphina is learning to harness and control her special gifts, a war between humans and dragons begins. The humans are fighting rebel dragons over power. The battle is raging in her land, and Seraphina learns that because of her heritage, she is the only one with the ability to stop the war and unite the kingdom - which she fulls intends to do. Convinced that the other half-breed people will only help her, she goes on a quest to find them and convince them to fight with her. Along the way, Seraphina will learn things she never dreamed possible - from terrible secrets and lies to hidden histories - and the realization that someone is trying to stop her. What makes things worse is the fact that this person is a half-breed like her, one who will stop at nothing to make sure both sides - human and dragon - are destroyed.I have to admit that due to all the hype about the first book along with the huge buzz and anticipation for this installment - I had some pretty high hopes and expectations before even opening the novel. I shouldn't have worried though, because there was nothing at all lacking from this book. It was just as magical and enchanting as the first - immediately sucking me back into Seraphina's world from the opening words and not letting me back out until I was completely finished. I felt that this book deals a lot more with the political unrest in the kingdom and the war between the humans and dragons for power. Normally those types of concepts would make me wary of a book, but I found myself eagerly reading everything to see what was going on and why - and what was going to happen next. I loved that there was a bit of a mystery thrown into the plot with Seraphina realizing that one of her own people is working against her and wants to see both the humans and the dragons destroyed. I continually tried to figure out who it might be, but I couldn't do it on my own and had to wait until it was revealed in the book.There are three major aspects to this book that made me love it so much. The first I've already described above - the plot. It was original and had tons of action and adventure  - which kept me on my toes the whole time. There are a couple storylines happening at once during part of the book, and I loved that they were both written in a way that didn't confuse the reader, and also when they melted into each other to return to the main story line. The second thing is the character of Seraphina. She's an incredibly strong female lead for the book (and the series) and continues to grow and mature all the time. We see a lot of growth from Seraphina in this book - she learns that she is the key to stopping the war and uniting the kingdom, the pressure to find others like her to help fight, and overcoming several other obstacles throughout the story. She's already strong - physically and mentally - as well as smart, intuitive, determined, and willing to do whatever is needed to make things right. Because of these attributes and the various situations and problems she encounters in the book, she has to mature even more than before and in a short amount of time. She can't be so blind to things that are going on around her - she has to be alert and always on guard in case something should happen. The changes in her character are obvious at the end of the book, but seem to happen gradually in the book - which I really loved.Lastly, the main aspect of the book that I loved more than anything, was the author's writing. This is where it gets hard for me to put my thoughts and feelings into the right words and I never seem to be able to describe things enough to emphasize how incredible they are. Every part of this book was written with such attention to detail - down to the most minute details - and with such description that it truly brings Seraphina's world alive for me. I immediately felt like I was inside the story alongside Seraphina, experiencing everything that she did. The author used intense and vivid imagery along with incredibly detailed descriptions throughout the entirety of the story. As I mentioned, the world the author creates feels so realistic that I easily slipped right into it from the beginning. I could shut my eyes and see, feel, hear, smell, and taste everything in the story, from the tiniest detail to the important parts like the battles - and everything in between. The book is told from Seraphina's point of view, which is my favorite writing style. Because it's first person, we're able to know every little thing that goes on in her head - doubts, fears, dreams, hopes, insecurities, along with her inner dialogue and the story from her vantage point. By the end of the story, we feel as if we actually know her as we would a good friend or even somehow closer. Using the first person point of view also makes the book feel more conversational in tone and the flow comes naturally - like the story is being told by Seraphina to us - not the author writing it on the pages. It's this part of the book - the writing - that makes or breaks a book, for me at least. The author didn't disappoint with this novel. I was instantly mesmerized and stayed that way throughout the entire book - which is actually really long. It takes phenomenal writing to keep a reader enthralled for such a long period of time. Like I said at the beginning of my review, I can't ever seem to find the right words to describe why I loved the writing so much or what it is about the novel that made it blow my mind. I can never do it the justice it deserves. All I can say in closing is that this is one of the best books I've read this year, and by far one of the best YA fantasy books I've ever read and it's now a new favorite. I can't wait until the next book to see where the story will take us. If you're a fan of YA fantasy, paranormal fiction, action, adventure, mystery, high fantasy - or just a reader looking for something different to lose themselves in for awhile - then you need to read this book. I personally think everyone should read this book due to all the different genres it combines and because it's such an exceptional novel in every way. READ. THIS. BOOK. NOW. I promise you won't be disappointed.Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VM5U9QQM7R9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375866574#wasThisHelpful","R2VM5U9QQM7R9U","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 Stars'Earth & Sky' is the fantastic first book in what promises to be a phenomenal science fiction trilogy. The story follows our main character Skylar, or Sky, as she goes about her normal teenage life as a senior and dealing with incredibly powerful panic attacks that happen when something around her feels ""wrong."" Nothing bad has ever come after these attacks, so Sky has found a way to cope on her own and appear normal in front of everyone - including her parents. Sky's world is turned upside down when she meets the mysterious and seriously cute guy named Win - who can finally explain what's happening to her and why she gets the attacks. Apparently the Earth has been a place for alien scientists to conduct various experiments that manipulate time. It's been happening for thousands of years and the Earth is beginning to show the effects of the experiments - it's very existence and reality is slowly unraveling right around everyone. There is hope though, in the form of a rebel faction of aliens who want to free the Earth and its people from being mere test subjects. Win happens to be a member of this alien rebellion and is on Earth to help find a weapon that their leader has left somewhere in Earth's time and space that will stop the scientists once and for all. Win needs Skylar's help to find the weapon and stop the experiments - before the world literally falls apart.I found this book to be a truly refreshing breath of fresh air for the YA science fiction genre. There are so many books out there right now that seem to be blending together, but this one takes concepts and aspects of science fiction that aren't normally written about and melds them into a unique and enthralling novel. I don't normally read a lot of science fiction, especially ones that have to do with aliens - mainly because I usually can't connect with the alien characters or I can't immerse myself into the story. I encountered neither of those problems with this book - it actually had the opposite effect on me. I was drawn into the world the author created right from the beginning and I didn't come back out until the very end. The Earth setting in the book is just like our world today, so everything in it and about it was completely familiar to me and put me at ease immediately. I think that had a lot to do with the way I responded to the alien aspect of the story - I slid easily into the book at the beginning, which is just Sky's normal life - just like anyone's now. When Win was introduced into the story and the real plot of the book was revealed, it just didn't seem like that huge of a leap for me. I think another reason that I could get into the story was because the aliens looked just like normal people, and the concept of time travel is nothing new to me as a reader. No matter the reason(s), I was surprised at how much I identified with the characters - human and alien - and how I readily accepted the plot about aliens.Speaking of the characters, they were all very realistic with distinct personalities and traits. I loved Sky as the main character because she was realistic. The daily problems of high school, friends, family and others - and because she suffers from intense panic attacks. This aspect of her character really resonated with me because I myself suffer from panic attacks, so I could easily empathize and identify with how she felt and what happened during them. The entire story was incredibly well written with a fast pace but an easy flow that has the reader inside the book without them even knowing it. I loved getting to know all the facts and details about Win's planet and his people - everything from their history to how the scientists manipulate Earth in experiments and how the rebels are planning on stopping them. There's a lot that builds up during the book that foreshadows what's going to be happening in the next couple books - and I can't wait to see where the story line will go! I'm already dying to read the next book in the trilogy so I can continue on the adventure alongside Sky and Win. I very highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys science fiction, fantasy, time travel, aliens, and those looking for a unique and mesmerizing first book in a series like nothing else out there.Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N9XCHTFYS8GP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477847847#wasThisHelpful","R3N9XCHTFYS8GP","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Near Enemy' is the gripping and darkly hilarious second book in the Spademan series. The book picks up a year after the first one ended, but the reader is caught up to speed almost immediately, learning what has become of most of the other major characters from the last book. With everything seemingly back to normal, Spademan takes on what should be a routine job - to take out a guy named Lesser who has been a huge pain for everyone in the limnosphere. Although Lesser has been making enemies everywhere he goes, he comes back from his dream state and claims that there are terrorists who have found a way to get into the limnosphere and hijack the complex system from inside of it. Also - they're based somewhere in New York. Spademan doesn't know whether to believe Lesser or not, but this could turn out to be a huge terrorist attack - one that hasn't happened in a long time - and it would be from inside the limnosphere, where the people who can afford it retreat for an escape of the dim reality of their actual world. It seems that the more he investigates Lesser's claim, the more enemies he uncovers - some that he would never have guessed were so close, and just what they're willing to do.The author's first book in the series took me completely by surprise and it ended up being one of my favorite books of the year. Needless to say, I had pretty high expectations and hopes for this book - and the author didn't fail to deliver. The story has all of the strange and twisted elements as the first, our anti-hero main character is back, and the plot turned out to be complex with lots of twists. Spademan remains the gruff main character of the book - although he's still an anti-hero, those who have read the first book know a bit more about his character and can see beneath that layer of his personality to something more underneath. I loved Spademan just as much in this novel as I did in the last - he continues to be a favorite character of mine. The other characters in the book were well written, especially Lesser, who we get to know decently well. Again, he's not a saint or anything, but he's also much more than what he's known for.I loved the plot for the story. It was genius and original - terrorists going into the limnosphere and attacking from the inside? Awesome. As the story progresses and we learn more about these terrorists and their plan, the more we really get to dive into the perverse thinking and actions that have come about in this horrible new world that the author has created. It's written with such attention to detail and vivid imagery that I easily slipped back inside within the first couple of sentences. I could shut my eyes and see myself beside Spademan in this New York of his world - and experience everything just as he would. That kind of immersion is rare in a book, especially one that's so different from our own, and I consider that to be a huge indicator of the author's talent. The writing itself was phenomenal - just like the first. I was afraid that it wouldn't capture me in the same way as the previous book did, but I had nothing to fear - it was all written in the exact same gritty narrative with dark humor that had me snickering (a lot). The writing, in my opinion, reminds me of Frank Miller with it's short dialogue lines, twisted characters, and thrilling plot. The book was a quick read for me - however, I was already accustomed to the way the author writes and didn't have to figure it out. Some readers find the writing hard to decipher, at least at first, due to the lack of punctuation in places, the short lines, and no indications of what is dialogue and what isn't as well as who is saying what. Once you catch on though, the story really flies and you become completely engrossed in the story. I can honestly say that I love this book just as much as the first. There isn't any aspect of the book - from writing style to characters and setting to the plot itself and anything in between - that didn't blow my mind. It's hard to describe a book like this one - let alone try to write a coherent review of it. There's no way I could ever do it the justice it deserves, but I'm trying my best to convey how unique and unconventional the book is. Obviously, this book won't be for every reader. There will be those who don't like the writing style, or the overall plot and narrative. That's fine and to be expected. But for those readers who - like myself - enjoy this type of gritty, twisted, and darkly funny fiction and love to be totally engrossed and glued to each word - you need to read this book. Seriously. I can't recommend this novel, or the first novel in the series, highly enough. This is definitely going to be a favorite for this year and will end up on my all time favorites list. I'm keeping my eye on this author and I can't wait to see what he's going to come up with next.Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review through the Blogging for Books Program.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y0UPDKDTS2AL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385349025#wasThisHelpful","R1Y0UPDKDTS2AL","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Haunted' is the first book in a new young adult paranormal series. It follows our heroine, Phoebe, as she and her family move from her home in California to her stepfather's dilapidated family manor in England. Phoebe knows that they had to move because of her - due to something awful that she did - she just can't remember what it is. Phoebe immediately gets a creepy vibe from the house when they arrive, almost as if someone or something is watching her. She hears the local stories about the mansion being haunted by the original owner, Madame Arnaud, who abducts and kills children. Phoebe isn't sure what to believe, especially when she begins to experience really strange things in the manor that she can't logically explain. Nobody in her family will listen to her concerns, so she turns to Miles - the hot guy who has been giving her mixed signals - for information and help. What she finds goes deeper than she ever thought possible, and might just include her too.This was an intriguing and atmospheric novel that sets the tone and scene for the rest of the series. The setting was my favorite part of the book - the 18th-century mansion that has been left to deteriorate over the decades. The manor is the epitome of Gothic architecture, with detailed descriptions of the various rooms - the ballroom, the library, the main entryway - as well as intricate details - the stained glass windows and the pictures they show, the hundreds of small sculptures on the outside walls of the house, along with all the smells and sounds. The manor is a huge part of the story and is definitely the centerpiece of the book - all of the events and occurrences come back to it. The characters are well written, with each having their own distinct personalities, strengths, weaknesses, and problems. Phoebe - our main character - is also the narrator of the story, so we get to know her on a deeply personal level. We learn everything about her - her quirks, fears, the things she loves and hates, her emotions, and all the inner dialogue throughout the story. Seeing things from her point of view allows the reader to feel more connected to the characters as well as the mystery and paranormal events that occur throughout the book. The plot wasn't anything wholly original, but the author gave it a few twists and turns that made it fresh and unique in it's own way. No spoilers here, so I'll just say that the twists are big and alter the reader's perceptions in several ways. The writing was well done with a natural flow and conversational tone. There was just something about it that didn't grab my attention fully enough to pull me into the author's world. Don't get me wrong - there's nothing at all wrong with the story, the writing, or anything concerning the book. The issue is all on my end. I can't pinpoint the reason that I couldn't immerse myself inside of the story - even with the first person narrator. Because of this, I found my mind wandering at times and I wasn't very focused on the story or what was going on. I have to admit that I did grow a bit bored with the story - again, I don't have any specific reasons why this happened, it just did. I felt like it was going too slow and dragging things out, along with some stereotypical elements and boring aspects. All of these things diminished my interest and my overall experience with the book. Overall though, I would recommend this to fans of young adult fiction, especially those who enjoy fantasy, paranormal, ghost stories, and Gothic fiction.Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JFA46A3WR3SN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617736260#wasThisHelpful","R3JFA46A3WR3SN","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 Stars'Dead to Me' is a gripping young adult historical mystery/thriller based in Hollywood during the late 1940s. The story revolves around our main character, Alice, as she digs into her sister's life for the past four years - since she left home without a trace. Now, Annie is in a coma and fighting for her life after being nearly beat to death one night. The hospital called Alice after finding her picture and phone number in Annie's shoe, and Alice can't believe that she's found her sister after all these years - and is more determined than ever to find out the truth of why Annie left home and never reached out to her. Alice also knows that her parents are lying to her about something big - and she has a hunch that it has to do with Annie and why she left. She's not about to lose her big sister again, so Alice feels it's up to her to find out what Annie's being doing since she left and who could want her dead? She'll have to go through the shady underbelly of Hollywood -  with all of the dirty and nasty secrets that are hidden there - in order to save her sister and to answer the questions that have burdened her for years. What she finds will shock her to the core and she'll have to rethink everything she thought she knew about Hollywood, the so-called glamorous life of actors, and even her own life.I love a good mystery or thriller and never pass up a chance to read one that sounds promising. I'm usually complaining that the YA genre doesn't have enough good thrillers out there, which I'm happy to say is starting to change, and this novel can definitely be added to that list. The plot of the book really isn't anything terribly original - a teen girl runs away from home after a big fight with her parents and isn't heard from again - until she turns up in a hospital, leaving nothing but more questions. The fact that the story is set in Hollywood during the late 1940s makes it much more fascinating. A lot goes on during the story, especially as Alice digs through her sister's past to figure out what happened to her. There are tons of smaller stories that are brought up during this time in the book - and all of them somehow tie in together to create the backbone of the central plot. These smaller story lines are detailed and intricate, which I feel only adds depth to the book as a whole. It's like a puzzle - all of these smaller stories and characters that Alice discovers are the pieces, and when put together in the right way, they show the entire picture of what happened to Annie and why.I always try to figure out the mystery in the book before the main character does, but I wasn't really able to pin it down with this one. I kept building up theories in my mind, only to have a big twist in the story knock me back to where I started. When I can't figure out a mystery of any sort before the character, I consider it a strong indication of the writer's talent and ability. I loved the author's writing style throughout the book - all of the various elements were each done precisely and in great detail. After putting all of the different parts of the story together, the big picture behind it all is revealed in striking detail. When I found out that this is the author's debut novel, I could hardly believe it. The book is written with the skill and grace of a seasoned author and showcases the incredible talent the writer possesses. Part of the reason I loved the writing so much was the author's use of first person point of view - that of Alice. By using this technique, the reader gets a much deeper and intimate understanding of what happens during the book, sometimes actually feeling as if we've been transported to that specific place and time. With this novel, I felt as if I had stepped back in time and was experiencing the glamorous Hollywood of the 1940s, as well as the dirty underside that is kept hidden from the world. We experience everything as Alice does and are privy to her personal thoughts, fears, dreams, hopes, and emotions - among several other things. This style also allows the reader to connect with the character in a whole new level than would be possible using a different technique. The reader is almost immediately connected to Alice and can easily identify with her from the start of the book. I love being inside the main character's mind during a story - experiencing everything from their standpoint. Emotions, inner thoughts and dialogues, and other sensory information is vividly detailed and described from the character's viewpoint - which makes the reader feel as if they are inside the story itself and experiencing everything that happens alongside the character. This is a huge benefit of using first person point of view, in my opinion, and I believe it makes a book and it's characters all the more realistic.Each part of the story - from the setting and scenery to the secondary characters and the events that unfold - is described in fantastic detail with lots of description and vivid imagery. It feels so realistic that the reader will get lost inside the pages, forgetting about the outside world, until they have finished the book - which is another sign for me that an author has true talent. Overall, I found this novel to be an exceptionally well written story with an imaginative plot and a mystery full of twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the very end. I very highly recommend this book to fans of mysteries, suspense, and thrillers - along with those looking for magnificent writing and a twisting narrative that will have you reading as fast as you can to find out the truth and who's behind it all. I'll most definitely be following this author and eagerly awaiting her next release!Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ITHJS5KM630X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1423187121#wasThisHelpful","R2ITHJS5KM630X","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"'Quest for Gray Ironbark' is the fun and action filled first book in a new middle grade series. The story follows a young wombat named Laz, who happens to witness a tasmanian devil attack one sunny day. Not knowing what else to do, Laz fights back - but his sister is taken captive. To make matters worse, the tribal elders exile Laz along with his friends Kita and Zeeg for not following the way of the wombat. Now the three friends are out in the wild, trying to find a way for themselves and tracking down Laz's sister. They learn of a legendary weapon that could save not only Laz's sister, but the entire tribe as well.  Will they be able to find the weapon in time to save Laz's sister and the tribe? Or are their efforts going to be for nothing?This was a great middle grade book full of action and adventure. The fact that the characters are wombats is a cute concept, and the reader is able to identify with them as though they were regular human characters. The plot is full of danger - trying to save Laz's sister and not being attacked by the devils themselves. However, underneath the lively story, the author deals with some serious concepts that middle graders would be dealing with in their own lives. The underlying topics are crucial ones that need to be learned - how to stand up/defend yourself against someone who is attacking you, learning how to make your own way in life, making difficult decisions and sticking to them, having to make choices that will effect everything in your life, along with other concepts like standing up for what's right, friendship, love, hard work, and family - among several others. I love that the book is filled with these great messages underneath the overlying story, so that the reader is learning about them without really knowing it. They're going to see it as a fun adventure full of lively and colorful characters - which it is - but while they're enjoying the action, they will also be learning valuable lessons for their own lives. This was a huge selling point for me with the story. The added depth to the story makes it so much more than just a light hearted fantasy with lots of humor and exploits. I highly recommend this book for MG readers, along with parents and teachers of that age group, and younger teen readers.Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XX70P7GI91P2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5VNBGI#wasThisHelpful","R2XX70P7GI91P2","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 Stars'The Book of Strange New Things' is unlike anything I have ever read or even come across before. It is truly original and can't be bound by mere genre labels or even reviews. This book is more of an experience than a story - each reader will interpret and react to this novel differently and on a wholly personal level. I never thought that a work of fiction would have such a profound impact on my way of thinking. There's no real way for me to give a true review of this book because I have no words to describe how I felt and what I thought during reading it.The story itself is as fascinating and intriguing as it is heartbreaking and thought-provoking. The main character of the book is a man named Peter who is deeply grounded in his faith. He's given the opportunity of a lifetime when offered a position that will take him galaxies away from Earth - to a new planet and new people. Peter's intrigued by the mysterious company - USIC - that's overseeing everything that's being done. He's also fascinated by the native people that inhabit the new land; they seem friendly enough but suffer from hunger and a deadly illness. Peter begins to teach them lessons from his Bible, and essentially becomes their minister - and they his congregation. Peter feels like he's doing God's work and what he's meant to do. Until letters from his wife, Bea, start describing the terrible things happening back on Earth. Natural disasters are ripping apart the planet and governments are falling to the ground. It's become incredibly dangerous at home and Bea - who is a woman devoted to her faith, like her husband - is starting to waver in her trust in God and her faith. The distance between the two - literally galaxies - is causing a huge strain on their relationship with each other and with God. Peter's trying to help the people in this strange place while Bea is on Earth struggling to stay alive. Will their love for one another, along with their faith and devotion, save them? Will Peter return home to save Bea - or will he stay and continue to help the natives that are becoming his people?There is a ton of things happening in the book - both on the surface within the text as well as important topics layered underneath. If you take the story at face value and nothing more, you'd find a remarkable tale of space exploration, alien life forms, tragedy, and love - among many other things. It's a great science fiction novel with accessible characters and a compelling story line. However, if you take the story along with the underlying topics and questions that arise from it all - then you'll have an experience that leaves you blown away with your mind spinning and questioning almost every important facet in your life. I know that sounds like a bit much - maybe even a little overboard - to say about a book of fiction. Like I said earlier - everyone will have a different experience with the book. It may be just a great science fiction novel for some, while others might not take to it at all and won't finish reading it. Some will be left with thought provoking questions about heavy topics in life such as love, faith, religion, family, responsibility - and so much more. I could continue on in my ramblings about what I liked about the story - how the characters were written or how well the author created the worlds contained within the pages, but none of that will really tell you what I thought about it. Those are usually some of the important questions to ask about a book, but in this case - they become less relevant. I guess what I'm trying to say is that, for me at least, this was so much more than a novel. It was a literary masterpiece that has several different layers and various ways of affecting the reader. It's one of those titles that you know you're going to read again - probably more than just once - to understand it a little better each time and pick up on things you may have missed before - and, most of all, because it deserves to be thought about and re-read several times. I highly recommend this book to readers of all types of genres - it goes above and beyond any ordinary novel and is really in a class of its own making.Disclosure: I received a copy of this book through the Blogging For Books program in exchange for an honest review.o","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TM8FGGBYEAQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=055341884X#wasThisHelpful","R2TM8FGGBYEAQF","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Dirty Rush' is a hilarious novel and the closest you'll ever get to being inside a sorority - at least seeing what goes on in one. I read the description of the book and knew I had to give it a try. I normally don't read books like this - I guess I haven't come across many books like this one - and I wasn't in a sorority in college. I'll admit that I've always been a bit curious about what really goes on behind the doors of a sorority house, and what it's like to be in the middle of all the action and drama that comes with it. When the description said that this story was the closest to the truth when it came to being Greek, I decided to take a chance and try something different. I'm incredibly glad I did - in more ways than one. The book details every moment - good and bad (and then worse) that goes on when a person is in a sorority. If the things in the book are pretty true to life, then I guess I missed out on some incredibly insane life experiences - again, both good and bad - but I also didn't get mixed up in all the drama either.Our leading lady in the book is Taylor Bell - a freshman at CDU and a third generation Beta Zeta legacy. Taylor already knows that she doesn't want to rush or pledge for any sorority - including the Beta Zetas. When she gets to know a few of the girls a bit more, she thinks that she may have stereotyped them and they could be good people. She decides to pledge and she's having the time of her life. There's tons of crazy parties, full of booze and acts of the X-rated variety, along with the friendships she builds with the girls - who she sees as being super cool, bitchy, and full of attitude. They seem to rule the college like nobody's business. Taylor's glad that she joined Beta Zeta - until a sex tape is leaked. A sex tape featuring a girl that looks just like Taylor. Is she going crazy? Did she make this video without remembering? Or is someone trying to frame her and make her look bad, so she'll end up losing everything she's been working so hard at building at Beta Zeta?I'll admit right now that this book isn't going to be for everyone. There's tons of swearing, underage drinking, drugs, sex and sexual acts, and basically anything else you can think of that's connected to Greek life at colleges. Some readers will find this unappealing due to the material, while others will find themselves fully wrapped up in Taylor's life and not bothered a bit by the scandalous nature of some parts of the story. I personally thought the majority of the book was hilarious (the parts that weren't funny were not meant to be, so it's definitely nothing against the book or author. They're just serious scenes.). From the beginning of the book, with the email from a sorority sister who also writes the forward for the book - I was laughing so hard I couldn't breathe. The attitude, humor, and general writing style were remarkably well done in a way that fueled both laughter and mortification as we go through Taylor's story alongside her. I have never laughed this much while reading a book. Then again, I think that the swearing, dirty sexual scenes, and general attitude of all the characters was ridiculously funny and all the more hilarious because of the truth behind it all. I easily identified with Taylor right from the start. The book is told from her point of view, so the reader gets to know her on a very personal level throughout the story. We get to know her thoughts, fears, emotions, inner dialogue - everything that goes on inside her head. I love when authors use that kind of writing style because it gives the novel a deeper sense of feeling for the reader - it's like you actually know the main character and are with them while everything in the book happens. I'm not going to talk much about the plot, basically because the description does it just fine by itself. It's exactly what's advertised - an inside look at a sorority and all the experiences of being a member of one (both good and bad). I'll definitely be re-reading this one because I'm sure there are parts I missed due to laughing so hard, and because I just want to enjoy the story all over again. I very highly recommend this book to readers who enjoy college-based fiction and for those who want a light and quick read full of laughs. Again, I just want to warn you that this isn't for everyone, due to the reasons I mentioned above. If those things don't bother you (and you think they're funny) - you really need to read this book. You won't regret it at all - you'll actually end up thanking both myself and the author. I'm definitely going to keep my eyes open for more books by the (real) author. Seriously - go read this book now!!Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20Q9DGWWUBXB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476775281#wasThisHelpful","R20Q9DGWWUBXB6","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 Stars'The Conspiracy of Us' is the thrilling first book in a new YA mystery/suspense series. It follows our heroine - Avery West - as her world gets turned completely upside down by two hot guys approach her at prom and tell her that she has family that wants to meet her - and these people are incredibly powerful and important. Avery's mom doesn't have any family and she never met her father - but didn't even consider the possibility that he had relatives, and ones that would want to meet her so badly. After meeting her family, Avery discovers that they are a part of a secret society called The Circle. The society believes that Avery is the key to unlocking an ancient prophecy - some members want to use her for her part in the prophecy, while others want to kill her. Avery wants answers to this dangerous mystery, so she follows clues that take her around the globe - and what she begins to discovery is a conspiracy so huge that it might bring about World War III. Now she's being forced to pick a side - along with choosing between the two gorgeous guys who accompany her on her trail around the globe.I'm a huge fan of thrillers - both YA and adult. I honestly don't think there are enough really good YA thrillers out there. There's some that are fantastic and mind blowing, but they seem few and far between. That's why I was so excited when I read the description of this book. It sounded sort of like a YA version of The Da Vinci Code mixed with a couple of hot guys. After reading the book, I'm glad to say that it definitely deserves to be put on the list of amazing YA thrillers. The plot is full of twists and turns - it seems as if something shocking would happen and I'd just be adjusting to that twist, and then BAM - another turn of events or revelation would happen and I'd be left dumbfounded all over again. Along with keeping the reader on their toes, the story contained a fantastic mystery about a secret society, ancient prophecies, conspiracies, and all that cool stuff. Blending the gripping twists with the mysterious clues and the journey that Avery makes really sets this book apart from others in the genre. It combines a ton of various types of fiction, so you can't easily label it as a mystery or a thriller - it has both of those as well as action, adventure, suspense, and even romance. By blending elements from all of these genres, the author gives the book a depth that wouldn't be present otherwise - and this depth really pulls the reader into the story and doesn't let you go.I loved Avery as the main character - she's realistic and easy to identify with right from the start. The two hotties in the book each have distinct personalities with their own strengths and flaws - which makes it all the more interesting to watch them interact with Avery and see how things progress throughout the story. As for the plot, I absolutely loved everything about it! I especially loved the secret society and the prophecy - their histories, beginnings, and evolutions were fascinating and I really liked learning as much as I could about all of it. I'm hoping the next installment will have even more information and history about The Circle - it's origins, history, practices, etc. Overall, I found this to be a compelling mystery mixed with the unexpected twists and turns of a gripping thriller that will have you compulsively reading as fast as you can to see what will happen next. This is a phenomenal first book in what promises to be an incredible new series - and it's the author's debut! I never would've guessed it just by reading the book - it certainly showcases the author's immense talent, and I'm definitely looking forward to reading the next book in the series - along with anything else she writes. Very highly recommended for fans of mysteries, suspense, and thrillers!Dislcosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH4TA6OIWAYZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399166505#wasThisHelpful","RH4TA6OIWAYZN","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'The Body Electric' is a thrilling and thought-provoking young adult science fiction novel. It follows our main character, Ella Shepherd, as she learns about her unique ability - to go inside another person's mind. She is able to see their dreams and memories and help them relive special times in their lives, all using the technology her mother created. Things aren't what they seem though, and soon the government has Ella spying on the minds of a rebel group and using her abilities to influence them and their memories. Ella feels that something's not right - especially after seeing images of her dead father. And when the leader of the rebel group tells her that they were in love once, despite the fact that Ella's never even seen or met him before, it can only mean one thing - someone has been inside Ella's mind and has tampered with her memories. A war is brewing between the government and the rebels - with Ella caught in the middle. Now that she knows someone has been messing with her mind, Ella can't trust anything - her thoughts, feelings, or memories - because they might not be hers at all.This is the first book I've read by this author, and I have to admit that I had pretty high hopes and expectations for it after hearing all the wonderful things about her writing. I got everything I hoped for and then some. Granted, the story line isn't the most original - there are lots of books out there that have a dystopian future where the government is corrupt and a rebel group is growing in order to overthrow them. What I found special about this book was the writing style and the unique twist the author put into the story about Ella's ability to go into other people's minds and her gift to see their dreams and memories. Everything about this part of the book completely fascinated me. I loved learning all about the technology Ella's mother created, how it all worked, how Ella was able to go into someone else's memories and even influence them - it was all intriguing and added a great layer to the plot to make it stand apart from others in the genre. The characters were all well written, with Ella being the most developed. She's a great main character for the book - down to earth, smart, a loving and devoted daughter, and determined to do the right thing. She's faced with some really hard decisions and situations throughout the book, but her character was able to grow and mature in order to handle everything she experienced. I liked watching Ella's character mature from being a somewhat naive teenager into a determined and decisive young adult. The rest of the writing was equally as well done, with a great amount of imagery and description that made me feel as if I were right beside Ella in New Venice. With all the vivid details, I could just shut my eyes and easily envision every single thing that was around us and what was happening. I'm not usually a big reader of science fiction, but this was a book that makes me more curious about the genre as well as the author's other works. This is an exciting and fast paced science fiction novel full of unforeseen twists that fans of the genre as well as those who enjoy dystopias and fantasy will not want to miss out on.Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MCX9U8JLIC6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990662624#wasThisHelpful","R3MCX9U8JLIC6L","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Disturbingly Beautiful' is the enchanting first book in a New Adult time travel romance series. It follows the main character - Nell - as she goes about her life as a governess at Haunchcroft estate after her charge, Abigail, has passed away. It doesn't take long before the master of the house, Mr. Buchannan, begins to make intimate advances towards her. Nell finds her master to be a handsome man, but doesn't like his character or personality. His advances towards her are unwanted, but he doesn't seem to care. As the time passes, Nell begins to realize that she has been at the center of an intricate plot the family concocted - and that she will never be allowed to leave the estate as promised. When an intruder on the estate comes across Nell on accident - she chases him through what turns out to be a rip in time. On the other side of this opening, she finds a world completely different than her own. One where women have rights of their own, equality with men, and are listened to with respect. It's here that she also stumbles upon a true friend and gains a whole new outlook on life. One thing Nell never expected - aside from going through a rip in time - is finding herself in the future time with her unwanted admirer and master from her own century. Why is he there alongside her in this far-away and distant time? Is he the same person as the man she knows at Haunchcroft estate with his cold and distant demeanor and unwanted advances? Or is this future version a completely different man - one that sees her in a whole new light? Could this man possibly be the same one from her reoccurring dreams - her true love?I'm usually a huge sucker when it comes to true love and romance in books, so it's no surprise that I loved that aspect of the story in this one. Aside from the romantic aspects of the story, I was fascinated by the opening/rip in time that Nell goes through. It's mysterious and defies every possibility, but I really enjoyed seeing Nell in the future - with all the women's rights and advances in equality that seemed impossible to fathom in her own time. She reacted pretty much how almost everyone would in a situation like that, so even that crazy part of the story line made Nell all the more realistic to me as a character. She's a great lead for the story - smart, determined, honorable, kind, loving, and devoted. She has her flaws just like everyone else, but these only served to make her easy to identify with. I haven't read many time travel books, so I'm always intrigued by how the author fits it into the plot, along with all the details surrounding it. Every author has a different perspective and way of writing about time travel, and I find it interesting to compare them to see what they have in common as well as what's different. The writing was well done with a natural pace and easy flow with great use of imagery and detailed descriptions that makes the reader feel like they're inside the story beside Nell. There were some parts that felt a bit slow to me - they kind of popped up here and there throughout the book - but that's just my personal opinion and it didn't effect my reading experience very much. I definitely recommend this book to fans of science fiction, romance, and time travel lovers. This is a great start to a series that has loads of potential. I'll definitely be reading the sequel when it comes out.Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y8MAXMIV9XOR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P87EYPM#wasThisHelpful","R1Y8MAXMIV9XOR","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Forever Found' is the exciting conclusion to the New Adult fantasy Neverland Lost series. It picks up where the first book left off - with our main character, Gwen Barrie, questioning her sanity once again. After meeting and falling for the gorgeous and dangerous Peter at college - who reminds her more and more each day of ""the Boy"" she believed she met and spent months with on an island in the middle of the ocean - and with these reminders of the Boy come memories that are getting more vivid and detailed the longer she's with Peter. She's spent the last seven years of her life coming to terms with the fact that the island, the Boy, her memories, were only coping mechanisms made up by her brain in order to protect her from the trauma of seeing her parents murdered. After all this time - all the therapy, meds, time in mental institutes, and the hard work of putting her sanity back together - Gwen finds herself unable to tell the difference between reality and delusion once again. But what if they weren't separate things? What if she didn't imagine the island and the Boy? What if they were real?I haven't read a Peter Pan retelling before this, and I have to admit that it was a fun and intriguing twist on the story. This is a novella and the conclusion to the series, so you really need to read the first book in order to have any idea of what's going on or you'll be absolutely lost. In this book, the story is told from Peter's point of view - which I LOVED! The first book was told from Gwen's point of view, which gave us a great inside look at her character and all the different aspects - thoughts, fears, dreams, emotions, desires, etc. - and made her a fantastic main character who was easy to identify with right from the start. The author makes a huge switch by changing to Peter's point of view in this book. We already feel like we know Gwen on a personal level and we've been beside her throughout the events of the first book. By using Peter's point of view for this book, all of the reader's previous thoughts about the different happenings and things going on with Gwen are turned upside down. We now get to see inside Peter's mind - an inside view of his fears, dreams, hopes, emotions, thoughts, etc. I think it gives the reader a fuller view of the relationship between Gwen and Peter as well as the story as a whole, because we get to see it from both sides.As with the first book, the plot took a little bit to pick up and suck me into the author's world. But once the pace quickened and things heated up - I was hooked until the very end. Aside from that one opinion, the writing continued to be well done with great imagery and descriptions. There were definitely some steamy scenes in the books between Gwen and Peter, so be ready for those (not that I'm complaining in the least!). I loved watching Gwen and Peter grow both as separate characters and in their relationship with each other. The author put an original spin on the well known story and added a lot of swoonworthy romance, which added up to one hot and romantic retelling. I definitely recommend this book (and series) to readers who enjoy fantasies as well as those who enjoy retellings.Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14GG4EBAL4NBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RJHKKM0#wasThisHelpful","R14GG4EBAL4NBT","AXZD32TVRZ2GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXZD32TVRZ2GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Princess of Thorns' is a thrilling and enchanting retelling of the fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty. In this story, Sleeping Beauty's daughter, Aurora, is blessed with fairy magic that gives her the qualities she will need to win back her throne. With this blessing came a curse - she will destroy the free will of any man who dares to kiss her. After her brother is taken captive by the ogre queen that stole her throne all those years ago, Aurora is ready to fight like a warrior to reclaim what is rightfully hers. She makes an ally out of Prince Niklaas, who is also cursed - he will turn into a swan on his eighteenth birthday unless he can break the spell. Disguised as her brother, Aurora and Niklaas join forces to break both of their curses - before it's too late and terrible things happen.Fairy tale retellings are all the rage right now in YA fiction, and I have to admit that I'm loving the different twists that the tales are getting this time around. When I read that this book was a retelling of Sleeping Beauty - but with her daughter being a warrior princess who is going to fight to win back her throne from an ogre queen - I knew I had to read it. I found the story to be very original while maintaining the ""feel"" of a fairy tale. I loved Aurora as the main character right from the beginning. Aside from being blessed with fairy magic to have enhanced strength, mercy, and bravery, she is also smart, determined, a loving sister and daughter - and someone who will do whatever it takes to make things right and avenge her mother's death. She was easy to relate to and I was definitely cheering her on throughout the entire book. Niklaas is a strong secondary character with a lot of personality and a great backstory of his own. I liked reading about his family's curse and about his life - and, of course, I loved seeing Aurora and Niklaas get to know each other and watching their relationship grow. (There always needs to be romance in a fairy tale!)The writing was exceptional with a very fast pace with lots of obstacles and twists thrown in. The author uses first person point-of-view to tell the story; however, it's not just Aurora we hear from. The book is told in varying viewpoints between Aurora, Niklaas, and the ogre queen - which gives the reader an intense inside look at the story from three very different angles. We get to see the story through each of their eyes - hearing their private thoughts, inner dialogue, hopes, dreams, fears, desires - everything that makes them unique as a character. I love when authors write in this point of view because it really gives the reader a greater understanding of each character - good or evil - while giving the story a new depth that couldn't be achieved otherwise. The plot was full of action and adventure - there was never a dull moment and the pace was quick but not confusing for the reader and there was an effortless flow throughout the story that made transitioning between character's viewpoints seem natural. Overall, this was one of the best fairy tale retellings I've read - this year or ever. I haven't read any of the author's other works, but you better believe that I'll be snatching them up whenever I get a chance. I can't recommend this book high enough for readers who love fairy tales, retellings, fantasies, and action/adventure novels.

"I was skeptical about these at first - I thought they would melt in the oven or fall apart on me. They actually did very well for muffins and cupcakes both! I like that there's a variety of colors in the set, but I would have loved to see different colors you could pick from. (Personally, I'm not a big fan of pastels.) These are easy to clean and you can reuse them, so you don't need those flimsy paper liners anymore - which saves you lots of money (especially if you love to bake).

"HP x360 is a very confusing array of choices and HP's lack of detail and clarity are to blame.  This leads to alot of frustration trying to sort out their x360 models. You have the Pavilion models, Spectre models, and Envy, etc.  But even within one model range, you have various configurations of CPU, screen,etc.(In fact for the laptop on this screen, the current Amazon listing doesn't even have minimal specs, for instance you cannot tell what the screen resolution is.  I later found out from laptopmag that it's 1366 x 768 for both 11.6 and 13.3 screens.  The 13.3"" with 1366x768 is a pretty low pixel density.)HP needs to use varying model numbers, letters, or other CLEAR identifiers in order to keep things sorted out.  Otherwise customers will quickly be confused by all the offerings which may differ by only the CPU installed, which makes a huge difference.  Even on Amazon some of HP x360, item numbers are either nonsensical, having nothing to do with the specs of the unit (M1X24UA#ABA) or listings like this one that have no model number at all HP  Pavilion x360 2-in-1 13.3-Inch Touchscreen Laptop - Intel Core  i3-5010U/ 4GB Memory/ 500GB HDD/ Webcam/Windows 8.1/Silver.  Only for some HP Pavilion 13-s128nr x360 13.3-Inch (item model numbers 13-s128nr x360 or 13-s120nr x360) do you approach a measure of sanity in numbering.It can be really hard to compare x360 to other laptops, and even harder to compare x360 models to each other.Take this laptop for example Newest Model HP Pavilion x360 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop (11.6-inch HD IPS Touch-Screen, Intel Quad-Core Pentium N3700 processor, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD, Windows 10):Description:  Socket: FCBGA1170, Clockspeed: 1.6 GHz, Turbo Speed: 2.4 GHz, No of Cores: 4, Max TDP: 6 WOther names:  Intel(R) Pentium(R) CPU N3700 @ 1.60GHzCPU First Seen on Charts:  Q2 2015CPUmark/$Price:  7.60  Overall Rank:  1073***AVERAGE CPU MARK 1824 ***Compare to the similar model here HP  Pavilion x360 2-in-1 13.3-Inch Touchscreen Laptop - Intel Core  i3-5010U/ 4GB Memory/ 500GB HDD/ Webcam/Windows 8.1/Silver:Intel Core i3-5010U @ 2.10GHz  + Compare Average CPU MarkDescription:  Clockspeed: 2.1 GHz, No of Cores: 2 (2 logical cores per physical), Max TDP: 15 WOther names:  Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-5010U CPU @ 2.10GHzCPU First Seen on Charts:  Q1 2015CPUmark/$Price:  NA  Overall Rank:  703Last Price Change:  NA***AVERAGE CPU MARK: 3062 ***It's not really clear how this current Amazon listing page for this product being reviewed is different from the others listed above.  This laptop here at Amazon is ASIN B00X9KPSKK.  The other two above are B00UVXJEUS (the other maybe identical 13.3 inch with Core i3-5010U), and B016D03S18 (the 11.6 inch model).You should always go to cpubenchmark.net and enter the CPU of the laptop you are thinking about getting.  The trade offs all start based on how fast the CPU is and how much memory it has.  So the Pentium N3540 in this model with a TDP of 7.5w is consuming half the max power of the other processor at 15w.  And the N3540 has a slightly faster clock speed and four cores instead of two.  But this does not tell the complete story.  The CPU MARK for the N3560 shows it performs at 66% of the faster one.  And there is a tradeoff between overall CPU processing speed and battery life.  But it does not necessarily mean that you get 2x or even 1.3x the battery life of the Core i3-5010U in the other laptop.  And because HP does not list battery life comparisons for various x360 models on their own website or on Amazon, you are left to continue sleuthing which is crazy in the era of big data, analytics, and the world at your fingertips via the Internet.Laptopmag says this of another x360 sibling (with a 2.17-GHz Intel Pentium N3520 Processor)  ""You won't get much use out of the HP Pavilion x360 without a charger handy. The notebook lasted 3 hours and 43 minutes on our battery test (Web surfing over Wi-Fi at 100 nits). This endurance falls short of the K200MA (5:23), Yoga 2 11 (5:19) and NB15t (4:07), which all failed to live up to the 7:45 category average.""Laptopmag says of an x360 i3-5010U (2nd model in comparison above?)  ""The Pavilion x360 13t has pretty good staying power for its price. This convertible lasted 6 hours and 56 minutes on the Laptop Mag Battery Test (continuous Web surfing over Wi-Fi at 100 nits), which is better than the TP300 (6:12) and the Inspiron 15 (4:46). The HP also beat the budget 2-in-1 average (6:17)""  (Note that the model number of ""x360 13t"" does not appear anywhere in the HP Amazon listing.  We are guessing we have a match based on the screen size and CPU.)Techradar, speaking of a [?newer] x360 model says ""Users will also be able to configure the 11.6-inch HP Pavilion x360 with a fanless Intel Core M chip for $499 (about 334, AU$646), which HP promises will deliver eight hours of battery life. ""  I could not tell which x360 this is because none of the Amazon HP x360 product listings say 'Core M' and the review did not refer to any x360 model number.HP needs to be consistent in clearly distinguishing the features of the zoo of x360 offerings.  This is something that manufacturers like HP can no longer ignore.  A model number should include the main specs of the laptop.  Otherwise you risk picking a laptop that does not meet YOUR specific needs.  And the HP website is no better.  Although you can see some model numbers there.  If you click on 'See all offers' on the x360 page using either Chrome or IE, nothing happens.But besides clearer product numbering and model naming, HP and the entire industry need to come to a kind of *** truth in labeling *** when it comes to price and performance.  Most product pages for laptops do not clearly talk about battery life.  If you can get talk time and standby time for every mobile phone you should be able to get some kind of standard battery and performance specs for computers and tablets.In the photography world there is a CIPA standard for battery life in cameras.  There needs to be a similar standard here for battery life for laptops, tablets, and phones and all manufacturers need to use it.  Maybe something like PerfLife = batteryLifeAtBenchmarkSettings * standardPerformanceBenchmark","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HSU1VUAST8EX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9KPSKK#wasThisHelpful","R1HSU1VUAST8EX","A3PGVJF37JSHFO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PGVJF37JSHFO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And because HP does not list battery life comparisons for various x360 models on their own website or on Amazon, you are left to continue sleuthing which is crazy in the era of big data, analytics, and the world at your fingertips via the Internet.Laptopmag says this of another x360 sibling (with a 2.17-GHz Intel Pentium N3520 Processor)  ""You won't get much use out of the HP Pavilion x360 without a charger handy. The notebook lasted 3 hours and 43 minutes on our battery test (Web surfing over Wi-Fi at 100 nits). This endurance falls short of the K200MA (5:23), Yoga 2 11 (5:19) and NB15t (4:07), which all failed to live up to the 7:45 category average.""Laptopmag says of an x360 i3-5010U (2nd model in comparison above?)  ""The Pavilion x360 13t has pretty good staying power for its price. This convertible lasted 6 hours and 56 minutes on the Laptop Mag Battery Test (continuous Web surfing over Wi-Fi at 100 nits), which is better than the TP300 (6:12) and the Inspiron 15 (4:46). The HP also beat the budget 2-in-1 average (6:17)""  (Note that the model number of ""x360 13t"" does not appear anywhere in the HP Amazon listing.  We are guessing we have a match based on the screen size and CPU.)Techradar, speaking of a [?newer] x360 model says ""Users will also be able to configure the 11.6-inch HP Pavilion x360 with a fanless Intel Core M chip for $499 (about 334, AU$646), which HP promises will deliver eight hours of battery life. ""  I could not tell which x360 this is because none of the Amazon HP x360 product listings say 'Core M' and the review did not refer to any x360 model number.HP needs to be consistent in clearly distinguishing the features of the zoo of x360 offerings.  This is something that manufacturers like HP can no longer ignore.  A model number should include the main specs of the laptop.  Otherwise you risk picking a laptop that does not meet YOUR specific needs.  And the HP website is no better.  Although you can see some model numbers there.  If you click on 'See all offers' on the x360 page using either Chrome or IE, nothing happens.But besides clearer product numbering and model naming, HP and the entire industry need to come to a kind of *** truth in labeling *** when it comes to price and performance.  Most product pages for laptops do not clearly talk about battery life.  If you can get talk time and standby time for every mobile phone you should be able to get some kind of standard battery and performance specs for computers and tablets.In the photography world there is a CIPA standard for battery life in cameras.  There needs to be a similar standard here for battery life for laptops, tablets, and phones and all manufacturers need to use it.  Maybe something like PerfLife = batteryLifeAtBenchmarkSettings * standardPerformanceBenchmark","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I690YDFM1HUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016D03S18#wasThisHelpful","R2I690YDFM1HUO","A3PGVJF37JSHFO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PGVJF37JSHFO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK, you want to track your fitness/workouts/movement and want something a little more sophisticated than a pedometer.  And maybe you don't want to have your phone with you all the time.  Ok, so get a activity tracker like the fitbit.  Or maybe you want an UP2 instead.  Comparing the two there are many reasons why the fitbit flex shows that the UP2 is the better product.Wrist band - First, you have to press into your wrist to get the prongs to attach the band to your write.  This feels very uncomforable to do.  But still this kind of mechanism is waiting to fall off your wrist.  Many people don't press hard enough when putting it on so it's not really on and then falls off during exercise.  The problem is so bad that people are loosing them all the time.  There is even a product called BANDCUFFS which is a $6 piece of rubber you slide over the clasp on the fitbit band to keep it from coming apart.  You will want a better band than what it ships with.  In this regard the adjustable metal clasp on the UP2 is much more secure.  Point to UP2.Charging - The fitbit module comes with a charging cradle that is notorious for being slightly too big.  The cradle often does not hold the contacts in all the way and people are using paperclips and bent pieces of paper to keep the module in snug enough to charge.  The UP2 charger is also USB and is magnetic.  If you put the charger contacts on backwards the UP2 will not charge.  The fitbit charger is another design foible. Point to UP2Phone User Interface / App - The fitbit application one the bare bones application.  It's hardly graphical.  It does help you control settings on the fitbit but you get a distinctly meh feeling using it.  Fitbit is showing little effort to make a nice application here which is disappointing.  The UP2 UI is fairly well done.  It's pretty and very graphical.  It even helps you get exciting about meeting and exceeding your fitness goals.  The UP2 UI has some bad/nonsensical choices about how to save and exit menus.  But it's much more interesting to use than the fitbit UI.  Point to UP2.Other features are similar for sleep mode, alarms, activity tracking, food tracking, etc.  There are other minor differences here.  But the above items of band, charging, and Phone App, all scored 3 points for UP2 and 0 for fitbit.If you want to feel like you are interacting with a fun, interesting, and motivational device, that will charge without playing with it, and that is not waiting to fall off your wrist, get the UP2Update: 2015-OCT-02 - Yesterday the fitbit gave me a badge for making my 10K steps goal, although actually I had achieved the goal the previous day and was only around 7.5K steps when this award came up.  But then each time I double-tapped the fitbit it would only flash two dots and another two dots in a slightly different position [that's it's notification 'message'].  I could look on my phone and see what my current steps were as the day went on.  But the fitbit never got itself out of this notification mode when double-tapped (to see how many of 5 lights (each 20%) you were to your goal).  And it even did NOT reset itself the next day.  I had to remove the module and start charging it again (even though it was nearly full), in order to get the fitbit to respond to the double-tap as it should.  So be warned, both the phone apps and the onboard firmware are buggy.  My partner has an UP2 and it is SOOOO much nicer than a fitbit.  The fitbit has too many fits compared to the UP2.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R314J90B4J5GQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O#wasThisHelpful","R314J90B4J5GQC","A3PGVJF37JSHFO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PGVJF37JSHFO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a really good exercise and sleep tracking band.  It concedes nothing to fitbit and holds it's own very well.  However there are a few issues to be aware of.  The pedometer/tracker tends to under-measure compared to other pedometers.  We even had one morning were nearly all of an entire hike was not recorded (240 steps on the up2, but 5000 on a smart phone).  It's unclear whether this device uses NFC to upload to your phone as it seems to be uploading even when bluetooth on the phone is turned off.But the largest letdown here is the UI (phone software, food database, and band indicator lights).  First, the phone app software UI design itself is bad.  It tries to look nice but uses some strange UI symbols such as a pressing a check-mark to dismiss/save the current settings instead of a button clearly marked SAVE  or go back.  There are enough non-standard UI queues in here that you will get confused from time to time.  This needs to be fixed with standard user-friendly metaphors.  But the worse part of the app is the food tracking database.  Just try to find something like fresh strawberries or fresh blackberries, you can't, at least on the version we are using.  And there are many other common foods that the S Health application on Samsung Android devices can find that you won't find here.  Clearly the food part of the application is just plain bad.There are some issues with the band itself.  You really need to watch the video on how to adjust the clasp so you don't lose it.  And there is nearly NO other device that lights up RED when it's done charging.  What!!!  I don't care if on some other Jawbone models there is an outline of a runner in red when it's done charging.  That's NOT this model.  When it's charging you get alternating white, blue, and red lights.  And when it's fully charged you get a RED light??????  facepalmOverall, jawbone is coming close to the perfect solution.  But it has enough blemishes to make you pause and continue looking around.  If they can fix the software, make the UI more rational, upgrade the entries in the database, change the 'charged' led from red to green, and clearly explain how the UP2 is communicating with your phone (bluetooth and/or NFC, and which for what data), then they would have a more serious product here, and a winner.Update 2015-NOV-15 - After a month of using the UP2, it has stopped correctly recording all steps.  We changed nothing, and yet when compared to a fitbit flex, both of these units used to record within 3% of each other the correct steps.  But in the past few days the UP2 only records from 3000-5000 steps whereas the fitbit flex is recording more accurately the 12,000 to 15,000 steps we have been doing.  It looks like the UP2 has some issues.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRV82Q8UFDXBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HOIFFW#wasThisHelpful","RRV82Q8UFDXBT","A3PGVJF37JSHFO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PGVJF37JSHFO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Most 1.5-2 year old girls, making the transition to potty training, are excited about shifting into 'big girl pants'.  These are a great step along the way as they are easier to get out of and into than traditional diapers.  The design is great and mostly they are a replacement for diapers.

"We got a big box today from Amazon.  It's a Q3, measuring at 37"" long x 10.5"" wide x 3"" tall.  First one of these I've ever seen.  I had no idea what could be in that large box.  I opened that box, and inside saw an Amazon basics box 13.5"" x 10.5"" x 1.5"".  Inside of that box (feeling like nested Russian dolls at this point) was... VIOLA!  this 11.6 inch case.  I'm sure this case had a very comfy ride inside the plastic wrap, inside the box, inside the Q3 monster box.Now, at first when you touch this case from the outside you think.  ooooo, mega protection.  But open the zipper and find that there is a cushy white bubble/air something inside giving it the cush.  Ok.  So, take that out, and you have a nice neoprene sleeve.Putting this on a 11.6"" Thinkpad x140e, it did not quite, really fit.  The first zipper was a little hard to get around the top corner, and coming across the laptop into the home stretch, I really had to pinch the fabric together to get it zipped shut.  I'm sure it will be fine as it will stretch out over time.  But Amazon should make this just a couple mm longer in each direction to ensure that beefer notebooks like the thinkpad (a little thicker than most) will fit comfortably.I also wish Amazon would go to a percentage rating system like most things are on the Internet rather than trying to shoehorn your perceptions into 5 start.  Amazon products are not movies, there is much more nuance in products.Minus .25 star (5%) for the wasted large box used in shipping, and Minus .75 star (15%) for a bit too snug of a fit of the case on the Thinkpad x140e.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNTCEI2WVQDZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CD8ADKO#wasThisHelpful","RNTCEI2WVQDZ1","A3PGVJF37JSHFO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PGVJF37JSHFO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very handy tool.  Yes, it's versatile.  But there are a number of issues with this tool when used for grout removal.  I used the best/correct blade for the job Dremel MM501 1/16-Inch Multi-Max Carbide Grout Blade.  Took care to wear safety googles and a breathing mask.  I've used it a couple of times for removing 1/16"" grout and though the tool works very well in long straight stretches, there are a number of issues.First, it can get really old to keep having to loosen/remove the holding screen, re-position the blade, and screw it back down.  When you are working corners or edges next to tubs this really slows you down.  There should be another kind of quick release here where you can change blade position in a few seconds, not a minute or two.  Another issue is that the holding screw tool itself, which is supposed to clip on the top of the tool, won't stay on after you take it off a few times.  That entire design of the plastic retainer is flawed.  You'll end up leaving the removal tool just off to the side.  Lastly, with any kind of dust build-up on the outside of the tool, the power switch itself becomes very hard to turn off.  This should be an on/off push button under a rubber cup or other dust-protecting cover.  Even after a few minutes of using the tool for grout removal, if you keep turning off the tool to change the blade and you have any kind of dust around, you will be slowed both by blade changes and by the power switch getting harder to turn on and off.Yes, it's a great tool.  But it's not great if you have to adjust the blade frequently or if you are generating a lot of dust.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDKZKKY65687W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJW083G#wasThisHelpful","RDKZKKY65687W","A3PGVJF37JSHFO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PGVJF37JSHFO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We used this at first as a vacation laptop, something to take on trips.  But after a taking it with him on a trip to Asia, the teen in our house fell in love with it.  A month ago he took it with him to college in California.  And here, in late 2015, this laptop is still going strong.  We upgraded it's memory and put in an SSD and it's one sweet ride.  It's a great laptop.BUT, I have to say with my other experiences of Acer that I don't think I would purchase them again.  We have the i5 powered 5755G 15.6 laptop.  That laptop never worked adequately, it's fan seemed to always run and it seemed a little hobbled regardless of more RAM and disk defragmentation.  When we carefully disassembled it (being well versed in laptop upgrades), we found it was one of the most difficult laptops to upgrade.  You tend to find this a lot in Acers and in general among most cheaper laptops.  The Acers seem to be just a little too cheap and don't make upgrades easy.Today we like ASUS much better.  This ASUS laptop was very upgrade-unfriendly returned it ASUS F555 15-Inch Laptop [OLD VERSION].  Eventually we bought up the food chain closer to the $1000 level with this excellent and more easily upgradable i7 ASUS machine ASUS N550J 15.6-Inch Laptop [OLD VERSION]IF you are looking for something that has been sold in the past year or so that is similar to this Aspire One here,  then your two best choices are the Lenovo x140e Lenovo Thinkpad X140e 11.6 inch Laptop, AMD APU E1-2500, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD, Windows 8 Professional (Certified Refurbished) and the ASUS K200MA-DS01T(S) 11.6-Inch HD Touchscreen Laptop (Black).  The x140e is no longer sold but you can find great condition ones on eBay.  The advantage with the Thinkpads are two-fold, they are usually among the most upgrade friendly laptops you can find, a single screw unlocks most of the bottom cover for memory and disk upgrade.  The ASUS K200MA is spec-d similarly, but the over-glare screen that won't tilt back quite far enough for good viewing is a consideration.  As is the fact that they have buried access to the hard drive under the keyboard, a typical cheesy and cheapskate move that even the Asus F555 used.The other main thing about the Thinkpads, is that they have an innovative fan design that keeps most of the dust out of the fan.  The number one issue with any laptop, any computer, over time, that will usually doom it a slow death (as the fan runs more and more) is usually dust buildup on the cooling fans.  As dust gathers on the fan the efficiency goes down, the fan keps running, the CPU and other components heat goes up, and this wears them out (the hotter they are the shorter they will function before failure.)  THIS single issue is THE primary one that eventually kills laptops and the Thinkpad design is one of the few that attempt to address this issue.  It's really abhorrent that there is no required standards about laptop fans and dust build up.  This design choice in the x140e, 'dustless fan' is a bit of magic you should be aware of.  ""Dustless Fan - Filters dust from entering the fan assembly to extend the life of the fan""So when we were looking to replace the Aspire One that went to college, it came down to the ASUS KM200A and Thinkpad x140e.  I was leaning towards the ASUS (BHphoto 311.00), but switched to the Thinkpad x140e finding one in great condition on eBay at 150.00.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K4R5VSAONNIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0093SFA1Y#wasThisHelpful","R2K4R5VSAONNIV","A3PGVJF37JSHFO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PGVJF37JSHFO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Because, at least for me, none of those poser berries were the real thing.  I'm not exaggerating, these taste unlike any goji berries I've ever had, and I've had all kinds in the past few years.  They are organic, dried to perfection, and the taste, it like layers of enjoyment compared to anything else you've had named 'goji'.  In fact, the only things the other berries have in comparison to these is the spelling of the name.  Do yourself a big favor and try these.  You won't go back to any others.  Absolutely Yummy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y9AHAVWX2XEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W8AZPWI#wasThisHelpful","R2Y9AHAVWX2XEH","A3PGVJF37JSHFO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PGVJF37JSHFO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Where to begin, there are just so many things wrong with this.  First, the headset itself, plastic and aluminum that wraps around your head.  This is so thin it just feels like it's waiting to break.  Second, the ear pads themselves, think really nice pads that would go around your ears, but then shrink them so they press on your ears directly.  My ears start getting hot within 30 seconds.  Next the wires, they are soo thin that I can see them breaking in short order.  The next misfire is the control switch.  With a fully charged AAA battery in there, turn it to ON and you hear nothing.  Turn it to OFF and you hear the sound.  ?????  The one thing that works is the volume button on the control.  Do these actually noise cancel, well, not so much.  I'm sitting here with a window open and can hear the neighbors a few doors down doing yard work and my front loading washing machine gently turning away in another part of the house.  Not sure if these are defective but all of this together means these are not worth it.These are not something I would purchase for an adult or a teen.  They are soo fragile, think tween.  And yet for the price, you are stuck in a strange pricing level.  At $50 you are much better off going for Sentey Warp LS-4420 High Definition Stereo Foldable Headphones with Noise Isolation Ear Cups for Apple, Samsung Headphones, 3.5mm Connector, 40mm Drivers, 20Hz-20KHz Frequency, Black/Red.  And if you want more name brand recognition get to the $99 level here Sennheiser HD 280 PRO HeadphonesAs it is, given the durability issues with this design, I don't think they are worth more than $29-$35.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R376F095SK2M78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028E4SF4#wasThisHelpful","R376F095SK2M78","A3PGVJF37JSHFO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PGVJF37JSHFO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I didn't realize this was just a card game when I bought it, but it doesn't matter...we love it.  Basically, you try and make stacks of money that add up to $100.  (Cards are $15, $20, $30, $40, $45, $50, $55, $70, $80, $85).  You can steal another player's stack by adding a card on top that makes it $100...so if the top card is $70 and you add a $30 card you can steal it.  You can also steal using a thief card.  The final way to steal is via a jail card and that can only go on a thief card.  Once you have a jail card, nobody can steal your stack.  It's a fast paced game and doesn't take a long time to play.  The game is over when one person runs out of cards.  We've played with three and four players and it went well.

My 11 year old says,  ""the idea of the ever tree rotting and releasing the dreadful creature called 'worm' is a very nice concept. I can't wait for the next novel that they write.""  He gave it five stars.  Although it's a separate series, he thinks that kids should read the first series first.  My nine year old thinks that kids can enjoy it regardless.

"I've been using Coromega since they first came out.  So I was curious as to how these would compare.  I still buy the original orange Coromega.  I prefer the squeeze packs to any sort of pill because no fishy burps, and it's absorbed better.The Coromega packs I take say:20 calories2000 mg fish oil650 mg long chain fatty acids350 mg EPA230 mg DHAThe Sundown Packs say:20 calories2000 mg fish oil588 total omega 3s comprised of:314 EPA196 DHABoth have 10 mg of stevia.So Coromega provides slightly more Omega 3s, but not by a lot.  Taste-wise, I preferred the Coromega that I've been using for 15 years.My son (11) said they both taste the same.  Depending on the price, that's who you should go with IMHO.  I can get a big 90 pack of Coromega for about $10 more than the Sundown is selling right now.  So as it's triple the packs, that's what I'd buy.  (Everybody in our family takes it, so we go through it quickly.)  But if you just want to try out the fish oil squeeze packs to see if you like them, or perhaps you're more regular taking them than with pills, then I'd take whichever gets you 30 cheaper.Oh, when Coromega first came out, ""Prevention"" ran an article on all of the different ways you could eat it.  If you don't like it plain, I believe they suggested adding it to a smoothie or even pudding.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N6WMOG64XICA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WCOI1AI#wasThisHelpful","R2N6WMOG64XICA","A17SZZO9LM3WYC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17SZZO9LM3WYC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, a disclaimer. I was given this book for free.  I haven't read any of Salman Rushdie's works before, and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Within a page or two, you realize why Salman Rushdie is such a venerated author.  His choice of language and the breadth of the cultural and religious references he uses is inspiring. The premise for the story was fascinating. It harkens back to his Muslim upbringing with the story of Jinn.  Believing in jinn and angels are one of the articles of faith for Muslims.  I don't think any fatwas will come down over this topic, though.In ""Two Years Eight Months and Twenty Eight Nights"" (aka 1001 nights...a critical time period throughout the centuries that the book transverses), we have basically a battle in our time between the Jinn and the descendants of a female Jinn Dunia and her relationship with the 12th century  great Muslim philosopher, mathematician, and physician/scientist Ibn Rushd (Averroes).  Her children are known as the Duniazat (the tribe of Dunia), and they all share the unique characteristic of having no earlobes.  They also are prone to lightening strikes.  Without adding any spoilers, I'll say 1) Probably better to read in your Kindle so you can look up references you don't know.  2) I think Rushdie cheapened himself with some of the crude language and focus on sex.  He's a master wordsmith, he didn't need to do that.I think if you like fantasy or end-of-times type books, you will enjoy this.  As far as I know, this may be the first end-of-times book with a Muslim slant that I've read.  I enjoyed it, but it's not an easy rush through read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN8B9TAFC1ZW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081299891X#wasThisHelpful","RN8B9TAFC1ZW2","A17SZZO9LM3WYC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17SZZO9LM3WYC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A little more than a year ago, I started using a pumpkin peel from Skin Obsession every two weeks. (I'm in my mid-40s, with fair skin and light eyes.)  I've been looking for a moisturizing mask to add to my routine, and am now using the pumpkin peel every month.  When I saw the opportunity to try this out, I was quite happy to do so.  I know the Phyto 5  brand and was excited to try this product.  In general, I liked it.  My skin felt lightly moisturized after and the next morning.  It's not a deep hydrating masque in my opinion.  At the price it's listed for now, it's a good value.  There were two issues regarding the product IMHO:1) The mask did not come out of the container very easily and smoothly.2) It's not really a mousse as stated on its label.  Its more of a normal mud masque for lack of a better description.I do think it moisturized my skin well, but the product did not have the luxurious feel/texture I was expecting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZQZNCRV9LRBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WB85WDO#wasThisHelpful","RZQZNCRV9LRBJ","A17SZZO9LM3WYC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17SZZO9LM3WYC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ETA...October 2015:  Our new favorite (simple) is the raspberries with white chocolate chips.  So simple that my five year old can make them, but really delicious. I buy the raspberries at a warehouse club, and then a package of white chocolate chips at Trader Joe's or Target (best prices).  You can also use the white chocolate chips for the grapes dipped in white chocolate.First off, my kids really love this book.  It's an engaging format, with lots of pictures, good layout, that made them want to look through it for recipes.  We all also really like the rating system for recipes in the back, it helps us remember what we've tried and liked.  Many of the recipes are simple and easy.  I have an 11, 9, 7, and 4 year old, and many of these are perfect for kids to help with, or even do by themselves.  She talks about GF alternatives which is key for me with one of my kids.The negatives (for me) would be two.  One, she uses a lot of honey in the recipes.  I hate honey.  Yes, I've substituted agave and just good ol' plain sugar in some--but to me, it just seems honey happy. :)  Secondly, some of the recipes are just too involved for the average Mom.  The s'more toaster pastries are a wonderful idea....but are most Moms really going to make homemade pie dough, homemade Nutella, and homemade marshmallow fluff?  I don't think so.  (We made the recipe using store bought Nutella, marshmallow fluff, and homemade pie dough. :))  Some people may complain that many of these are not real recipes (too easy to need one), but since they reminded me of that idea or gave me that idea, it works for me.  (Plus, there are plenty of real recipes to make up for those.)So far, the winners have been:The afore mentioned toaster pastriesThe various cream cheese spreadsThe chia puddingThe banana popsThe dipped pretzelsApple sandwiches (apples and peanut butter)Watermelon Pops (yes, not really a recipe, but my kids loved having watermelon on a stick.)Now that it's summer, the kids are picking out ideas for snacks every week.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H18VMT4OK8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592336612#wasThisHelpful","R2H18VMT4OK8O","A17SZZO9LM3WYC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17SZZO9LM3WYC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Wish that would be offered again.These marshmallows are the same as American Halal Marshmallows.

"For those having trouble finding the downloadable guide, you need to add a / at the end of pinpoint massager. They didn't write it on the directions. So http://downloads.gaiam.com/pinpointmassager/  Unfortunately, that just got me a picture of basically six ways to use it on different body parts, but no real directions.  So try Google or Youtube for videos/guides on how to use the Backnobber or Body Back Buddy.I used to have something called a Backnobber, which I loved, as well as one other variation.  There's also something called a Body Back Buddy, which is even more versatile, as well as the TheraCane.  I was a massage therapist for 10 years, and it was wonderful.  This is similar in design, but it doesn't have as many knobs/variations as the Body Back Buddy...or even the Backnobber.  The premise is the same, and it if you press/pull it in a certain way, you can put pressure on your trigger points/sore points.  To me, it's especially great for the rhomboids (area in between the shoulder blades).  If you'd like to get an idea what it would feel like, have a friend use the eraser side of a pencil to press around the outline and underneath your shoulder blade.  You can pop your shoulder out more by putting your hand behind your back (For your left side, think of it making like a 4 shape with your elbow being the western point of the four and your open hand resting in the middle of your back.)I love the idea of this, but I think other companies have done better jobs.

"This was a really wonderful ""real"" book.  I read it in one day.  The book is about five women who meet because they are married to sex addicts.  I think anybody who has been married or had an unfaithful partner can relate a lot to what is said in therapy and the struggles these women (and their partners face.) The book had a few totally unexpected turns--both regarding a mentor as well as at the end.  Without revealing any spoilers,  the two characters I related most to were Gail and Hannah.  Gail is a well-respected judge whose husband Jonah is a professor at Harvard.  Hannah is married to an architect and has two children.  Her husband is gay.  Other group members include Bridget who is a nurse and married to Michael, Lizzie the teacher whose husband likes to watch porn, and Flavia whose husband Demetrius was caught on the Tube (subway) groping women.Only negatives would be that the ending kind of left you hanging (perhaps designed for a potential sequel?), and it was weird how some group members conveniently disappeared.

There were many good reminders, things I've heard from other people in talking about NDEs or other teachings--but some things were new.

It kind of reminds me of a Bible, in that it has a leatherish cover and is of similar size.  I love the translation...and all of the notes/discussions.  My one complaint is the size of the Arabic.  It is very very small.  I understand that they wanted to make the English larger and easier to read, but given how small the Arabic is, I'm not sure why they included it all.  Having the Arabic there means one must treat it differently than an English-only copy, and yet the Arabic itself is almost useless.

"I enjoyed Jane Isay's book, ""Secrets and Lies.""  I wasn't familiar with her story, or her husband's story.but without giving a lot away, just say that it rang true to me.  She gives examples throughout the book of different secrets and lies that families keepand how that impacts people.  She also shares from her own life.  I think what I was expecting, though, is more information on how to deal with things if you're one of the people from whom the truth has been kept.  I didn't really glean a lot of advice in that regard.  She's not a psychiatrist or psychologist, so perhaps that's why she limited herself to telling her own and others' stories.

"This came up on an Amazon list for me because I've been reading a lot about death midwifery.  I need to warn you that it is a little disturbing to read.  There are things in there I never knew about...and like most Americans, probably never wanted to know.  Still, I'm glad I did read it.  It's not a hard read.  Caitlin is a wonderful, engaging writer. I love how she shared death rituals from other time periods and cultures throughout the book.  She does paint some disturbing word pictures, though--and yet, I came away from the book believing that she and her coworkers truly cared about the people they took care of.  Yes, it was a job, but they tried to maintain the dead person's dignity.  One thing this does do, quite effectively, is think how you want yourself and your loved ones' bodies to be handled in death.  As a plump woman, I'm not so sure I want to go through cremation now... at least not at a crematorium with a brand new ""floor"" in the ovens.  I definitely have no desire for embalmment.

"As somebody who lives only a few hours from Sarasota, I really enjoyed this Amish fiction book set in Pinecraft.  I've read a few Amish novels that feature a family that go on vacation in Pinecraft, but this is the first I remember that has 95% of the story take place thereas well as so many real Pinecraft places like Yoder's, Big Olaf's, and even Emma's Pizza.  Even the character of Imogene is a lot like Katie Troyer and her Pinecraft Sarasota blog. While there are other story lines which feature an Amish widow or widower with young children, this was the first I've read that featured a non-Amish circus performer as the female lead.  While you might think there's no way that can work, it really does.  (I don't want to give away too much.)  It also featured some faith struggles regarding salvation and the Amish belief of being sure of one's salvation would be a sign of pride as interesting.  Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24FPMRDLVG43K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426753551#wasThisHelpful","R24FPMRDLVG43K","A17SZZO9LM3WYC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17SZZO9LM3WYC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With two/four kids having gluten issues plus one adult, it's usually easier to just make everything gluten-free at home.  Problem is, the gluten free kids are new enough that they'll complain if it doesn't taste ""normal"" as well the non-gluten free kids.  Pamela's baking and pancake mix makes awesome pancakes that everybody likes.  We usually add in a mashed banana and chocolate chips, and make it with milk instead of water (no dairy issues).  It's a winner.  I usually make a triple batch so I'll have some to freeze for busy mornings.  Happily you can try a small bag at Target and a lot of major grocery chains, and then come on Amazon to buy in bulk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25C0QTZGZAP2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NMJWZO#wasThisHelpful","R25C0QTZGZAP2H","A17SZZO9LM3WYC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17SZZO9LM3WYC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really pleasantly surprised by Serena Dyer's ""Don't Die with Your Music Still in You.""  I've seen her Dad on PBS many times, and actually own a few of his children's books for my kids.  Still, I didn't know what to expect from her book, as honestly, I've never heard of her.  Well, I picked the book up and couldn't put it down.  Not only that, I actually got out the Post-It notes.  For me, it's a rare book that requires me to either use Post-It notes to mark favorite pagesor even more rare, copy passages on the Post-It note to put on a mirror or 'fridge.  I found myself doing both with Serena's book.  It was wonderful hearing stories about how she was raised (seems like her Dad and Mom are quite authentic), as well as her interpretations/life lessons learned.  Highly recommended.  I hope she writes more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRI3YYCPVPJOE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140193627X#wasThisHelpful","RRI3YYCPVPJOE","A17SZZO9LM3WYC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17SZZO9LM3WYC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never tried a stevia blend, and was pleasantly surprised by this.  I usually think the best way to try out a product is by using the recipe on the back of the box/bag, so I decided to make chocolate chip cookies. I did not have any molasses (as required by the recipe to make brown sugar/stevia), so I used my regular recipe, only subbing in 1/4 cup of the Sweet and Lite for my normal white sugar.  Not only did the raw dough taste great and pass the kid test, so did the baked cookies.  Granted, they only were about 1/4 steviabut still, it was a good way to subtly reduce the sugar without anybody knowing.  I'm going to experiment some more in other recipes as well.

"I've been thinking about getting a bike rack as we have four kids and lots of bikes, but hadn't made the plunge yet as I thought it involved getting one professionally installed.  When I saw this come up on Amazon Prime (yes, I get to try this out for a review), I decided to give it a try.  I'm a 45 year old woman, who is not that mechanical (although I can follow Ikea directions to put together furniture), so I was wondering if this was something I could figure out, or if it would require my husband.  I was able to install it on our Honda Odyssey minivan without trouble.  We put the little kids' bikes in the trunk, and put my adult bike on the rack (this holds one bike, but there are other models that hold more).  It held it quite well for going to the park and back.  It also worked quite well for a longer drive of about two hours.  It fits nicely in the trunk for emergencies, like picking up my son and his bike at a friends house because of rain or whatever.  I'm assuming it's not as secure as a permanent bike rack, but then again, we need a rack only about once per month.  I predict as the kids and their bikes grow, we'll move to a larger capacity rack.  It was a good starter rack for people who aren't sure how often they'd really need a bike rack.  I do wish we'd gotten a larger capacity one, just in caseso I would recommend getting one for at least 2-bikes.  I think it's a great introduction.  I noticed no damage to the car/paint because of the rack (or the bikes on it).","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3032RD8ZAIE2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C45GW8S#wasThisHelpful","R3032RD8ZAIE2O","A17SZZO9LM3WYC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17SZZO9LM3WYC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In general, I'm really disappointed by pre-made First Aid kids.  They usually have substandard suppliesnot enoughand are overpriced.  This falls in line with those.  It's much easier to put together your own by going to a big box store or buying stuff on Amazon.  But the thing ismost people won't.  This is a good kid for our minivanand I'm glad to have it.  I'm also glad I didn't pay anything for it, although the box is fine. :)The addition of eyewash is nice, but honestly, as somebody married to an ophthalmologist, there probably isn't enough to really do the job and a small bottle of water (distilled if you can get it) or contact lens saline solution would offer more volume and do the job just as well.One nice thing about Amazon is that you can find really good quality medical supplies for not very much money. If you're looking for what to put in it, check out the Red Cross or another disaster or survival website. But here's my suggestions:Rather than buying individual packets of antibiotic ointment or cortisone, just pick up a store-brand tube of each.Buy a box of Band-Aids, assorted sizes.Pick up a good pair of tweezers (Amazon sells great ones designed to remove splinters.) Include an ACE Bandgage, some rolls of gauze and non-stick gauze pads, a pack of steristrips, a roll of paper tape.Throw in a bottle of chewable aspirin, a bottle of ibuprofen or acetaminophen, and an anti-diarrheal like Lotramin.Can include a space blanket if it's going in your car or for camping.If you're on meds, include some.If you can get an Rx, include an Epi-pen.Need a snazzy case?

"I didn't know Umm Zakiyyah had come out with some new books since the ""If I Should Speak"" trilogy, so I was happy to stumble across this in the Kindle store.  It's the story of a young American girl who moved to Saudi Arabia with her mother when she was nine, and has now moved back to the states.  She must face the trials of do I want to be ""visibly"" Muslim or do I want to be ""normal.""  Even older Muslims can relate to that as a struggle, and it's something that our kids will definitely go through as well, so it's a good read.  I enjoyed it tremendously, but wished it had been flushed out more.  It's a quick readand like all of her books, ends too soon! Would have loved to hear more from the character Anisa (Inaya's Mom's friend), as well as hear more about Nasra.  I'm hoping that there's a sequel in the works. :)I've been Muslim for 15+ years.  Like many, some days/years are easier than other.  One thing I've found is that Umm Zakiyyah's fiction is always inspirational.  I always take away something that helps me.

I've grown more and more interested in the history of the feminine divine (if you haven't seen the BBC documentary ""When God was a Girl"", check out Youtube.)  This book brings you a few familiar and not so familiar stories from the Bible told in a different way.  I instantly recognized the story of Abraham/Ibraham, Sarah, and Hagarbut the others were not as clear to me.  Still, I enjoyed them tremendously.  I was, however, left with a sort of sadness at how crappy, in general, women's lives have been and are still in many parts of the world.

"3-1/2 stars. I've been doing Pilates for the past 25+ years.  I recently bought a new reformer, so was happy to see how comprehensive this book is in covering the various apparatuses and mat work.  Of course nothing replaces in person classes, but I think having a book like this as a reference if you use DVDs mainly is a great idea.  I love the imagery bit for each exercise.  I think she provides very clear instruction.  My one complaint is that Rael doesn't offer any modification information on the mat work to meet the needs of a wide variety of exercisers.  Very few can start right off and do all of the exercises the way they are meant to be.  While a few variations to make the exercises more difficult are given, none are given to make them easier.  That is a serious miss in my book.  It's great in its range of exercises covered, but lacking in providing really good instruction for every exerciser for each exercise. But, I do think she should have covered more modifications.  Pilates really is for everybody--not just professional dancers or those who are already fit.  If you don't think you'll need the modifications or are perhaps a Pilates teacher or what not, then you'll probably love this book and would rate it 5 stars.  For me, I've seen too many people who do need modifications of some sort...especially at first.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R388P1IO69XNGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1450434169#wasThisHelpful","R388P1IO69XNGX","A17SZZO9LM3WYC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17SZZO9LM3WYC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like many, I've read a lot about Anastasia. I remember the film with Ingrid Bergman.  I remember all the talk about Anna Anderson.  Well, as the author points out, hypotheses about whether or not one or more Romanov daughter survived have been put to rest by DNA evidence found a few years back.  Still, I find their story fascinating.  I was given a chance to review an early copy of this book as part of Amazon vine.  This book is extremely well researched and well done.  The author is a historian, writer, and Russianist who has written about the deaths in her book, ""Ekaterinaberg"", as well as about Queen Victoria in ""Magnificent Obsession"" and ""Queen Victoria"".  Because of her extensive knowledge, she really makes the girls and their life come alive. What surprised me most was how much I felt for the Tsarina. A few chapters are spent on her upbringing in Germany, and early marriage to Nicholas.  She really had a dream marriage compared to Queen Victoria's other grandchildren and most royals.  A marriage where she was truly loved.  Thing is, none of them seemed meant for the life of a ruling Tsar/Tsarina.  They seem like they would have much happier had Nicholas been a younger brother--and they had lived their life out of the spotlight.  While I thought I'd become intrigued with one of the daughters, I actually found Alexandra the most interesting ""character.""  Rasputin (cue Boney M song) is of course mentioned, but still the focus of the book really is the girls. In reading the book, I found I could never divorce myself of knowing their fate.  I also could not forget all the things that happened during Nicholas's reign, such as the pogroms and such.  It was a weird phenomenon, kind of like reading about somebody getting on the Titanic.Still, the book focuses mainly on the girls (Olga, Tatiana, Anastasia, and Maria).  You feel for Alexandra as she gives birth to daughter after daughter.  Yet they were well-loved and cherished by both of their parents.  You rejoice at the birth of the tsarivich, even though you know about his hemophilia.  The girls to me, come across, as just really nice, slightly sheltered girls.  Normal girls, really. You learn about the girls' upbringing, governesses, even their toys.  Sounds like they had a wonderful happy childhood.  Their parents (or perhaps it was the time as well) kept them secluded as well.  Still, these were teen girls, growing up, having crushes--being teens.  I did not know about OTA training as nurses during WWI.  Still, it did nothing to save the family from their fate.  You want to hope that each will find a nice Duke or something to marry, but you know the truth.  You want George V to sweep in, grant the family refuge, and save the day.  It never happens.  History is not rewritten.Not a lot of attention was paid to politics going on outside that lead to the abdication and death of the family.  While I appreciated that (as that might have dragged the story away from the girls and family), the book seems insulated from reality a bit just like they were.  I don't think we get an idea just how bad things were, which was perhaps for the best, and really fitting for the book.  The entire royal family was extremely isolated from St. Petersburg society.  Alexandra and Nicholas kept their daughters isolated too (although there's almost a disconnect with how they cavort with some soldiers.)

"Back when I had braces and a retainer, the advice of my orthodontist was to clean it every week or so using a denture cleaning tablet.  Seeing that these are made by Efferdent, I'm assuming that they are capitalizing on that.  I wear a bite guard for teeth grinding.  (I actually bought my latest one from Amazon by SportingSmiles instead of buying a $400 replacement from my dentist.)  Everyday, I brush it with toothpaste--but that's about it.  I clean the case, but I haven't used a denture cleaner tablet or anything similar.  So, I was curious as to how much of a difference this would make.It comes in little thin packets, kind of like the kind you open to add flavor to a water bottle.  You put your guard/retainer in a clean cup with warm water to cover, and then add the packet. The water automatically turns blue, and after 5 or so minutes, the water will be clear and you can remove and rinse your appliance.  It really did a  good job in that my bite guard felt so clean when I put it on, but the water mixture smelled horrific.  So take that as a warning.  It did not, however, make my appliance taste bad.I will use this about once/week.  I will buy more.  I can't comment as to whether it does a different/better job though to regular denture cleaning tablets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKUEQ1EXGIKB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNKXSZO#wasThisHelpful","RKUEQ1EXGIKB4","A17SZZO9LM3WYC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17SZZO9LM3WYC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To be honest, I first picked up this book because I had done well with my investment in Southern Company.  The second reason is that I used to be in corporate America, but had left--and am now in the process of starting my own business. Oh how I wish I had this book 15 years ago when I graduated for B-school.  Thing is, it still applies. So much here applies not only to women who want to succeed in the C-suite, but also women who want to succeed in politics or in their own businesses.  I also found her experience of actually being a better leader in a field that wasn't your expertise to be true in my case as well.  I remember having a discussion with a good friend about accepting a big step up to Senior VP at a Fortune 500 company.  She didn't know if she was ready for the spot, and I said, ""of course you are.""  We talked about all of her experience, her skills, and thennear the endI mentioned a few men we had worked with, and I said, ""they wouldn't even hesitate one second""that's the difference.  She did take the job, and has excelledbut the truth remains.  It's not a ""Leaning In' that many women face, it's that we doubt ourselves.  We dare to try.  Think of all the bozos in Congress.  There are easily women who could do a better job, but they never try.  That's why this book is so important.  It inspires you to Dare to try.  Dare to reach.  Dare to fail.  It was a great boost to me as I work on my business plan.  Why shouldn't I succeed?  Highly highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC15LELRF35KN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=111856264X#wasThisHelpful","RC15LELRF35KN","A17SZZO9LM3WYC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17SZZO9LM3WYC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Years ago, Biore had a different self-heating masque that I loved.  I remember using it, and I swear that it stayed hotter longer. (I think you could add in more water, which would make the reaction last longer). They discontinued it, and I was so upset.  A few years ago, they had a self-heating cleanser which I loved too.  Can't find it.  Then, a few years ago, I bought an Olay facial brush and it came with a sample of a heating cleanser/exfoliater, which I loved.  Unfortunately, I can't find it anymore, so I was so excited to try this.  It looks like a normal mud masque (dark grey in color), but a little thinner.  Unfortunately, the heat effect really last barely a minute.  I think if they could change it to last 5 minutes, it would be a total win.  The one minute is just too short.

Oiled the pan and dusted with cocoa powder (although next time I think I'll try just Pam as the cocoa powder made the cake look weird in the places where it adhered and did not adhere).  We followed the recipe for the chocolate cake on the box, and then used the Marshmallow Fluff recipe for whoopie pie filling.

"I've never read anything by this author, and I liked her style of writing. It was a very easy read.  (I read it while getting my car's oil changed.)  I've been involved with energy work for over 20 years, since my days as a massage therapist.  While I encountered info about ""the dark side"" briefly when I was involved with some pentecostal Christians--it's never been a focus of what I've read.  So in that regard, this was interesting.  I appreciate that the author isn't a total fear monger, but gives a lot of good information on where people sometime get trapped, and how our own actions can sometime make us more vulnerable.I think her story of how she became an energy healer is very interesting.  I found her style of writing and the actual content--very good and I plan to pick up her other books.What I think was a miss for me was that there was not a lot of practical info on what to do if one encounters dark energy or the like.  She does mention some resources on her website, like that of a clearing bath (1 pound of sea salt and 1 pound of baking soda in a bath for 20 minutes), which I appreciate it--but I'm not sure why she couldn't put that info in the actual book.  She also mentions that some of these things are covered in seminars she gives.  Once again, great--but I'd like to see more in the book itself.  Same thing when she mentions meditation.  She's dismissive of how T.M. has become so expensive (which I agree with), and mentions her own meditation program which is similar and uses a mantra, but then doesn't go beyond that.  You need to go purchase her meditation program.  I guess I'm used to Donna Eden's work and others which give lots of practical meridians and exercises that you can do to clear chakras, work with meridians, etc.  I'm used to meditation instructors who don't feel a need to hide behind a paywall in order to help people.  Yes, I know she needs to make a living, and I respect that.  But I think this book would be more effective if she at least offered some basic exercises/info in the book, and then perhaps sold her own more advanced programs.  So, for meditation, she could say, choose a mantra with meaning for yourself, like ""love"" or ""peace"" or ""light"".  Sit comfortably either on a meditation cushion, or in a chair with your spine erect and as you inhale, with your tongue on the roof of your mouth, say your mantra in your mindor what not.  She may also include this info in her podcasts or radio show for Hay House, but once again, it could have been included here as well.  The book is not excessively long.  There was space.I do appreciate her focus on laying the foundation of daily or regular practice before one can receive what she calls higher initiations.  I liked her interfaith approach--which is very inclusive. I just wish there had been a bit more practical information as well.  Perhaps there will be more free content added to her website to support the book.  I hope so.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5Q3MYHL7OWKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401938949#wasThisHelpful","R5Q3MYHL7OWKN","A17SZZO9LM3WYC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17SZZO9LM3WYC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Dad is part Lenape (Delaware Indian)so while I can't always find things related to his traditions, I do like to find anything I can regarding Native spirituality, teaching stories, etc. (Yes, I know that different tribes are not all the same).  It was under the desire that I picked up ""Returning to the Lakota Way.""  I had not previously read any of Joseph Marshall's works--so was not familiar with the author.  The author himself grew up on the Rosebud Sioux/Sicangu Lakota Reservation in Idaho and spoke Lakota as his native tongue.  It's not just some Western guy with a love of Native Spirituality sharing stories, but somebody who authentically grew up hearing themand living by them.  That holds so much more weight to me.The stories talk about universal character traits (not sure what to call them) like silence, tolerance, simplicity, wisdom, patience, etc.  These are old values, tried and trued values, which one will find in a wide variety of faiths across the globe.  Yet there's something about teaching stories, be it these, the parables that Jesus used, or Sufi and Buddhist tales, which stay with you much longer than  a mere lecture.  You are not soon going to forget the stories you read here.  That's the value of this stories why they are timelesswhy they are so powerful.Yet the author does not just tell a well known story, he also adds his own experience and commentary from growing up Lakota.I plan to seek out more by this author.

"I own Trista's previous book, ""The Girl God"", and I wasn't sure if this would hold up to the very high bar she set before.  I was completely wrong!  I actually may like ""Mother Earth"" more.  It has the same lovely illustrations by Elizabeth Slettnes.  It has wonderful, carefully chosen quotes throughout--basically with each illustration.  I love the link between how the daughter treats the Mom, and how we treat the Earth.  It actually reminded me more of the divine feminine, our first mother, than her first book.  It made me more conscious of the little choices I make and how they not only impact the Earth, but also impact my relationship with the Divine.It will be a treasureto pass down from mother to daughterand to granddaughterand so on.

"I'm trying this diet called The Simple Diet: A Doctor's Science-Based Plan. Basically, the guy who wrote it used to (and possibly still does) run physician supervised diets for those with a lot of weight to lose. Basically you eat two frozen meals per day and three protein shakes per day (can also include nonfat greek yogurt), as well as at least five servings of fruits/veggies per day. You can also include meal bars, up to I think five per week. So, I wanted to try some possible meal bars.I don't like meal bars. I never have. I don't like protein shakes either. So whatever I say, take it with a grain of salt if you actually like them. These are O.K. They have that slightly weird mouthfeel and are a bit dry. They'd be more palatable with a large glass of milk. :) Honestly, for me, I find the Fiber One Protein Coconut Almond Chewy Bars, 5-Count 1.17 oz. bars (Pack of 6) or Kashi bars better (especially the Kashi Dark Chocolate Coconut Layered Granola Bars (1 Box = 6 Bars) (2 Pack), but they don't all have the same nutritional profile.

"This is my third Perky Pet Hummingbird Feeder.  In 2013, I got the 8120-2 Green Antique bottle.  It, too, had no place for the hummingbirds to rest as they drink.  But with solid, yet elegant construction, I like them both.  In 2014, I picked up the 710B Elegant Copper hummingbird feeder.  Now it does have a rest or perch for the birds to stop flying while they eat.  Funny thing....I don't think they care.  They play so much while they eat, that they just adapt to whatever they have to.  A glass bottle is so much easier to keep clean than plastic.  All of the plastic hummingbird feeders have been replaced by these Perky Pet Hummingbird feeders.  If you like watching these great, little birds fly around and feed and play, then get any one of the Perky Pet feeder I have indicated above.  You will love it.

"Weighing in at just over 6 ounces, you know that you have a watch on your wrist.  Solid feel.  Large face with blended tones.  I have not placed a watch on my wrist in over ten years due to the invasion of cell phones.  However, I am now finding that I like what is consider retro to some.  Does it make me feel younger?  Only time will tell.  This is actually good to go if you dive or swim.  Sorry, that's not happening, but for those of you who don't ever want to take it off.....you go for it.

"After starting on my search for healthy eating about three years ago, I came to the understanding that nuts, nuts, nuts SHOULD be the center of anyone's search to good health.  I am not talking about low calorie.  I am not talking about diet items.  I am talking about how we should eat to be more healthy and have more energy.....by the way, you WILL lose weight.  Patrick Evans-Hylton explains, in a very picture perfect book, what we should do and eat using nuts.  I found it fun and exciting.  You see, if you replace or add to your meats in dishes, the amount of meat goes down or away, and the calorie count really does not make any difference.

"We are cat caregivers.....over 35 years and counting.  As the staff, we constantly strive to find even better food for our masters.  Our current female bosses, Paisley and Bindi, have told us they like Solid Gold product.  Let me explain.  As early 80s caregivers, we were not as active as we should have been.....and accidents happened.  In the early 90s, a lovely lady named Angel came to live with us.  She had a extremely sensitive stomach and the research began.  Hill's Science Diet was what we as staff found.  It was and IS an extremely great product.  In fact, it is still our primary food for our bosses.  However, about 5 years ago, after Angel went to become a kitty angel of her own, we decided to try to give our bosses extra treats.  But we wanted to trick them into food just as good as they ate for all their normal Science Diet meals.  Since our owners liked PetSmart, we bought our ""treat"" food like Blue (all mixes) and Simple Nourish (turkey and oatmeal is their favorite) at PetSmart and then in the evening when we staff got home from our other jobs....we would treat the girls to food that was as good as Science Diet....but called a treat.....ingenious.  It worked.  So that is how we introduce new foods to them to see if they like it.  So a week ago, we introduced Solid Gold as their treat.  Their main meals are still Science Diet and the previous treat was Simple Nourish Turkey and Oatmeal.....so the odds were stacked against Solid Gold.  Since the smell is different as the product is different, the lead boss, Bindi the elder, held back ever so gently...maybe 30 seconds.  Then it was a treat fest.  It has been the same every evening since.  Solid Gold will now be an equal to Blue and all Simple Nourish EXCEPT Turkey and Oatmeal...that just rocks for the bosses.  I hope the telling of my tale, how ever so low it has been told by this mere staff of the bosses, Paisley and Bindi, helps another staff member in their quest for food for their bosses and masters.  As Alton says, Good Eats.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A0E5GV91GHZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X0GTP9S#wasThisHelpful","R1A0E5GV91GHZR","A3U52V5ZAHZZKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U52V5ZAHZZKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice addition to my specialty tools, and it comes with an interesting slant......it is TSA approved.  Now, I need to state that I have not taken it on a flight, but I plan to next month.  It's a good solid weight of 9 ounces.  The flip open to the pliers and other tools is so smooth.  The sheath to carry it has a solid clip which can be removed without taking off your belt.  All 16 tools I have used as stand-alone tools, so I know I will get around to all of them someday.  Easily I will use 6 to 8 of them on a regular basis.  When open in full extend mode, it can measure up to 9 inches (ruler engraved into side).  I am extremely pleased with the SOG, after buying a number of other similar products that did not have the same quality as an SOG.Update:  I flew across the USA last week.  I took my insert of the product put the SOG in my carry on bag.  For the flight out it was fine.  For the return flight (I was pre TSA boarding), I was called over by a quiet, nice TSA agent.  He asked if he could go thru my bag.  I said fine.  I figured I knew what he was after.  It was the SOG unit.  He pulled it out and asked me about it.  I told him I got it on the guarantee that it was a TSA approved item.  He was nice, opened all the parts, and found no issue.  He did NOT look at my receipt or paperwork.  He approved it.  So as far as I am concerned, the SOG unit is APPROVED by TSA.

"This is my first attempt at using a tempered glass screen protector.  I must say I was very impressed.  I did watch a few videos of other people attaching the tempered glass to iPads before I even ordered.  The instructions for Anker tempered glass were different than some of the other videos that I watched.  But instead of trying to install differently than Anker instructions, I followed Anker instructions to a T.  It worked out perfectly.  They send everything you will need to install.  Since I and my wife just got brand new iPads, I did not even open the iPad box until I had the Anker Tempered glass.  Therefore, I had no cleaning to do as they had never been turned on my me.  There are tabs that you attach to the glass so you can dry fit the product.  Only when you are 100% sure all is right, do you remove the back cover of the sticking side of the tempered glass.  My wife was not sure since it is GLASS, but they put something on it to not let it smudge as much or something.

"I am sure there will be a ton of reviews about the great job Jabra SPORT COACH does as they work out.  I am a different generation from the young kids on the slick Jabra video.  That does NOT mean that I can't enjoy using this high tech device as I do the things that my generation just calls ""work"".  Not work out, but work.  I absolutely love this concept.Over the past 30 years I have tried dozens of different products to use with the electronic products of our time.  From cassettes to walkmans to flash to WiFi, I have tried them all.  WiFi products have matured enough, and Jabra has hit a home run.  Set up is easy.  Apps load fast.  Just follow the directions.  It has different size earbuds....I use a large for my right ear and a medium for my left.  There are clips to adjust the length of the cord.  A small USB 8 to 10 inch charging cord fits into the little pouch with all the earbuds and clips.  Charging takes 2 hours, but it will then run full out for about 6 or 7 hours before it needs charging again.  About one hour before your battery is at zero, a smooth female British voice states ""Battery low"".  At approximately the 30 minute point, she tells you again.  Finally, about one minute before she informs you a third time.  I used it over this past weekend.  On a solid charge, Saturday I used it for about 4.5 hours doing errands and shopping.  I just cruised around listening to my tunes.  It was neat to be in a store, but really by myself since I did not hear anyone around me.  I did not recharge but continued to use the Jabra on Sunday while I worked around my house.  Mowing, edging, sweeping, trimming trees, doing some work in my wood shop....just basically ""working"" outside.  It finally lost charge after about 3 hours.  So I estimate between 5 to 7 hours of use between charges.The sounds are awesome.  Dolby has a part into this product and that brings quality to the table.  I am very impressed.  It not just for work outs.  Get it if you just need to do things and want to listen to your music without bothering anyone.  Really.

"Having animals for 35 years, now empty nesters, we need to have our little friends to keep us company.  Our two friends are Paisley and Bindi who are female cats.  The videos on the Petcube website are great.  What I realized after I placed the camera in the first position was that the laser  blended in with our red tinted rug.  That prompted a new location.  Then I came to understand that since there is no light ability on the cube (and they don't ever state there is) that it needs to be somewhere in the house that has a light on all the time, or you can't see anything at night thru the app on your phone.  Everything works including the laser, but you just can't see due to low lighting in your house.  Most of you would know that but I am kinda slow on the uptake.  The microphone part of the app is very cool.  You can talk to your pets while you are miles away thru your phone and then thru the speaker on the Petcube.

"Extremely small footprint.  Very portable.  No other power source needed.  Although it is just an external HD, it has a cool color and does look good beside the Xbox 360.  I plugged it in easy enough into the back of my Xbox 360 elite with the usb drive.  Formatted it in my settings and I have 1862 Gb available.  Data transfers pretty well.  You have to be logged into a specific user profile if you want to transfer specific user data (saved games and such).

"My family has been cooking with cast iron frying pans for 30+ years, but our pots have mostly been Calphalon.  Our Calphalon 6 Quart pot is used quite often and even though Calphalon does have a lifetime warranty, we decided to move to a cast iron setting.  Now with a cast iron grill and frying pans which we use with our gas stove, we are adding a Dutch Oven.  We will not really cook Mexican food, as we are stew and crockpot peoples.  You can cook all types of slow cooked foods in this.I like the fact that it is ceramic coated which makes clean up a breeze.  However, a basic cast iron product is easy to clean also.  We use plastic scrapers from Pampered Chef and they do a bang up job.There are little plastic clips that come with the unit so when you flip the lid over for storage you do not chip the unit.  These will fail.  Just get a large, soft cotton dishtowel to layer in between the pot and lid.  That will also help with moisture control.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HUJODONDHW2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJKKT9W#wasThisHelpful","R3HUJODONDHW2M","A3U52V5ZAHZZKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U52V5ZAHZZKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have had my Stanley Wood Chisel Set for well over 20 years.  I take very good care of them.  Good quality.  I have used them many times over these two decades for many, many projects.  However, the TEKTON wood chisel set is about 40 percent longer.  This gives me a truer ability to line things up correctly.  It is easier to grasp.  I am not saying my Stanley set is a substandard tool.  I am saying that the TEKTON set equals my old Stanley set.  So I have now replaced my Stanley set, where they will be used on less technical projects.  The TEKTON are a fine addition to my wood chisel tools.

That is great because stuff on the side and behind are a pain.  The USB charging amp will not get used all the time, but it is way cool that I could charge my phone if I needed to.  The alarm is plenty loud and the radio comes with a two foot long antenna for better reception.  Neat.  It even has a daylight savings switch on the back so when you switch between the daylight on/off savings, all you need to do is flip the switch in the back instead of any reset.

"As a Science Diet customer for over 15 years, I use them as the basis of my judgements.  My wife and I long ago went on a search for quality food for our cats.....and we have had great pets over these 35 years.  So as Science Diet as our main food, I started looking for food to trick our cats as a treat.  I want their treats to be the same quality as Science Diet.....i.e. tricking them into eating ""junk treats"" that are actually healthy.  It is a way to try out new foods to see if they like other quality foods.  My oldest cat didn't jump into this when I passed it out for a treat, but as the younger cat (who normal just hangs back until her old sister is done) jumped in to munch away, older sister decided it was just fine.  After that both ate normal amounts.  So our cats like it.  The ingredients are high quality.  What's not to like.

"If youre looking for a camping mat to accompany you on long hikes and week-long camping trips in the middle of nowhere, look no further. This mat weighs in at just 12.2 oz., which makes it one of the most lightweight options out there for individuals looking to go ultra-light. In addition to adding hardly any weight to your pack, this sleeping mat is also compact. The packaging this comes in claims the size is comparable to a soda can of some sort, which is only slightly accurate.  Needless to say, its bigger than a soda can, but really only by an inch or two either way. Its still incredibly tiny compared to every other sleeping pack I have carried.The diagram suggests you can blow this particular mat up in 5 breaths, but that is inaccurate. The body and head pillow need to be blow up separately and they take 6 breaths and 2 breaths respectively, equaling a total of 8 breaths to blow it up. I was giving large, full breaths when testing this item out. Now, this is only 3 extra breaths when compared to the manufacturers suggested amount, which in reality is only a couple extra seconds. No big deal.Now, my wife (59, 150 pounds), my daughter (59, 142 pounds) and I (510, 170 pounds) all tried this sleep pack out on tile floor once it was blown up. My wife and I are in our late fifties, our daughter in her mid-twenties, and we all thought it was pretty comfortable. We each laid on our backs and our sides. My wife has back problems and thought the body part was still comfortable, though she did complain about the pillow. My daughter and I both liked the pillow very much because it almost provides a pocket to cradle your head, and its awesome whether you are sleeping on your back or side. The bottom of the sleeping back has the holes filled in; my daughter suggested carry this design feature up the spine to provide a little bit more support and comfort, as her tailbone and hips fell in the cracks and were a bit uncomfortable. I didnt have an issue and thought it was comfortable. Keep in mind we didnt sleep in this throughout the night, only tested it for about 10-15 minutes each.Rolling this pack up to its compact state is pretty simple. I wasnt able to fit it perfectly back in the bag, but with practice Im sure I could. Overall, I like the pack and think it will be attractive to people looking to go ultra-light. I think you might sacrifice a little comfort in order for it to be compact and lightweight, but choose your battles. If youre looking for a lightweight, compact option that does provide some decent support, I would recommend this sleeping mat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ES5E11ZYTI2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GK4LUXQ#wasThisHelpful","R3ES5E11ZYTI2X","A3U52V5ZAHZZKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U52V5ZAHZZKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like to utilize technology and all it has to offer, but Im still old school and like having a physical planner to keep with me. This one is great for the minimalist who still wants paper copies of their day to day activities. In the beginning of the planner, there is a three year reference page that shows from 2014-2016 at a glance. Each month has its own tab, which makes it incredibly easy to flip between them. This particular one starts in July 2015 and goes to June 2016. At the beginning of each tab, there is a two page spread for the current month. Each date has 5-6 lines to write on (depending on if a holiday is typed in), which doesnt offer a whole lot of space if you have meeting and appointments that run all day to keep track of. However, I do like the fact that they have a countdown until the last day of the year and they also show how many days it has been since the start of the year.Each week is divided onto two pages: Monday-Thursday on the left-hand side, Friday-Sunday on the right. Each day has 16 lines to utilize. Six contact and six note pages are provided in the back of the planner. The final two pages are an event calendar, which is gridded and fairly small, and a list of holidays for the year.Overall, this is a great sized planner that would work for the minimalist. People who want to write more, or just have more to write, might do better with a larger size. I also like the fact that the planner is spiraled and flexible, which makes it incredibly easy to write in and deal with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28JHHQO3P407T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCDHYGS#wasThisHelpful","R28JHHQO3P407T","A3U52V5ZAHZZKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U52V5ZAHZZKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As I continue my journey thru my blessed life, I need to always learn new things.  Bill Blankschaen's new book, A Story Worth Telling, is about each of us thinking about what we are called to do in Christ, and then to do that.  It is an easy book to read as it does not slam you with a specific agenda.  It is structured to lead you through a series of exercises that may help you decide.  I don't think that any one book can be your answer to understanding the Bible, but then, neither does Mr. Blankschaen as he refers us to other great books that helped him.

The only thing special that you need to understand is how to release the blade to close it.

"OXO Good Grips GreenSaver Crisper Filter is a very neat product.  Even though we have a state of art refrigerator with all the bells and whistles, I was less than impressed with the quicker spoilage of leafy plants, root veggies like carrots, and squash and cucumbers.Since putting it neatly inside my crisper on the left wall of the crisper, I have found that the leafy plants are the biggest winners here.  I know it is helping with the carrots, too.  My wife and I eat the cucumbers and squash too fast for me to make a comment yet with them.  I will come back in a few months to update.So far, so good.

"A toolkit should have a multimeter in it.  This thing is very small, which is what it states.  So it would be easy to have it in a drawer instead of outside in the garage.  That will make is more useful for quick action.  In fact, I just tackled a problem with a light kit cord on one of my ceiling fans.  It was easy to use.  It does seem to be able to work with most issues.However, the thing I question is its ability to detect live wires/devices remotely.  I am kind of uber safe when it comes to electricity.  I was almost zapped back to the stone age 20 years ago with a faulty extension cord and a vacuum and some water....needless to say I trust nothing unless I am sure.

"I got this for my wife and she reviewed as follows:This is a serum, for night use.  On the bottle it is described as a ""nightly purifying micro-peel"".  I followed the directions - cleansed my face,  then smoothed on the PROx.  It says to use 2-4 drops - I used 4.  It felt sticky, so I went to read for a few minutes before turning in, thinking the product would either a) soak into my skin or b) dry.  It did neither.  I felt like it just ""sat"" on my face. (I've always thought a ""peel"" was a product that dried on your skin, then you peeled it off - pulling out the dirt/impurities on your skin with it.)  I finally went to bed after 20 minutes - hey, I was tired!  I woke up the next morning and the PROx still felt sticky on my face and there was a ""nice"" residue on my pillowcase.I tried the product again 2 days later, and this time only used 2 drops.  Better results, at least with the stickiness.  Not nearly as sticky and no residue on the pillowcase - my advise - use VERY sparingly!!!  Haven't seen much of a difference...yet, but then again, I've only used the product a few times.  The directions also advise you to use a sunscreen (SPF 15 or higher) after you cleanse your face in the morning. **Note - 2 weeks later - I'm still using the product, not every night, but 2-3 times a week.  Went for my massage yesterday, and they were offering a free facial analysis, so I stuck my head in the ""booth"".  She noted some dryness around my eyes, (duh!) some oiliness around my nose (again, duh!) but she said it looked like I had a low number of enlarged pores...hmmm maybe this stuff really does work!  I had this done a couple of years ago (just before a full facial) and my enlarged pore count was pretty high!So, I've edited this review from my original, which was pretty harsh, and I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt...end quoteI hope this helps someone","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LOMKVJQE1991/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKD6E4E#wasThisHelpful","R1LOMKVJQE1991","A3U52V5ZAHZZKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U52V5ZAHZZKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had one of these type of products during my pregnancy and it helped reduce my back pain a lot! I have arthritis in my spine and it was a great help in reducing the pain/muscle fatigue. I read about using abdominal binders post op after a hysterectomy and thought it might be helpful agin so I bought this one. I AM SOOO GLAD I DID!  My Dr had me in a much larger/wider cheaper version post op and it helped make getting into and out of bed much better/less painful and easier.  Eventually the one the Dr had me in got to uncomfortable though but I still needed that ""extra support"" feeling. This is where I began to use this one! It helped making sleeping on my side feel ""more secure"" along with my walking up and down the neighborhood and grocery store while I was recovering! It was a nice addition to make my recovery much more comfortable along with a 12 inch Wedge pillow that I bought here on Amazon too! Makes it easier to roll out of bed when your abs aren't quite ready to cooperate with lifting up out of bed. I wish I would have worn this binder post c-section and had the wedge pillow I now have because my life would have been much more comfortable post baby too! Live and learn from my mistakes.... If you are in your 20's it might not be that big of a necessity..

"From Conception to Aging this wedge can help with lots of life's Adventures! I was thrilled to find this at an excellent price on Amazon. Years ago I was hesitant to buy one for $100.00, but at this price point I gladly paid!  I bought this mainly for using post-op (hysterectomy) but I figured I could use it for my occasional heart-burn (hiatal hernia) break through also. It was a blessing to have post op and made it much easier to roll out of bed at home for those first couple of weeks when sleeping on my side or stomach wasn't an option yet. Very comfortable, great to read with and probably nice to use to watch TV in bed too (although I didn't do that). I also had the opportunity to use it for that breakthrough heat burn that would normally keep me up for a few hours. I was able to take a Rolaid and Pepcid and go right back to sleep with this wonderful incline! It's very comfortable but just high enough that sleeping on my side with it is a challenge unless I squirm towards the very bottom in the middle of the night. At times I just used a soft beaded neck roll pillow and at times I used my Standard size ""soft and squishy"" pillow for comfort on top of the wedge for my head.SMELLS: NONE HERE AFTER AIRING OUT AND I WAS BLESSED WITH THE MOST SENSITIVE NOSE I KNOW... I could smell my son's dirty diapers when he was in his bedroom and I was in the living room. Lots of watery eyes for me but no diaper rash here! LOL Makes me wonder if different warehouses have different smells.. ?POST-OP DREAM:  I wish I would of had this post C-Section, gallbladder and tonsillectomy (as an adult, horrible pain to lay flat). I even had eye surgery a week before I bought this and I'm sure it would have helped with the swelling more than just ice.  There were times I used my heating pad too in between the wedge and my back and it molded nicely enough to have heat applied in all places. I'm thinking based on logic and things I have heard from friends and family it would help with most head and neck surgeries to even chest/breast, shoulder and arm surgeries where swelling or lack of use of abdominal muscles might be a challenge. Could be helpful with knee surgery to but might need to add pillows to the declined side to help keep your feet elevated or buy a second wedge to make a square.. Sinus stuffiness... Sleep apnea, snoring.. Lots of applications...

"Best erasable pencils vs Crayola's version. You'll need an excellent handheld sharpener, like the BRASS BULLET (available on Amazon) before you can use this 24 count set though. It appears as though the 12 count set comes already sharpened based on the pictures shown. These laydown MUCH smoother than the Crayola version!  Granted they are more expensive but they feel and look so much better they are worth the $11.00 ish that I paid.  There is a reasonable range of colors with this 24 count set. It includes a White, Black, Gray and a Light Peach! The closest two colors in the set are the Vermillion and the Orange. They are strong enough to handle a really sharp tips and color in small spaces and yet smooth enough to lay the color down well.  From sketches to coloring they can handle the job! They are closest to the Prismacolor Verithin line but they erase better. I just wish more colors were offered in this line for my ""adult"" coloring books. I haven't tried the other brands available in the erasable version (but have tried the regular versions). This is a solid performer at a reasonable cost. These are made by Prismacolor like the Scholar line. The erasable Scholar line only comes available in a 12 count though. I'm just guessing but I bet they have a more ""powdery"" feel and less of a sharp tip than this line. Based on the feel of the regular Scholar line vs the Verithin which these feel closest to.Erasability: These erase better than then Verithin line as shown in the photo that has the Violet Blue Verithin erased vs the Col-Erase shown in the Blue, Purple and Black. The pink erasers work well on the pencil ends but I prefer to use the white ones made by Pentel or Staedtler. They don't ""eat away"" at the paper as much.Lay Down: Color is smooth! Smoother than the Crayola Erasables and feels better when using and sharpening. Nice sharp tips with the right sharpener!FYI: These Individual Colored Pencils are available at Dick Blick for less than $1.00.. Handy if you use a lot of a couple of colors.SHARPENERS: The Brass Bullet provides the sharpest tips but requires a trash can. The Prismacolor Premier is a great all around sharpener with less mess and offers the colored pencil hole that seems to provide a nice tip without eating up your colored pencils. The Faber-Castell in the triangular shape is great for the triangular shaped colored pencils out there and offers 4 holes to sharpen the variety of sizes but makes a little bit of a mess when the colored shavings from the tips falls out when you open it. I love all three for different reasons.. Tips for proper sharpening can be found on the Prismacolor website and Dick Blicks website.PRISMACOLOR TEMPLATE: GO TO THE PRISMACOLOR WEBSITE AND CLICK ON THEIR COLORED PENCIL INFORMATION (any type).  You will see a small banner about halfway down the page on the right with a green pencil that says ""Download Here"".. You should be able to click on that and then print your very own copy!

"These erase pretty well. They lay down a little different than the standard Crayola colored pencils. They seem a ""little more resistant to color"".... I had to go over the same areas a few times to get the template colored in the picture. The result was good, it just required a little more work to get them colored in. I erased the right side of the scribbles of the 3 colors on the notebook paper in the attached picture. As far as doing what is advertised they did a great job! If you like easy, dark laydown I think the Watercolor version of Crayola pencils are the BEST, even used dry.. I have a review of them with a picture included. I also included the regular Crayola pencils on the Watercolor review. When it comes to my adult coloring books I won't be using these. I'll stick to my non-erasable colored pencils.. Hope this helps...;)BEST ERASABLE/""NORMAL"" PRODUCT FOR COLOR CODING:  Try the Frixion erasable colored ink pens by Pilot. I prefer the ""Clicker"" version. They don't do well in the heat, but are great for the home or office. If they accidentally get exposed to the heat the ink turns invisible. Yikes! They can be ""brought  back"" to color by putting in a freezer. I don't recommend them to color with but are excellent in a planner for color coding etc.. The black is a little more on the grayish black look, but the colors are excellent! Pink, purple, turquoise, red, green, blue, navy and orange. Lots of choices!

"These have a Chisel Tip on them (unlike the typical broad line markers from Crayola) and a decent range of colors. There isn't a black marker though which I find a little odd since these are called ""Poster"" markers and the number one color most people would want to use is black. Most of the colors range more towards the classic colors except the pink is more of a hot pink. Here is a picture of the colors you get.

"Nice pencils for true artists! I'm not as excited to use dry on adult coloring books. They were a little more ""streaked in how they laid down dry on paper than some of my other pencils.

"These are quick and easy mini versions of the larger Dover Stained Glass coloring books. It says ""Dover Little Activity Books"" in the upper left hand corner on these mini 4x6 ish versions of their coloring books. Because of reading other reviews I understood how small they really are.. What I couldn't get a grasp of is what they meant by ""Stained Glass Effects."" The pictures are printed on a transparent paper (vellum?) with heavy black lines outlining the images, which is how you get the stained glass effect when hung up on a window. For the best effects you need to color both sides of the paper for the best effect.  Hope that helps clarify what this means to someone else. ;) I have added pictures and the instructions from within the front and back cover too. It lists all the flowers you get to color in this book. There are ONLY 8! You could argue that's times two if you want the stained glass effect since you have to color the backside of the page too.ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS: I purchased a larger horse stained glass coloring book from Dover and made a black and white plain copy to color/experiment with and it looks Great! So, if you have the desire to have a ""large"" 4x6 ish single flower template (perfect to cut out and put on a small card) to experiment shading techniques on this might be helpful if the thick black lines don't get in the way too much. You could possibly set your printer to a lighter setting to help or trace a copy using this as a guide to make your own template..you could even make a smaller one.  There can be more value here if you think about it... ;)I have included the black and white copy I made of my larger/normal sized Dover stained glass horse book so you can imagine how a black and white would turn out.

"I have this coloring book and the Supersize one with the Unicorn on the front. This one is thinner and has less pages. The biggest difference that's surprising are the variations of pictures to color between the two.

You can easily achieve a nice within the lines picture with crayons with the majority of the pictures in this book. If you purchase the ""Rainbow Majesty"" you will have a lot more detailed pictures and lots of pictures with girls that are quite stylish and will need to consider colored pencils to stay in the lines for the majority of the pages. The quality of the paper in both books is the same and extremely thin/old style (not maker quality).I reviewed ""Rainbow Majesty"" and attached a lot of pictures of it's pages if you want to see the difference.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMUM1XX7BSPQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1559931264#wasThisHelpful","RMUM1XX7BSPQL","A2TIP4NEY64PLK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TIP4NEY64PLK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this same looking set from eBay (based on packaging). The sets in the red box, with the bird are the water colors. These with the Knights on the front are colored pencils. My set is written in English though and says ""Made in Indonesia"" on the back of the box. I have some other sets by this same manufacturer and some are made in Brazil, another in Germany. The quality does seem a little different from each country/factory with the Polychromos from Germany being the best. This one says ""Classic Colored Pencils"" on the front and that the leads are 3.3 mm and specially ""SV"" bonded to prevent breakage. A few tips broke in shipping so I got the chance to try the sharpener out that came with this set. It worked fine, as far as putting a better tip on them. It stores in the base of the ""tray"" that slides out of the box a nice feature if you are on the go. They do not have names printed on them, just numbers. The pencils are octagonal shaped and don't roll. These tips are on the harder side of the spectrum when coloring and took quite a bit of pressure to get the lightest yellow, pink and gray to show up on my template. I am an adult that colors in adult coloring books and not drawing sketches by the way.Color Range: I really like the colors within this set.. Due to the varied range within the colors themselves. Each blue, green etc is distinct. This might be a disadvantage for blending multiple shades of 1 color, so keep that in mind (I am coloring and want contrast). This set reminds me a little of the Marco Raffine set of 48 in ""firmness, feel"" and numbering system.  There is not a very good light peach combo in this set vs the Marco Raffine, but this is one of the better/darker blacks I have seen than in most sets.Hardness: Based on a little experience coloring with Crayola colored pencils vs Crayola Watercolor pencils, and Faber Castell Art Grip colored pencils vs their Aquarelle/watercolor version.. The Watercolor versions seem to be a softer lead within their own brands, if that's what you prefer.. FYII have included some color templates from the other versions and brands for you to see the difference (labeled at the tops/bottoms of the columns) and you might have a better idea of what you are getting. There is a dramatic difference between the Crayola regular version and their Watercolor version for instance.

"Nice book but depends on your expectations. The ones I grew up with didn't have as many girls and were large simple, easy to color with crayon pictures. This book with the Unicorn has some easy pictures but a lot of the pictures have a lot more detail (and black ink) that will probably require colored pencils for those people who care to stay within the lines. ;) I'm guessing 50% of this book has pictures with girls in them to color. This is a bigger coloring book than the one I got from the dollar store as shown in the pictures. The one with the heart peace symbol on the front I got at Dollar Tree. The last two pictures are of it's cover and an example of it's style. The rest of the coloring pages are found within this book.  I unfortunately got this book with a crease that transfers through every page.. :(  Just a heads up on the differences so you have appropriate expectations.

"Ok, I have a rather large set of Prismacolors and a lot of the cheaper Faber-Castell etc. sets of colored pencils. These  ""stand out"" from the pack (keep in mind that I am coloring more than doing sketches etc) in regards to ""ease of use"". They are just really smooth and easy on my arthritic hands. They are a med round barrel, similar to a Bic Stick Pen.. With their color names on the side. They also cost more and seem to substantially cost more and more with each quantity increase in set size? So, if you want the most colors for your money and a really nice product, get the larger Prismacolor sets. There are videos online to have them sharpen better (might need to warm up the wax, if the lead is internally broken) etc.  but...in comparison..COMPARISON: I have applied this set of 36 Polychromos on a template that ironically has the Crayola Watercolor 24 count set and a Spectrum Brights Marker set. The Polychromos produce colors similar in saturation similar to the Spectrum marker set and even close to the Crayola Watercolor (these are much better than regular Crayola pencils in smoothness). Polychromos are just smoother in color ""lay-down"" and ""better"" in regards to pressure necessary to achieve that smooth rich consistency.  If you are not sure you want to invest the money in these, just order 1 -2 individual pencils from .. Blick, Amazon, an art supply store (haven't seen them sold that way at my local stores.. FYI) or where ever you can find them individually. I bought 2 from .. Blick and they were a reasonable cost but they just made me want more of them.. Maybe it's just me, but they seem much easier on my hands, but then again..might be that ""spreading butter"" factor. The cost online was so ""cheap"" you can probably come out ahead buying this set of 36 count and then individually purchasing additional colors you feel you need later on.. Just a thought.. If you are on the fence, I really recommend buying 1-2 individual pencils first and go from there. You can even buy a Prismacolor individually to compare (they are at my local art stores). You won't have any regrets that way..BUDGET: If budget is your primary concern, then buy a Watercolor Crayola set or a Faber-Castell set that's less expensive (skip the art grips and just buy the set with the Koala). You can always buy an individual Polychromos or Prismacolor and decide if the difference in cost is worth it to you. The Prismacolor Scholar is pretty nice for the price too (my set isn't complete, bought used, names are added where colors are missing though for the 60 ct set).  I have some other brands colored on the templates too. Each is labeled at the top and/or bottom of the columns.TIN BOX: It's surprisingly thin.. Not much taller than the pencils themselves. Opens and closes easily.

"I like these markers, I just wish they had a name on them too instead of just a number since a lot of the colors are really close (especially the pinks, two of the yellows, two of the greens and two tans.. the lower number is lighter).

"This sharpener has turned into my favorite for sharper tips on all my colored pencils! It doesn't chew into the wood when all you need is a sharper tip! Be sure to put the in the ""Colored Grip"" hole for best effect. Even though they are referring to their ""tri"" shaped pencils it works well for all shapes and sizes of colored pencils with it's three holes available. It's not a ""perfect"" avoid the trashcan sharpener due to the fact that it more frequently shapes just the tips and not the wood. This allows splinter size shavings of the colored tips to slightly fall out of the sharpener in the lid when you open it since there's really nothing like wooden shavings to help trap them in. So it's best that once you open it..leave it open to sharpen all pencils along the way without additional slivers wining up in loose in the top of the cap. It's not a lot of mess, but not mess free either. I have a couple of others that are more ""mess free"" but they tend to eat into the wood every time you sharpen not just shape up the tips.. I have also had challenges getting them to open up to empty at the trash. This one easily opens up for everyone from children to adults with arthritis to empty into the trash.If I was sharpening a lot of reg pencils that have a blunt end or a lot of new Verathins, I recommend the brass bullet with a trash can at your side. But if you need a little something to have on hand that's faithful at providing a nice (not over the top) point that won't break with the first application of color.. This is the one!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ULEBW5881BJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009WFNY2#wasThisHelpful","R3ULEBW5881BJR","A2TIP4NEY64PLK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TIP4NEY64PLK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought a set of these used from eBay since I have already spent a small fortune shopping for additional types and colors of pencils. I REALLY like these as far as value goes.. And I have the 132 ct set of Prismacolors. Granted, I am Not an artist and mainly an adult that is coloring those Dover etc. coloring books. I wondered what the colors might look like and have made a template of the ones I have (from my used set) and wrote in the ones I am missing at the tops of the pencils in similar categories to at least give you an idea of what you are getting for your money. I can't attest to the case, but I can tell you there are some nice boxes and zip up pencil cases out there to be had for the money you are saving. I tend to put my pencils I am currently working with in a tin pail or cup until I am ready to move on (so I don't accidentally grab the wrong one in a hurry anyway).FYI.. My set looked like it had been carried in a backpack to and from school quite a few times and I haven't had any problems with sharpening or broken tips etc. There is a you tube video telling you how to sharpen a Prismacolor pencil (without twisting back and forth) in the same direction and how if broken leads are a problem simply let the wax within ""warm up"" a little in the sun and you have a whole new intact pencil now! No breaking from within..I""ll include pictures of the 72 ct and the 132 ct Prismacolor sets too for comparison. There are 3 colors in the 72 ct set with checkmarks in front of them they are Not included in the 72 ct set. They were bought individually, but I didn't think to take a picture before I added them in.

"This is a handy set to grab and go with. I thought the colors would match the exact same name in the box sets... But most are just close matches.. FYI.. There isn't a darker/regular blue and two of the ""tannish"" Browns end up coloring pretty much identical even though the shades on the pencils are different.  The pencils snap snugly in the case and that reduces the noise when traveling or walking around vs having a bunch roll around in a pencil box.  I was hopping to be able to add a few colors loose in the case. It will hold up to 5 additional pencils on the bottom of one side of the case and 4 additional pencils on the other side. We have a Color Alive set and it will easily hold the 7 crayons from that set loose. In fact, it will hold around a total of 21 crayons if you don't mind them being loose and potentially spilling since you have to fill both sides to get that kind of room for storage.

"They color lays down pretty well, but inspite of coming with sharp tips they are too hard to get close to tight edges. The triangle shape makes it ackward to use next to the lines. It is sort of like using Jumbo Crayons to color with as an Adult. They say the 4mm core is an advantage regarding not breaking on the box and that's great for Preschoolers probably.. It even has it's own triangle shaped sharpener for the triangle pencils..that you can buy separately(I like it actually)..  Lol  I'm guessing these would work well for larger/kid size coloring spaces possibly and are nice in that they wouldn't roll off of a table. Some of the names of the colors are different than what I grew up hearing (you can tell they weren't made in the US) .. FYII prefer numerous brands of colored pencils due to the shape of the tip, even though some of Faber-Castell's colors are pretty..Take your pick.. Staedtler-Noris Club (no color names),  Crayola, Marco Raffine (no color names, just numbers), Prismacolor Premier & Verathin etc.. Here's a picture.. I just wish these were normal sized tips. I would really like them then, I bet.Update: I liked the colors so much I played with them some more.. And realize that the larger tips, 4mm, on this package is a large part of the issue. I also realized after closely looking that the tips came presharpened from the factory in more of a rectangle shape (like they were sharpened with a knife..in a way). So, I sharpened them with the triangle shaped sharpener that Faber Castell makes and their performance significantly improved in more spaces. I also bought the set with the koala bear on the box and they were more standard in the size of the lead. I took a picture of the lead differences along with one of the pictures I'm working on.. The colors can be quite bright with pressure. I left some areas with ""easy"" coloring so you can see the difference. When working with tighter spaces definitely buy the older version with the koala on the front!","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ILHGJZC4GSYZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008UWA0E6#wasThisHelpful","R1ILHGJZC4GSYZ","A2TIP4NEY64PLK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TIP4NEY64PLK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very pretty sparkles of silver dust! Here are the colors you get with this set... Copper star (looks like a pretty orange to me..), lime star, green star, rose star, blue star, golden star (looks more yellow to me..), sky star, marine star, 2-pink star, 2-red star, 2-purple star, 2-silver star. I wasn't sure if they were the same until I colored with them at the bottom, hence the two each for them. Based on my experience in coloring with these pens I highly recommend getting a label maker and naming them since the lids are clear & don't show the difference in colors. I grabbed the wrong green or blue sometimes when I was coloring with them. I kept having to color leaves on scratch paper to see what the colors were. Here is a picture of all the colors in a mass effect view (not a very pretty mix, but a nice representation of what they look like on a larger surface area and my ""scratch"" colored leaves.

"Here is what the 72 count set of colors looks like... Unfortunately, I didn't think of taking a picture before I bought 3 more pencils individually. The ones with the check marks in front of the set were the 3 additional ones that I bought. These are great for layering and shading. I bought a 36 count of the Prismacolor Verithins for darker lines. They work well together and each one has it's own purpose. I'm not an artist just an adult that has picked up coloring before bedtime to relax. I only wish that I would have bought one of the larger count sets since I am always looking for additional colors.If you are having challenges with sharpening them there is a you tube video about it and how you should always turn the pencil, not the sharpener, in the same continuous direction. Don't be wobbly or rotate back and fourth. There were even explanations on how many you should put into an electric sharpener and then manually sharpen one because they overheat and break the leads! Even to follow up a couple of colored pencils that have been sharpened with a graphite one to lubricate the gears again! Wow, I had NO Clue why electric sharpeners seemed to sometimes work and then not.. It makes perfect sense now! (Very important to know if you have an entire set that needs to be sharpened like the Verathins... )! There were also recommendations regarding pencils that have leads that seem to be broken within, warm them up in the sun a little bit before you sharpen.. You'll have a whole new solid lead from within on e the wax melts together.. Problem Solved!I've included a picture of the Verathins 36 count set and a 48 count set of Marco Raffine for anyone curious of the differences. There are pictures of the 50 count Prang set vs the 50 count Crayola set on the 50 count Prang review of mine. I provided a picture of the colors in the 132 count set in the last picture.

"This is a new adult coloring hobby for me, so I don't understand why they have named the title Ohuhu 48 ct when this is a 48 ct Marco Raffine set. Color lays down beautifully with this set and I have included pictures for you to see.  Unfortunately, they only have numbers and not color names. Be sure to NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THE NAMES ON THE PRISMACOLOR TEMPLATE! I just liked it and used it to compare colors on from my other sets. Only things to note (in my opinion) are that the black/#570 isn't as solid/dark as the other colors, #571/gold isn't that yellow or ""gold""/dark of a gold, but #572/silver is AWSOME for a colored pencil! The picture doesn't do the silver justice, it shimmers more like a metallic marker. I've included pictures of the Prismacolor Verathin set-36, my Crayola set-50, Prang set-50 and Prismacolor set-72 count (I separately bought an additional 3 with the check marks at the front) and the Prismacolor Scholar set (incomplete set since I bought it used from eBay).  As far as value (around $30) and range of colors I really like this set and the Scholar set. The lay-down with the Scholar set is less ""waxy"" than with this set (it feels like more of a powdery softer tip, very close to the Prismacolors Premiers) and tips on this set feel a little firmer. It seems as though you don't have to sharpen the Marco as frequently and they are great for the fine details in some of the adult coloring books. I have posted pictures and the different colored pencil set titles are written at the top of the lists. I hope this helps!If you like these..

"Having discovered Gillian Flynns writings with the enormous popularity of Gone Girl a few years ago, I have found myself working backwards through her previous literature.  As such, it has been interesting to see the progression of her work.  In Sharp Objects, the overall plot of the story may not be quite as compelling as her later, tighter efforts, but the characters are so incredibly complex and interesting that it is just as good of an experience.For a basic plot summary, Sharp Objects tells the story of Camille Preaker, a newspaper reporter sent to cover the murder of a teenage girl in her old Missouri hometown (which she fled from years ago after losing a sibling and becoming engaged in a cycle of physical abuse).  From that point, the story diverges into two narratives: 1. Camilles investigation of the murders; and 2. Camille getting re-acquainted with her old digs, including a mother who is borderline crazy, a step-sister she barely knows, and a number of old friends who remind her of what life is/was like in the oldhometown.  As the book progresses, those storylines converge to reveal a compelling and thought-provoking finale.Of all the three Flynn books so far (this one along with Gone Girl and Dark Places), the central, main storyline of this one is probably the weakest.  It isnt terrible or distracting, by any means, but while reading I had to keep reminding myself what exactly was going on and keeping everything straight.  There is a lot of meandering that goes in when examining that central kidnapping/investigative narrative.However, that meandering ends up producing perhaps the best characters of any Flynn book, and they are more than enough to make this a top-shelf (pardon the pun) read.  The inhabitants of Wind Gap, MO, are all a bit off, but off in a way that most people (at least those who came from small-town upbringings) can relate to.  A common theme throughout the Flynn novels has been the KC/MO small-town setting, and that definitely comes through in Sharp Objects.Thus, this novel would be a formidable achievement for any writer, which is why (as a debut) it makes Flynn look even more impressive.  The closest contemporary I can think of to Flynn right now is Stephen King (pretty high praisebut deserved!), in that both authors are able to create such incredibly engaging characters and write in a style that is down-to-earth without being stale/sparse.  When you are finished with Sharp Objects, the details of the central storyline may fade away a bit, but the characters will likely stick with you for a long, long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A3TAMAWLIODU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307341550#wasThisHelpful","R3A3TAMAWLIODU","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When judging a film based on a spectacularly popular novel, there are two things that I usually look for: 1. Does it stick to the compelling themes of the source material reasonably well?  I dont need word-for-word and I dont even mind little changes here and there, but it should be faithful to the themes that made the literature iconic.  2. Does it add something unique to the equation?  Print literature and film are too entirely different beasts to tame (just ask Stephen King about that!), and one doesnt necessarily (or even usually) translate well into the other.  In essence, you cant justexpect a movie to be successful because the book was likewise.  The film-makers need to make sure the translation is fit for the big screen.On both of those counts, To Kill A Mockingbird receives a solid A grade.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on a number of events transpiring in the small community of Maycomb, GA during the 1930s.  Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), a lawyer, is called upon to defend a Negro man, Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) over allegations of rape from white woman Mayella Ewell (Collin Wilcox) and her father (James Anderson).  While this race-fueled trial grips Maycomb, the children of Atticus have their own coming-of-age adventures.  Jean-Louise, or Scout (Mary Badham) and Jem (Phillip Alford) make a new friend in out-of-towner Dill (John Megna), obsess over the neighborhood legend of Arthur Boo Radley, and try (as best they can) to come to terms with their fathers work.In terms of capturing the iconic themes of the novel, this film is able to accomplish that heady task, of which much credit can be given to director Robert Mulligan.  In terms of getting the gist of the story, I could recommend either the book OR the novel (though I would highly recommended both!) and feel confident the message would come across in either format.  It is also a film that can be enjoyed by children and adults in equal measure.  Children will feel akin to young Scout, while adults will be taken in by the solemn themes interspersed with recollections of more innocent (or were they) and youthful days.What makes To Kill A Mockingbird truly special, though, is that Pecks Atticus Finch is easily one of the most iconic film characters of all time.  I cant imagine reading the novel now and not picturing him as Atticus.  Hes the father figure of all big-screen father figures.  While Atticus was a powerfully-written character even in the novel, one could argue that Peck even transcends that literature and brings more depth to the character.  The courtroom scenes featuring Atticus in this movie are truly riveting no matter how many times you see them.Thus, I have to consider To Kill A Mockingbird to be one of my favorite all-time films.  Even having seen it and read the book a number of times, it can still bring a tear to my eye and stir some pretty deep emotions.  Both film and book complement each other perfectly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIHJKLY0EM7GT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006FE83UE#wasThisHelpful","RIHJKLY0EM7GT","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 2006, ""Casino Royale"" changed the game in James Bond movies, as it was the perfect combination of great story, cool action, and even relevant character development (something a bit new to the Bond franchise).  Unfortunately, that wonderful effort was followed by two clunkers, ""Quantum of Solace"" & ""Skyfall"".  ""Spectre"" pretty much splits the difference between the Craig original and the other two sequels, producing a thoroughly mediocre film.For a basic plot summary, ""Spectre"" sees Bond (Daniel Craig) on the outs with M (Ralph Fiennes), as the 00-program is being phased out of British intelligence.  As usual, Bond gets sucked into a scandal involving a shadowy figure (played by Christoph Walz) that seems to be behind the dastardly events of all three previous films via an organization called SPECTRE.  With the help of Q (Ben Whishaw) and Moneypenny (Naomie Harris), Bond does some reconnaissance of his own, along the way meeting up with Dr. Swann (Lea Seydoux), who has a personal connection to SPECTRE as well.The main selling point of ""Spectre"" is that, like ""Casino Royale"", it works pretty well as a prequel...at least for those who have seen the previously Connery/Moore flicks.  I have seen them all, so (without spoiling them) I can say that there are a number of iconic moments here.  The film also hits all the usual Bond cues and does them pretty well.Unfortunately, ""Spectre"" is also a film riddled with problems, such as...-Though SPECTRE and its history may be able to hold my attention, it likely will not do so for more modern fans who haven't ""done their homework"".  I was watching the film with a sibling who has only seen the Brosnan/Craig Bonds, and he was pretty much disinterested from beginning to end.  Thus, it works as a prequel...but only to an audience that is probably getting narrower as time goes by (seeing how those old Bond flicks don't really hold up all that well).-It should have been combined with ""Solace"" and ""Skyfall"" into one super-movie, where all those plots could have been examined in one whiz-bang type of film.  Unfortunately, production decisions have only drawn out these recent Bonds instead of made them tighter.  It's almost like after the disaster of ""Solace"", they tried to go back to formula with ""Skyfall"".  Of course, then fans said ""but aren't these supposed to be prequels?"", so it was back to prequel-land for this one.-The whole concept of ""Bond girls"", which the franchise now doesn't know what to do with.  Nowdays, you can't get away with Bond saving the girl and then, well, you know.  That doesn't fly anymore.  I'm not saying its good or bad, but I just think the Bond franchise may need to re-evaluate how they use their heroines.  Right now, they are trying to have it both ways...adding a beautiful female, but then not really knowing what to do with her.  Besides her looks, Swann's character added little to ""Spectre"", and thus her in a ""sidekick to Bond"" role felt strange.All in all, then, I thought that this was a decidedly average Bond effort.  As a fan who has seen all the previous installments, it was fun to see the history behind the crime organization most prevalent in them.  As stated above, however, I wish that the franchise hadn't drawn out the character so far from his ""Casino Royale"" days.  Had they been able to use Bond's love for Vesper and rage at her death (from ""Solace""), his roots (from ""Skyfall""), and his discovery of SPECTRE in one single film, it would have been great.  Instead, for probably a number of different reasons (chiefly, we ""can't give Bond too much character development"", right, lest we completely drain the idea well?), that character development was spread over three average (or below) movies.Bottom line: If you are a fan of Bond's history in the older films, ""Spectre"" will at least entertain you (although I can't promise much more).  However, if you only know Bond from ""Goldeneye"" on (and I think that comprises a large number of Bond-goers these days), this will be run-of-the-mill at best and confusing/uninspiring at worst.  In this case, it's all about what previous knowledge you bring into the theater with you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A47CFK0JG6ZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017HYSN0A#wasThisHelpful","R2A47CFK0JG6ZJ","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The combination of director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks is almost certain to produce a quality product at the cinema.  That's exactly what happens (again) with ""Bridge of Spies"".  It probably won't be your favorite effort from either of those two film luminaries, but it is instead a quite, brooding tale about life and espionage during the Cold War.For a basic plot summary, ""Bridge of Spies"" tells the adapted-from-true-events story of James B. Donovan (Hanks), an insurance lawyer tapped to defend one of the most hated men in America, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), who is convicted of spying in our homeland for the Soviet Union.  Donovan first fights for Abel's rights (when no one else will seem to, even in full breach of the law), then is sent to Russia in order to facilitate an espionage-laden exchange mission.The area in which ""Bridge of Spies"" works best is when it can relate the themes of the Cold War to everyday life, showing that the events around the world may change over time, but people's reactions to them are usually more predictable.  The overwhelmingly negative and hateful response to Abel's more presence in the country is startlingly familiar to the country's response to people of Islamic faith after 9/11.  Seemingly all rule of law (and even some of decency) was thrown out the window in favor of ""patriotic justice"".  Early in the film, there is also a poignant angle dealing with how children are reacting to Cold War tensions.  At school, they are taught to ""duck and cover"" in case of an Atomic explosion (right after reciting the pledge of allegiance, of course), and at home Donovan's children are all very conflicted about how he could possibly defend the ""Commie traitor"".Bolstering those themes is the expected brilliance from Hanks in the leading role.  Here, he is very much akin to, say, Atticus Finch in ""To Kill A Mockingbird"", or the typical Jimmy Stewart ""defend peace and law at all costs"" type role.  In a world turned upside-down with misinformation about the Communists and hatred about something that isn't probably understood, Hanks's Donovan is able to keep a level head and pursue the tasks that really seem to make a difference, such as diplomacy and preserving the rule of law.The only reason ""Bridge of Spies"" probably isn't even better is that the ""espionage stuff"" over in Russia, while still rather entertaining in general, isn't the highlight of this film.  The themes in the first half or so of the movie, feating Donovan's interactions with his family and the Abel case, just work on a deeper level.  It still turns out to be a pretty emotional and satisfying ending, but the time spent in Russia is where things tend to get a little formulaic or draggy.  Again, nothing terrible, but enough for me to drop this to four stars instead of an all-out five.Overall, I enjoyed the deep themes and powerful messages of ""Bridge of Spies"", as well as the notable acting performances given.  It is a movie that can really be enjoyed by anyone teenaged years and up, as it touches on so many distinct avenues to get its message across.  That Cold War era is one that often doesn't get its ""fair shake"" in history books or curriculums, so it is nice to see Spielberg bring it to the masses.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QF3AFKHC6V03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015HM32X2#wasThisHelpful","R2QF3AFKHC6V03","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A number of years ago, I watched ""The Social Network"" and was completely transfixed.  I loved how that movie was able to tell a specific story (the origins of Facebook) and also serve as an excellent character study.  When I heard that the same screenwriter (Aaron Sorkin) that did ""Social Network"" was on this project, I was obviously intrigued.  The result is a movie just as good at examining real life events through the prism of drama and time (or hindsight).  Perhaps even better, in certain ways, as it had less historical material to focus on and thus was truly about the man at its center.For a basic plot summary, ""Steve Jobs"" tells the story of its title character (played by Michale Fassbender) through three different product launches at three distinct times in his life.  In each instance, Jobs verbally spars with personal assistant Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) and must deal with a family situation involving a child who he doesn't want to accept is his (Makenzie Moss, Ripley Sobo, & Perla Haney-Jardine) and an estranged wife (Katherine Waterston) who wants little to do with him but is sure glad to accept his bank deposits.  Also explored are Jobs' relationships with fellow tech gurus such as Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogan), John Sculley (Jeff Daniels), and Andy Hertzfield (Michael Stuhlbarg).As we all know, the real-life Steve Jobs was a very complicated, unique, and even polarizing figure (the guy once got kicked out of his own company, for crying out loud!).  There is no doubt that he was quite a revolutionary thinker...yet pretty much everyone who worked for the man intimates that he was a class-A jerk with a slave-driver mentality.  That is the main focus of this film, and it provides some of the movie's best moments.  The film-makers really tackle the question of ""did Jobs have to be such a jerk in order to do what he did?"".  That is fascinating discussion topic, and one that Sorkin and director Danny Boyle cut to the heart of with ""Steve Jobs"".This is very much a ""talking film"", so if you are looking for a lot of action, you might have to temper expectations.  To be honest, this is almost a completely dialogue-driven film.  Fortunately, Sorkin has mastered the art of dialogue and uses it to full advantage here.  There isn't a wasted scene, with every conversation a chance to dig a little deeper into the heart of Jobs the business man, Jobs the family man, and Jobs the individual.  Though difficult to do right (as dialogue-heavy films can be disasters if not handled with a sense of energy), I'm a huge fan of this style of film-making.  I know that ""show, not tell"" is usually the mantra of Hollywood, but when dealing with personalities I think that can be deviated from a bit.To pull off all that dialogue, there needs to be great actors up on the screen, and ""Steve Jobs"" has that all-around.  Fassbender is entrancing as Jobs, while the entire supporting cast is also excellent.  Especially on-point is Rogen as Wozniak.  His scenes with Fassbender are probably the best of the entire film, cutting to the heart of who Jobs was as an individual.This movie opened to bad press and made little money (at least initially), and I think I know why: you can't go in expecting a cradle-to-grave biography.  That's not what this movie sets out to do.  It is a character study, plain and simple, just like ""The Social Network"" was really as much a character study of Mark Zuckerberg as it was a ""movie about Facebook"".  ""Steve Jobs"" leans even more in that direction, as there is no ""one specific event"" that it can lean on.  Instead, each behind-the-scenes of the product launch is intended to give glimpses into how Jobs handles different portions of his life in order to get to know him better.  Obviously, some of the key details are filled in through monologues and flashbacks, but this is by now means anywhere near a comprehensive biography.  That wasn't the point.Overall, I consider ""Steve Jobs"" to be one of the most thought-provoking films I've seen at the cinema in quite some time.  It can play to the nostalgia of Apple users, tech nostalgia in general, and tell a complex personality tale about one of the great technology icons of all-time.  The themes espoused in the film will be kicking around in your noggin long after the lights cycle up and the credits roll.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVZU9YQW0QV76/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0168UF2PS#wasThisHelpful","RVZU9YQW0QV76","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a huge fan of ""Smallville"" and everything Superman, I was obviously intrigued by this show.  However, I was worried that it was going to be little more than a ""girl power"" show and be rather vapid.  Unfortunately, that is exactly what happen.  It only took me two episodes to determine this will not continue to be on my DVR schedule each week.For a basic plot summary, ""Supergirl"" tells the story of Kara Danvers (Melissa Benoist), a Kryptonian sent to Earth just after her super-powered cousin.  Kara ends up in National City, where she doesn't choose to cultivate her super-abilities and instead works as basically a gopher for media mogul Cat Grant (Calista Flockhart).  Finally fed up with being pushed-around, Kara decides to don the infamous read and blue skirt/cape and begin her superhero existence.  She is helped in this task by James (not Jimmy) Olsen (Mehcad Brooks) and sister Alex (Chyler Leigh).There are three specific reasons why ""Supergirl"" is doomed to fail:1. The ""girl power"" theme will get CBS a lot of nice press, but it can't carry a show.  Developed characters and interesting plots carry shows, and ""Supergirl"" has neither.  Through two episodes, there seems to be no compelling core to the show, and the acting (besides Benoist) is terrible Flockhart and David Harewood (who had a great turn on Homeland a few years ago) must be embarrassed to be put into their strange roles.2. Every celluloid iteration of Supergirl has failed because she is a ""second fiddle"" character to Superman.  There is very little original about her story.  She has the same character arc and powers as her super-cousin, and he is always first, so to speak.  The Supergirl movie failed after the Christopher Reeve Superman films, and this show will fail because ""Smallville"" was just so much better.  This has nothing new or interesting to offer.3. Finally, CBS is a procedural machine right now (besides ""Person of Interest"", and even that show had to ""trick"" the network into believing in it).  The ""eye"" network could care less about taking chances on long-term or interesting-concept shows.  Instead, everything must fit into their slick, technology-heavily, flashy-looking formula.  That's exactly what ""Supergirl"" is too: shallow plot, hollow characters, all with a veneer of slickness that will quickly wear off.Simply put, I'm disappointed that CBS is taking such a generic, short-sighted approach to this property, but I wonder if this was doomed to failure from the beginning.  There just isn't enough ""oomph"" in the Supergirl storyline to sustain any sort of storytelling convention...serialized, procedural, or what have you.  This will be one of those shows that gets a lot of buzz...and then is quietly cancelled after its initial 13 episode order.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWK2DC5Y0X9TI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0155ON2WI#wasThisHelpful","RWK2DC5Y0X9TI","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Knock Knock"" isn't a great movie.  It isn't even a good movie.  However, perhaps the most disappointing thing about this entire experience is that it is filled with enough interesting themes that it truly could have been great if given the chance.For a basic plot summary, ""Knock Knock"" tells the story of husband and father Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves).  Evan is married to beautiful wife Karen (Ignacia Allamand) and has two wonderful children (played by Dan Bailey and Megan Bailey).  One weekend, Mom and the kids head to the beach house in order to leave Dad to his architecture work.  Just as he is getting into it, however, there is a knock at the door.  Standing outside in the rain are two of the most beautiful young women (girls?) one could ever see--Genesis (Lorenza Izza) & Bel (Ana de Armas).  At first, they seem like two innocent friends needing a bit of help on a stormy night.  What Evan slowly begins to discover, however, is that the pair isn't nearly as innocent as they seem.The obvious problem with this movie is that director Eli Roth either doesn't know how to make a serious movie, or doesn't care to partake in that particular activity.  I was not familiar with him before this film, but a quick check of his previous works turns up almost exclusively this kind of dark, grisly fare.  So, this movie was going to be done in a certain style (half shock, half parody) with him at the helm.Sadly, this film had so much more to offer had it been taken seriously.  I don't care if you are a male or a female watching (although I think it will have a bigger effect on males), there are times during this viewing experience where you will be thinking about issues of morality and infidelity.  What??!! In a horror movie?!  Yep.  That is why ""Knock Knock"" can legitimately be intriguing at times.  It really plays off the red-blooded male fantasy scenario of ""two young hot chicks"" in an environment where ""no one would find out"" in terms of promiscuity.  Those themes may be uncomfortable to many viewers, but they are real and true for most people, and thus great fodder for the big screen.  It's just that director Roth uses those themes only to turn the rest of the movie into a farce.It also doesn't help that Reeves doesn't quite seem like the right leading man for this role.  Nothing against Keanu personally, but I wish that a different choice would have been made.  Maybe a guy who would really make me believe that he both loved his family AND could get sucked into a one-night-stand sexual encounter.  Reeves couldn't pull that off here.  His two female co-stars are very convincing (not to mention incredibly sexy, which in a movie like this is also important to the storyline, not strictly eye candy), and are great at reveling in their craziness.  I just wish (minor spoiler alert!) that they weren't written as ""pathologically crazy"" and rather would have had a more serious tone to work with.So, to me ""Knock Knock"" is first and foremost a wasted opportunity.  It has the ghost of some great themes, but due to direction/style it never really explores those areas to the fullest.  Instead, it almost makes a mockery of them instead, using shock value instead of real emotions to get the point across.  I'd give this film 2.5 stars as an exact rating, but it was just too disappointing to give it anything more.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRBVWRDOA0GCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016IP3GM4#wasThisHelpful","RRBVWRDOA0GCY","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is no doubt that author Steve Turner did an incredible amount of meticulous research for this project.  That cannot be denied and he must be given a great deal of credit for that endeavor.  However, the trouble with this book is that readers want to read about the band members and their experiences directly relating to the Titanic voyage...and there just isn't enough surviving research to tell that kind of in-depth story.As such, Turner pads the narrative with in-depth research about the families of the deceased and their lives before/after the disaster.  While the research is exemplary, it doesn't address the ""why should I care?"" question at the core of every research-based titles.  Hard-core historians of the Titanic disaster will love this stuff, but more amateur historians (like myself) will find it a bit dry and off the target.So, when it comes down to it, there really just isn't enough material (no more than about 50 pages of the book) dealing with the musicians' time preparing for or on the Titanic.  I can't fault the author for that, as there is only so much he can unearth on an event now over 100 years old.  But, it doesn't change the fact that most of this book is filled with descriptions of events having nothing to do with the Titanic disaster.  In essence, it is 85% backstory and prequel.Thus, as long as you know and accept what you are getting into, you might get more out of this book than I did.  I picked it up because I've always been a bit fascinated (as a musician myself) of this occurrence and so it really peaked my interest.  Unfortunately, there just isn't enough ""meaty"" material to sustain the core narrative for all that long.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VN4PXSX7F85T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Q7CMLI#wasThisHelpful","R1VN4PXSX7F85T","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For readers who like action, adventure, and edge-of-your-seat cliffhangers, Listen To The Moon might not be the novel to pick up.  For those who prefer a bit more of a slow, contemplative read that simmers to an emotionally-packed conclusion, you will struggle to put this one down.For a basic plot summary, Listen To The Moon (set during the early stages of World War I) tells two narratives side by side that move towards each other and finally converge in the end.1. Young Alfie and his family live in the Sicilian islands off the coast of England, where fishing is the primary way of life.  On a fishing expedition one day, Alfie and his father stumble upon a girl (basically on deaths doorstep) on an uninhabited island and take her in.  She cannot speak (only able to croak out Lucy) and struggles to piece together her previous existence.  The only clues to her past are a blanket with German writing on it and a raggedy teddy bear2. Young Merry and her mother live in New York City and wait for the father of the husband to come back from war.  When they receive the news that he is injured and in an overseas hospital, they decided to pay him a visit.  This requires a trip across the ocean on a very large luxury liner...but the trip may not turn out quite as pleasant or routine as they suspect.I wish I could say more about the plot of the novel, but to do so would be to rob you of some great moments.  Suffice it to say that both of those narratives slowly converge as the book proceeds, and by the end you will understand how the pieces fit together.There are two primary reasons why Listen To The Moon is so successful in telling its story:First, there is the mystery aspect of the tale, mainly dealing with Lucy and her past.  To be honest, sophisticated readers will likely figure it out relatively soon (although even those readers wont be 100% sure of the outcome until the final pagesauthor Michael Morpurgo is too savvy of an author to let it get too predictable), but younger readers will be able to savor the mystery until the very end.Secondly, the novel delves headlong into a number of wartime societal themes, most of which centers on anti-German sentiment from those in England.  While those exact sentiments are unique to the time/place, the emotions/actions of those interlocked in war are universal.  They can (and are) still felt today in regards to, say, Muslims and the war on terror.I would say that Listen To The Moon is probably the best YA novel Ive read this year, but that statement wouldnt be 100% truemainly because it is tough for me to call this specifically YA in genre!  Because of the youthful characters and based on the press/cover Im sure it will be marketed to the younger set, but I know plenty of adults I could give this book to and they would enjoy it just as thoroughly as any teen would or could.  As Ive said previously, the narrative works on a number of different levels depending on your age and what you may be looking for in the story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFYMYV6L8RJH8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250042046#wasThisHelpful","RFYMYV6L8RJH8","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Movies like this are not ones that I usually go for.  Horror flicks are a dime a dozen these days, and it's tough to weed the good ones out of the murky mess, a task not usually worthy of my time.  This year, though, I kept seeing ""Trick 'r Treat"" pop up on ""must watch"" list for scary Halloween flicks.  It finally sucked me in because I was intrigued by the promise of some overlapping narratives.  It seemed like an interesting way to tell some scary stories.What I found, however, was that ""Trick 'r Treat"" is a lame excuse of a ""horror flick"", offering nothing new to the genre and completely underwhelming in what it did bring to the table.  Besides a couple of ""jump scares"", it almost put me to sleep.The promise of overlapping narratives?  Technically, it did do such a thing, but in no meaningful way.  I kept hoping for the narratives to all come together in the end, but nothing of the sort happens.  It just kind of descends into a mess, with even the one ""big reveal"" coming so late and anticlimactically as to be almost laughable.Anything resemble real suspense?  Nope...not here.  Besides maybe two scares that will get you to jump, everything else is rather predictable or old hat.The promise of some fun moments?  It looks like that might happen in the first few minutes, but even that quickly dies.  A couple looks to have fun, a group of hot chicks go out on the town...and then everything fizzles.  Basically, this movie can't even decide on a mood from one scene to the next.I'm glad this movie was only 82 minutes, as I likely would not have been able to stomach much more of its brand of ""horror"".  I knew about 20 minutes in that it was taking a turn for the worse, and it only kept down that road...never recovering.  Why this keeps showing up as a Halloween classic?  I haven't the foggiest.  Maybe because it is one of the few horror films actually set on Halloween night?  That's all I can think of.  The film itself offers practically no merits beside that setting.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38LF2557L95HL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002LMSWN2#wasThisHelpful","R38LF2557L95HL","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Though I don't much consider myself a ""gamer"" anymore, I will always have a soft spot for the Zelda series, as I consider ""Ocarina of Time"" to be perhaps the greatest adventure game I've ever played.  In recent years, I have tried playing through ""Majora's Mask"" (too difficult) and ""Wind Waker"" (the cartoonish animation never quite suited me) and came up disappointed both times.  After always kind of knowing that ""Twilight Princess"" was compared favorable to Ocarina, I decide to final give it a try on my old Gamecube.First off, I have to say that I have not completed the game (and may not ever).  My interests have shifted away from the video-game playing of my youth and I no longer seem to have the patience for long adventure games anymore.  So, this review will be more about the ""feeling"" of the experience rather than the actual nuts and bolts of the game itself.That being said, I still wanted to comment on the quality of the game, as I could automatically tell that it was more kin to ""Ocarina"" than the previous two before it.  The gameplay is basically the same (except now you get the horse right from the get-go!) and I could see similar themes between the two.  ""Twilight Princess"" is set up as an epic adventure like ""Ocarina"", not a race against the clock (""Majora"") or a swashbuckling cartoon (""Waker"").I couldn't give this game the full five stars, however, because it still didn't ""fit like a glove"" like Ocarina still does.  Call me an old curmudgeon or awash in nostalgia if you will (and both of those things are probably true!), but even to this day I can still take out ""Ocarina"" from time to time and it seems like I can completely get swept away in it each time.  I didn't have that ""complete buy-in"" with ""Twilight Princess"".  Was that more because of my own personal biases...or was it that ""Ocarina"" is still the gold standard?  I'm not sure.  Either way, that doubt was even to drop it to four stars instead of a sparkling five.Bottom line of what you need to know if you are considering giving this game a try: It plays more like ""Ocarina"" than any other game in the series to that point.  If you were disappointed with the frantic pace of ""Majora's Mask"" or the cartoon-y nature of ""Wind Waker"", this game will ""feel like Zelda"" for you right away.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NX168VHSRV3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009UBR3A#wasThisHelpful","R3NX168VHSRV3H","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All Allan Say ever wanted to do was draw cartoons.  Because of his nationality (Japanese) and the times in which he lived (post-WWII), however, Allan had to overcome some serious obstacles in pursuit of that dream.  The Inkers Shadow is a graphic novel that tells the story of a young Say and how he persevered in spite of the many twists and turns his life took as a young man.For a basic plot summary, this graphic novel begins with Says father (a wealthy business man) sending him to an American military school for his education.  In the often anti-Japanese post-WWII climate, however, Allan is mocked and relegated to tasks and a lifestyle that he does not enjoy.  Inspired by his comic book alter-ego from his cartoon-ing days in Japan, Allan decides to leave the military institution and strike out on his own.  He ends up in California, where (through his own drive and the kindness of others) he enrolls in more schooling and finds some mentors in the comic/art business.The story of Allan Say is one that epitomizes the phrase the truth is stranger than fiction.  A Hollywood script-writer could not craft a tale with as many twist and turns, or as much inspirational material, as that of Say.  Whether you are a child reading the book or an adult, those themes are obvious and shine through on every page.  Multiple times in his life, Say had no one to lean on and not more than a few dollars in his pocket, yet he still managed to become a renowned illustrator and novelist.  Thus, the primary reason this graphic novel succeeds is that it tells such an engaging, important tale.The art in the novel is also very interesting and well-done.  Im no artist by a long shot, so I cant give any critiques on the forms used, but I will say that I liked how many different styles were used to represent Says journey.  Some are full color, others are black-and-white sketches, while still others are in full cartoon-strip form.  Even some charcoal-looking drawings are used.  What this does is make every page a visual treat, as there is definitely no getting bored while paging through this graphic novel.  Each time you flip to the next page, some new layout is waiting for you!Overall, I enjoyed both the visual experience and the message behind Inkers Shadow.  The graphic format will likely guide it towards school libraries or public library YA sections, where it should succeed equally.  Even adults who pick up the book, though, can appreciate both the artwork and the inspirational themes behind its main subject Allen Say.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11H3M1T3UJA1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545437768#wasThisHelpful","R11H3M1T3UJA1I","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Created by Damon Lindelof of ""LOST"" fame, ""The Leftovers"" is the type of show that sets its sights very high...and generally hits the mark.  A compelling mystery is at it's core, but the real hallmark of the show is the writing and crafting behind the characters (both reminiscent of LOST, too).  Though the show may lose a few viewers with a number of disjointed episodes in the early goings, those who stick around and wait for the payoff will be richly rewarded for their patience.For a basic plot summary, ""The Leftovers"" picks up three years after a momentous event: 2% of the world's population has suddenly vanished with no apparent explanation.  As the show begins, it focuses on Sheriff Kevin Garvey (Justin Theroux) and teenage daughter Jill (Margaret Qually), who are trying to make the best of things after wife/mother Laurie (Amy Brenneman) leaves.  Laurie wasn't one of the departed, however...she joins a cult-like group called the G.R. (or Guilty Remnant), led by Patti (Ann Dowd), that makes life generally miserable for the town inhabitants by refusing to allow them to move on with their lives.  In a separate storyline, a mysterious man named Wayne (Paterson Joseph) is seemingly able to cure people of their inherent sadness with a simple embrace...a helpful skill in a world that still hasn't moved on from the 2% disappearing.Other key characters in the show include...-Preacher Matt Jamison (Christopher Eccleston), who also lost something very important to him and is trying to figure out what to believe and where he stands.-Nora Durst (Carrie Coon), a woman who lost her entire family and is really struggling to cope.-Meg Abbott (Liv Tyler), a lady new to town who shows viewers the inside workings of the G.R.Did you follow all of that?!  Like I said, ""The Leftovers"" is a very ambitious project.  All of these plotlines/characters are thrown at you in the first 4-5 episodes, and to be honest it can be a bit overwhelming at times.  After five episodes, I found myself wondering ""what is going on and why do I care?"".  Luckily, from that point on Lindelof focuses on a character an episode and things really start to tighten up, producing some of the best drama I've seen in a TV show in quite some time.  You just have to have some patience and be able to trust that things are indeed going to start making sense.I hate to continue the LOST comparisons, as the shows are just as much different as alike, but one more is apt: Remember those early episodes of LOST when the backstories of the characters were revealed and it felt like you were really getting to know them?  That is what the six really good episodes in this season (#3, #'s 6-10) remind me of.  Really, the only difference is that while in LOST they started fleshing out the characters right after the Pilot, in ""Leftovers"" they take 3-4 episodes to get their feet wet.  Again, patience.Overall, though, I very much enjoyed this show for both its mystery components and the great cast of interesting characters.  I can't give it the full five starts because a few too many episodes (in a season of only 10) failed to truly hook me, but on the whole I become invested in pretty much everything by the time the curtain came down.  This is a show that will appeal to a certain type of viewer in that it isn't going to enthrall anyone with over-the-top action, witty one-liners, or other whizz-bang things of that nature.  This is a mystery/drama through and through, though of the highest order.  As I've stressed multiple times in this review, a little patience WILL be needed, I think, by even those (like myself) who really want to give the show a chance.  Once you let it play out, however, you'll find that it will have you watching multiple episodes in a sitting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SH7PJIYSS2KT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZCHTY8A#wasThisHelpful","R2SH7PJIYSS2KT","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I began reading this graphic novel, I was at the disadvantage of having read neither the popular Golden Compass novel nor seen its big screen film adaptation.  I truly knew nothing of the story coming into the experience.  What that did allow me to do, however, was evaluate this graphic novel strictly on its own merits (not comparing it to anything else).  What I found is that it lacked a lot of the context needed to understand the complex plot/characters.For a basic plot summary, this is the story of Lyra, a pre-teen girl who happens to stumble into an intrigue plot involving her adventuring uncle in the North, a teacher who seems to be preparing her for a journey to that land, and mysterious creatures such as Gobblers & Dust, which seem to strike fear into the hearts of all those around her.  Lyra is also given a strange, four-handed, gold compass-type device that she tries to decipher with little luckat least so far.The reason I cant give this graphic adaptation even a passable grade is because I really feel it is terribly lacking in context.  I know that this is a story filled with some heady, adult themes as it is, so the buy in for YA readers might be a tad higher than normal anyway.  Even as an adult reader, though, I felt very confused as plot elements & characters are introduced and given very little explanation.  It wasnt until I did some research on the plot of the original novel/movie that I began to understand just what the heck was going on.A concrete example of this lack of context is how the story is supposed to be set in an alternate universe allowing for the fantastic creatures/devices/events that its story eventually brings forth.  However, from reading this adaptation, one would never know this.  There are other plot points (such as an early assassination attempt and a young friend of Lyras who disappears with no explanation) that left me feeling the same wayI only understood them after getting more information elsewhere.As such, I think that this graphic adaptation of The Golden Compass is much more suited to those who have already read the novel or seen the film.  If (like me) you havent done either of those things, it might just end up as a bit of a mess.Also, readers should be aware that this graphic novel only covers roughly the first third of the Golden Compass story, with the second and third volumes coming out in September of 2016 & 2017, respectively.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23UEDH4JT97HM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553523716#wasThisHelpful","R23UEDH4JT97HM","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I considered ""Mr. Mercedes"" to be one of my favorites of the recent King novels, I didn't have the same level of praise for ""Finders Keepers"".  It is a pretty engaging story, truth be told, but just not up to the (incredibly) high standards that King seems to keep raising with each passing year.For a basic plot summary, ""Finders Keepers"" opens with the robbery and murder of famous author John Rothstein.  Head thief Morris Bellamy didn't really want to kill his idol Rothstein...he was mainly after the unpublished notebooks (and the wads of cash) in the writer's safe when things go south.  Sweeping the priceless notebooks into an old truck and burying it on the banks of a river for safekeeping until the heat is off, Rothstein is tripped up and sent to the slammer.  Flash forward almost 40 years later, and young Pete Saubers (living in the house once occupied by Bellamy) takes a walk by the river and finds a trunk sticking out of a downed tree.  Long story short, the trunk's contents are an obvious boon to young Pete and his family...but also send them down the rabbit hole of an intrigue plot when Bellamy is finally paroled and comes looking for the long-ago buried loot.That main story is probably a four stars out of five.  It isn't quite as strong or perfectly portioned as other King novels, but it is definitely intriguing and never really gets boring or anything like that.  It is a very relaxed, cautious sort of tale, where it constantly unspools as the pages fly by.  The hallmark of the tale is probably the juxtaposition and extreme use of irony intertwined within the tales of Pete & Morris.  It is interesting to see how the trunk (and its contents) represents something so different to each individual.Where I thought the story weakened a bit, however, was the inclusion (after about a third of the novel is set up) of the previous characters from ""Mr. Mercedes""...characters like Bill Hodges, Holly, Jerome, and even a little ""cameo"" (with the potential for much more) by one Brady Hartsfield.  The characters in and of themselves are not poor or poorly written, but rather their inclusion in this story seems a bit forced.  I didn't really feel like I learned a lot about the characters from this installment; as if they didn't grow like the characters of a second novel in a series should.  Perhaps the problem was that Bill and his gang maybe aren't quite as interesting when just doing straight-up ""detective work"".  While in ""Mr. Mercedes"" there is much background given to those characters, this time it seems like they are mainly used just to advance the story forward.King isn't really known for his sequels, and I wonder if this isn't a slight misstep in that area.  King is a master at weaving characters in and out of his stand-alone novels, but rarely does he put a ""part X"" or ""part of a series"" in the title like he does in this one.  Perhaps that affected the seeming forced-ness of the characters as times, as even though the main story revolved around a completely different plot, it had to still be a part of the ""Bill Hodges Trilogy"".Overall, though, ""Finders Keepers"" is still an interesting novel to read.  It will hold your attention all the way through.  It just didn't completely and utterly enrapture me like most King books have done recently.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PZD25MCCSBND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501100076#wasThisHelpful","R1PZD25MCCSBND","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not since the days when the MVP franchise owned the rights to Major League Baseball likenesses has there been a baseball sim as good as this one (MVP 2005 was still the standard for the past decade).The graphics are pristine and remarkable, most notably the different stadiums for each team.  Even the general movements are pretty smooth and as realistic as one would expect for this generation of game consoles.Where a baseball sim usually succeeds or fails, however, is in its controls, and it is here where ""The Show"" distances itself from previous franchises.

"Over the course of three seasons, ""Hannibal"" was one of the most unique shows to ever be broadcast over the airwaves.  While that uniqueness produced a wonderfully nuanced show, it also almost directly led to its unceremonious dumping from NBC.For a basic plot summary (some spoilers), this Third Season of ""Hannibal"" opens with all the main players trying to pick up the pieces (almost quite literally!) after season two's stunning, bloody finale.  Hannibal (Mads Mikkelson) and Dr. Du Maurier (Gillian Anderson) have absconded to Europe, while Will (Hugh Dancy), Jack (Laurence Fishburne), & Dr. Bloom (Caroline Dhavernas) are all licking their wounds and contemplating joining forces as the only way to bring Hannibal to some kind of justice.  Even Mason Verger (Joe Anderson) & sister Margot (Katharine Isabelle) are willing to pitch in.About half way through the season, there is a pretty significant time-jump forward that introduces a very familiar character from Hannibal canon lore: Francis Dolarhyde (Richard Armitage).  This plotline sets up what ultimately becomes the endgame of the entire show.First and foremost, ""Hannibal"" did not deserve (creatively-speaking) the rough treatment it was given by NBC...first the cancellation and then the banishment to late Saturday nights.  However, this is a show that would have been better served by being on cable, where its gore and sophistication would not have to be hidden.  This is still a five-star season all the way.The season starts off a bit slow, even by its own standards, but yet still never boring.  After such a shocking finale, perhaps a bit of a breath-taking was needed.  Once the main plotlines take shape, however, this campaign produces some of the best episodes/moments of the whole show.  Before or after the time jump, it really doesn't matter.  The final two scenes are a bit odd, but for a show known for such operatic violence and heady material, I guess that is just par for the course.  Still an easy 5-star all the way.Overall, the third effort of ""Hannibal"" was a unique joy to watch each week.  I will miss its gritty storytelling and incredible acting performances.  The show ended too early for a number of reasons (NBC; couldn't get the rights to Clarice Starling, etc.), but for a series that never pulled in big ratings even from the get-go, perhaps this is all fans of the show could have hoped for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2044DXMC9LN5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDQ5HBO#wasThisHelpful","R2044DXMC9LN5T","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Summer camp. Burgeoning romance. Self-discovery. General hijinx.  These are the things that summer reads have been made of for a long, long time.  Honor Girl carves out its own niche, however, by altering the formula in three specific ways: 1. Being a graphic novel;  2. Having the main character deal with homosexual issues; and 3. Presenting itself as a memoir.For a basic plot summary, Honor Girl is a graphic novel memoir from author Maggie Thrash.  At a summer camp at the age of 15, Maggie discovers that she has serious feelings for a fellow female named Erin.  This is the first time that Maggie has felt this way about another woman, and thus she must deal with those feelings as best she can.  Complicating things, of course, is that the camp is located in the South and populated by all girls, a difficult combination for a burgeoning lesbian romance to work out its issues.What I really liked about this graphic novel is that it had a very real sense to it.  While reading, I could picture similar teenage girls acting exactly like the characters in the novel.  To me, this really added a tale of legitimacy to the story.  Perhaps this is helped by the fact that the story is actually a memoir, so Thrash more had to remember her interactions at the camp rather than make them up.  It still takes a great deal of talent, however, to take those real-life interactions and turn them into something that someone else can sustain an interest in, and Thrash seems to havethat talent.In terms of the homosexual component of the story, I also really appreciate that Honor Girl didnt market itself as such, as to me the marketing of a book can have a big impact on how it is perceived (the whole dont judge a book by its cover).  If Thrash had splashed all over the front cover A Book About Potential Lesbians, it would automatically be viewed/judged in a different light.  Thankfully, the decision was made not to go this route and I think the novel is stronger for it, as it allows an engaging story to unfold before hitting the hard issues.  I could easily give this book to a teen girl and just tell her you will enjoy it without having to mention its subject matter, and I think enjoyment is exactly what would take place.  Sometimes, being a bit more low-key about things (e.g. not using homosexual themes to generate interest/intrigue) is the way to go.The only reason I cant give Honor Girl the full five stars?  I was a bit disappointed with the books ending.  I know it is based on Thrashs real-life experiences and thus doesnt have a Hollywood ending or anything close to it, but after reading the final pages my first emotion was that of being slightly let down.  Luckily, that is a rather small quibble with the overall experience, as otherwise this is a wonderful graphic novel that covers a lot of great materialboth serious and otherwise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B3KEV4YWXJUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=076367382X#wasThisHelpful","R2B3KEV4YWXJUT","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Hired Girl is a book filled with interesting themes: feminism, religion, class distinctions, romance, and family.  While reading, I often was prompted to think about one of those topics in a different way, while the characters were interesting enough to keep me invested.  Unfortunately, the end result is that all those themes get muddled together amongst each other and the novel isnt nearly as clear in concept at the end as it is in the beginning.For a basic plot summary, The Hired Girl tells the story of 14-year old Joan Skraggs.  Living on a poor Pennsylvania farm, her father is a crude workman who has no respect for her or pretty much all of womankind.  With Joans mother deceased (worked to death by Pa, explains Joan), he is able to rule the roost with an iron fist.  All Joan wants to do is get away from farm life to become a teacher, and when Pa pulls her out of classes and insults the schoolmarm in the process, she decides to run away.  She ends up as a hired girl (servant/worker) for a well-to-do Jewish family in Baltimore, where she begins to question her religious (Catholic) upbringing, her social status, and her blossoming (and of course forbidden) relationship with a young man within the household she serves.Author Laura Amy Schlitz does a marvelous job of making Joan a sympathetic character right from the get-go.  Her Pa is a truly terrible person that creates a sort of purgatory for the hard-working, yet creative/inquisitive child.  While she plots to run away, readers will be completely swept up in her quest.  Even when Joan finds her new occupation in Baltimore, she still manages to be an interesting figure as she meets all of the diverse characters within the household and integrates into the daily comings-and-goings.Unfortunately, it is at this point where The Hired Girl starts to splinter (and not necessarily in a good way).  The first half of the book sets up a strong, inspiring female character.  The second half turns into a pretty standard forbidden romance tale.  All that great character development and exploration of themes in the early chapters seems to melt away in favor of sappy romance and much more religious exploration than one would expect. I kept waiting for the text to circle back and pick up on those threads from the beginning, but it never does.Overall, I was very intrigued by the setup of The Hired Girl, but after the conditions/characters of the story are established, I felt like it turned far too much into a traditional romantic tale (considering the more lofty goals it seems to initially aspire to).  As such, I cant give it more than 3-stars.  It was a good read, and stirred a lot of interesting themes, but that stirring didnt seem lead to much of a finished product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5I80D9GFH8H6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=076367818X#wasThisHelpful","R5I80D9GFH8H6","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I grew up playing video games, and as such have great nostalgia for them.  ""Ready Player One"" is a book constructed with that type of nostalgia in mind.  Unfortunately for me, I needed to have been born about 5-10 years earlier to truly appreciate it.For a basic plot summary, this book tells the story of young Wade Watts living in the year 2044.  In that future year, humanity is really struggling and most people are logged into OASIS (a virtual reality simulation) pretty much 24/7, as it is a far brighter reality than the one in which the real world resides.  The OASIS was created by James Halliday, a reclusive, odd fellow who also programmed in an easter egg worth millions.  All one would have to do is follow the clues (all based on Halliday's youthful 1980s pop culture obsessions), which is exactly what Wade sets out to do.I've never read a book quite like this, so I have to give it props for originality.  It tells an interesting story and creates a fantasy world filled with seemingly endless possibilities.  References to pop culture (especially from the 1980s) are all over the place, often playing key roles (not just side jokes) in the plot of the novel.The ""problem"" for me, however, is that most of those references are second-hand for me, as I was only being born in the 1980s.  I can't fault Ernest Cline for that obviously, but it still stands that the book's largest appeal is to those who fully ""get it"".  The characters aren't quite developed enough to carry the load, so the spectacle and references are indeed the hallmarks.One interesting thing to think about is that I think ""Ready Player One"" might make a better film than book, even.  It is scheduled for a 2017 release with Steven Spielberg at the helm.  On the big screen, those of us who don't have the lifespan to get all the references will more easily be able to see them first hand.Overall, this book held my interest throughout but won't stick with me as an all-time favorite just because many of the references that compose its ""holy grail"" were lost on me.  Those who grew up watching movies and playing video games in the 80s, however, will not be able to get enough.  I think it all depends on your age with this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPLKYMZX3XE9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307887448#wasThisHelpful","RPLKYMZX3XE9D","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In todays popular culture, the Western genre is floundering.  Sure, you see one pop up on the big screen once in awhile, and Louis LAmour novels are ubiquitous in grocery stores, but there isnt much new/exciting being done in Western format anymore.  This is especially true, I think, in the YA genre, as I believe older readers still may feel some pull from a Western story having grown up in the cowboy-crazed 1950s and 60s.  So, it seems quite likely that a book like Vengeance Road might be the first Old West tale that a youngster of this generation may ever read.  Fortunately, author Erin Bowman makes it a great one.For a basic plot summary, Vengeance Road tells the story of 18-year old Kate Thompson, who sees her Pa hanged by outlaws over a dispute involving a journal that contains a map to hidden gold.  With no family left and a burning desire for revenge in her heart, Kate sets off after the men who did the deed.  Along the way, Kate meets up with a brother duo (one could be a potential love interest), an Apache female (who may or may not be trustworthy) and a host of other characters (most unsavory, as per the times) that she must navigate to keep on the trail of the bandits.What I really liked about this novel was how Bowman sticks to her guns (pardon the pun) about making an honest-to-goodness Western tale.  Those plots/themes are first and foremost to the story.  Does it contain characters that teens can relate to?  Of course.  However, those YA elements do not distract from or overshadow the Wild West atmosphere, language, and storylines.  An adult could easily pick up this book, begin reading, and never feel like it was below them or only appealing to teens.  The plot itself even harkens back to some classic revenge-western tales like Nevada Smith or The Searchers.For the teens who are picking up Vengeance Road, it does indeed also contain the tried and true themes of the YA genre.  The main character, Kate, must work through a number of different emotional issues while on the trail, dealing with her family history, intense anger, the conditions of the dusty West, and the potential of a romantic relationship.  The great thing, as I mentioned above, is that all these elements are integrated so well into the story that they dont seem forced or rote.About the only reason I cant give the film a 5-star ranking is because I felt the ending (last 50 pages or so) lost a bit of focus.  It isnt a terrible ending by any means, but lets just say (like with most revenge tales) that the chase (and the lessons learned along the way) is easily the best part of this book.Thus, I very much enjoyed reading Vengeance Road and think it serves as a great potential introduction to the Western genre for young people.  For those who may be more familiar with that type of writing, this book can stand on its own for them, too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R159EIP7VSYSJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544466381#wasThisHelpful","R159EIP7VSYSJR","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From a strictly artistic perspective, The Secret Mission of William Tuck isnt all that groundbreaking or great.  It isnt one of those books that transcends the genre or provides entertainment outside its target audience.  That being said, this is a novel containing enough action/adventure to keep being checked out in middle school libraries.For a basic plot summary, Secret Mission tells the story of two youngsters growing up during the heart of the Revolutionary War in 1780s America.  William Tuck learns that his brother was killed by the British and vows to join the American cause (his young stature requires he be a drummer).  Williams friend, Rebecca, has a father held prisoner by the Redcoats and wants similar vengeance.  As such, both strike out and fling themselves into harms way.  When Williams is whispered a secret message by a dying soldier meant to be heard by General George Washington himself, the pair strike out to find the leader of the American militia, armed with the communication that may help change the tide of the war.Like I mentioned in the opening paragraph, Secret Mission is a standard YA war novel.  The plot is pretty thin/simple, and the structure is set up so that the characters move from one seemingly impossible situation to another.  Simply put, this is a book that really will only appeal to young readers (or those who like their narratives very, very simple), as it isnt complex enough either in characters or storylines to hook most adults.As such, the two-star rating on this book more indicates my personal liking of the material.  When I read YA material, I like it to be a bit more mature in theme and scope, and that just wasnt what Secret Mission brings to the table.  Perhaps the 10-13-year old me would have enjoyed this book, but the 29-year old model?  Not so much.Of course, Im not truly being fair in that assessment, as the book is made for a target audience of middle-schoolers and that is exactly who will likely enjoy the novel.  Even then it wont be anything near an all-time classic, but it will (at the very least) hold a young readers attention (especially one fascinated by Revolutionary War history).","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VWZBN370GAT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402281749#wasThisHelpful","R3VWZBN370GAT5","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you have those skills or want to take the time to figure it out, than maybe this book will have something for you.  Otherwise, it is more math problems than anything.A better option for fans looking for a good baseball sabermetrics title is ""Baseball Between The Numbers"", or those looking for an introduction to the topic should pick up ""Moneyball"".

"Over the course of the previous four seasons, ""Falling Skies"" was a show that largely succeeded because of its storytelling balance.  You had action, science fiction, and plenty of bravado...but also many reflective, character-driven moments.  Sadly, I felt that the show messed up that equilibrium in this final campaign, instead choosing to keep ""push, push, pushing"" forward with a lack of characteristic reflection.This final season isn't terrible.  For those who are in it primarily for the alien apocalypse angle, it might be one of the strongest seasons in the show's run.  From the first episode of this Fifth Season, when Tom Mason (Noah Wyle) gives a revenge-laden diatribe whilst holding the severed head of the enemy, one could understand that this season would be different.  It is more about setting up the final battle and less about the struggles of humanity.Your enjoyment of this final effort will really come down to why you began watching the show in the first place.  If you like to see people blowing up aliens, there is plenty of that (always has been).  However, if you (like me) are into the show for other, more subtle, character-driven reasons, then you might be a bit disappointed in how things all play out.  Despite friends and family telling me that I ""had to watch"" this show for a number of years, I ignored those exhortations because I saw it as ""just another alien apocalypse show"".  When I finally relented, however, I realized that it was about so much more.  It was a show about what it means to be human.  There were many times when I was moved to tears, while other moments were so inspirational (""we choose to go to the moon!"") that they left me speechless after viewing.  I counted Captain Weaver (Will Patton) to be one of my favorite television characters of all-time.  I remember one particular episode where the Second Mass. was literally travelling in a caravan from one destination to another, just talking with each other.  It was one of the best episodes I can recall watching, proving that the science fiction and action (while exciting) was not what defined ""Falling Skies"".As I've mentioned, however, this final season goes away from that and focuses on the battle.  It also (disappointingly) covers ground that has seemingly already been tread: Masons vs. Pope, ""can we trust the Volm?"", Mason and his family ""on trial"" for questionable wartime decisions.  Stop me if you remember this stuff from previous seasons.  Basically, instead of being inspired by the ending of the show, the thought I had more often than not during this season was: ""they had the freedom of mapping out the show's ending and THIS was the best they could do?"".I hate to rag on this final season so much, because the show truly is one of my favorites.  I'll conclude with an example of why Season Five failed to live up to my expectations: After five episodes of tireless battle, the sixth episode finds the Masons stumbling across a family of ""conscientious objectors"" to the battle against the Espheni.  At first, Tom is flabbergasted that they can live in such denial of the world around them, but after some time with them he realizes exactly what he is fighting this war for in the first place.  Reflective, contemplative moments like this are what made ""Falling Skies"" stand out from the crowd.  Without them, it would have been a run-of-the-mill post-apocalyptic blow-up fest.  For four seasons, the show managed to maintain that perfect balance.  Surprisingly (as this was a show that rarely let me down), it couldn't do it for a fifth.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5CEU0FYQS26V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YMIQDM0#wasThisHelpful","R5CEU0FYQS26V","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the Authors Note at the end of this book, Marcia Thornton Jones mentions that Vietnam was the war of her youth.  In Woodford Brave, she is able to draw from those experiences and craft a convincing, coming-of-age tale set in World War II America.For a basic plot summary, this story centers on Cory Woodford, a young boy whose father is off fighting the Germans.  During the day, Cory chums around with his baseball-obsessed pals and suspects the neighbor, Mr. Ziegler, of being a Nazi spy.  At night, he writes letters to his soldier father, including a comic strip in which they team up to stomp all evil out of the galaxy.  When a new girl moves into the neighborhood and challenges everyones notions of gender and cultural, however, Cory begins to understand first-hand that wartime issues are not quite as black-and-white as they seem.Woodford Brave is an excellent YA historical fiction novel for two primary reasons:1. The characters seem true-to-form and are quite engaging.  One could easily imagine young children interacting with each other like they do in this novel.  Playing spies, obsessing over baseball, chiding each other relentlesslythese are all things that ground the book both in its times, as well as in its character range.2. The themes of a country at war.  At the beginning of the book, Cory is a nave child who believes that killing Germans is the most noble cause on the face of the earth.  In that way, he sees the world through the simplistic eyes of a child.  By the end of the book, however, Cory has a far deeper understanding of the sacrifices that must be made (or even not made) during war, and that there are different types of courage than just charging into battle.Perhaps the hallmark of Woodford Brave is how it is able to take such adult themes and transition them down to a YA audience.  Even though I read the book from an adult perspective, I dont think an adolescent (even those on the very young side of that term) would have any trouble picking out the important themes and enjoying them, as Jones couches them in with such wonderful characters and situations.Overall, I very much enjoyed Woodford Brave and would give it 4.5 stars if I could.  The character resolutions are a bit predictable from an adult perspective, but that is really the only reason why I couldnt give it the full five stars.  That wont be an issue with young adults, though, so this is one that could shoot to great successes, especially with children whose parents may have served in the military recently (Iraq, Afghanistan, etc.).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ORKCTT98T25C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629793051#wasThisHelpful","R2ORKCTT98T25C","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The year is 1964, and 12-year old Trip Westbrook just wants to play football with the guys out in the front yard of his Jackson, Mississippi home.  The only problemand it turns out to be a big oneis that Trip has recently befriended the colored boy, Dee, who helps with chores around the Westbrook home.  Even though Dee has the best arm of the bunch and should be the pride of the front yard football circuit, all people seem to notice is the color of his skin.  What begins as an innocent game of football turns into a clashing of societal beliefs that tears the neighborhood apartwhile at the same time brings others even closer together in their solidarity against the prejudices of the time and place.Yard War is a five-star effort primarily because it is able to play both sides in appealing to middle-schoolers all the way on up to adults.  Youngsters reading the novel will immediately identify with Trip and his relations with family/friends, while more seasoned readers will be hit with a pang of childhood nostalgia as well as be able to see the societal messages that the younger readers may be just getting introduced to.I also really enjoyed how author Taylor Kitchings is able to tell a macro-story (with themes of prejudice and casual racism) and a micro-story (relationships within the Westbrook family) and have them fit seamlessly in the end.  I wont give away whether the ending is an uplifting one or a depressing one, but suffice it to say that it has a very realistic feel to it (as does the entire novel, really).  Kitchings does a great job of not preaching or sugar-coating things.  He tells it like it is without being profane or crassly offensive.Overall, I very much enjoyed the experience of reading Yard War and would highly recommend it to the middle school or even sophisticated/advanced elementary aged readers.

"The story of the flag-raisers of Iwo Jima is a fascinating one.  From the perhaps not-so-common knowledge that the picture was actually of the second flag raised on the mountain, to the misrepresentation of those even in the picture, it is a narrative filled with drama and human interest.  Director Clint Eastwood is the perfect figure to tackle such a project, and he does so with his usual aplomb (aside from perhaps a few narrative structure hiccups).For a basic plot summary, Flags Of Our Fathers tells the story of that famous picture taken of the American flag being hoisted atop Mt. Suribachi during the battle for Iwo Jima.  The film many focuses on John Doc Bradley (Ryan Phillippe), Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford), & Ira Hayes (Adam Beach), three of the flag-raisers who survived the war and were recruited by the military to tell their story and be hailed as heroes to drum up sales for war bonds.  Initially, the three men seem quite uncomfortable in this role, and as the story progresses (filled with flashbacks to the Iwo Jima battle itself) we learn why: Not only was the famous picture taken of the second flag, but there is even an error regarding which men are in the picture.  The military pushes the rhetoric over the truth in order to sell, sell, sell those war bonds, and the three men must deal with those repercussions.First and foremost, Flags of our Fathers is a great movie because it has a great story to tell.  Most Americans can identify that iconic flag-raising photo, but many did not know the interesting story behind it.  All movies succeed/fail primarily by the strength of the story, and it is in this category where Flags shines the brightest.  One can see their own parents or grandparents (who may have participated in WW2) through the lens of these characters, and even extrapolate upon themes of military deception or obfuscation of the truth.  Fortunately, Eastwood is always very good at keeping things grounded and practical instead of rah rah political, so this isnt a preachy film by any means.  It lays out the story and lets the viewer make their own conclusions.Supporting that fine story is some great acting all the way around.  The three leads are spot-on, while the auxiliary cast features such strong performers as: John Slattery, Barry Pepper, Paul Walker, Robert Patrick, & Neil McDonough.  Simply put, acting isnt a problem in this film (!).About the only reason I cant give this picture the full five stars is because of Eastwoods rather odd choice of telling the narrative in such a disjointed fashion.  Parts are flashbacks, parts are narrated by a researcher interviewing the aged veterans of Iwo Jima, and even the real time action can jump forward or back in time with little to no warning.  To me, this led to a rather disjointed experience in trying to follow the overall narrative.  It seemed like every time I would get comfortable in what time/place was being presented in the scene, it would jump to another just as quick.  Luckily, Eastwood is a good enough director to still make it work, but his other films usually take a more straightforward, direct approach.Overall, though, Flags of our Fathers is a great film filled with wartime action, human interest, and a story that will last down through the generations.  It may lack the utter gravitas of the earlier Saving Private Ryan, but it tells an equally (if not even more) compelling story.  The telling of that story may be a bit fractured, but the sum of the parts is quite a moving, emotional experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XTY3G0E1N01E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000M4RG42#wasThisHelpful","R1XTY3G0E1N01E","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"More often than not, sports memoirs can be a bit dull and cover some of the same old tropes over and over again.  Fortunately, ""Just Tell Me I Can't"" breaks that mold by delving deep into the topic of sports psychology (a big part of Jamie Moyer's career) in order to help understand the motivation behind a man pitching until the age of 49.This book tells two concurrent narratives all the way through.  First, it introduces Jamie Moyer just as he is severely injuring his arm during the 2010 season.  He is in his mid-forties and yet still trying to rehab and make a return for the 2012 season.  As that story unspools, the narrative flashes back to certain key points that happened earlier in Moyer's career.As I said, this is no ordinary sports memoir, primarily because Jamie Moyer is no ordinary athlete.  Besides the whole old-age angle, Moyer's story is actually most interesting when dealing with his relationship with notably sports mentalist/psychiatrist Harvey Dofrman, whose insights turned a struggling journeyman pitcher into an All-Star and eventually World Champion.  It is utterly fascinating to hear Moyer describe the unique link between his performance and his mental state/thoughts.Simply put, this is a book that hooked me in from the very beginning and didn't take me all that much longer to finish!  After reading relatively boring or unimaginative bios on figures like Mariano Rivera & Pedro Martinez in recent months, ""Just Tell Me I Can't"" was a breath of fresh air, as it not only gave a great accounting of Moyer's career, but did so in such a way that followed a new/interesting narrative structure that made it an exciting story.  I wish more sports memoirs would take this kind of approach.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCKRQKEEZN61E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455521574#wasThisHelpful","RCKRQKEEZN61E","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For many years, I have held author Stephen King to be the gold standard of my reading tastes.  I had never found an author who was able to get into the head of his/her book's characters and make them come alive quite like Mr. King.  I think that has now changed after reading two novels from Gillian Flynn, the second of which being ""Dark Places"".For a basic plot summary, ""Dark Places"" tells the story of Libby Day, a woman who (as a child) escaped from the massacre of her entire family by her crazed brother, who is now in prison for the act.  Despite that courageous act of survival, however, present-day Libby is a mess.  After getting by on the sympathy of others for so long, the money has now dried up and she is desperate for the next ""sympathy check"".  As such, she attends a sort of cult meeting of a group obsessed with her family's murder on that night so long ago.  What she discovers, make to her chagrin and surprise, is that this group does not believe brother Ben could have committed the murders...which plants the seed in her head to pay her incarcerated brother a visit for some pointed questions.  The result?  A shred of doubt creeps into Libby's mind about exactly what transpired on that fateful night.Like many people, I was introduced to the writing of Gillian Flynn by reading ""Gone Girl"".  I was so entranced by that effort, I decide to give this one a try, and to be completely honest ""Dark Places"" might be even better.  Using interspersed chapters of flashbacks and present-day material, Flynn concocts a wonderful mystery that one absolutely cannot get a handle on until its climax.  The tension keeps building which each new revelation in both the past and present.While the plot is indeed unique in that sense, the hallmark of ""Dark Places"" is easily the complex characters it introduces and explores.  As I mentioned in the opening, the only author I've read who has been able to accomplish this with such aplomb is Stephen King...and can one heap bigger praise on a relatively inexperienced author than that?!Overall, then, ""Dark Places"" is one of the best books I've read in quite some time.  Going into the first page, I had suspicions that maybe Flynn was just a ""one-hit wonder"" with ""Gone Girl"", so imagine my surprise when this one turned out to be (IMHO) even better!  After I go back in time a bit more to read Flynn's debut novel, ""Sharp Objects"", you can be guaranteed that her next efforts will be high up on my ""to-read"" lists for the foreseeable future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR1LAZFCFEIPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307341577#wasThisHelpful","RR1LAZFCFEIPG","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After the film ""Zodiac"" peaked my interested on the subject, I decided to give this book a try to see if it provided what the author claims on the cover.  While the accuracy of Gary Stewart's claim (that his father Earl Van Best, Jr., was the infamous Zodiac Killer) has not been able to be proven as of yet, he makes a compelling case.  Even if you don't count yourself as a ""believer"", though, the story of Mr. Stewart and his lineage alone is enough to hold your interest all the way through.For a basic plot summary, ""The Most Dangerous Animal of All"" begins with one Gary Stewart (as an adult) finally meeting his biological mother (he was adopted).  After a joyous reunion with mother Judy, over time the identity of his father is brought up.  Initially, that seems to be a subject shrouded in mystery that no one wants to remember, but Gary keeps pushing.  Through much research and many interviews, he finds out that his father, Earl Van Best Jr., had married 14-year old Judy, had a son (Gary) with her, and then abandoned the baby on the steps of an apartment building.  More research shows that Van possessed all the necessary capacities (both physically and mentally) to be the Zodiac.  The rest of the book is spent examining how Van could have been the Zodiac and all the reasons Gary thinks he was.I don't want to give away all the ""juicy details"" of this book (that is most of the fun!), but suffice it to say that Stewart has a very solid circumstantial case that his father was indeed the nefarious Zodiac murderer.  From Van Best's knowledge of ciphers to his deviant behavior and his very image (compared to a sketch of the Zodiac from one of his surviving victims), it truly could be ""case closed"".Unfortunately, looking at things from a very procedural angle, nothing in this book is truly conclusive (in terms of hard evidence).  The crimes happened so long ago that it is a pretty cold case, and Stewart's attempts to compare his DNA to the DNA markers found from Zodiac were met with obstacle upon obstacle (backlog of DNA inquiries, detective who seems to want to shut Stewart down, etc.).  So, as of yet, there is nothing coming from this book that would hold up in a court of law.However, even if the above paragraph bothers you a bit, take heart in that this is a story that still can be thoroughly enjoyed even if you don't come away with ""book 'em, Dan-o"" type conclusions.  Whether he was the Zodiac or not Van Best (and his entire family past and present, really) is a fascinating character study.  In all honesty, the book could have been a biography of that man and I probably would have liked it just as much.  Stewart also does a great job of making sure that those ""family moments"" are present quite a bit.  This isn't a ""hard-boiled cop story"" by any means.  It really is more about Stewart's struggle to understand his own legacy and determine what it means for his life.Perhaps the hallmark of ""The Most Dangerous Animal Of All""?  The fact that Gary Stewart seems so utterly convinced that, through his outreach to find his birth parents, he truly did stumbled upon the Zodiac killer.  That strength of conviction is very important to a book in which hard ""case evidence"" cannot be presented.  At the end of the reading experience, I was in his corner.  Perhaps further reading on the subject would change my mind, but this was a wonderful human interest tale either way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16V89UK00QU16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062313177#wasThisHelpful","R16V89UK00QU16","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its always fun to see the old gang get back together.  The Toy Story characters have so endeared themselves to our hearts that there is an automatic connection with them every time they appear on screen.  In Toy Story That Time Forgot, some new blood is introduced.For a basic plot summary, this little short tells the story of a Christmas playdate at a friend of Bonnies.  While at the friends house, Bonnie is sucked into playing a new videogame instead of playing with the toys.  So, Woody, Buzz, and the gang must go it alone and interact with a new set of dinosaur toys (led by Reptillus Maximus) that still dont yet know they are toys.Like I said, its great to see and hear from the toy characters again.  In this installment, dinosaur Trixie gets a lions share of the screen-time, much like Combat Carl stole Toy Story of Terror.  That being said, each of your favorite character has at least a line or two.The only reason I cant give this the full five-stars?  Because I think that maybe a bit more time was given to the battle dinosaurs than necessary.  What makes Toy Story great is the emotion and the humorous interaction between the characters.  Both of those things are indeed present here, but there is a lot of setup to pull it out of the story.So, I have to say that I liked last years Halloween special a bit more than this Christmas effort.  That being said, this one is still quite enjoyable and will, at times, have you both laughing and feeling in equal measure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYONVLP38R5BN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2DWRD8#wasThisHelpful","RYONVLP38R5BN","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being released right around the tenth anniversary of the Hurricane Katrina disaster that leveled the city of New Orleans, Drowned City is a somber, straightforward (yet surprisingly engrossing) description of the key events before, during, and after the disaster.The tone of the book is melancholy, but not overtly depressing.  There just seems to be a great deal of respect for the storm and those who died in it.  I like how author/illustrator Don Brown tells the facts in a way that makes them very accessiblelike he is telling a story.  This is a great approach for young adults who wont want the history book description of the event, but rather something a bit more personal and close-to-home.The illustrations do not distract from the text, nor are they boringthe perfect combination.  I have no background in art to comment on any specific styles that Brown used, but I will say that I enjoyed the illustrations and found them to be very much in tune with the text (the non-technical explanation!).Drowned City can also serve dual purposes:1. A first history lesson for those not old enough to appreciate the scale and scope of Katrina.2. A look back (can it be ten years already?!) for those who remember the events and like to wax nostalgic (although that is definitely not the appropriate word in this case).Overall, I very much enjoyed this graphic novel.  I dont read too many graphic works, but this one caught my attention and was both interesting/informative to page through.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R149KS13QZFT2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054415777X#wasThisHelpful","R149KS13QZFT2Z","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The third season of the X-Files is widely regarded as the best season of the show at seamlessly showcasing the three areas in which the X-Files came to be known for:1. First, this season kept progressing the show's ""mythology"" in fascinating fashion.  From the introduction of the shadowy Syndicate (of which the Cigarette Smoking Man is a member) to the continued betrayal of Alex ""Ratboy"" Krychek, the myth-arc episodes were some of the best in the show's history.  A different interpretation of Scully's earlier abduction is also touched on, as well as a strange alien subject brought up from the depths of the ocean.2. This season also continued the high-quality ""stand-alone"" X-File case episodes.  ""Revelations"" probes the religous differences between Agents Mulder and Scully, ""Pusher"" introduces a psychologically-terrifying villain, and ""Avatar"" explores the personal life of A.D. Walter Skinner.3. Finally, three comedic episodes are featured in this season, providing a much-appreciated breath of fresh air to a show that regularly delves into some very serious content.  ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose"" pays tribute to the silent films of yesteryear, ""War of the Coprophages"" is full of witty Mulder-isms, and ""Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'"" is considered the ultimate comedic X-File to this day.To conclude, the Third Season of the X-Files does a remarkable job of blending an over-arching mythology with single-hour paranormal excursions and short doses of comedy to keep things fresh.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ1R4SI96BCB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BOH990#wasThisHelpful","RZ1R4SI96BCB4","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite the fact that boxing really hasn't been all that relevant for quite some time, boxing movies (or ""fight movies"" in general) are a favorite of mine.  I count the ""Rocky"" series, ""The Champ"", ""Real Steel"", ""The Fighter"", and ""Warrior"" to be some of my favorite films of all-time.  The reason?  Boxing movies really aren't about boxing.  They are about revealing character.  There may not be a more straightforward sport: hit the other person repeatedly until him or you can't continue.  Yet, it is through that ferocious simplicity that great character stories can be told and relationship examined.  Sadly, ""Southpaw"" doesn't do nearly a good enough job with that character/relationship-building, instead just content to throw out all the old boxing cliches and hope they meld into something inspirational.  They do not.For a basic plot summary, ""Southpaw"" tells the story of Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal), a light-heavyweight champion at the top of his game.  He has beaten all-comers, has a beautiful wife (Rachel McAdams), and a lovely daughter (Oona Laurence).  The only problem?  Billy can't walk away from any fight (in OR out of the ring) and it leads to a brawl in which a great tragedy befalls him and his family.  Starting over basically from square one, Billy finds a new trainer in Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) and begins to rebuild both his own life and that of his newly-shaped family.Despite my earlier praise for the ""fight movie"" genre, many of its movies do use rather predictable cliches when dealing with the actual boxing portion of the flicks.  In ""Southpaw"", every single one of those cliches is used in order to try and create a large amount of drama.  There is the riches-to-rags-and-back-again story, the grizzled old trainer with the odd methods, the fracturing of the family life due to a violent sport, and the corruption of the entire business.  Heck, ""Southpaw"" even rips off the old ""Rocky IV"" sequence of having interspersed shots of two boxing training with different styles...this time just set to an Eminem rap tune instead of a score.Unfortunately, all those cliches do is cover up for the fact that the characters in this movie are not well-written or well-conceived whatsoever, and the plot adds absolutely nothing new to the genre.  It is completely hollow once you look past the surface material.  Sadder still, there really isn't even anything that I can point to as being really good about the film, besides perhaps the acting of Gyllenhaal (which itself is even ""just okay"" as there is no dramatic meat for him to work with).  To be honest, a more accurate rating of this film for me would be 1.5 stars.  I'll round it up to two stars because it at least as some coherency to it, but that is truly the only reason.  Nothing else made me care about what I was seeing.I was very disappointed in ""Southpaw"", as (when I first saw its trailers a few months ago) I predicted it would be perhaps the best movie I've seen all year.  Boy, was that ever a ""punch to the gut"" (pardon the pun).  Instead, it ended up as one of the most bland, hollow movies I've seen in quite sometime.  Unless you've never seen a fight movie in your life and want to catch up on the mechanics of how they work, ""Southpaw"" will likely underwhelm you to the point of boredom.  It just doesn't have any dramatic substance.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP77U3UYKZZ4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012FJ3096#wasThisHelpful","RP77U3UYKZZ4S","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For a number of years now, I have enjoyed seeing my hometown Minnesota Twins play in some opposing stadiums.  While home stadiums are always great, there isn't anything quite like the experience of hitting the road and getting first-ups in a new and sometimes strange/wonderful ballpark.  As such, I could really appreciate the concept behind ""I Don't Care If We Never Get Back"".Basically, this is a story about Ben and Eric and their epic baseball road trip...all thirty stadiums in thirty days.  Ben is the stat geek in love with baseball who meticulously plans this epic, improbably trip, while Eric is more the free spirit who doesn't really even like baseball but is just ""along for the ride"", and what a crazy ride it turns out to be!From a few of my own baseball trips, I know that life on the road can get crazy, so I really enjoyed hearing the antics and situations that Ben and Eric get themselves into over the course of their journey.  There is a certain bond that forms between people driving hundreds of miles a day and sleeping at a new hotel each night, and these two do a great job of reflecting that.  A lot of fun also mixed with high anxiety, flaring tempers, and seemingly impossible travel goals that are more often than not met.Really, about the only criticism I can give this book is that it might paint with a bit too broad of strokes sometimes.  The narrative of ""Ben the stat geek"" and ""Eric the annoyed friend"" is used again and again.  Perhaps that is indeed what the trip was for many stretches, but I have to believe that the pair enjoyed the whole experience a bit more than what was let on.  This ""emotional stuff"" is covered a bit towards the end, but I wish that deeper material could have been present even a bit early.  A very small ""complaint"", however, in the grand scheme of things.Overall, this book was a joy and a riot to read!  For any baseball fan who has traveled any distance to watch their team wear the visiting uniforms, you will find things to relate to in Eric and Ben's journey.  While I could never see myself planning such am ambitious/crazy journey, there were times when I felt extremely jealous of their trip.

"The FOX network has a strange history with mystery/scifi shows.  The X-Files practically gave the fledgling network life, yet they are also notorious for cutting shows down that still have solid audiences (Firefly; Fringe) or promoting shows ad naseum and then pulling the plug before they can even get going (Alcatraz; Almost Human).  Combined with the fact that notoriously ""hit big or miss big"" director M. Night Shyamalan was at the helm, I honestly had no idea what to expect from ""Wayward Pines"".  What I found was that if (as a viewer) you can throw caution to the wind and expect something crazy and mysterious, this is a show that will thrill you in nearly every episode.Because the show is such a giant mystery, I can't give too much away in terms of plot.  The basic premise is that Secret Service agent Ethan Burke (Matt Dillon) gets involved in a car crash while on a mission to find fellow agent Kate Hewson (Carla Gugino).  When he wakes up, he discovers himself in the small, ""cozy"" community of Wayward Pines...where not everything (or anything) is quite as it seems and there doesn't seem to be any immediate way to leave.  A mysterious, tough-talking sheriff (Terrance Howard) and a friendly female confidant (Juliette Lewis) seem to be Ethan's only hope of figuring out exactly what is up with this weird town.  Then, in another ""accident"", Ethan's wife Theresa (Shannyn Sossamon) and son Ben (Charlie Tahan) show up in Wayward Pines, and the stakes get raised even further.The main advice I can give anyone watching Wayward Pines is to stick with it for at least 3-4 episodes (if you are at all intrigued) before passing judgement.  For the first two episodes, I didn't know what to think, but then I realized that this is pretty much the hallmark of the show.  It pulls no punches and knows no bounds in terms of crazy plot twists and character developments.  Characters can be killed off at a moment's notice, and by the end of the series the plot described above is almost completely moot, as so much is covered in just ten episodes.  So, make sure to give it a fair shake.For those of you who especially love mysteries, Wayward Pines definitely is full-to-bursting in that department.  Nearly every episode is packed with twists and turns and huge reveals.  Though not nearly as ambitious as a show like The X-Files, Wayward Pines gives off a similar vibe in its fearlessness with plots and characters.Kudos must also be given to three other actors I haven't even mentioned yet: Toby Jones is his usual odd self in a pivotal role, Sarah Jeffrey is charming/innocent as a love interest for young Ben, and Hope Davis plays a school teacher who I really can't say any more about (!)Simply put, if you like mysteries and you like solid science fiction, I think you will take to Wayward Pines as much as I did.  I really liked how FOX (right from the get-go) advertised this as a ""event miniseries"" and likely not a long-running affair.  I suppose the ending is ambiguous enough to continue on at some point, but I think part of the reason the series succeeded in the first place is because the writers/producers were able to go ""all out"" for ten episodes and not have to worry about getting cancelled or jerked around by the network.  I would be perfectly fine with these episodes standing alone as a great mystery story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NOXOZG6N1BQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJLL18S#wasThisHelpful","R2NOXOZG6N1BQG","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Toy Story...Wall-E...Up...Finding Nemo...etc. When a company (Pixar) makes films of that caliber, it is a difficult task to keep ""upping the ante"" with subsequent releases. While ""Inside Out"" is (at the very least) entertaining, it doesn't quite live up to the bar of greatness set by previous Pixar installments.For a basic plot summary, ""Inside Out"" tells the story of an 11-year old girl named Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias), who is moving from Minnesota to San Francisco. This is obviously a big change in Riley's life, and it is when we are introduced to the emotions inside her head: Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), & Disgust (Mindy Kaling). All of Riley's outward emotions are controlled by these core emotions in the ""command center"" of her brain. As Riley struggles to acclimate to her new home, school, and environment, these emotions struggle to figure out their place in the overall scheme of her personality.The concept behind ""Inside Out"" is original and entertaining. It's fun/interesting to see our emotions represented like that, and it provides for both some very happy/uplifting, as well as very sad/depressing, moments throughout. In terms of original concept and interesting ideas, ""Inside Out"" may actually be one of Pixar's best.However, I found the execution of those ideas to be only so-so. I had two complaints (this is coming from an adult perspective, of course) while watching the movie...1. When the camera ""pulls back"" to see Riley interacting with her parents and environment, that is when this film works the best. However, a majority of the film is spent inside Riley's brain dealing with the emotions themselves. For example, a subplot involving Joy being separated from the command center takes up quite a bit of time. I just wish things could have been a bit more balanced.2. More so than any other Pixar film, ""Inside Out"" seems to really ""go for the cry"", so to speak. I've never been in a theater where so many sniffles and even outright sobbing could be heard. I have no problem with that at face value, as great films are supposed to grab at the emotions, but this one just felt expressly made to do so. I shed some tears at the end of ""Toy Story 3"" and at the beginning of ""Up"", but I really feel that was because those montages were so well-made and natural to the plot of those films. With ""Inside Out"", at times I felt like the entire point of the experience was to have parents bawling.That being said, even though this one didn't rank as high as other Pixar efforts in my book, it was still fun to watch. I thoroughly enjoyed the unique concept and really liked the parts where the emotions in Riley's (and her parents') brain directly influence conversations and interactions in the real world.

"The novelization of films can often be given a bad rap in the sense that they are copying what the movie did and just putting it in readable form.  While that indeed is exactly what is being done, in the technical sense, I have also seen a number of examples in my life where the lure of cinema material changed into book format has jump-started interest in young readers.For a basic plot summary, Inside Out: Cinestory Comic is an exact re-telling of Pixars Inside Out, following the plot of that film to a tee.  Young Riley and her parents pull up stakes from Minnesota and move to San Francisco, where the transition to everyday life isnt easy for any involved.  This is primarily expressed via representations of Rileys key emotions in her brain: Joy, Anger, Sadness, Fear, & Disgust.Once again, let me re-iterate that this is the EXACT SAME story as the movienot a spin-off tale.  What you saw in the theater is what you aregetting here.I could see this book having a double-barreled appeal to youngsters: It may catch their eye after watching the film, or (once the movie hits home video) it could go the opposite way, with children reading this book and then getting excited to watch the movie.Either way, I think that books like this can go quite far in promoting exciting reading for children.  Disney/Pixar collaborations are so popular with that set these days that it really is a no-brainer to port them into readable form.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX09484AQ4C04/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1926516877#wasThisHelpful","RX09484AQ4C04","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When the closing credits rolled on The Age of Adaline, the first emotion that I felt was disappointment.  Obviously, that disappointment wasnt based on the movie being terrible (as three stars isnt a terrible rating), but rather was disappointment that such a great concept/opportunity was wasted with such poor direction and scale.For a basic plot summary, Age of Adaline tells the story of Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively), a woman born in 1906.  When the audience meets Adaline, however, she is living in the year 2014 and looks to be in her twenties.  How is this possible?  In a series of flashbacks, the film explains how Adaline was given the mysterious condition of never aging past the looks of a young woman.  Recognizing that she is such an oddity and fearful that she will be used as a test subject, Adaline has resigned herself to living on the runnever staying in the same place for too long.  That is, of course, until she meets Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman), a man who is enticed by her mystery and refuses to take No for an answer.  Also, it just so happens that another Jones family member (played by Harrison Ford) might have more of a connection to Adaline than anyone knows.The concepts behind The Age of Adaline are dynamite, put simply.  Age-old themes of love, aging, generations, and family are touched upon within the magical, mysterious environment created by Adaline herself.  Plus, Lively is truly a beauteous sight to behold (makes you wonder why she hasnt had a bigger cinema presence before now).  It would really seem like a slam-dunk that this movie should not only do well, but perhaps even to the point of winning awards.  Remember The Curious Case of Benjamin Button?  Age of Adaline has even that award-winner beat in terms of overall potential emotion and mystery.Sadly, the direction of this movie is a mess.  There are a number of choices made that really perplex me, and speak to either flat out poor direction or a wrong tact in creating the film.  For example-The flashbacks in the film are narrated montages, really violating the show, not tell general guideline of great cinema.  I wanted to see/experience what was happening, not just hear about it.-A plotline involving a celestial comet falls so embarrassingly flat one must wonder how it wasnt scrapped on the cutting room floor.-One of the core components of the film is the romance aspect, and even that is mostly unsatisfying.  This is mainly because it seems like the film-makers dont want to see Blake Lively actually emote (whether she can or cannot do this as an actress I do not know).  Instead, it was more like lets put her in a bunch of evening dresses and see what happens.Overall, I think that the main problem with Age of Adaline comes from the perspective.  I was hoping for a film heavy on the mystery with some solid characters to back it up.  Instead, this is mainly a vehicle to showcase the beauty of Blake Lively and establish her as a starvery little more or less.  A bit sad, considering that this film had the potential to do it all.  When all is said and done, Benjamin Button actually turns out to be a better experience for those looking for similar themes.  That film was made with care, while this one lacks oh so many things.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19A77N9DU1Z8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPH4REI#wasThisHelpful","R19A77N9DU1Z8P","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While reading The Game of Love & Death by Martha Brockenbrough, it was very clear that the book was supposed to have a very epic feel to it, what with characters such as Death and Love so heavily involved in the proceedings.  Unfortunately, even as an adult reading a book that will likely be marketed to the YA crowd, I never felt like I quite understood the epic plot points.For a basic plot summary, Game of Love & Death tells the story of two teenagers growing up in the Great Depression.  Flora is a jazz club singer by night and daredevil airplane pilot by day, inspired by the likes of Charles Lindberg and Amelia Earhart.  Henry is a poor boy with no family to speak of, but happens to be taken in by the family of a friend, where he is set to be apprenticed as a newspaper man.  What Henry really wants, though, is to play music, a pursuit that leads him to Floras nightclub, where the two strike up an acquaintance that evolves into romance.  The catch behind all of this?  As children, both Henry & Flora were marked as little more than players in a cosmic struggle between the figures of Love & Death, a sort of wager to determine which wins out in the end.Had this book been a more traditional piece of historical fiction, I actually think I would have liked it more than I did.  I usually dont advocate for books being less complicated or more straightforward (I like shades of grey and multi-faceted characters), but in this case a simpler approach probably would have increased my enjoyment of the proceedings.The reason?  I honestly just did not understand all of the epic stuff surrounding the characters of Love and Death.  Each time the story would cut away from Henry, Flora, and the auxiliary characters for a little Love/Death interlude, I would struggle to understand what was going on or what the deeper meaning was.  I completely and utterly failed to see the significance of the whole game that is being played.  I was actually just content to keep reading about the well-written and interesting characters of Henry & Flora.Perhaps I missed some key early plot/character developments or this type of storytelling just didnt appeal to me.  Based on other reviews of this book, it seems like it was very well-received.  However, I also consider myself to be an avid reader (and general media consumer, like television & film) and am usually able to appreciate a great story when I see one.  In the case of The Game of Love & Death, either I completely missed that great story, or it truly wasnt there in the first place.Either way, my experience with the book was mostly a negative one. Besides the pages/dialogues strictly between Henry & Flora, I never got hooked into any other plot/story line in the novel.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22ZRX3H0QECU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545668344#wasThisHelpful","R22ZRX3H0QECU1","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a 29-year old male, ""The Best Of Me"" was not a movie I would typically watch.  But, it just happened to be ""let someone else pick the movie for a change"" night and so I gave it a try.  While it isn't an outright horrible flick, it was exactly what I expected...and that's not why I watched movies.For a basic plot summary, ""Best of Me"" tells the story of Amanda (Michelle Monaghan) & Dawson (James Marsden), two 30-something adults brought back to their mutual hometown by the death of a friend.  As they get re-acquainted, their romantic backstory is shown via flashbacks, with Young Amanda (Liano Liberato) and Young Dawson (Luke Bracey) navigating the trials of young love.  Back in the present, the two must reconcile the lives that were with the lives that are.The trouble with this movie is that it is exactly as predictable and sappy as one would think...nothing more, nothing less.  If you are a sucker for these types of movies and like to know what to expect when going in, than you will probably love this type of film-making.  However, if you want a few genuine surprises and relationships that don't feel like they are being heavy manipulated to stimulate tears and tug on the heartstrings, than you should probably stay away.An interesting thought when it comes to Nicholas Sparks book-to-film translations: I don't have any ""hard numbers"" to back me up on this, of course, but I think it is a pretty safe bet that ""The Notebook"" has best the most well-received.  I know young and old (and many in between) who have thoroughly enjoyed that flick.  The reason?  It was first.  Everything after that has kind of been a different variation on the same theme: sappy romance with large doses of tragedy.  I wonder if perhaps the novelty is wearing a bit thin with films like this one.That being said, it seems like there are easily enough people who like this formula and will continue to populate theaters for it.  If you are able to take everything strictly at face value and not think too much, I can see how it would be very possible to get swept away in the dramatic experience.  Nothing wrong with that...but not my cup of tea by a mile.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UY6NTHJCN553/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QK4ANMK#wasThisHelpful","R1UY6NTHJCN553","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was drawn to ""Aquarius"" for tow main reasons: 1. I'm an X-Files fanatic (so the return of David Duchovny was interesting to me); and 2. I just finished watching ""Mad Men"" and was hungry for another period piece.  Sadly, the show failed miserably to deliver in either aspect.  I quit watching after six episodes.For a basic plot summary, ""Aquarius"" centers on LA cops Sam Hodiak (Duchovny) & Brian Shafe (Grey Damon) in the year 1967.  First and foremost on the docket: The disappearance of Hodiak's daughter Emma (Emma Dumont) into the Helter Skelter cult just being set up by Charles Manson (Gethin Anthony).  Clashes with civil rights groups, tough/corrupt cops, and gritty crime drama also ensue.Had this show been exclusively about Charles Manson and the story behind his cult following, I think it might just have been a runaway smash success.  The scenes where he is on-screen are palpable with emotion (superbly acted by Anthony), as we as viewers know the kind of sick man he will eventually turn into.  I watche dthis show for even longer than I probably should have just to see a bit longer how his angle would play out.Unfortunately, pretty much every scene that doesn't feature Anthony's Manson is either boring or a complete mess.  Despite being set in the 1960s, ""Aquarius"" never felt like a ""period piece"" to me.  I never was truly transported into that era.  It tries to incorporate elements of 60s culture into the flow of the show, but (as previously noted), the only portion that works is the Manson Cult.  A big reason for this is that the acting (especially by Duchovny) is so understated, droll, and (dare I say) boring.  For a show in which much of the promotional material centered around Duchovny's Kodiak (and he really is the fulcrum for the show's plots), it is truly a disaster to have him be such a shallow, uninspiring presence.  I'm not sure if Duchovny just isn't as great of an actor as he once was, or if this just wasn't a role suited for him.One final observation: It probably isn't all that fair to directly compare ""Aquarius"" to ""Mad Men"" (as comparing anything to ""Mad Men"" is a tall order), but I'm going to do it.  The reason I feel justified in doing so?  I can't help but think that the network planned this out as sort of an ""outlet"" for ""Mad Men"" fans (like myself) grieving the recent end of that show (which was also set in the same time period).  Whereas ""Mad Men"" took great care with the characters and period references right from the beginning, this show tries to just mash everything in without exploring character motives or taking a step back to contemplate.Thus, ""Aquarius"" had three avenues for potential: Duchovny, period setting, and Manson angle.  As it turned out, Duchovny was terrible, the period setting was not at all convincing, and there wasn't nearly enough ""Manson stuff"" to sustain interest.  For a show that oozed potential from the very first time I saw a trailer for it, ""Aquarius"" sure crashed and burned quick.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVMB6JGHQ6WDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y2DQD3Y#wasThisHelpful","RVMB6JGHQ6WDA","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Perhaps the most important thing to point out in this review, first and foremost, is that I read Gone Crazy in Alabama having not read the two previous books in the series: One Crazy Summer & P.S. Be Eleven.  As such, I felt that this book, purely as a stand-alone experience, was a bit disappointing.For a basic plot summary, this book tells the story of three sisters (Delphine, Vonetta, & Fern) who are uprooted from their Brooklyn home and dumped at their grandmothers home in deep-south Alabama during the summer of 1969.  While there, the sisters learn about farm life and a long-standing family feud, while watching a man walk on the moon and witnessing hooded KKK riders.There are two problems I had while reading this bookone specific problem, and one more general:The general problem is that I didnt feel like the characters were all that well-developed.  Now that I realize this was the third book in a series, of sorts, I better understand why I felt this way (at least, it makes more sense).  For those (like me) reading this without that foreknowledge, though, it might be a bit of a struggle to really understand all the characters and identify with them.The specific issue (completely independent from any issues dealing with previous material) was that I didnt like how a massive section of the book deals with a long-standing feud between Ma Charles & Miss Trotter, half-sisters from the same father that live across the way from each other.  If you break this novel up into thirds, the entire second third, if you will, consists of little more than the sisters going from Ma Charles to Miss Trotter and reporting what one says to the other.  I got a bit restless reading this back-and-forth for so long.So, I think that your overall enjoyment of this novel will likely be determined by whether or not you have read the others in the series.  As a stand-alone title, Crazy In Alabama didnt strike me as anything too special.  It does a decent job weaving in some period events (moon landing, KKK, etc.), but for a story that is all about the characters, there just isnt enough growth to make you care as much as you need to.  However, perhaps a person would have a wildly different perspective having already been acquainted with the characters from the previous books.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BUA3TWJUAGLJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062215876#wasThisHelpful","R1BUA3TWJUAGLJ","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a young adolescent in 1999, I remember watching ""Entrapment"" and enjoying it immensely.  It was one of my favorite films from that time period.  I just recently watched the film again in 2015 and discovered two things: 1. The film is pretty much made for adolescents; and 2. It truly is only a product of its times.For a basic plot summary, ""Entrapment"" sees insurance agent Virginia Baker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) on the trail of notorious art thief Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery).  Whereas other agents have failed to catch ""Mac"" and bring him to justice, Virginia hopes to use her seductive powers to catch him off-guard.  What follows is a game of cat-and-mouse in which you are never 100% sure who is the cat and who is the mouse.Purely on a plot level, this film isn't all that bad.  There are a number of twists/turns, as well as a ""who is playing who"" atmosphere in which viewers never quite know which side any character is on until the very end.The major problem with ""Entrapment"", though, is that it is badly miscast and contains characters that you really don't care about from beginning to end.  Sean Connery was having a bit of a late-career resurrection in film at this point, but all it does is create a number of uncomfortable moments of him leering at the shapely, svelte Zeta-Jones.  For a movie that so heavily plays on a seduction angle, it is almost comical to see an old man such as Connery playing the leading role.  Then, there is the subsequent issue that there really isn't any great chemistry between those two leads (again, probably due to the enormous age gap).  End towards the end of the film, when you are really supposed to care about how those two feel about each other, all that potential emotion falls completely flat because it is so unbelievable and acting so unconvincingly.Another issue with this film is that it seems to want to create a sleek, technological environment, yet surprisingly little technology is actually used.  There are a few scenes (especially the opening) that look really great, but otherwise there is a lot of roaming around an ancient mansion and inside art museums.So, I believe that ""Entrapment"" can very clearly be designated a ""product of its times"" and only that.  Back then, Zeta-Jones was a sex symbol, it was still a novelty to see an ""old James Bond-ish Connery"", and the film was set right before the turn of the millennium.  I can see young theater-goers of that time finding some enjoyment out of the experience (I know I did!).  But, analyzed as purely a film, it falls short of even being called ""okay"".","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12XEOQLBQYRKV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ENC5YW#wasThisHelpful","R12XEOQLBQYRKV","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always been fascinated by baseball history, especially the Dead Ball era (early 1900s).  When I saw this book, it was ""right in my wheelhouse"" and I knew I had to read it and soon!  If a book has the names Cobb & Lajoie on the front cover, I'm probably reading it.  Unfortunately, though shedding some light on a very interesting topic, there were too many sections of the book that I ended up just skimming through for me to consider it a really great read.For a basic summary, this book tells the story of the hotly contested 1910 American League batting title race between Ty Cobb & Nap Lajoie.  In that year, an automobile (still a relatively newfangled device in U.S. history) from the Chalmers corporation would be award to the top batsman.  Predictably, the race between two of the game's greatest hitters comes right down to the wire, with an ending that has been under the microscope of historians since that fateful day.Probably the hallmark of this book is that even though I'm a fan of that era, I really hadn't read anything to this point delving into this exact topic.  I already knew a lot about the two principles and the players around them, but this exact batting race and kind of ""slipped through my historical cracks"".  I was fascinated by the race itself, the public's perception to baseball at that time, and the nonchalance given to official scoring back in those days.  It was most definitely not like today's stat-obsessed culture.  Back then, not too many people attached significance to one's exact stats/averages.  That is why the Chalmers car angle is so fascinating, as it was the first time a notorious prize was given to a personal, rather than team, experience.Why just the three-star rating then?  Because after about 100 or so pages, the batting race itself has wrapped up.  The next 100 pages or so take place almost exclusively in depositions with league officials (Commissioner Ban Johnson plays a large role in the proceedings) and the key contributors to the potential ""fix"" (I don't want to give away too many details for those who don't know this story).  I ended up skimming most of those pages and seeing my interest dwindle, as it is very dry reading.  I suppose it needs to be done to tell the whole story, but I think that maybe even too much detail than needed is gone into.The ending of the book really picks up again, as there is much discussion about retro-changing of stats of the old-timers (precipitated by the stat technology we now possess) and I found that to be fascinating.Overall, this is a book that may struggle a bit to find an audience.  Most people won't have an interest in the topic to begin with, and those who (like myself) picked up because of the batting race, Cobb/Lajoie angle might be disappointed at how much non-baseball material (courtrooms, backroom meetings, etc.) populates the text.  At the very least, however, ""The Chalmers Race"" is an interesting glance into a fascinating era in American baseball culture, as well as one particular batting race that captivated the baseball-cognizant nation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GWV1IMH0Q8EZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0803271824#wasThisHelpful","R2GWV1IMH0Q8EZ","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After having recently finished a quest of sorts to read a biography of each President in United States history, I decided to watch this documentary as a sort of ""review"" after all I had learned the past few years from the literature.  I was pleasantly surprised, as this is a very well-made, engaging little series that would be good for amateur scholars like myself, or for the generalist who knows next to nothing about Presidential history.Because this series isn't incredibly long (8 one-hour episodes), it moves right along in describing each Presidency.

I'm not sure why this happened, perhaps for time constraints, but considering that the general public is probably more interested in these men than some of the earlier Presidents, it was a puzzling choice.Overall, though, I was very impressed by ""The Ultimate Guide To The Presidents"" and watched all the episode within a matter of days.

"When I first saw the trailer for ""Tomorrowland"", I was intrigued by the mysterious premise and the promise of adventure.  It delivered on both accounts.For a basic plot summary, ""Tomorrowland"" tells the story of a number of different individuals who are introduced to the alternative-universe of Tomorrowland.  A young Frank Walker (Thomas Robinson) just wants to be an inventor, and he is ushered into the strange new world by Athena (Raffey Cassidy).  It seems like he has is entire, exciting life as an inventor planned out for him.  Fast-forward a number of years and Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) is feeling stifled by a family life and school life that isn't challenging her enough.  She stumbles across a pin that, when touched, transports her to Tomorrowland for short periods.  Intrigued, Casey begins to investigate further, coming into contact with Athena herself and a sour, cynical, grown-up Frank (George Clooney).  Casey and the gang are pursued by some shady forces too, proving that perhaps Tomorrowland isn't quite as angelic or benevolent as it may seem.The strongest facet of this film is that it simply is a great adventure piece.  The characters are interesting enough to make you care, the visuals are spectacular (I'd recommend IMAX, as it truly was stunning), and the pacing is perfect.  It's been quite some time since I've enjoyed a rollicking adventure like this without rolling my eyes.Another strong suit to ""Tomorrowland"" is that it contains enough futuristic themes to hook in more sophisticated viewers.  Yes, it is made by Disney, and no, there isn't any questionable content, but this isn't a ""kids movie"" because, in all honesty, it deals with many of the same themes that ""Interstellar"" covered in its own more adult way.  Simply put, ""Tomorrowland"" is the type of movie that an entire family can enjoy.  It has adventure, humor, drama, interesting themes, and likeable characters.The bottom line on this flick is that it is just great, entertaining cinema fun.

"As a child, I remember ""The Silver Chair"" having been one of my favorite Narnian adventures.  After re-reading it from an adult perspective, I have to agree with my kid-self on this one.For a basic plot summary, ""Silver Chair"" sees Eustace Scrubb and newcomer Jill Pole whisked away into Narnia in order to find Prince Rilian, the son of Caspian and heir to the throne.  On their journey, they are given four ""signs"" to watch for and obey by Aslan...to which of course the children bungle at nearly every turn.  After meeting up with the Marsh-wiggle Puddleglum (who has a negative attitude about everything), the trio is thrust into some serious conflict between those who live on the surface of the earth...and those who dwell far below.  A mysterious green-robed, witch-like figure also plays a key role in the proceedings, and she will seem very familiar to fans of the series.""Silver Chair"" reads so well because it is truly an adventure at heart (at least as much, if not more so in some cases, than its predecessor ""Dawn Treader"").  It is a nice mix of C.S. Lewis' Christian allegories, but also just some great storytelling to boot.  The Christian themes do not severely effect the plot narratives, and vice versa.  It's probably the best story/allegory mix Lewis created in the series since the original ""Lion, Witch, & Wardrobe"".Overall, I was able to enjoy the adventure of ""The Silver Chair"" even as a 29-year old adult.  It surprised me at times, harbored some real drama, and the Christian allegories are interesting to think about if you are into that sort of thing.  I read this book fifth in the series (after LWW, Caspian, Horse/Boy, & Dawn Treader), and it's probably my second-favorite of the bunch (after LWW)...at least so far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W8VIW81K7Q0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0064471098#wasThisHelpful","R2W8VIW81K7Q0M","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a young child, I grew up squarely in the video game era where the Nintendo Entertainment System was the dominant home console.  That being said, my grandma had this ""strange black box contraption"" (with a controller featuring a single button and a joystick) that I would tinker around with while visiting.  Little did I know that I was experiencing the legendary Atari 2600.  When I stumbled across this documentary, I didn't know if it would hold my interest.  An hour later, I was completely enraptured and on the edge of my seat.There are two main plotlines that are established during this documentary...First, the filmmakers explore the legend/reality of the now-infamous ""E.T. game cartridge dump"", where supposedly a million cartridges of that game were disposed of in a giant hole out in the New Mexico desert.  The history of that game is discussed (including conversations with its primary creators themselves), as well as the reasons why the company might have decided to ""cut bait and run"" after producing what is widely considered to be one of the worst games ever created.In between the archaeological digs out in the desert, the documentary also explores the history of Atari as a company.  This includes its domination of the coin-op business, translation into the home market, and failure to anticipate the expanding nature of the business (like Nintendo would do a number of years later).As the documentary progresses, I found myself getting more and more invested in what the excavation crews would find out in that New Mexico desert.  I won't spoil what the exact findings are, but suffice it to say it has some fairly dramatic moments.  It also provided me with some history about a company (Atari) and era (late 70s, early 80s) that I didn't have a ton of knowledge about.Thus, ""Atari: Game Over"" really sucked me in and easily exceeded all my expectations coming in.  If you have fond nostalgic memories of that time period, or just are a scholar of all things video games, you will enjoy this entertaining and informative little jaunt.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DE8FKJ5C9MD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W3XNYZK#wasThisHelpful","R3DE8FKJ5C9MD7","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I initially began watching ""Gotham"", I was terrifically excited about the potential of an origins story for the city that Batman eventually protects.  While knowing that a young Bruce Wayne would be part of the show, I honestly didn't even expect much from that angle.  I knew going in that this would be mostly a police procedural dealing with Jim Gordon and some familiar villains.  With the first season having just come to a close, the show ultimately did not live up to expectations.  It is strictly a guilty pleasure, for a number of reasons.The main problem with ""Gotham"" is that its narrative structure backbone is essentially a gang war between Carmine Falcone (John Doman) and Sal Maroni (David Zayas).  There are indeed many other interesting things that happen in the show (which I will get to in a moment), but the entire structure is indeed based on the gang warfare principle.  Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Oswald Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) play major roles in the gang activities, to differing effects.  Fish is an extremely annoying, time-wasting character from the beginning, and she stays that way until the end.  Oswald starts off as the best character in the show...but then is given very little new material after the first 4-5 episodes.  All he does is stir up trouble between Falcone and Maroni episode in and episode out.The other glaring weakness of the show is that the writers/producers really don't seem to have a direction that they are settled upon.  They look to be just ""throwing things against the wall to see what sticks"".  This is not a show built on careful plot/character deliberation.  Instead, it is ""charge forward and figure out the direction when you stop to catch your breath"".  This is especially galling with the Edward Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) character.  They tease his presence during the entire season...and then give him some rush, tertiary character development right at the very end.  Obviously, nothing was planned out in the making of this show.There were, however, some great, spine-tingling moments/characters that made me tune in for all of the episodes this season despite proclaiming my ambivalence to the show practically all the way through.  For example...-James Gordon (Ben McKenzie) is a tremendous lead and I could see him easily turning into the ""Commissioner Gordon"" we all know and love.  Unfortunately, in typical show fashion, he is saddled with a terrible partner character in Harvey Bullock (Donal Logue).  Not terrible in terms of acting, but terrible in that it is essentially a tag-along character.-Young Bruce Wayne (David Mazouz) is spot on as the ""spoiled rich boy who just lost his parents but will someday become a hardened hero because of it"".  His interactions with butler Alfred Pennyworth (Sean Pertwee) produce some of the best moments/dialogue of the entire show.-Young Selina Kyle (Camren Bicondova) is a wonderful feline precursor to his later cat-ish ways.  She is also the spitting image of a young Michelle Pffieffer (who played the Catwoman role in ""Batman Returns"") and carries a great screen presence.All in all, ""Gotham"" is a show that ""has its moments""...but not nearly enough of them to sustain any sort of interesting narrative over the course of a season (or probably beyond).  I know that in the early goings of the show, the Bruce Wayne component wasn't going to be added at all.  However, it seems like the FOX producers realized that they couldn't (or didn't want to) make a show called ""Gotham"" without a Batman-ish presence, so they caved.  Not a good way to start the existence of the show...not knowing where it was going from the very beginning.I compare this first season of ""Gotham"" to the later 2-3 seasons of ""Smallville"", which dealt almost exclusively with villains and story ideas plucked right out of comic books.  That is really what ""Gotham"" is: crime noir (that could be ripped from the pages of any graphic novel) with enough canonical moments to keep Batman movies like myself interested.  Thus, if you don't mind it being a crime/police procedural at heart, you will likely enjoy the proceedings much more than I.  However, if you are looking for a true Gotham origins story (using the characters from the movies), you will be severely disappointed after the first few episodes.  It just lacks too much focus to be anything close to great.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XC0ACNR5GV4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T5D4I0Q#wasThisHelpful","R2XC0ACNR5GV4B","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Usually, I am not a huge fan of autobiographies.  I recently read Mariano Riveras The Closer and found it dry and devoid of personalitysometimes even bordering on boring.  When I saw this autobio about my favorite MLB pitcher of all-time hit the market, however, I knew I had to give it a look.  Despite a few bumps and some sour grapes, Pedro transcended most of my gripes about the genre by producing an informative, nostalgic, entertaining read.Pedro is basically the story of Pedro Martinez, told by the man himself.  A good deal of material is spent discussing his hometown in the Dominican Republic, with the other material spent on his years with the Dodgers, Expos, Red Sox, Mets, and even a bit at the end of his career with the Phillies.Of course, all of the major areas of Pedros career are touched on, such as his toils in the Dodgers minor league system, his breakout Cy Young season with the Expos (1997), his storied tenure as a Red Sox ace (including all the postseason turmoil/glory), and even a late-career resurgence as a Met.  It was fun re-living all those moments that so vividly captured the attention of baseball fans at that time.  Martinez (and co-author Michael Silverman) does a nice job of balancing the on-field action with what was going on in Pedros head.  It doesnt get too heavy in either direction.Because it is indeed still an autobio, I had to deduct a star because I didnt like a few things about Pedros areas of focus.  For example-He really bad-mouths the Dodger organization and has no respect for them.  Sounds like a lot of sour grapes, to me, for a pitcher who hadnt yet learned to dominate hitters like he did after leaving them.-Him being disrespected seemingly every time he had a contract negotiation.  In this book, he makes himself out to be the victim, while just as convincing of a case can be made that his own big mouth and surly attitude were as much to blame.-He says I dont want to talk about steroidsbut then devotes a chapter to that very topic.  It was a bit sickening to hear him feign ignorance (like so many other players of his era) of the whole ordeal.  Either that makes him a complete idiot, or he is obfuscating the truth to a large degree.  I dont know what is more pleasant than the other to put in your autobio.Thus, if you are thinking about giving Pedro a read, I think you will enjoy the experience (much more so than Mo Riveras book, in comparison).  Like I said, as a person who is VERY wary of autobios, I finished this one in very short order.  A few little gripes, as described above, but otherwise a nice little walk down baseball memory lane.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R202DCBSMQDBXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544279336#wasThisHelpful","R202DCBSMQDBXG","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What initially intrigued me about this book was that it looked to be a hilarious romp describing the first year of fatherhood using sports situations/metaphors.  While some portions of the text did indeed bring a smile to my face, the overall bleak outlook of the text made it a rather depressing read on the whole.  I needed a glimmer of hope in order to laugh/feel with the author.Basically, ""Benchwarmer"" is a book about a man's first year as a father...just in sports almanac format!  It proceeds as a serious of vignettes relating some sporting situation to what Wilker was going through in his personal life at that time.  Some of the scenarios are spot-on and hilarious, while some are a bit of a reach.  Your previous knowledge of the sports events he is describing will go a long way in gauging your enjoyment of each little jaunt.However, despite that interesting/inventive format, I couldn't ever bring myself to really enjoy this book because it was so bleak on the prospect of parenting (especially a first child).  I will fully admit that, having no children of my own, I can't directly identify with Wilker's experiences, but he almost seems depressed at times and really struggling to cope.  Instead of ""laughing along with him"", which is what the book tries to get the reader to do, I more just felt sorry for him.  At first, I thought that Wilker was just using a lot of self-deprecating humor, but as the book continued on the same tone I realized that this was not the case.  He seemed to literally be struggling that much, and that made me more sad than anything.Thus, although I did appreciate some of the humor in this book, there were too many times when I almost didn't want to pick it up because it got so depressing for me.  I just didn't want to read anymore about a man struggling with heavy, heavy issues...and then trying to comically relate that to sports scenarios.  Maybe I'm just taking the text too seriously or mis-reading the tone, but I wanted a ""message of hope"" at least somewhere in the text.  I never got it, and thus I didn't enjoy the overall experience.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJZD5P3MCZ3SN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1610394011#wasThisHelpful","RJZD5P3MCZ3SN","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most of the books in the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" series have an epic sense to them.  In ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader"", however, that epic feel is set aside for plain, simple adventuring.For a basic plot summary, ""Dawn Treader"" sees Edumund, Lucy, and cousin Eustace pulled into a painting that turns into Narnia.  They arrive smack dab in the middle of a seafaring quest to the ends of the Narnian world, led by Caspian (as well as the plucky Reepicheep).  As the Treader sails on and on, the crew encounter a number of strange phenomena in their quest to reach ""Aslan's country"" at the end of the world.As a child, I remembered this book being easily my favorite.  I can see why, as it is light on allegory and heavy on plain child-enticing adventuring.  There are dragons, wizards, spooky places, sea creatures, and more!  Rarely are there even pauses for reflection.  Instead, the action is always driving forward in this one.From an adult perspective, this one might not quite hold up.  It doesn't have quite that same ""newness"" as ""Lion, Witch, Wardrobe"", nor does it have the gravitas of even, say, a ""Prince Caspian"", despite being a better overall book.  Simply put, ""Dawn Treader"" is much more structured for the mind and energy of a child.Overall, I enjoyed the rollicking fun of this novel.  It isn't my favorite in the series anymore, but I can see why ""childhood me"" was swept away by it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16NKFXR10LJEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0064405028#wasThisHelpful","R16NKFXR10LJEV","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes, a movie only needs a great idea and a great actor to be really, really good.  ""The Terminal"" is an example of that kind of film making.  There are a number of things that prevent ""The Terminal"" from being an all-time classic, but the performance from Tom Hanks and the ""guy trapped in an airport"" premise is enough to make for a very entertaining movie.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on Viktor Novorski (Hanks), who is trying to get from his home country of Krakosau into the United States (New York City, to be exact).  On the international trip, however, Krakosau is over-run by rebels and no longer recognized by the U.S. government.  As a result, Novorski cannot return home, nor can he legally enter America.  He is ""trapped"" in the airport terminal, waiting for something to happen.  Not helping matters is that airport director Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) has it out for Viktor.  While patiently waiting for a resolution to his situation, Viktor meets a number of friends, including a potential romantic interest (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a woman he greets every day trying to get his status validated (Zoe Saldana), and a number of other airport workers who help him be as comfortable as possible in such a strange situation.""The Terminal"" is a charming movie mainly because you'll probably never watch a film quite like it.  Under the able direction of Steven Spielberg, the movie succeeds in taking a ludicrous situation and making you care about a majority of the proceedings.  Of course, it helps to have Hanks in the drivers seat of the leading role, as he turns in yet another performance that will make you think ""this can can play anything!"".  Without his presence, this would be a forgettable experience.Unfortunately, ""The Terminal"" is completely and utterly unable to capture any romantic chemistry between the Hanks & Zeta-Jones characters.  For whatever reason (likely because Zeta-Jones just simply isn't around enough), the emotional backbone of the movie fizzles.  For me, this was enough to drop the experience an entire star rating.  Had the romance angle been done better, it would have easily been five stars.  As it was, there were just too many moments towards the end of the film where I was thinking ""I know I SHOULD be wrapped up in these emotions more, but..."" instead of just enjoying the experience.Overall, though, ""The Terminal"" is a quirky, entertaining little flick that really emphasizes the ""less is more"" philosophy of making a solid cinematic experience.  In this case, all it took was a great idea and a great actor.  With those components given to Mr. Spielberg, he was able to work his magic (sans a believable romance) with the rest.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LX9JC583IUD9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005JMYC#wasThisHelpful","R3LX9JC583IUD9","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the surface, ""Nightcrawler"" is a very well-made film.  The production value is high, the visuals are great, acting is solid, and it delves into a number of very relevant themes regarding journalism and TV news.  The problem, however, is that director Dan Gilroy doesn't pause nearly enough to examine the really interesting parts of the film.  Instead, everything in the movie is kind of viewed in the abstract...with very little (and thus I would argue not nearly enough) context given in order to make it a truly great piece of film-making.For a basic plot summary, ""Nightcrawler"" sees Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) trying desperately to find a job in a rough economy.  One night, he stumbles upon a crime scene and meets Joe Loder (Bill Paxton), an independent TV news cameraman who impresses Louis with his ability to ""do the dirty work"" and get paid handsomely for it.  So, Louis decides to get into the TV journalism business himself, even doing well enough to hire a partner in Rick (Riz Ahmed).  Along the way, Louis also develops a relationship (that some might considere inappropriate) with head news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo).  Things seem to be going great for Louis and his thriving business...until the night he arrives at a burglary scene before the police, making a number of choices leading him down a shady ethical path that he may or may not recover from.Easily the two most interesting parts of this film are Gyllenhaal's Louis and the movie's examination of the TV news business.  Both of those subjects carry very weighty, relevant themes in today's society and are worthy of examination.  Unfortunately, both are also just kind of glossed over in favor of ""the spectacle"" in this case.Louis is one of the strangest characters I've ever seen on the big screen (done to perfection, as usual, by the underrated Gyllenhaal).  On one hand, you can kind of feel sorry for him, as he never seems to catch a break early on.  On the other hand, he is such a smarmy individual that he is far from like-able.  Usually I like this kind of ambiguity in my film characters, but in this case it comes off more as confusing than interesting.  At the end of flick, I didn't feel like I cared any more about Louis than I did, oh, 20 or so minutes in.As for the many themes regarding televised news, I really wish the pace of the film would have allowed even more examination of them.  There is a character in the newsroom (played by Kevin Rahm) who always bring up the ethical issues of what is transpiring, but he is quickly pushed aside each and every time.  Perhaps that is a statement being made in and of itself, but I still feel like the movie wanted us (as viewers) to take a few too many things at face value.  I wanted to see the principals struggle a bit regarding their decisions.  There just didn't seem to be any conflict in what was happening.Overall, though, ""Nightcrawler"" isn't a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination.  In my mind, it is the complete and utter personification of a ""three star effort"", as it easily did enough to hold my interest, yet didn't do anything more to really make me care in the end.  To me, this was very much a ""take it or leave it"" experience.  Had some closer examination of themes/characters taken place, I think it could have been much, much more interesting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R301RD34KKS86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q3DMJZW#wasThisHelpful","R301RD34KKS86","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I had enjoyed the previous (first) season of ""Hannibal"", there were a few things that prevented me from giving it five-star billing (mainly, a number of ""procedural"" episodes that seemed a bit like time-fillers).  With the basic premise of the show now set, however, this second season becomes a tour de force, with not a moment of ""wasted space"" or downtime whatsoever.(Minor spoilers ahead)For Will Graham (Hugh Dancy), this season is all about redemption.  As the season opens, Will is in the Baltimore psychiatric facility, being suspected as the Chesapeake Ripper after his mind has been completely manipulated by therapist Hannibal Lector (Mads Mikkelsen).  Of course, we (the viewers) know that Hannibal is to blame all along, so that knowledge only further intensifies Will's quest to prove his innocence.  Jack Crawford (Laurence Fishburne) and Dr. Alana Bloom (Caroline Dhavernas) are stupefied by this strange turn of events, while Dr. Frederick Chilton (Raul Esparza) tries to play both sides in his quest for glory.  Even Hannibal's old shrink, Dr. De Maurier (Gillian Anderson) cannot helped but be roped back into the action.To give you an example of the type of energy this season provides, consider this: the first scene of the season gives glimpses of a furious brawl between Hannibal and Jack Crawford.  Obviously, something has come to a head.  Yet, without any resolution or reasons why the confrontation happened, the action abruptly jumps back in time to slowly, over the course of the season, ""fill in the details"".  Essentially, it's a flash in the pan, followed by a slow burn to reach that point again.By this point in the show, all the characters have really found themselves and turn in consistently great performances.  There are even some extraordinary ""OMG"" moments that rival anything I've ever seen in a televised drama (and a network one at that).  Gone are the days, most certainly, when the show couldn't (or wouldn't) decide exactly what it wanted to be (waffling between charge-ahead drama and pace-conscious procedural).  Now, each episode is back to the gills with action, drama, and character development.Sadly, this season of ""Hannibal"" still proved to be a ratings disappointment.  Perhaps the graphic content (on a network) has something to do with that, or maybe people just don't want to take the time to understand the often thought-provoking actions behind the show's drama.  Either way, it's still a little tough to believe that the show may very quickly have an ax over its head, as it is so clear that series creator Bryan Fuller is producing a show of the utmost quality here.Thus, with this incredible second season, ""Hannibal"" easily made the jump onto my ""favorite shows not to be missed"" list.  A third season is scheduled to begin in the summer of 2015, and I hope the new change of scenery (the previous two installments were spring airings) provides a bit of a ratings boost to keep this deserving little gem afloat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB33VZV0OL5J5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LHVZIT4#wasThisHelpful","RB33VZV0OL5J5","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first heard that Vince Gilligan was working on Breaking Bad spinoff ""Better Call Saul"", I dismissed it as an oddly-conceived cash grab for AMC.  I mean, seriously...a show all about Saul Goodman?  Nah, that'll never work...right?  But then, something a bit strange happened: All the pre-show reviews/buzz gave it incredibly high marks.  It got picked up for a second season before the pilot even aired!  All of that being said, I settled in to watch that opening episode with very low expectations.  10 episodes later, I was amazed by the quality of the show and the continued genius of its creators.  If only I could figure out what the heck kind of a show it is (or wants to be)!The basic premise of ""Better Call Saul"" sees Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), essentially a con-man, trying to make it in public law defense while running schemes on the side.  He's got a cramped office (in the back of a salon owned by a number of Asian women), crashes with brother Chuck (Michael McKean), a once-great lawyer who Jimmy reveres, but now has some sort of strange sensitivity to electronics (or is it all just in his head?), and seems to have very little future.  He is connected to the law firm managed by Howard Hamlin (Patrick Fabian), primarily through a female friend Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn), but doesn't seem to be too well-received around the place.  Oh yes, and let's not forget...the ""ticket-taker"" parking lot attendant just happens to be a stone-faced figure named Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks).It's very tough for me to describe a show like ""Better Call Saul"", because to be honest, I've never quite seen a show like it.  Whereas some TV shows produce serial episodes (like Breaking Bad did) and others take a more ""plot of the week approach"" (think Person Of Interest in its most basic form), this show manages to do both at the exact same time.  Each episode is about something almost completely different than the next...yet there is still tremendous amounts of character growth from beginning to end.I won't throw in any absurd spoilers here (maybe some minor ones), but when the show begins, it looks to really be skirting off the coattails of Breaking Bad's success.  Nacho Varga (Michael Mando) makes a very quick appearance, and just the whole look/feel/vibe of the show screams ""BB nostalgia!"".  By the third episode, however, the show turns into Jimmy's quest to change from ""Slippin' Jimmy"" to a respectable lawyer.  Just as soon as that has happened, the show takes an abrupt aside to focus on Mike for an entire episode before its back to Jimmy & Co.  Towards the end, more time is given to Jimmy's strange relationship with brother Chuck, female friend Kim, and a potentially new career path that could offer him some legitimacy...if he chooses to fully embrace it.Suffice it to say, this show shifts gears quicker than Slippin' Jimmy himself can concoct another rip-off scheme!  I can honestly say I've never seen a show cover so much ground (and diverse ground at that) in the span of just 10 episodes.  The plots/scenarios of the show play on a very interesting dynamic: even though the viewers know exactly who/what ""Jimmy"" will become, we tend to forget that while we are watching because the stories/characters are so engrossing.  Just when we (as viewers) think we have everything ""figured out"", however, we are always reminded that we know exactly how this Jimmy character is going to turn out.  So, the show really taps into two distinct emotional areas: The one where we WANT Jimmy to do something, and the one where we KNOW he is going to do something...the question just being ""when?""Yet, despite all the praise I have heaped on the show so far, I can't give it the full five stars for this opening campaign for one main reason: I really just don't know what I am watching yet.  It's like each episode is a non sequitur.  A very entertaining non sequitur, to be sure, but just all over the map in terms of plot from episode to episode.  Like I said previously, I've never watched a show like this before...one in which I enjoy it each week but can't quite put my finger on how/why.Putting things into perspective, though, I actually thought that ""Better Call Saul"" had a more intriguing initial season than its cousin ""Breaking Bad"" (which I felt took a whole season and a half to really find the base of the characters).  This show does it in the opening scene of the opening episode...tight from the word ""go"".  I enjoyed each and every episode, and will be waiting patiently until the next installment of Jimmy McGill's inevitable journey towards Saul Goodman.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BMQZF6KNRQHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R15JYHW#wasThisHelpful","R1BMQZF6KNRQHU","AP3B615GM191G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP3B615GM191G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In COOTIES, Elijah Wood plays a wannabe-writer from New York named Clint. Forced by failure to move back in with his mom (THE OFFICE's Kate Flannery in a criminally-underused cameo) in his hometown of Fort Chicken, Clint turns to substitute teaching to pick up the slack until he can finish (and hopefully sell) his horror novel about a demonic boat. On his first day on the job, he meets a bevy of kooky coworkers as well as a school full of obnoxious kids who get even more unmanageable once they eat some tainted chicken nuggets and start turning into blood-thirsty zombies.Penned by horror-vet Leigh Wannell (SAW, INSIDIOUS), this film relies pretty heavily on its central image -- fed-up teachers clobbering pre-teens with savage abandon -- for both its horror and its comedy. It works well at the start, but when the second and third acts fail to build on the premise in any interesting way, the movie starts to drag. There are a few plot points that suggest the movie wants to be more than just a slaughterfest, including a love triangle, a microscopic subplot about how kids are over-medicated, and lots of talk about how the nugget virus works and can be stopped, but nothing comes of this. There are a few hurdles for the teachers to overcome here and there, including finding cell phones and food for a character with diabetes, but these obstacles feel like half-hearted attempts to disguise the fact that the movie doesn't know where it wants to go with itself. In fact, a conclusion never really gels, and the movie seems to end before the story does.This is most evident in our characters, none of whom really change or grow, existing mostly as uninspired stereotypes. This is a shame, since the cast list is pretty impressive, including Rainn Wilson as a Dwight Schrute-ish gym teacher, Jack McBrayer as Jack McBrayer, Jorge Garcia as a shroom-loving security guard, and Matt Jones as an unfortunate police officer. Because none of them are asked to move the plot forward, the characters are basically one-note jokes that get repeated over and over, including Clint's pretentious obsession with his writing (in lieu of teaching his kids, he has them read his book aloud and give him notes), Jack's possible homosexuality (his lines exist primarily as double entendres), and Jorge's movie-long shroom trip. Even the love triangle that builds through the second act is quickly abandoned in favor of moving the film to a new location, not so that the story can build, but simply so we can watch the characters battle zombie kids in a new, creepier location.It's a shame that so little work went into the writing, because so much more work clearly went into everything else. Our set pieces are pretty great, as is the music. And the cinematography is A+ quality, starting from the opening credits sequence which films chicken nuggets being made with a gorgeous sumptuousness that is at odds with its glistening nastiness. The gore, also, is plentiful and effective, even more so when you consider that much of it is sold by child actors. Unfortunately, like the bulk of its cast, the tale itself feels underfed and like it wasn't given the chance to mature into a story that's worth telling. Any opportunity to give the flick more backbone -- whether by making a point about kids and Ritalin and teachers' poor wages, or by amping the stakes with the death of a central character -- is squandered in favor of showing more bloody battles with the kids. These turn out to be decently entertaining, but -- without clear stakes or the driving tension of a good story -- they fail to be terribly interesting or memorable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2879UCX9697RV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015IVEATW#wasThisHelpful","R2879UCX9697RV","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROM RIDE tells the story of eight teens who are on their way to prom when their stretch limo is hijacked by a mysterious assailant who is intent on torturing the young couples for some unknown reason. It is the kind of movie that looks like it was filmed over a weekend and then edited overnight. There is a critical problem with the pacing, but that might be due to the writing, which is juvenile and uneven.Claiming to have been ""inspired by TRUE events,"" the film skitters back and forth between footage from smartphone video and more traditionally cinematic shots. Neither one works that well, but combined they way they are, so haphazardly and thoughtlessly, they bring out the worst in each other. They also make the padding in the film (of which there is a lot), a lot more obvious and mind-numbing. This includes a stupid beach prank, a really dumb five-minute musical dance number in a clothing store, and lots and lots of shots of people dressing or admiring the stretch limo or just generally being high schoolers on their way to prom.Normally, this is where the character development and exposition would be located, but there's not a lot of depth to our story or its players, and the only stuff of substance that we get is a tidbit about a couple that's saving their virginity for prom night and a (obligatory?) make-out scene with two girls. There's more mindless prattle and some drunken montage-ry before the limo ride finally goes south.It doesn't go that south, though. Ludicrous implausibilities abound, and even if your disbelief is light enough to be that easily suspended, the ""horrors"" that take place in the limo are so poorly choreographed and filmed that they are laughable. One ""fight"" that occurs consists of one character punching another character over and over for about three minutes, and it is so poorly acted, directed, lit, and edited that it comes across as an overlong joke.Only three real things of any note happen in this movie, and like everything else, they happen with a sort of half-hearted, lackadaisical care, like everyone on set was on ambien or maybe thought they were just doing a rehearsal run-through without realizing the cameras were actually rolling. I don't know that more energy would've saved things, although it might have made the film a bit more vibrant and maybe would've detracted from the abysmal performance that nearly every actor turns in (although, interestingly, the kids do a better job than the adults; the parents at the beginning and the cops at the end tied for first place as the worst performers of the film).Dull story. Dull execution. Dull everything. If you and your buddies like to watch bad films and make fun of them, you might have something here to work with, but overall, this is just another bland and lifeless product of our over-saturated media landscape. Technology has made filming movies easier than ever before, and as a result, the internet is now bloated with thousands and thousands of flicks just like this one: movies that people make just because they can, without ever really stopping to ask themselves if they should.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP9BIGLBYHP09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XLOJOBS#wasThisHelpful","RP9BIGLBYHP09","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"STUNG follows the swarm-horror formula so closely that its predictability almost becomes a reminder of why that formula exists to begin with. This means it's not necessarily a bad film, but it's also not a terribly memorable one. Since it expends enough energy (and not a drop more) to toe that line, if you're a genre fan, you'll enjoy it about as much as you make up your mind to.The film is populated by convincing caricatures. We have Paul, the clownish lead male, a man-child with a hero's heart, and  his boss/love interest, Jessica, a woman with daddy/control issues. Jessica runs a catering business that is working a wedding on a large estate owned by a spoiled/bitter rich kid toiling under mommy's ancient thumb. Include a token cougar, a ne'er-do-well mayor, and a Latino maid (among other similarly shallow archetypes), and you have a nice crowd of people ready to be mowed down by our resident evil: in this case, a swarm of wasps that have developed mutations as the result of some hastily-explained chemicals.Although there are some disappointingly-shaky CGI sequences, the film also relies on some satisfying PFX for more than a few scenes. The acting is decent, even considering the rather sparse character development found in the script, and the gore is plentiful. The film excels mostly at its pacing, spacing the action so perfectly that audiences aren't allowed too much time to dwell on how derivative it all is. At least until the ending.As with most formulaic films, STUNG is (ultimately) about a man who wins a woman. Even though it tries to give Julia a personality and her own, personal arc, really she exists mainly to be the reward for when Paul manages to subvert his own goof-off persona and find the moxie in him to save the day (or does he?). Although the movie shows shades and tones of something that wants to be nastier, sloppier, and wilder than the formula it follows (this includes the flick's final shot), it ultimately boils down to the same, basic wish-fulfillment that a lot of horror (and all other genre) films are based on: a guy doing what it takes to finally win the girl, right down to a head-shakingly ludicrous sex scene that owes a lot to early Bond films.This might have worked more had the previous 80 minutes been more clearly satirical. Clearly fun was had and almost no one involved (from the writer to the director and his cast) took any of it too seriously, but they also didn't try as hard to subvert the formula as they did to follow it. Expertly tongue-in-cheek (almost to a fault), the film would have benefited more if it had stuck that tongue between its lips and had blown a big fat raspberry right at the audience, instead of giving it exactly what it expected.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X7GY17LNAZC3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UVEVGC#wasThisHelpful","R2X7GY17LNAZC3","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story behind CREEP is simple. Aaron (Patrick Brice) is a filmmaker who needs some extra cash, so he agrees to go to a cabin in the woods (natch) to meet Josef (Duplass). Dying of a brain tumor, Josef hires Aaron to film him during the day so as to leave a video will of sorts to his unborn child. During the course of the filming, Aaron begins to realize that there is something off about Josef. Maybe it's the brain tumor. Maybe it's something else.Although the movie is not long (at 77 minutes, it's more a short than a feature), only about three or four events occur in the whole thing. This makes the movie seem longer than it really is, and not so much in a good way. The audience is kept on its toes by what are clearly two unreliable narrators, but the ""what's true and what's not?"" aspect of things only holds water as long as we care or are interested in the characters. However, whatever sympathy is elicited by Aaron and whatever curiosity is elicited by Josef quickly starts to wane as the movie progresses without many actual events or contextualizing reality. Just like our lead character, the movie seems to be 99% talk, which is rarely creepy in and of itself.Fortunately, Duplass (notable for approaching filmmaking the way water approaches its lowest point: via the path of least resistance), low-key to a fault, has enough weird charm in his eyes to keep the movie from being a total exercise in self-indulgence (part of me wondered if the idea for the movie wasn't kickstarted by people telling Duplass that he sometimes makes them feel uneasy). Plus, the setting of the woods gives us enough uncertainty that the mere possibility of something happening is tantalizing enough for a bit. However, when the film moves to other locales, it starts to feel forced and aimless and hastily improvised. By the time we get to our legitimately creepy ending, it feels like the climax of very little actual rising action.While it does want to be scary (or at least unsettling), the movie is also trying to skewer found footage horror in a number of ways. Take, for instance, the jump scare, when something non-scary happens in a loud and sudden way so as to make you jump in your seat. This is a common (and very annoying) trope for horror movies in general. As Aaron films, Josef constantly jumps out and yells ""boo!"" to try to scare him. In fact, he does it so much that it is clearly their way of mocking the trope. However, it's also -- cleverly, I'd say -- a way of retooling the trope so that it IS scary (creepy, I mean) that this guy keeps doing it. In other words, it takes something not scary and makes it scary in a different way.This is what makes it hard not to like CREEP. It's trying to do the same old thing in new, inventive ways. It is, unfortunately, doing it without also having much in the way of a story to build on. As a result, the talent behind and in front of the lens feels formless and flat, and it is used to tell a tale that doesn't even seem to know where it's going until it finally appears to stumble across its own conclusion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26Z2U6GJGZ0MP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011KK862C#wasThisHelpful","R26Z2U6GJGZ0MP","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A year and a half ago, I reviewed a film called SORORITY PARTY MASSACRE. I expected it to be a bad movie, but in a cheesy, fun kind of way. The movie WAS bad, but in a bad way. It had very little of anything you'd expect from a film with that title.GIRL HOUSE delivers pretty much everything I expected from that first movie, and does so in a strong, competent way. The film follows a secluded house that is wired to the gills with cameras as a sort of Big Brother-ish version of a porno webcam show that runs 24/7. The girls who live in the building are visible at almost all times to the horn dogs who subscribe to the site to switch around between cams in bedrooms, bathrooms, and showers. You can even watch the ladies watch TV with curlers in their hair and skin cream slathered on their faces, if you're into that sort of thing. One of the subscribers, however, has a less than healthy interest in the ladies and this leads to a full on assault on the house, where we see just how hot-blooded these ladies really are.There is a nearly non-stop stream of T&A, and when the bad guy gets going, the movie goes full-tilt into gory slasher territory with no hesitation or apology. The makers of this film know exactly what its audience wants and it gives it to them. Unfortunately, it also never once attempts to be creative, nuanced, or unique in the least. The dialogue is rote and predictable. The characters are all one note. Even the title is about as uncreative as it is possible to be. My wife and I kept trying to figure out what the movie's twist would be only to discover that there is no twist. For once, what you see is exactly what you get. I'm not saying that's necessarily bad, but I am saying it's lazy and results in a film that's fairly forgettable.Or kind of. Unfortunately, the film does two things that lowered my rating for it. The first is it overtly compares itself to Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW. Although there are some obvious parallels -- people around the world watching the massacre on the webcams are unable to stop the killer -- the comparison is not very flattering, at least to anyone who has seen Hitchcock's far superior film and gets the winking joke in the script. Also, the movie is more than a little preachy about online webcam porn, the women who provide it and the men who consume it. The message is very clear: the writer does not approve. The girls who are killed are some of the vainest, most vapid characters put on screen, and the girl who survives is described over and over as ""the wholesome"" type, ""not the kind to normally do this sort of thing,"" and is the only one you never really see naked.This is hypocritical in a film that draws much of its audience with the explicit promise of plenty of nudity, capitalizing on the very thing it's not-so-subtly pooh-poohing. ""Here are some super sexy ladies without their clothes,"" it seems to say. ""Now lets kill them all for being so slutty."" It's kind of dizzying.Competent in nearly every other way (even if it never aspires above mediocrity), the film should satisfy the basic urge of any classic slasher lover, even if it does so with an edge that could use a little sharpening.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11SWNZTXQV5I9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPELEDE#wasThisHelpful","R11SWNZTXQV5I9","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For a movie that gives away its twist on its poster, I-LIVED takes a long time to get to its point. The film follows Josh, an over-educated and under-employed 20-something who wants to make a living reviewing cell phone apps. (I said he was over-educated, not smart.) He reviews an app called called I-Lived that promises to help you achieve any goal that you input into it as long as you successfully do the missions that it provides for you. I'm not giving anything away (unfortunately) by revealing that the app was actually created by the devil, and that when you agree to the terms and conditions (without reading them, natch), you are essentially selling your soul.Since the poster and trailer both give away the ""secret"" of the film, the burden of the entertainment lies on the story, acting, and directing, all of which fall short in one way or another.Big problem here: our lead is extremely unlikeable. It's hard to pinpoint what's more to blame, the way he's written, acted, or directed. Perhaps it's a combination of all three. When he's reviewing apps, he behaves with a choppy, frenetic, cartoonish goofiness that rapidly grates. When he's disappointed by his life, he's flat, dull and featureless. When he's scared, he mostly looks confused. When it becomes clear that his life and his (ill-gotten) achievements are at risk by supernatural forces, it's hard to care since he doesn't really demonstrate any traits worth rooting for. Halfway through the film, seemingly out of nowhere, he starts to worry about his cancerous mother's health, but this feels like a half-hearted ploy to rig sympathy that was shoved into the script at the last minute. He also has an ex-girlfriend that is meant to provide him with sympathy, but in her only scene, she is so poorly acted and written that she feels like some kind of absurd joke character.The directing is off, since the film can't decide if it wants to be goofy, dark, otherworldly, or truly terrifying. There's the sense that maybe they wanted to blend all of those elements together, but they aren't blended even a little bit. As a result, the movie shifts tones often, making it hard to get into any kind of groove with the plot. This includes an abrupt ending and a brief, on-the-nose speech by the apps designer himself in a scene with a visual gag that's shoved in your face -- for laughs or chills, I have no clue.The overall story has the potential for some serious juice, even if it is very clearly a rip-off of Stephen King's NEEDFUL THINGS, just updated for the modern techno-age. It's just too bad that the people involved didn't try harder to find unique places in the tale to go to instead of taking the easy route with nearly every scare or plot point. This is evident even in the title, which has the ""e"" spelled backwards in case you are the dumbest of the dumb and can't figure out that ""lived,"" spelled backwards, is ""devil"" (because Satan's marketing department stinks).","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23LHCL0VO5T5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011484TS0#wasThisHelpful","R23LHCL0VO5T5P","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In THE JOKESTERS, a group of guys called the Prankmasters (famous on YouTube for their prank videos) decide to throw one last big prank on a member of their crew who is getting married. The synopsis (written by the screenwriter/lead actor, Nathan Reid) calls it a ""Cabin in the Woods"" prank that goes ""so well that it actually becomes The Cabin in the Woods horror in real life.""If you're a first-time filmmaker, it's generally wise to avoid mentioning in your script or promotional materials other, far superior films. It invites comparisons that are rarely flattering.This very short film (it's barely 80 minutes long) spends the bulk of its time following the Prankmasters (why is the film called THE JOKESTERS and not THE PRANKMASTERS?) as they do pranks, ruin Ethan's wedding, and generally treat each other like crap. You have Ethan (the hot one who's getting married), Chris (the one who sometimes speaks in Spanish), and Andrew (the one who is not the other two). The fourth member of their crew, Nick, is by far the most obnoxious. Scriptwriter Nathan Reid plays him with an unrelenting juvenile abandon that quickly annoys everyone around him. That includes me.For a movie that classifies itself as found footage horror, there is very little of that promised terror. It takes 55 minutes for anything remotely interesting to happen, during which we are treated to a series of pranks that include things like ripping off a girl's top and then running away, locking the car when someone gets out to pee by the side of the road, and putting a two-day-old jockstrap on a friend's face. (I'm surprised no one gets a phallus drawn on their forehead.) This hour is clearly meant to provide us with character development, but the script obviously doesn't know what constitutes ""development."" There are a few plot points dropped here and there, but mostly the story just spins its wheels. There's a hint at a gay subplot that could've made the movie a little more unique if not interesting, but this is quickly abandoned.The final twenty minutes of the movie are a hasty, scattershot mess with two very heavily foreshadowed twists. Perhaps hoping to make up for the glacial pace of the previous hour, the last act of the film is unnecessarily rushed (especially considering that the movie doesn't even have the run time of what most would consider a feature film). Although we are treated to some decent effects and shots (for an indie), they are cobbled together with so little awareness of pacing that they play like a highlight reel, like the editor got tired of trying to tell a story and just slapped together all the creepiest scenes that they filmed without adding any of the connective tissue that would make it interesting or coherent.There's a clear stab at a possible sequel, including a segment where a news reporter (a friend of the bride from the aforementioned wedding) learns on-air about the Cabin in the Woods horror that (possibly?) claimed the lives of her friends. (I'm pretty sure television reporters preview the stories they're going to read and don't just wing it live.) The same reporter also -- in one of the laziest tropes a screenwriter can employ -- delivers a big chunk of parting exposition (the kind of stuff that should've been salted into the first hour of the movie) to justify the choppy mess you just watched.If the last quarter of the film had been stretched out to form the bulk of the film, and if the twists and turns had been more skillfully employed, and if the character development had been actual development, even if the pranks had been more creative or the jokes less childish, this might have been worth the viewing. As it is, the only thing genre fans might get a kick out of is the fairly liberal T&A (and that includes of the male variety, in case you're into that sort of thing).","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8DIWKZZ5DVW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W7AG2AI#wasThisHelpful","R8DIWKZZ5DVW4","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an interesting little doodad. Interesting, but not terribly useful.Let's start with the logistics of using the thing. You are meant to use the device anywhere that you experience acne. This is to be done for 3-4 minutes per application, twice a day. After a 6-8 week treatment period, you move into maintenance. Maintenance is 3-4 minutes per application, twice a week total. The booklet says to expect possible redness and irritation upon initially using the device, but my redness never lasted very long.The device works by emitting blue light and exposing your skin to heat. According to the literature that came with it, Blue's light and heat combo work by breaking down the bacteria in the pores that are the culprits behind acne and other blemishes. Realistically, the device seems meant primarily for those people who have chronic acne but only in spots. If you have chronic acne all over, using this device as directed would require hours. Even someone with just average acne problems is probably going to need half an hour (if not more) for a full session.It's also not a good device for use on or next to the nose. When I get blemishes, they're usually in that crease between the cheek and the nostril.  Applying Blue there means smooshing your nose to the side and hoping that the blemish is getting enough of the light and heat. Blue is also not designed for spot treatment.  When I have a blemish pop up here or there, it's usually gone within the week, especially if I apply some benzoyl peroxide. With a 6-8 week treatment period, Blue doesn't seem like the proper tool for eradicating spontaneous, short-lived zits. That means that when all is said and done, this tool is a reasonable purchase only if you have chronic acne that affects just a few small, easily reached areas.There are also a few technical issues with the device. When you turn it on, you must wait for the green light to indicate that it's ready, and then you press it against an affected area. Upon contact with your skin, the blue lights illuminate and the head gradually heats up. After the 3-4 minutes, you move the wand to another spot. Once it loses contact with your skin, the lights and heat are meant to turn off. However, frequently the lights remained on after lifting the device off my skin. At least once every couple of days, I had to turn it off and back on. Less frequently, the lights would not come on at all.  A quick power-cycle fixed that for a time.Although it seemed to work as directed (more or less), it's hard for me to recommend the device. First of all, I can't guarantee that my blemishes went away because of the device or just due to natural causes. For me, zits don't stick around long unless I pick at them, so the ones that faded away on my face may have done so because it was just time. Secondly, the amount of time one is required to spend holding a heated light to your skin is pretty problematic unless you were already planning to spend the next half hour or more sitting around doing nothing. Therefore, I recommend you try out Blue only if you have one or more of the following:1. Chronic acne that occurs in very small patches;2. Overly-sensitive skin that reacts badly to chemicals like benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid; or3. A ton of free time to use Blue on larger acne-prone areas","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WA7TOVRO8BSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ET86JSG#wasThisHelpful","R1WA7TOVRO8BSD","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As others have noted, this doesn't work with some newer models of phones, though.Cons:Definitely designed for backpacking and camping. This is not the pack for carrying textbooks or documents.Rigid internal spine. Probably effective when needing to maintain good posture with a full pack on a long hike. Not so good (uncomfortable) to toss in a few essentials for a day at the park with the kiddos or even just errands in town.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DMWJFWSP7ARB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFCF59Q#wasThisHelpful","R3DMWJFWSP7ARB","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't know who Jude was when I purchased this book, and you don't really need to in order to enjoy the stories. His tone and voice is much stronger and more mature than you'd expect from the person portrayed in the pages. Autobiographical almost to a fault, this collection of true tales pretty much deals exclusively with drugs, sex, and (maybe you'd call it) love. The lens for each story is unflinching and unclouded, and our narrator is guilelessly straightforward about his thoughts, experiences, and general level of depravity and dismay.The biggest flaw with the book is that the stories get repetitive after awhile. If they aren't about him doing drugs and/or having sex, they're about his family or his longing for the One That Got (Thrown?) Away. Each piece is beautifully written and achingly sincere, but the themes blur into one long, monotone landscape after awhile. The force of his honesty starts to lose its edge when you read about the same basic confessions over and over. He has a knack for analyzing his mistakes and self without coming across as preachy or self-pitying, which is amazing actually and keeps the tales moving without ever growing too stale, but in retrospect it feels like some of the pieces could've been eliminated or joined together to avoid blunting their energy with repetition.Minor quibbles for what is one of the best story collections I've read in a long time. Beware: these tales are about as X-rated as they get without crossing over into full-out smut.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R139O9G70SR4AH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476789304#wasThisHelpful","R139O9G70SR4AH","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BIG TIME is a crass, off-kilter comedy drama about two oblivious wanna-be filmmakers who are better at creating trouble than actual movies. When their parents threaten to kick them out of the house, they go to extreme lengths to figure out a solution. Needless to say, they tend only to make things worse.Saying much more would ruin the enjoyably twisted and convoluted story line. Like a lot of shows these days (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia comes immediately to mind), this one features obnoxious idiots as our protagonists, but they are portrayed by a couple of charming guys with great timing. They're also surrounded by a lot of great talent, including some new faces (John Bass as Del is perfect and seamless) and some old (Cuba Gooding, Jr. as you've never seen him before).The story gets very dark very fast, but it moves with such snappy precision (and is so elegantly contrived) that it's hard not to be impressed. It keeps itself and viewers on their toes, so the grim tone never gets too heavy to handle, unless you get a little squeamish at the sight of blood. If you don't mind a little gore and enjoy a good dark comedy, BIG TIME is among the best out there right now. A parody of a self-obsessed generation that lacks self-awareness (among other things), the show is even brilliant at times, but enjoyable regardless if you have the brainwave for that kind of stuff or not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38NRA2ICF6AIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UEQ5CPS#wasThisHelpful","R38NRA2ICF6AIL","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Considering its Olive Garden budget, TIME LAPSE manages to execute its intriguing premise with some impressive skill. Unfortunately, significant elements of the script come across as juvenile or half-formed, resulting in a viewing experience that is half-awe and half-scoffs. Or maybe a little more of one than the other.The story is about apartment manager Finn, a budding artist who shares an apartment with his girlfriend, Callie, and his pill-popping buddy, Jasper. One day, they discover that a tenant has died, leaving behind a camera that can take pictures of the future. Once the friends find the photos and start trying to figure them out, things quickly spiral out of control. Are they causing the pictures to happen, or is it the other way around? Are we in charge of our fate? Which came first: the future or our picture of it?The bare bones of the story are pretty interesting and worth a good post-film conversation with anyone who's got the patience for time-paradox discussions. The problem is that the film's idea of conflict is pretty adolescent. Although the movie focuses mostly on our three leads (almost aggressively so, including a weirdly-framed shot at a party where every single person is dancing with their backs to the camera except Finn, Callie, and Jasper), it tosses in a violent bookie to amp up the stakes. The problem is that the bookie is not a very threatening guy (I'd lay money that his beard is glued on), and the paranoia and chaos that results from his introduction to the film makes very little sense. A lot of explanations for this might lie in the fact that Jasper is constantly doing drugs, but even this is portrayed in a half-baked way: Jasper carries around a metal case that is filled with a random assortment of pills of all shapes, colors, and sizes, and he ingests them and shares them with others without seeming to distinguish between which pill is which, like they all do the same thing even though they're clearly different. This is like what a prepubescent kid might imagine when they think of a guy who's addicted to pills. It just smacks of laziness and/or ignorance, which is a shame, since the actual plotting of the film clearly took some time and brains.While the whole film may not add up to the sum of its parts (there's much that's lukewarm, including the acting, set design, and even the title), and while there is a level of immaturity to the film's general idea of reality, the philosophical thrust of the story and the nuts and bolts of its timeline (as well as its small handful of secrets and twists) are pretty satisfying overall. You take what you can get: I enjoyed the film when all was said and done, but I have a hard time recommending it to anyone who doesn't already have a lot of free time on their hands.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HGF3TZART1PL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XR39WKQ#wasThisHelpful","R2HGF3TZART1PL","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll admit: I have a soft spot for Vince Vaughn. He's done a lot of stinkers at this point, but I've never disliked him or his performances. His problem these days seems to be that he's got no quality control on what scripts he chooses to do. Consider UNFINISHED BUSINESS, a film that feels very much like it, too, is unfinished. The script concerns a salesman named Trunkman (Vaughn) who is sick of getting jerked around by his boss, so he leaves to start his own company with two other workers. A year later, and he's still searching for that one elusive deal that will legitimize his business. His last chance, it seems, is in Germany, where he and his coworkers go to get the handshake that will ensure their success.There are a lot of weird gaps here. The actual mechanics of the business deal are vague to the point of irritation, and when it is mentioned, it's a clutter of businessy-sounding words that don't mean anything. All viewers are guaranteed is that Vaughn's business has ""better numbers,"" so it deserves the deal more. This is a surprise, because Trunkman's company isn't really a crack team. Wilkinson plays a downtrodden man who is afraid of his hideous wife and Franco is Mike Pancake, a guy who may or may not be mentally handicapped. The character comes close to being seriously annoying (some might even say offensive) except that Franco does such a poor and uninteresting job of portraying him.Everything a comedic script is supposed to have locked down -- conflict, pacing, jokes -- feels vacant and tired. Every gag is more like a set-up of a gag than anything else, so that when Trunkman unwittingly finds himself having a conversation with a glory hole, you wait for the punchline or the pay-off but to no avail. That's the whole joke: he's talking to a guy in a glory hole. Character development happens the same way. Trunkman has issues with his kids that are crammed into the script so awkwardly, it feels very much like they were a second thought that was hastily scribbled in by a last-minute script doctor.As charming and Vince-Vaughn-ish as ever, Vaughn does his best to sell the material, but it's just too weak to work on any level.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R370STROZSGG2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBRGMI6#wasThisHelpful","R370STROZSGG2I","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, if you enjoyed the first MAD MAX, then you'll almost certainly enjoy this one. It's got the same heart, drive, and attitude as the original without being a carbon copy of it. Mad props to George Miller, the man who wrote and directed all of the films. His dry, tribal vision of the apocalypse remains as solid and gripping as ever. (It's hard to believe nearly every non-Max film he's done has involved cute, CGI animals prancing around.)Second of all, if you've never seen any of the Max films, know that they are exercises in Showing, Not Telling. One of the most common rules of scriptwriting is that the less dialogue, the better, since that means more is being communicated by the drama and visual aspect, which are the two most important components of a film. I've never seen the script for FURY ROAD, but it wouldn't surprise me if dialogue composed no more than 10-15% of it. The tale here -- of rebellion, redemption, and revenge -- is what amounts to three long action sequences strung together with a cobweb of exposition.The majority of non-stop action films are dull because they confuse activity with action, filling the screen with energy, fire, and violence as a substitute for story. These grow tedious to watch, since the movies spend so much time on the speeding cars, fight scenes, and explosions that they leave no time to convince viewers that we should care about who's in those cars, fights, or flames. FURY ROAD carefully crafts its sequences so that they are as much about the character and story as they are about giving viewers something cool to look at. Not that there's nothing cool to look at; you've probably already heard about the flame-throwing guitar.That makes it sound over-the-top, and it is, but in a way that makes you want to redefine where the ""top"" is. This future is heavily stylized (FURY ROAD LESSON #38: After the apocalypse, everyone's eyes will look AMAZING) but the sureness of its story-telling and the quiet (for the most part) confidence of our characters keeps it from seeming cartoonish. This is quite a feat, as anyone knows who's ever tried to explain the plot in depth to anyone.Some fans have complained that this film's cast is saturated with female protagonists. As a result, our title character is forced to share a big chunk of his spotlight with others, notably Theron's Furiosa. If this is the sort of thing you think you might take issue with, you might not enjoy this film. Also, I feel sorry for you. No characters are extraneous, and whatever politics you think you can ascribe to the cast's heavy supply of estrogen, it's still never turned up nearly half as loud as the frenetic artistry that surrounds it and propels it forward. Although this is a serious movie, it is clearly designed not to be taken that seriously, so if you find yourself bristling at implied politics (the film contains hints at class warfare and wealth distribution), maybe you should take a step back and focus on that flame-throwing guitar for a second.A film that sets a specific goal for itself and accomplishes it perfectly, MAD MAX sets the bar for the rest of this summer's inevitable deluge of action blockbusters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VGCQD77DYVZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XOXDXV8#wasThisHelpful","R1VGCQD77DYVZX","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been over a decade since this was released, but I recently had to go back through some old music, and when I rediscovered this gem, I figured I'd add my voice of praise to the mix.I won't go into the mixed expectations that haunted Sneaker Pimps after the success of BECOMING X and the (according to some) mixed love of SPLINTER. I will say that, even as a shift in gears from their previous stellar offerings, BLOODSPORT is an excellent album. It's a record that is mixed and mastered with authority and a certain level of maturity, but that's written and composed with a lot of dark, playful energy. I'd argue there isn't a bad track in the whole thing. Even the songs that are stand-outs vary depending on who you're talking to. Some reviewers praise ""Loretta Young Silks"" as their favorite, but I like it the least (without actually disliking it). I prefer the grim propulsion of ""The Fuel"" and the chaotic beauty of ""Think Harder."" Still, I don't think there's a misstep in the whole line-up.A strong, sometimes-raucous, often-beautiful, and intriguingly complex album, BLOODSPORT mingles songs of melancholy and praise into a set of imminently listenable electro pop.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QWPKYNQSKJZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036YI8M4#wasThisHelpful","R1QWPKYNQSKJZD","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE LAZARUS EFFECT is a horror/thriller that squanders an intriguing premise on cheap scares and shoddy plotting. It seems sometimes to be missing some connective tissue in the dialogue or editing that would give the story more flow, which makes it feel a lot longer than its lean 82-minute run time would suggest. My guess is this thing was chopped to shreds in post-production. Whatever the cuts were supposed to improve, I'd say it didn't work.The story is nothing new. A group of scientists have developed a serum that can revive a dead brain. Any seasoned horror movie fan knows that when a film is about bringing creatures back from the dead, inevitably something supernatural is brought back with them. This movie is notable, at least, for blurring the lines between science and spirituality. When our leading lady is brought back from the dead, she's not the same, but it's unclear whether the change is chemical or demonic. In fact, for an intriguing moment, the movie seems poised to argue that there's a way it can be both, but then it devolves into dumb, predictable slasher-y territory.This might have worked better had the rest of the film been a bit more interesting, but this nifty twist on an old trope is surrounded by a lot of cliched window dressing, including a canned ""You're playing God"" speech as well as a shadowy corporation that suddenly threatens to take the research for no good reason. There's also a lot of stuff that is stupid or nonsensical, such as scientists taking home a test animal that they just revived from the dead and living with it like it's their normal pet dog. At one point, the elevators stop working and the characters announce that they are trapped in the building, even though there is clearly a sign next to the elevators that tells people to use the stairs in an emergency.At least we have a decent cast that tries hard (for the most part). Olivia Wilde does her best as our revived leading lady (a plot point that is revealed in every trailer but which still takes nearly half of the movie to happen), and Ray Wise is a nice treat in a brief cameo. Unfortunately, our leading man, Mark Duplass is a cold fish for the bulk of the film. Duplass has never met a scene he couldn't underact, and although that serves him well in his mumblecore romantic dramas and quirky indie flicks, it's a huge detriment in a film where he's supposed to act terrified for his life or devastated by the death of a loved one. He could've been wearing a plastic mask of his face over his real face and his performance would be 99% the same.It sets out with a cool idea, but this movie quickly dies, and no amount of demonic black eyes and spilled blood is able to bring it back to life.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VVI85U4OWGOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VUK4REO#wasThisHelpful","R1VVI85U4OWGOX","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's nearly impossible to watch or talk about this film without being reminded of PULP FICTION, a movie that's inspired so many cheap knock-offs that it's kinda baffling that it's still going on over two decades later. How is it like PULP FICTION? Well, we have a fractured timeline that proposes to tell three intertwining tales of murder, revenge, and ill-fated romance. The flick attempts to punctuate its straight-faced humor with cavalier violence, and even has a character who wears a black suit, is an ""expert"" at dealing with assassinations and murderous situations, and is (shamelessly, I'd say) named Wolfe. As our characters' fates intertwine in complicated ways, the movie even tries to throw in some light-hearted kookiness, like a woman who accidentally hits her husband with a car or a killer who stops in mid-murder to answer his cellphone. These things are played as jokes, but they come across as half-formed and derivative, as does the rest of the film.The biggest difference between this movie and PULP FICTION (and the biggest reason why this film fails), is that the characters are uninteresting, one-note caricatures who never once do anything to earn our sympathy or attention. Even the abused wife who is the subject of our central assassination fails to strike a note of empathy since we never learn anything about her as an individual with a personality. Everyone is like this, a watered-down version of a real human being who dutifully fulfills their stereotype without ever adding a dash of flair or panache. Likewise, the script rests on its loopy knot of a plot without ever attempting any moments rich with suspense, drama, mystery, or any of the other things that make a film, you know, fun to watch. Instead, scenes are stitched together with overlong musical interludes (the same surf-noir song seemed to play non-stop throughout the film whenever no one was speaking), and gaps in logic are never even partially addressed (biggest example: a character with a massive and life-threatening gambling debt never considers selling his palatial, shore-side home, which could clearly pay his arrears ten times over).It's dull. It's derivative. It barely knows what it's doing. Killing it once would be too good for it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZT7LYPJ4QR2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7WNQYC#wasThisHelpful","RZT7LYPJ4QR2L","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Spare, smart, and sharp, EX MACHINA is a strongly-directed thought experiment on A.I. and humanity's ever-growing reliance on (and susceptibility to) technology. Nathan, a brilliant-and-reclusive tech billionaire, invites Caleb, one of his lowly programmers, to his personal estate to test the humanity of his latest invention, a robot named Ava. Nathan says Caleb's job is to give Ava a Turing test (a test designed to tell if a computer has true intelligence or just simulated intelligence), but as secrets and trust-issues and lies start to build, the real story turns out to be more complicated than that.With just three characters (okay, let's call it 3.5), the movie feels a bit like a stage play, right down to its pacing, action, and set design/staging. People without much love for sci-fi (especially for its more cerebral varieties) might find themselves running out of patience with the film. Maybe wanting to give audiences time to really process the implications of the story, the flick moves at a leisurely pace. It's not slow -- not a single shot of the film is wasted -- but it is a little indulgent at times, especially when the soundtrack takes over for the dialogue.It's also impressive just how fantastic everything looks considering the relatively small size of the budget. Add in the understated acting and weighty/economical scripting, and you've got an excellent sci-fi parable. Some might hanker for a bit more action or excitement (a la Blade Runner, perhaps). When you look back on it, there's not a whole lot of actual meat on the bones of the plot. But the ideas presented by the story are plenty enough to chew on for viewers with the interest in sifting through them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34VUK7J2RS4WD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VWPQNJ4#wasThisHelpful","R34VUK7J2RS4WD","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROJECT ALMANAC is a found-footage, time travel film that wastes everything cool about its premise on predictably cheesy high school drama. Here's all I'll say about the found-footage aspect of the movie: it was completely unnecessary and -- given the way certain scenes are shot -- the movie is well aware of that fact.David is a brilliant inventor (and the son of one, too), who can't afford to go to MIT. By chance (I'm skipping a lot here), he discovers a time machine in his basement. It's not humming and ready to go, though, and he and his brainy friends spend the first hour of the movie trying to get the thing into working condition. Meanwhile, David's sister films literally everything that happens, and David occasionally pines from afar for the beautiful Jessie, his longtime crush.One flaw with the film right away is that the producers cast a guy who looks like a professional model, making his geeky awkwardness around Jessie really hard to believe. Even his friends mention his fantastic ""bone structure."" I'm sure that was supposed to be a wink at the very thing I'm complaining about, but it seems lazier and less effective than casting a guy who, you know, looks like he would have trouble with girls. Still, I can ignore this for the most part. After all, looks don't automatically make you charming.However, it's really hard to ignore the massive plot holes that form when the movie tries to be philosophical or even just funny. After an overly long build-up, when the kids finally figure out how to use the machine, they use it -- of course -- to change the past. There are some cool segments where we see some of the effects of the time travel, including the danger of deleting yourself from existence, but none of these rules are adhered to very well by the script. It passes over its own logic in an attempt to be heartfelt. Scenes aren't designed to make sense so much as they are to fill you with laughter, longing, or a vicarious thrill as the teens go back in time to pass failed tests, attend Lollapalooza, or even to woo one another.Maybe if I cared more about teens passing tests, attending Lollapalooza, or successfully flirting with one another, I'd have enjoyed this part of the film more. Unfortunately, our two leads are so attractive and so clearly designed to end up together, that their romantic subplot never did it for me. Neither did our two buddy characters, who were pretty much interchangeable. Although the film takes a cool and clever approach to setting up its time traveling reality, it gets stale and kind of childish with its second act. The options for a movie like this are pretty vast, but this one chose to oversimplify in favor of a few low-hanging ideas.The final lesson of the film is a good one, in spite of the pedestrian way it was told. More odd logical loops show up to tantalize us with the close of the film, but they don't entice so much as confuse. It's normal for a time travel film to have a few loose ends or contradictions, but it's also normal for those things to be at least brushed past or disguised. This movie turns one of its largest plot holes into its last parting shot for the audience, which takes all of the oomph out of the story's real ending.Even all of this would be forgivable if the film wasn't nearly 110 minutes long and didn't spend the first half of that trying to prove it has an above-average brainwave. It takes so long for it to establish its own rules that when it inevitably breaks some of them, the effect is annoying, made even more so by how frustratingly close the whole movie comes to being truly entertaining.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R272YLPJXGICGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SY9YDIE#wasThisHelpful","R272YLPJXGICGE","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There's a lot of extremely flattering praise on the back of this book. Ken Wilbur, for instance, glowingly says that author ""DeHaven is either a thinking man's Tucker Max, or an idiot's Hunter S. Thompson."" Who is Wilbur? No clue. The blurb says he's got a PhD and works for California's Marketing Magazine Journal, but that's not a lot of help. If he's the Kenneth C. Wilbur of the website of the same name, then I'd argue his opinion doesn't carry a lot of weight.The blurb that really caught my eye and convinced me to read the book, though, was by a man named Michael Scripps, who declares that ""DeHaven makes Bukowski look like a Disney writer!"" This is a pretty bold statement to make, especially since the only Michael Scripps I could unearth anywhere online is a convicted felon serving time for stealing over three million dollars from his own mother.That might be the joke. After all, this book is all about blurring the line between fiction and reality. The book's forward claims that ""this is a true story."" The idea is that DeHaven was bamboozled by a free-lance self-help writer named Michael Enzo. To get back at Enzo, DeHaven published this collection of some of Enzo's journal entries. There is even a brief and tepid Twitter war between the two writers, although it's not very convincing.The book is not so much a novel as it is a collection of short stories, most of them about Enzo's life ""on the razor's edge."" Because they don't really connect in any meaningful way, it's hard to maintain interest in anything that happens. It also makes it harder to get a bead on Enzo himself, and what the whole point is other than to very, very, very lamely mimic Bukowski's darkest protagonists, right down to the gambling, alcoholism, sex, and self-loathing.The tepid mimicry (maybe you'd call it an homage) isn't the book's biggest problem. Because it pretends to be about someone who writes self-help books, there's a great chance to see the blurry borders between how we live our lives versus the lessons we learn from it. But DeHaven isn't really interested in exploring that. Instead, the book is a series of uninteresting tales about being in the Boy Scouts, dating a porn star, and stealing cars to pay back gambling debts, the whole lackluster mess peppered with inspirational quotes that you might find in self-help books scrawled in the margins. It's hard, even here, to tell how serious the book is trying to be, because most of the marginalia is the worst kind of meaningless profundity. ""Life is a series of lies that wind up on the cutting room floor,"" is one of the worst of the lot.The stories also have these constant narrative digressions that are meant to be chummy in a kind of absurdist way, making a sliver of a joke's worth of sense in an attempt to come across as familiar and friendly. But really, it just reads like forced posturing, not the least because none of it is nearly as funny or clever as it thinks it is. Mostly it just makes you furrow your brow and think, ""Wha?"" For example, here he describes the car he drives: ""This particular model was from the only year Plymouth made the Neon before the marketing giant Dodge bought them in a close-out deal worthy of the main character in PRETTY WOMAN (not the hooker), if only there were some gerbils involved. Oh Dick, you silly bastard.""The final nail in the coffin is that the prose is so inconsistent. It can't decide if it wants to have the dismissive jokiness of a frat boy, the hard boiled grittiness of a Bukowski-type loser, or the faux-insightful intelligence of a philosopher. At best, this kind of fluctuation is just annoying or disorienting, but at its worst, it creates moments of cringe-inducing awfulness. Much like the self-help quotes and the jokes, oftentimes they make absolutely no sense even if they sound like they should. Here's an example: ""The sun induces a reflective state of mind and has a sobering effect. Especially when it looks in your bloodshot eyes and pounds jealousy in your heart, its misdirected envy toward the moon pouring in briefly to smash your soul.""Actually, that line there is pretty much indicative of the whole book.

"Is your bathroom a debris field of loose toothbrushes, crumpled tubes of toothpaste, and massive webs of unorganized floss? Do you constantly catch yourself muttering, ""Now where on Earth did I put that stupid water pick?"" When you go to do your oral ablutions, is your sink so cluttered that you grasp comically at your hair and say stuff like, ""If only there was a better way!""I thought so.Well, bemoan no more, because here comes the InterDesign Med Plus Dental Center! It's plastic! It's clear! It has four slottish-type areas for toothbrushes or other long items, like pencils, if you're the type to write a lot of bathroom memos. It has a larger section for larger things, like tubes of toothbrush, or tubes of other things, like anti-fungal cream or rolled up memo pads. Plus, since it's plastic, it's easy to clean and will never, ever biodegrade, so that you can pass it down to your children, and your children's children, and your children's children's children. As long as humans exist that long and don't evolve away their teeth in favor of, I don't know, acidic cheek pouches.And guess what? This baby is yours for just eleven bucks. That's right! For the price of a pack of cigarettes or a ticket to see the matinee showing of Teen Sex Comedy #5,409, you can finally clear all of the mostly unavoidable chaos that your bathroom is bound to be in.Or you can, I don't know, use like a drinking cup or something instead.

"Names are tricky. Long ones are good if you're a royal dignitary or an essay by David Foster Wallace. Short ones are good if you're a recreational drug or a child's doll. This item is called the ""Turtle Beach Ear Force Stealth 400 Premium Fully Wireless Gaming Headset For Playstation Blah-blah-blabbity-blah."" I get that this is a use-specific set of headphones, but still. Having a name that won't fit on a typical Twitter message is a sign that maybe you're pigeon-holing yourself. Or trying too hard. Or not enough?Not that these are bad headphones. They come pre-charged, so you can use them immediately (who likes waiting?). Also, they've got a pretty impressive range. They worked up to 50 feet away in a signal-heavy environment (these particular items were tested in a TV studio). They've got nice sound, packing a great bass level, and it's a snap to cycle through it's various EQ settings with just one button. (This, granted, might be a flaw for people who prefer to fine-tune their own levels rather than put up with pre-set standards.)The headphones' wireless audio lasted for over fifteen hours, which is what I would call a marathon gaming session, although some players might just call that ""Monday."" The headsets also had distinct controls to set game and chat volumes, as well as a removable headset mic. And they appear to be compatible with almost any device with a headphone jack. That's nice.But problems? Yeah, there are a few.-- The documentation says that the headphones and the transmitter are already linked up, but they were not in my case. It took me ten tries using the instructions to sync the devices. You'd think this part would be automatic.-- There aren't readily noticeable indicators for which side is Left or Right. I mean, one side is saddle-bagged with all of the controls, but that's not a dead giveaway. After much searching, I found discreet L and R letters on the inside of the headphone arch, which is kind of a counter-intuitive place to put them.-- Be prepared to feel like an airstrip with the nonstop blinking lights. I thought the blinking signaled that the headphones were syncing, but they never stopped blinking. At first, it wasn't such a big deal, but if you're the type of person to wear them for a long period of time (i.e. any serious gamer), you might start to get annoyed by the constant flashing. I can only imagine the chaos that might be caused by a whole room of epileptic gamers wearing these things. The hilarious, hilarious chaos.-- The headphones have some seriously annoying Siri-voice feedback that is constantly telling me what I already know. ""Powering on"" the voice says as I turn them on. ""Bass Boost"" the voice announces when I turn on the bass boost. What possible reason could there be for this function? Are there really gamers out there who need this kind of validation? ""I know I turned it on, but it would be nice to hear a disembodied voice remind me that I did. You know, for the heck of it."" It wouldn't be so bad if you could turn it down or off, but -- worst. idea. ever. -- this stupid voice is not only unavoidable, but it completely mutes all other audio while it talks to you. What this means is that every time you perform even the most mundane of functions, you risk missing important audio from the game you're playing.-- CLICK! If you turn off the headphones, get ready for an eardrum shattering CLICK! Because who doesn't want to be aurally thumped in the ear when you're done playing?","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF87B0E5P67UK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSQAACO#wasThisHelpful","RF87B0E5P67UK","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everyone knows that babies are usually up to no good and cannot be trusted. This is why they must constantly be monitored. But there are so many options out there for worried parents who need to spy on their babies. How does this particular device stack up? I sent this to my brother who has a particularly mischievous baby girl and asked him to tell me how well it enabled him to keep tabs on his child. Here's what he had to say:PROS:-- The device is light and compact, making it easy to cram into tight places or conceal in nooks and crannies. The baby will not know it is being watched.-- It is remarkably easy to set up and use. Even the most idiotic of parents could figure it out, provided they haven't swallowed it first. It is very small, as I said.-- You can link up to four cameras to one monitor, all of which can be cycled through with ease.-- You can take your baby's temperature with it. Hot babies, as we all know, are the most dangerous of babies. The only catch is it must be used as directed: by placing it a 1/2 inch from the baby's head. This may be difficult if your baby is recalcitrant or anti-authoritarian. It is still easier than jamming a thermometer into one of the baby's orifices, though. It is also handy for gauging the temperatures of any other liquids you wish to subject your baby to. You know what I'm talking about.-- It's got pretty good color resolution for its size, and when the lights get low, the camera switches to an infrared night mode! Ha ha! Take that, baby! No sneaking around at night and getting into monkey shines and other subversive activities. My brother said this was handy for all types of night surveillance, not just those related to suspicious babies.-- The device claims to work from up to 500 feet away, but that is only true if there are no walls or obstructions between the camera and monitor. So, you'd have to live in a bowling alley or something. However, my brother said it worked fine up to 100 feet away with six intervening walls, so in an average house, it should be just fine. Unless you live in a mansion and/or wish to sleep very, very far from your baby, in which case, your problems are greater than what kind of monitor to buy.-- You can not only hear what's going on near the camera, but you can also respond with a microphone on your end. This is in case you wish to speak to your baby, but cannot be bothered to pause whatever Saw movie you are in the middle of watching. The sound quality makes you sound like a principal announcing the lunch menu at a grade school, but this will prepare the baby for the drudgery of school that is soon to come.-- There are many helpful accessories, including a stand, belt clip, and even a light bar that indicates the volume of the sound near the camera. This is in case you are sick of your baby's constant pleading and wish to turn down the volume during polite dinner functions or meetings, but still need to know if the baby's screaming continues unabated. Or if the baby has gotten hold of a power saw or something.-- The batteries last for a long time as long as you are not constantly checking the monitor, which goes into standby mode after a long period of having no buttons pressed. The listed power life is 3 hours, but my brother timed it at a little over 7 hours. Keep in mind, during this time, my brother only checked the device 6 times because he is foolishly very trusting of his baby.-- The monitor alerts you when it is getting out of range or running out of juice.-- The camera has a nice wide angle, which is great if you are living in that bowling alley I spoke of earlier.-- You can pan and tilt the camera to see the surrounding areas, just in case you suspect your baby of having enlisted outside assistance.CONS:-- The device is made of what feels like a very cheap plastic. If you hurled it violently at an intruder, it would probably disintegrate. The device, that is. Not the intruder.-- The screen resolution is only so-so. You can get a good idea of what's going on, but you're not going to be able to pick out any moles or scars or identifying marks to make sure that it is your baby that is in the monitor and not some kind of imposter.-- Although the range is good enough, it's unfortunate that there is no option to link the device to your own personal wireless network so that you can stream securely to an online location. This would allow you to monitor the baby from a remote location, such as a nice, fancy restaurant where you are far, far away from your baby.-- The battery takes 16 hours to recharge. This is ridiculous. Do you know how much mischief a properly motivated baby can get into in 16 hours? It would also be nice if there was an option to keep the monitor on without having it go into standby every few minutes.-- The pan/tilt option is something of a gimmick. It does specify that it is a ""digital"" pan and tilt, but not a lot of people know the difference. Basically, what this means is that it zooms in on a larger image, and then lets you move the image around. You're not actually moving the camera. That they are including this option is tacit admission that the screen resolution is mediocre and requires zooming.So there you have it. A decent device for the price. Good luck with your baby, and keep watching the cribs!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33J0BUU8BG7M6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IM8FXP4#wasThisHelpful","R33J0BUU8BG7M6","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OBVIOUS CHILD bills itself as a romantic comedy about abortion. Romantic comedies aren't usually known for their originality, but this film deals with that hurdle right off the bat with its risque subject matter, facing the taboo head-on with fart and diarrhea jokes. This gives it a sense of freshness that you don't often find in the rom-com genre. If ""fresh"" is the word I'm going for here.The film is about Donna, a twenty-something New Yorker who is also an aspiring stand-up comedienne. After a devastating break-up with her boyfriend (and, by extension, her friend he was banging), Donna ends up having a one-night stand that results in an unwanted pregnancy. The bulk of the film is how she deals with this uncomfortable reality, and how her strengths and weaknesses are affected by her friends, her stand-up, and the man who supplied the seed.I recommend the film for anyone who's still interested, but only by virtue of the performance of Jenny Slate, who plays our lead. She does a near-seamless job with the role, managing to hit the exact right note of subtly quirky self-confident desperation that humanizes her without making her either a pity case or some kind of soldier for womanhood. She is basically just a woman, often funny, sometimes sad, usually confused, and consistently (and -- thank god -- passively) charming. Much like her stand-up, which takes a ""laid bare"" approach to humor, Slate gives us a Donna who is completely realized and unguarded without being show-offy about it.Unfortunately, the rest of the film doesn't possess even half as much complex sincerity as its lead. It really is just about a woman dealing with being down on her luck, career-, love-, and pregnancy-wise. There are no surprises, tricks, or secrets to the tale, and it only goes through the three-act formula by virtue of our love interest, a man so aggressively bland that he may as well be a mannequin. With no real flaws to speak of, and no interesting lines to speak outside of his responses to Donna, our Male Lead feels intensely out of place. The film could (and should) have been about a woman growing into her independence (and the choices required by it), but all of that is diluted by the constant presence of Mr. Decent.Fair enough, because the story doesn't really know what to do with itself. The title isn't the only cleverly aimless part of the film. There is also a completely nonsensical digression involving David Cross, the obligatory Central Casting Gay Best Friend, a hastily-delivered feminist rant against patriarchy, and a drunken-dancing musical montage. None of that is bad, in and of itself, but the film really wants to be more than that. Heck, if its main character is any indication, it wants to be well-rounded, detailed, intricate, unique, and lovingly chipped. Instead, it's disappointingly straightforward and blase. My guess is you'll enjoy watching it, but you'll finish it thinking less about the story and more about how the lead actress deserved a much, much better script.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W0WISB7F4WA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KT1B31A#wasThisHelpful","R1W0WISB7F4WA1","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Liam Neeson plays yet another grizzled, take-no-guff tough guy in this half-baked crime drama that wastes its hard-earned moodiness on silly storytelling. I'm not taking any points off for Neeson rehashing himself (he's a retired cop and reformed alcoholic named Matt Scudder) because, hey, he does it real well. In fact, he's not asked to do much more than glower in this film.Currently working as a private eye, Matt gets hired by a big time drug trafficker named Kenny to help find the men who killed his wife after he paid them a lot of money not to. Matt's detective work uncovers the work of two very dangerous and unpredictable psychopaths. Tracking them down and stopping them from killing again turns out to be dark, grisly work. Also, a little boring.A lot of small changes would make the movie work far better than it does. For instance, virtually none of the characters seem very authentic. Our bad guys work but only because their lack of personalities function the same way as the eyes of the shark in JAWS. Every other person, though, just fails to ring true. Kenny delivers all of his lines like he's trying to eject his eyeballs out of his head by sheer force of will, and when he needs to be sympathetic, he utters random facts apropos of nothing. ""I could've paid more,"" he says as Matt is leaving his house. ""I told them I could only pay 400,000, but I could pay more. It was our nest egg."" Matt, like the audience, has no idea why Kenny is saying this, and just leaves the scene. Just like this, over and over, characters speak in ways that betray their archetypes, saying lines that sound like lines.Probably the worst offender is the young TJ, a homeless black boy that Matt befriends in a library. TJ is meant to humanize Matt, but this is totally unnecessary, because Matt is already spending the entire film risking his life to find some brutal killers. TJ spouts streetwise cliches and even uses slang improperly (I was certain during the film but I checked the Urban Dictionary just to be sure, and it turns out our scriptwriter doesn't know what a ""chicken head"" actually is) and refuses to put junk like soda into his body. Twizzlers and pancakes for dinner is fine. But no meat. Meat is bad for you. Point being, when TJ shows up, the plot screeches to a halt.These things should've been chopped out of the script to make more room for places where there are unforgivable shortcuts. Biggest among these is how Matt learns of the identity of one of our villains. ""How did you know I was lying?"" asks the guilty rat. ""Because you're a weirdo,"" Matt growls. Ha ha ha! Hilarious. But seriously, how did you know?It's stuff like this, including huge symbolic bonks on the head and a constant, in-your-face references to Y2K (most of them via clunky Time Stamp Tribune paper headlines, which also let us know about gun violence) that make the film sometimes feel like it's trying to go for a really subtle kind of satire. Given the rest of the themes -- including mutilation and some pretty egregious child abuse -- that doesn't seem the case, so the whole thing ends up feeling both shoddy and overwrought.This is most evident in the film's climax, which is paused over and over so that the audience can hear some woman recite the twelve steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. The gimmick is so pretentious and so deflates the moment -- one of the few really engaging parts of the movie -- that it makes one wonder what it's even trying to accomplish other than mainlining the film's emotional core directly into your earballs. And that's really the biggest problem with the movie: it doesn't trust you to care about any of the characters, so it resorts to cheap tricks to get you to get emotionally involved rather than letting the plot speak for itself.But even that might not have been enough because our protagonist, Matt, really has no arc in the film. He's pretty much the same at the beginning as he is at the end, except by the time the credits roll, he has a new friend in TJ. But he hasn't learned anything about caring or alcohol or himself that he (and the audience) didn't already know at the start of the film. This makes TJ's presence even more blatantly a plot device. In this case, he's meant to distract from the fact that although Neeson is playing yet another man with a powerful set of skills, unlike in his past successful films, his character this time around never really develops or grows. His virtues and flaws are nearly identical, meaning he has nothing to gain or lose from anything he does. Neither does the audience, it turns out.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UPZMCL7794TW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQE6X3A#wasThisHelpful","R3UPZMCL7794TW","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FOR ALT-J NEWBIES:It's hard to categorize Alt-J's sound, which I think is often the trademark of really good bands. There's a sort of folk sensibility, but it's a lot more intricate and synthesized than you usually find in folk music. I've heard some refer to them as ""art rock,"" but I'm not sure what that is other than rock that's trying to be, y'know, artistic. The band also has a sort of trip-hop, art-house-pop feel to some of the songs, but it never feels cheap or chewy. The lead singer's voice has a delicately strained quality to it, like someone combined a yell of pleasure with a yell of pain and then slowed the resulting sound down to a gentle purr.Their first album was pretty highly rated by people more in the know than myself, and by people in general, so if you're new to Alt-J, you should probably start there. This album is just as infectious and slippery as the first, though, and it plays just as much with the mind and heart while refusing to sit still long enough to be pigeonholed. Considering that cookie-cutter pop/rock is pretty much everywhere these days, it's a treat to find something so indecipherably beautiful out there to be enjoyed.FOR FANS OF THE FIRST ALBUM:When I first played through this album, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did the first one. I wasn't sure why. The songs here seemed darker, slower, and more fragile than those in AN AWESOME WAVE. Also, it seems like there's a real attempt to make a sort of story out of the way the songs are arranged, and it's not necessarily a story with a happy ending. There was darkness in the first album, but it seemed married to a graceful energy that made it aggressively intriguing.After listening to this album all the way through, I thought I'd put on the first album and listen to it again to see if I could more clearly figure out what differentiated them. And what I heard? No difference at all.There's a definite shift in the artistic sensibility of the songs. This album does feel a bit more ... mature in its tone and themes. The songs are a little less bombastic and playful, trading that stuff in for more of a deep-water simmer. But as far as the actual quality of the writing, singing, and music, well, it's just as good as the first album. I was a little surprised, going back and forth between the two records, to realize that Alt-J had accomplished something so very rare for bands: they had created a sophomore album that showed growth and change in the band's direction without losing the skill and talent that made their first album such a hit. It's not the same, but it's not all that different, and it's still great stuff. If fans of the first album find this album a bit disappointing, I'm willing to wager that it's not necessarily because this record isn't good. Rather, it's probably because not only was the first record so good, but it also came with that soul-sparking thrill that you get when you discover something new and wonderful.This record is just as wonderful, and the band has very beautifully woven newness into it as well, but there's still a comforting familiarity to the songs. It's pretty much exactly what you're looking for in a sophomore album.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1080N13T6UA5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L2XWHNW#wasThisHelpful","R1080N13T6UA5V","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't have a child. I don't really see the point, honestly. But my brother has one -- a bouncing 12-month-old girl with giant, pinchable cheeks -- and I passed this on to him and asked him to tell me how it stands up as an educational toy for his daughter. Here's what he had to say about it.PROS:-- The box says there are over fifty phrases/songs/responses. This is true. In fact, my brother counted up to around 80.-- Like most Fisher-Price stuff, the build is sturdy, yet light. It would survive a fall from a twenty story building, although any child sitting in it at the time would probably not.-- The components in the chair automatically progress through responses as the child learns to comprehend them. In my brother's words, this was ""very cool."" You can also manually set the system level, choosing from three settings. Level 1 is all about the kid just exploring the chair and what it can do, Level 2 builds on what the child has learned and starts asking guided questions, and Level 3 gets a bit more abstract by encouraging games of pretend.-- The chair is just the right height and stability for the suggested age group. My niece -- Kyrie -- isn't walking yet, but it was easy for her to sit next to and in the chair as well as play with all of the buttons and switches.-- My brother was very excited about the chair's ability to adjust its volume. Although he liked the variety and quality of the tunes and feedback, he also saw himself getting pretty sick of it after awhile. Kryie, on the other hand, didn't seem to get too sick of it.-- The power, volume, and setting switches were convenient enough for adults to adjust, but also inset so as to be difficult for children to change.-- The chair automatically goes into a standby mode after a while and only turns on when it senses feedback. It's nice not to have to remember to turn it on and off.-- There's a big gap between the base and the seat to help prevent the accidental mashing of hands.CONS:-- The assembly was kind of a pain, even more so since the battery housing is located under the rear leg assembly, which means every time you need to change the batteries, you'll need to partially take apart two separate parts of the chair with a screwdriver. It would've been nicer to have a more accessible battery compartment.-- Although it has a lot of tunes and feedback, more actually would've been nice (and ""kinder to my sanity,"" says my brother). This, he admits, is a bit of a nitpick.-- There's not much included literature to indicate how the chair works. Adults will end up having to explore the chair with the child just to figure out what it's doing.Overall a fun and fairly inexpensive learning device with a few small, not-too-big flaws.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROPOEQHXGKWCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J49UU0I#wasThisHelpful","ROPOEQHXGKWCG","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently caught a sort of double feature of two suspense/thriller films that happened to have months in the title. Similar in both their flaws and successes, I figured I'd give them a double review.Two Faces Of JanuaryPlaced mostly in Greece in the 60's, this suspense flick follows a couple of well-to-do tourists (Dunst and Mortensen) who meet and befriend an American tour guide (Isaac) named Rydal. Rydal's a bit of a scammer, but he is taken with the handsome couple, first by their charm, and then by the fact that he ends up helping them dispose of a dead body. Secrets, suspicions and doubts unravel as the three of them are forced to travel on the run from the law.The Hitchcockian influences are pretty strong here -- the soundtrack alone begs the comparison -- and they show strong form. Edits are brisk, character development is as snappy and lush as the movie's palette, and the story has that stumbling anything-can-happen atmosphere that dominates so much of Hitchcock's best stuff. The performances are pretty much dead on, and although the characters aren't particularly likeable, they are still complex enough to be interesting.There are a few issues with the plot, mostly that the third act is prompted by a moment of stupidity so aggressive that it is an obvious contrivance to raise the stakes on our threesome. I won't give much away, other than to say that it involves someone running off of a bus for ludicrous, childish reasons, and it results in a bit of meandering in the storytelling that makes everything feel like it's wandered into a completely different film for fifteen minutes. Also, there is a bit of father/son symbolism at play in the script that works very well at the start of the film, but which gets shoved into the audience's faces by the end, mostly in some dialogue that is a bit too on the nose.This silliness aside, this lushly filmed and briskly told story is otherwise engaging and doesn't overstay its welcome. FOUR STARSCOLD IN JULYOne night, Rich (Michael C. Hall) shoots a home intruder in the face, killing him instantly. The intruder's father (Sam Shepard) comes looking for revenge, but it turns out that things are more complicated than they initially appeared. As the two men enter each others' orbits, the revelations that ensue take them into progressively darker and more gruesome territory than they ever expected.As with the other film, the performances here are spot-on and almost artistically muted. Also, like the previous film, the story-telling is top notch. Although it doesn't explore its themes or actions with a whole lot of depth, the turns and twists are compellingly consequential, and they give the film that itchy no-telling-what's-next sensation that keeps eyes on the screen, even when some of it stretches a bit thin. The dialogue is sparse and in service of the movie's overall atmosphere of actions tumbling to an unknown but unavoidable conclusion.The soundtrack here is a bit more forced, though. The events take place in Texas in the late 80's, and all of the music has that retro-synth sound that you'd expect in a typical 80's B-movie slasher or sci-fi flick. Sometimes it works and sometimes it's just jarring and weird. Likewise, our main character, Rich, tends to act as a sort of placeholder for the audience, and when the story starts to move into especially dangerous territory, the movie doesn't work hard enough to explain why Rich sticks around. There's a half-hearted stab at an explanation (mostly he's just curious), but it doesn't totally jive with his character. This weak connective tissue isn't a big deal, all things considered, but it does add some to the silliness.Just as much concerned with fathers and sons as THE TWO FACES OF JANUARY, this film doesn't totally throw its morals or message in your face. And also like that other film, it lets its story play out in an almost extemporaneous fashion. The end result feels endearingly sloppy and authentically entertaining in the way that more predictably formulaic movies are rarely able to pull off.

The performances are pretty much dead on, and although the characters aren't particularly likeable, they are still complex enough to be interesting.There are a few issues with the plot, mostly that the third act is prompted by a moment of stupidity so aggressive that it is an obvious contrivance to raise the stakes on our threesome. I won't give much away, other than to say that it involves someone running off of a bus for ludicrous, childish reasons, and it results in a bit of meandering in the storytelling that makes everything feel like it's wandered into a completely different film for fifteen minutes. Also, there is a bit of father/son symbolism at play in the script that works very well at the start of the film, but which gets shoved into the audience's faces by the end, mostly in some dialogue that is a bit too on the nose.This silliness aside, this lushly filmed and briskly told story is otherwise engaging and doesn't overstay its welcome. FOUR STARSCold in JulyOne night, Rich (Michael C. Hall) shoots a home intruder in the face, killing him instantly. The intruder's father (Sam Shepard) comes looking for revenge, but it turns out that things are more complicated than they initially appeared. As the two men enter each others' orbits, the revelations that ensue take them into progressively darker and more gruesome territory than they ever expected.As with the other film, the performances here are spot-on and almost artistically muted. Also, like the previous film, the story-telling is top notch. Although it doesn't explore its themes or actions with a whole lot of depth, the turns and twists are compellingly consequential, and they give the film that itchy no-telling-what's-next sensation that keeps eyes on the screen, even when some of it stretches a bit thin. The dialogue is sparse and in service of the movie's overall atmosphere of actions tumbling to an unknown but unavoidable conclusion.The soundtrack here is a bit more forced, though. The events take place in Texas in the late 80's, and all of the music has that retro-synth sound that you'd expect in a typical 80's B-movie slasher or sci-fi flick. Sometimes it works and sometimes it's just jarring and weird. Likewise, our main character, Rich, tends to act as a sort of placeholder for the audience, and when the story starts to move into especially dangerous territory, the movie doesn't work hard enough to explain why Rich sticks around. There's a half-hearted stab at an explanation (mostly he's just curious), but it doesn't totally jive with his character. This weak connective tissue isn't a big deal, all things considered, but it does add some to the silliness.Just as much concerned with fathers and sons as THE TWO FACES OF JANUARY, this film doesn't totally throw its morals or message in your face. And also like that other film, it lets its story play out in an almost extemporaneous fashion. The end result feels endearingly sloppy and authentically entertaining in the way that more predictably formulaic movies are rarely able to pull off.

"I figured I was in trouble when our lead -- Sadie, played by Annalynne McCord (who is basically reprising a version of the role she did with a lot more skill in EXCISION) -- awkwardly used the word ""scorned"" for the sixth time in her dialogue. ""You SCORNED me, Kevin!"" she cries at least four times. ""Hell hath no fury like a woman SCORNED!"" she announces, just in case anyone didn't get it.The story is your basic love triangle, with Kevin cheating on Sadie (as in ""sadie-istic"") with her best friend, Jennifer (Viva Bianca wearing one of the worst wigs I've ever seen). Sadie finds out and completely loses what little of her mind she had. The rest is torture, maiming, and lots of crazy-eyed stares and pointless monologues about forgiveness and the like.There are a lot of problems here. First of all, like most movies of this ilk, it can't tell if it wants to be horrifying or funny, and so it tries to do a little of both. I'm starting to think the horror-comedy aspiration is a lost cause, because it is so rarely ever done well, and this is very much the case here. If it's NOT trying to be funny, then that makes this a whole lot worse, because there's a lot here to laugh about.A big problem is that the movie thrusts us directly into the torture and maiming. It gives viewers almost no back story at all, except in a few ill-timed and poorly written flashbacks, so it's impossible to care about any of the characters at all, even more so since none of them have any depth. Kevin: rich sleazeball. Jennifer: mistress. Sadie: crazy woman. Seriously. The end.Piled on top of this turd souffle are so many technical issues, it's hard to know where to begin. The acting is laughable; Billy Zane appears to have just given up. Our victims don't appear ever to fight back at all or in any logical, reasonable way, so the suspense and torture is more baffling than horrifying. The editing is, just, wow, just a masterful cocktail of incompetence. There are at least three scenes where meaningless shots were obviously cobbled together just to patch up a plot hole. And, the piece de resistance, the soundtrack features multiple shrill songs that sound like they were recorded for a My First Slumber Party CD. Turns out the director/writer (who is best known for the LEPRECHAUN series) wrote some of these songs. I didn't recognize the name of the woman who sang them, but she had a bit part in the movie, and I have no doubt she's either related to or dating one of the producers, since she had all of the musical skill of a goose with throat polyps.A story that goes nowhere and does it with a complete lack of skill, this is one for the trash heaps.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RIM8Y5GBV5LW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8H6Q96#wasThisHelpful","R2RIM8Y5GBV5LW","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Can you believe this guy is over sixty? Whatever Neeson is doing, he's doing it right. He's back again, solidifying his emergence as one of Hollywood's better action heroes, this time taking the thrills up 20,000 feet into a non-stop transatlantic flight. Neeson plays Bill Marks, an air marshal who has struggled with alcohol and his job ever since his young daughter died. While in the air, he begins receiving threatening text messages from a stranger who claims he will kill one passenger every 20 minutes unless 150 million dollars is wired into a specific account.The film is suitably tense and claustrophobic, and Neeson does an excellent job as a man teetering just on the edge of holding everything together. As the stakes raise, and Marks starts to look more and more like the bad guy he's hunting, the film really begins to pay off. Much like our incredibly smart, anonymous killer, the script is perfectly paced and knows exactly what to do and when to do it to keep the suspense at a near boil without totally jumping the shark. All of the performances are solid and the story is clear without insulting the intelligence.There are more than a few cliches, however, that keep it from being more than just really entertaining. Also, while the film necessarily relies on text messaging to drive both the story and the mood, it does start to get a little old when you're spending what feels like five minutes just reading back and forth text messages. Also, there are a few equally necessary if not equally disappointing nods to 9/11 and prejudiced profiling, which makes a lot of sense when you've got a movie about a terrorist on a plane. Finally, there are a few minor plot holes that don't really rear their heads until you're headed home and reliving the story in your mind. But really, these are all tiny flaws in what is otherwise an excellent way to spend a tense 90 minutes of your life. If you enjoy a good action flick, you've no reason to avoid this one, unless you also have a tendency to overthink minutiae to the point of distraction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X5KYF2YZ5B6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLTD49C#wasThisHelpful","R1X5KYF2YZ5B6J","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's a lot about NEBRASKA for contemporary audiences to hate. It's in black-and-white, for one. Yuck. Also, the story and acting are all incredibly subtle and patient, and -- aside from a mugging and a quick right hook -- it's fair to say almost nothing happens in the film. Depending on how close you are with your own father or son, you might also find the movie depressing. People who live on the coast might watch the film and find themselves pitying Middle America with a bad taste in their mouths. People from the Heartland might easily feel mocked.But these responses, however legit, are certainly coming from people who are only giving the film a surface-level viewing.Painfully funny (if rarely in a ""ha ha!"" kind of way), the movie follows a quiet man named David as he takes his father, Woody, on a trip to Nebraska in order to claim a million dollar prize. Woody, always shown with a half-vacant gaze and Doc Brown haircut, doesn't appear to operate on the same plain of awareness as anyone else. It's easy to think he's teetering on the edge of senility, but many of his remarks and responses indicate a man who is not suffering from decrepitude so much as ennui or despair.In fact, the movie is chock full of people who seem to view life as a giant waiting room for some kind of Great Bland Hereafter. You will not find anyone in this film with a whole lot of passion, as if most of the cast were an embodiment for the apathetic sterility of the gray flatland that makes up the film's heart-breaking scenery. In spite of what feels like a near total apathy in the characters, there are glints and glimmers of satisfaction in the quiet, simple lives these characters lead, whether they're running hometown newspapers or just sitting by the side of the road and watching the cars go by.The real story is one of connection between father and son, and it happens at such a slow simmer that it's nearly impossible to tell when and where the relationship fully flowers into understanding. Thankfully, the film never resorts to sappiness or schmaltz, and it absolutely refuses to moralize with the script, the closest you get to a moral coming in the following exchange:A: ""What's wrong with your father? Alzheimers?""B: ""No. He just believes what people tell him.""A: ""That's too bad.""Delivered with the same dead-pan as nearly every other line, what is both sad and hilarious about that exchange is easy to miss in the stark black-and-white silence of the rest of the film. But it neatly encapsulates the point of the film: belief, connection, and how it's too bad that neither of those things ever come so easily or so neatly. A lesson that's easier said than learned, it matches this film that will try the patience of hastier viewers, but which will reward those who don't mind sitting by the road for a while and just waiting contentedly to see what happens to pass by.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29JY3TDLJ72J1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVNZ1DK#wasThisHelpful","R29JY3TDLJ72J1","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I sat down to watch SORORITY PARTY MASSACRE, I expected it to be bad. But I expected it to be FUN bad. Campy, gory, gratuitously nudey, tongue-in-cheek bad. The kind of bad that you and your friends can get a kick out of. MST3K bad.Not so.This movie IS bad, but in a bad way. It is bad because it fails to fully deliver any of the things you might expect, and it is generally so ineptly done that it becomes annoying even just to pay attention to it. Let me explain.#1: The intended audience here is obviously young, horny guys. Too bad for them. The T&A is negligible at best. You'd get more skin looking at a JCPenny underwear catalog. Also, it is quite clear that NONE of these girls belong to a sorority. Most of them look like they're in their 30s. One of them is quite clearly 40-something. I'm not saying older women can't be sexy, and I'm not saying that a movie has to have nudity to be good. I'm saying a movie entitled SORORITY PARTY MASSACRE generally leads its audience to expect titillation of a certain type, and there is none of that here. None.#2: The ""massacre"" is bush-league at best. Aside from an opening that is halfway-decent only because it shamelessly rips off the first SCREAM film, there is no real attempt at the kinds of gory SFX that movies with ""massacre"" in the title tend to have in spades. Instead, you've got maybe half a barrel of corn syrup and a ton of hasty, horribly edited cut-aways at the moment something scary or brutal is supposed to happen.#3: The movie IS funny in that baffling, partially intended way that you might expect, but the comedy is spotty. The story, regrettably, ends up taking itself seriously by the end, and as the movie limps and shuffles along, the gags and self-referential moments grow shorter and rarer. It could've been a not-entirely-wasted experience had the flick not tried so weakly to also be scary and sexy when it should've just banked on its complete lunacy.#4: Technically, the film is a nightmare. The soundtrack thinks it's a lot better than it is, and the volume of the dialogue and score is uneven. If you turn your sound up to hear the mumbled, barely coherent dialogue, keep the remote in your hand, because you WILL be walloped with a blast of sound when the music blares out of nowhere and for no reason, as happens approximately 76 times. Include an overly complex plot and a weird stab at backstory that comes out of left field, as well as horrendous make-up, costuming, and a total inability to frame most scenes or provide establishing shots, and you've got a movie that is hard to understand simply because you can't see or hear most of what's really going on.So, a warning: you might think this film would be a fun, silly way to relive the 80's slasher-era sexy-serial-killer-romps, but you're better off just getting one of those old flicks instead of trying to relive them through this garbage.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QGTBNKXALAX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOYC3DI#wasThisHelpful","R3QGTBNKXALAX3","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a dumb movie.That is NOT a strike against it. Heck, the movie WANTS to be dumb. Check out that title. That's a pretty dumb title.Maybe instead of ""dumb,"" I should've written ""silly."" Meh. I'm six sentences into this review already. Too late to turn back now.The point being: this movie doesn't take itself too seriously. This is fine in a film, as long as it's a consistent goal, and one reached with some level of skill, which is where this film falters.The story is about Joe, a mechanic with low aspirations. Joe's girlfriend, Beth, breaks up with him at the start of the film for reasons that would sound very mature to your average thirty-something, but which are made to seem domineering and overbearing in the film. She is presented as a villain because she wants him to be more interested in doing something with his life rather than sitting around listening to and playing heavy (doom? gloom? crash?) metal and smoking weed. Joe is able to do these things indefinitely because he lives with a friend named Eric who is an ""accidental millionaire."" How this is the case is never elaborated on, although it does explain why Eric and his friend, Hung (Peter Dinklage! I kept telling my girlfriend, ""Man. That guy looks a LOT like Peter Dinklage. But surely he wouldn't be in a movie like this.""), are able to dress to the nines for their LARP sessions (Live Action Role Play). To help Joe get over his heartbreak, they bring him to a massive LARP festival where they accidentally summon a demon with a spell book that Eric bought from eBay.That's actually pretty funny.Where the movie fumbles is when it tries to be both horror and comedy. This is such a tricky thing to pull off that it's rarely done perfectly. There is some shocking and pretty gruesome violence in the film, and likeable characters die, and they die in pretty unforgiving scenes about which there is nothing funny. It makes the film feel uneven. It goes from slapstick to stab-stick without really letting the two mesh. There are a few moments that meld the funny with the gory, but overall the violence and humor aren't blended properly to give the movie the feel it wants to have.Also, the climax, during which our heroes must battle the End Level Boss, has a few flubs to it as well. The movie-makers must not have had much confidence in the special effects required to create their Big Bad, because it is constantly filmed in swerving, dipping, headache-inducing shake-cam. When it IS focused on properly, yes, it is less horrifying than a strangely inarticulate plastic creation. Even that could be forgiven as the necessary evils of a low-budget film if it weren't for the method with which the bad guy is finally attacked. I don't want to give anything away, but the final showdown was pretty embarrassing as far as film-making/story-telling goes. It is meant to be a joke, but it's not a very good joke, and it goes on too long, stretching out what little humor there is into something paper thin.Every actor does a bang-up job, and the general concept is pretty funny, but the execution is spotty, and the penultimate scene is so ridiculous that the movie goes from being ""funny dumb"" to just plain dumb.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G5IEOKPSYVA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8S1DB6#wasThisHelpful","R1G5IEOKPSYVA2","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, so, Martin Scorsese knows how to make a visually arresting film. This movie has all the hallmarks of great cinematography, great framing, snappy editing, and luscious attention to detail. If your eyes were mouths, they'd be crying drool. If that makes any sense.The problem -- and I'd say this is a problem that extends to a lot of movies these days -- is that so much time was spent on this film's superficial beauty that the actual story took a back seat to the sweaty, round, booty-liciousness of it all.This movie is about Jordan Belfort, a consummate salesman who gets involved with stock trades and discovers that he has both the slick patter and the complete lack of morals needed to bilk unwitting investors out of millions of their dollars. Thus begins his predictable decline into a world of sex, drugs, and rock and roll (of the ""Money for Nothing"" variety).Let me be clear: this is an entertaining film. However, the makers of the movie were nearly as gluttonous as its protagonist, and what could easily have been a tightly crafted ninety minutes turns into three hours of repetitive T&A and coke-fueled manipulation, most of it making the same basic point, over and over and over and over again. And, hey, I like a nice, round booty just as much as the next guy, and I don't mind a few midget jokes, a few drug jokes, and a bit of anti-hero characterization here and there. But this movie is just packed to the gills with the stuff, to the point where you begin to wonder if Mr. Scorsese or Mr. DiCaprio needed to have nay-sayers on set to remind them that, no, not every single thing they do necessarily should make it to the screen, especially if it very closely resembles the last ten scenes they just filmed.The point being this: this isn't a terribly original film. It's a story about a young upstart that uses unscrupulous behavior to make it big at the expense of others and then realizes that his amoral behavior comes at the price of friendship, decency, and perhaps a human soul. It's an age-old story, and it's told with all the naked sumptuousness that draws audiences, but it's so enamored with it's own nipply beauty that it drags on for twice as long as it needs to. Wolves, as I've always understood them, eat quickly and thoroughly. This film, however, digests its story with the long, gluttonous patience of a snake.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S9GS47UBHO6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H9KKKAY#wasThisHelpful","R3S9GS47UBHO6L","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whoever made the trailer for this thing deserves an award. I mean, I'm an experienced enough movie goer at this point not to be suckered so easily by a well-edited commercial for a film, but I admit: this movie's trailer got my hopes way up.Apparently it was created based on the success of a few internet clips of the clown that features prominently in the film. That's fair enough. It's a creepily done clown in most ways. The film itself: not so much.First of all, it's an anthology film. No points lost for that. These appear to be gaining popularity. Although it means the films often lack cohesion, it also gives it multiple chances to win audiences over.The over-arching story here is about a baby-sitter with the personality of a toothbrush taking care of two abrasively over-acted kids on Halloween night, all of them so meticulously make-upped and lit that it's impossible not to imagine the rest of the crew standing mere feet away (made even easier by the fact that there's virtually no establishing shots, with everyone in close-up). One of the kids, an alarmingly skinny boy, receives a blank videotape in his bag of Halloween candy, and they all sit down to watch it. Lucky for us, this family still owns a VCR, because the video contains our three scary stories.STORY #1 - CREEPY TRAIN STATION IS CREEPYA young woman has a close encounter with the film's scary clown villain while waiting for a train at a station that more closely resembles an elementary school boiler room. There are a few creepy scenes and moments in this one, and the actors really give it their all. The story, however, degenerates into random nonsense  and monster make-up that is a fang or two shy of really selling itself. It also includes a bad guy who keeps awkwardly licking his lips, like chapped skin is scary.STORY #2 - WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD!A young woman is unpacking boxes in her new home. Great pains are taken to illustrate how isolated the location is. Nothing happens for about ten minutes, although the electricity does go out and the women gets scared by bright lights from outside. Then she discovers the alien. Or rather, the skinny guy in the easily damaged alien costume. Cue screaming and running and absolutely nothing else.STORY #3 - THE GASH STATIONIn the goriest of the three clips, a young woman (must it always be young women?) encounters our clown friend at a gas station, where he begins terrorizing her because he's evil or something. This section of the film is shot in a gritty, sepia-ish tone that makes it feel more engaging, and the effects are the strongest of the movie. There's more of an attempt at a story -- although not much -- but the ending is so desperate to be shocking that it comes across as almost laughable.I'm going to let you guess how the movie ends, although I recommend not being too imaginative with your guesses. All in all, it's not the worst horror film I've ever seen, but it does seem to think that a creepy bad guy and some intermittent gore are good substitutes for plot and character, leaving the whole thing pretty hollow.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EV55EERKT7T0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DRQETEW#wasThisHelpful","R2EV55EERKT7T0","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review contains a mild spoiler. I don't know if you can call it a spoiler, because the Amazon book description as well as the Publishers Weekly review on this website both give it away. I think that's a crying shame, although it's not really a spoiler that would take a lot of brain cells to figure out on your own. Anyway, I wouldn't mention it in my review if it weren't a key reason why I disliked the novel. Are you ready? Here it is:It's all a dream.Sigh. This book was written 25 years ago, but even then the ""it was all a dream"" scenario wasn't really all that fresh or interesting, and it takes a heckuva a lot of talent to pull it off without getting readers to feel like they've wasted their time. After all, absolutely anything can happen in dreams, and so it's never really a surprise when anything does. Say goodbye to plot, conflict, tension, drama, or any of the other structural bits and pieces that authors use to guide their storytelling. The most you can do with ""it was all a dream"" is connect it in some way to reality and hope that the bridge is meaningful or profound in some way.The metaphor of the bridge is a pretty hefty one here. Suffering from amnesia, our narrator is fished from the waters around a bridge. This is no ordinary bridge. It's so large that it seems to have no beginning or ending, and an entire civilization lives among its beams and girders. This is, in fact, a really cool idea and worth exploring. Meanwhile, our narrator is asked by his therapist to provide him with examples of his nightly dreams. Since he doesn't remember his dreams, he makes them up. At first. This is also a pretty interesting concept, and the narrator's dreams -- both real and fake -- are pretty fascinating stuff.But it's really all just a fictional gumbo. The narrative voice slips and slides for no reason other than to increase the disorienting effect of the dreamscape. Different stories -- including one about a warrior and his smart-mouthed familiar -- gain and lose prominence as the book goes on. The narrator, inexplicably, makes it off of the bridge and into a city that appears to be at war. Then he comes back. Then there's a desert. Back and forth. Up and down. There's no consistency to any of it, but that's because it's a dream, you see.The thing is, no one likes to be told about your dreams. It doesn't matter how cool your dream is to you, or even what cool ideas there are in it, if you start to explain your dream to someone and it lasts longer than a minute, they'll start getting that glazed look in their eyes. I felt the exact same way about this book. Once it became apparent that this was all just some kind of coma-dream, it developed a hollow, very aimless feeling, and I ended up wishing it were over sooner.Banks does include a description of the narrator's life when he was awake, and it's actually kind of impressive how well he conveys an entire life with such economy of language. You speed through his childhood and school years and well into his adulthood, marking his successes and failures and even the size of his bald spot. Much of his life centers around an unconventional relationship with a woman. But, even though it's nifty how slickly Banks condenses this man's personality and life into such a small space, the guy and his history aren't especially compelling. Even the kinda-sorta open relationship that he has feels just as hollow and aimless as the dream world he spends most of the book inhabiting. And no, it's pretty clear that that isn't the point of the book.While it was probably a ton of fun to write and while there are elements here and there that are imaginative and stimulating, the whole experience is ultimately as unsatisfying as trying to remember the details of your own dreams an hour after waking. It's ultimately unsuccessful, and you end up wondering why you're even bothering.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27AKXHVMQ9C58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GVG1BSW#wasThisHelpful","R27AKXHVMQ9C58","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Renaissance Mix Collections tend to be more like grab bags than the albums put out in their other series, which tend to be more like cohesive DJ sets. Although not every Mix Collection I've heard is a complete scattershot, they do tend to be more uneven, and this album is no exception.It has a promising start, with the first seven tracks of Disc 1 offering up a dark blend of classical minimal against deep house funk, the mixture set to a low simmer. This really gets going in ""All Moving Over The Earth,"" a track with a catchy and insistent grimness that plays nicely off of the preceding ups and downs.At this point, the set completely collapses under a poorly chosen vocal track. Vocals are tricky when it comes to EDM. It's hard to find any that don't detract from the music. ""Good Times"" features atonal fellows attempting awkward falsettos over mind-numbingly repetitive lyrics to ""have a good time."" The next few tracks meander around without doing anything to revive the spirit before decaying even further under the horribly arranged ""Royal Asscher Cut,"" a minimal track that features the ear-grating whines of overlapping squawks. It sounds like two clowns with broken squeeze horns are honking them at each other without any rhyme or reason. Just an awful track.The set suddenly finds the plot again with ""Norah"" and ""Oregano,"" both of which bring back that twisty cone of deep funk and airy trance minimal. ""Red Lines"" makes it sound like Tiefschwarz is going to bring it down to a gritty finale, but the closing track, ""Knox's ""Mornings"" -- while a beautiful piece -- is a bittersweet alterna-anthem that sounds both unfinished and completely out of place.Disc Two opens with more of that grim magic with ""Detuned"" as well as a few very well paced darker pieces (""Vamos Mi  Nino"" is a standout here, as well as ""Flash""), but it stumbles, as before, on a few poorly arranged bits of atonal nonsense (""Gotham"" and Tiefschwarz's own ""Voices"" are the ones I liked least).Even if Disc Two seems to have more of the alienating weirdness that is hard to get a toe-hold (or ear-hold, I guess) on, at least the tone is more consistent. Unfortunately, the set closes, once again, on a strangely placed vocal track, although this one kinda sorta seems more fitting than ""Mornings"" did in the first disc.A curious mix, the set has its fair share of bright spots, but it's just too uneven to merit a full recommendation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJCAX6BKHPVJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009ICUP92#wasThisHelpful","RJCAX6BKHPVJT","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is pretty explosive stuff for a first novel. Polarizing readers with its sometimes disturbing depictions of violence and carnage (mostly to animals and very young children), THE WASP FACTORY, if anything else, put Iain Banks' name on the map. At the time of its release (mid-80's), this was considered pretty gruesome stuff (it would be another seven years before AMERICAN PSYCHO would confidently claim the crown of sadistic literature for itself). In retrospect, while there are certainly cringe-worthy scenes (I nearly became physically ill by a scene taking place in a children's hospital), the story itself is more quirky and bizarre than a vehicle for gore or gross-out shock value.The story concerns young Frank, a curious teenager who lives on a tiny island off the coast of Scotland with his recalcitrant father. Frank has a lot of homegrown superstitions, including belief in ""sacrifice poles,"" a curious contraption called The Wasp Factory, and the supernatural power of certain skulls. There's not a whole lot going on in the novel, although the imminent return of Frank's brother (recently escaped from a mental hospital) does provide the tale most of its forward focus. The rest of the story deals with Frank's shamanistic rituals, his unusual upbringing, and his slightly contrived friendship with a dwarf named Jamie.Banks writes with a clear, level-headed voice, which is admirable given both the subject matter and the fact that this was his first book. Unfortunately, the whole thing doesn't fully merge into a coherent whole, with some of the more cartoonish bits failing to jive fully with the rest of the book's visceral qualities. The final twist of the story, for instance, feels tacked on and completely unnecessary, including the tone it's told in, a sort of amateurish summary spoon-fed to the audience in the off chance that they haven't been able to figure it out on their own. It's mildly insulting and also, as I said, totally beside the point of the novel anyway, which mainly deals with themes of isolation, sanity, and security.In spite of its various loose threads and inconsistencies, though, the novel is, in fact, a stunning read most of the time. It's been a long time since I've been so gutturally affected by a book and had scenes from a tale lasting in my mind with such clarity and resonance. I recommend it to anyone who's a fan of alternative literature or even horror (although it's a bit of a leap to classify this novel in that genre). As far as unclassifiable tales go, this one is near the top of the list.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3URJZ4UFGQUS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D0KXVY4#wasThisHelpful","R3URJZ4UFGQUS8","A139ZF7CJVVTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A139ZF7CJVVTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Simcity 2000 is one of my favorite strategy game of all time. I've kept with with entire Simcity series, except the most recent one. Each Simcity improved graphics but it also lost a bit of its soul. Cities Skylines is going back to the basics. In a lot of ways, it is Simcity 2000 with killer graphics. It lets you build HUGE city without mod, you can build mega city with mod which lets you build all 25 tiles instead of limit of 9 tiles.Speaking of killer graphics, this game requires a mid range graphic card which priced around 300 to 400 bucks to make the game enjoyable. Especially if your goal is to build mega city and solve all the problems come with the mega city. I installed it on a Dell workstation laptop which handles popular graphic intense PC games pretty well, like 25-30 FPS. But not Cities Skylines, the FPS is like 8-10; completely unplayable. It plays beautifully on my workstation tower equipped with Quadro 7000 and GTX 660 Ti.Cities Skylines has a huge community already and it is growing fast. Hopefully the developers won't make the same mistakes as EA did for SimCity.

"I became my mother's main caregiver immediately after she was diagnosed with late stage lung cancer two months ago. This oxygen monitor helped me to keep track of her comfort level by adjusting oxygen concentrator's output level. Her heart rate jumped from 110 to 150 a day before her passing, which is a sign of impending death. She started breathing shallowly 10 minutes prior her passing, I couldn't get any reading from her fingers. I thought oximeter was broken at first, but it read properly on my finger. That's when I knew her passing is about to happen. Instead of calling in-home hospice nurse for advice, I held her and told her what a wonderful job she has done as a mother and she will forever live in my heart. It was time for her to go, my grandmother is waiting for her. She understood every word of it and passed away peacefully in my arms a few minutes later.Sadly, some of you are reading this review because you're in a similar situation as I was. I have to say being a main caregiver of a loved one is both physically and mentally exhausting, but reward you and your loved one get in return can't be measured. The medical science has identified signs of impending death and they are fairly accurate. With that knowledge and the tools like this oximeter can better prepared family for the final farewell. Of course, it is never too early to say it.Remember during active dying phase, patients may seen to be in coma and none-responsive. But study has shown in most of cases, all the senses are still there. So give them lots of love with talking, hugging and caressing of hands. It is equally important that you give them permission to go when the time is near.

"Its two USB ports are indeed quite loose when compare with the standard USB ports, but that is by design. If this adapter uses regular snug USB fitting, then the adapter will get pulled out of the Expresscard bay whenever you try to pull the attached USB device from its ports.

"True journalism is about the investigation and reporting of events, issues and trends to a broad audience without injecting its own opinions and believes. When a news organization identifies itself with an ideology, then its main role is no longer journalism.Sadly, all major ""news"" organizations in the states have loss sight of journalism. They are publicly traded companies which are under pressure to meet Wall Street's target quarter earnings. Therefore the ""news"" these days are all about numbers, ratings and ad revenues. To achieve higher rating, they're catering a specific view to a specific audience. After all people likes to hear what they want to hear.There's nothing wrong with creating shows for a specific audience, except when it comes to journalism. Once the journalism became tinted, the facts often get distorted for the sake of ratings. And some people will take its face value as facts. This documentary is doing the exact same thing as the modern news groups have being doing; targeting a specific audience by presenting a view of their liking. And generating revenue for itself in the process.There are many factors why OWS gone viral the way it did, major political think-tanks were not one of them. The scale of OWS is so massive, I think that's where older generation doesn't quite understand the power of social media and independent blogs have over the younger generation. Therefore it has to be organized by major political think tanks.Personally, I'd like to see a documentary about how mainstream media muted OWS with its coverage and the decision behind it. They kept on saying there's no single coherent message in OWS for them to report. Which part of ""Occupy Wall Street"" these journalists didn't understand?

Use these cans with MP3s (music from iTunes,Amazon and Zune) is kind of like put racing tires (ATH50S) on a Toyota Camry (MP3 & MP3 player); the racing tires won't be used to their full potentials.Lossless format uses a variable bit rate to sample a song without compression VS MP3 samples a song at a fixed 256 kbps bit rate with compression. Average FLAC bit rate is about 800 to 1000+ kpbs vs MP3 256kpbs, you can see how much details are dropped in MP3 compression.Device matters too, consumer class players like ipod, zune, and android won't bring out the full potential of these cans, even with a headphone amp. Apple & MS devices don't support FLAC, there are workarounds but the limitation is in the hardware. Check out Cowon devices, a less known brand to consumers, but not to audiophiles.

"Fish oil supplements come in two forms: Triglycerides (TG) and Ethyl Esters (EE). Majority of fish oil supplements on the market is Ethyl Esters (EE) because it's much cheaper to produce EE than TG.However EE is a synthetic substrate from micro distillation of crude fish oil and ethanol. So it's not really a ""natural"" supplement.

It's nice and thick on the back panel, but barely any on the sides and front is hard shell with no padding.- Plush Linging:  It's soft, but it will sheds eventually. Not idea for expensive camera.- Internal storage pocket shares the same space as camera, extra battery and SD storage case could scratch the camera body (if you can make them fit).I recommend Tamrac 5691 Black Digital 1 Camera Bag (Black). It's a perfect snug fit for LX5 from all sides, except from the top. The storage pocket is separated from the camera pocket, and store a tone of stuff. It can hold the entire LX5 battery charger. It's not cheap, but a good protection for a $350 camera.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IKZNHQWAFDVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0039BPG4C#wasThisHelpful","R3IKZNHQWAFDVO","A68I93HI9W6LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A68I93HI9W6LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It tastes great and fills you up, but it's loaded with sugar. Two out of top three ingredients are syrups. A candy Snicker bar (junk food) has 13g sugar, this one has 20g sugar.For muscle recovery, I've switched from this to thinkThin Protein Bar, Chunky Peanut Butter, Gluten Free, 10 - 2.1-Ounce Bars. ThinkThin uses sugar alcohol instead of conventional sugar. Google sugar alcohol, if you're not familiar with it. And ThinkThin use whey protein as a part of its protein blend. Whey protein is the best protein for muscle recovery.The best protein bars for muscle recovery are homemade, it's super easy to make (a bit messy). There are a tone of recipes on the net.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/REAIGUPCL4VAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00636PGG8#wasThisHelpful","REAIGUPCL4VAH","A68I93HI9W6LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A68I93HI9W6LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some of the reviewers eat these for weight control purpose, which I don't think that's what these bars are for. 20g protein bars like these are designed for muscle recovery after weight lifting workout. ThinkThin protein bars use whey protein isloate; which is the best protein for muscle recovery. I've been eating Cliff Protein bar for body building, although it's 95% organic but it has too much sugar. ThinkThin protein bars provide same amount of protein as the Cliff Bar with less sugar.These bars use sugar alcohol, instead of conventional sugar. Sugar alcohol is a sweetener commonly found in ""Sugar Free"" gums. It has less calories and doesn't cause tooth decay as conventional sugar does. Nonetheless, it's a sugar. I hope ThinkThin would start making these with organic ingredients.For those who are interesting in snack bars (instead of protein bars) for weight control, Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12) are awesome.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNPVLC9C2EAKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CRHQN0#wasThisHelpful","RNPVLC9C2EAKB","A68I93HI9W6LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A68I93HI9W6LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This phone is AWESOME! WP7.5 is intuitive, although its UI needs refinements still; which I was counting on MS for future upgrade when I bought it. Today's WP8 announcement by MS confirmed ALL current WP7 devices CAN NOT upgrade to WP8, really Microsoft?! Talking about epic fail. Who in the right mind would code a OS without supporting legacy hardware? Microsoft would and did LOL. MS said WP7 device will get 7.8 upgrade which is WP8 like. That will be the last major update for all WP7 devices.Enough rants, I mainly use it to sync with Outlook via MS Office 365, which costs 6 bucks a month. You can also sync Outlook via MS Live, a ""free"" service like GMail. But like Google, MS Live has virtually no privacy. Everything you do with MS Live are subject to be scanned for marketing purpose.WP7 & MS Office 365 works surprisingly well, it's almost seamless. It's deal for small business owners who want to sync with Outlook & MS office. MS Office 365 monthly fee is actually very competitive, it offers feature like web app, web hosting, cloud service...etc.If you want to play HD games, then better wait for WP8 devices which will support multi-core CPU and high end mobile GPU.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DFAXGCX6ZRJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0061QRIFW#wasThisHelpful","R1DFAXGCX6ZRJZ","A68I93HI9W6LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A68I93HI9W6LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Four months update, downgraded from 3 to 1 star: The skin loss its elasticity just after four months of light use. Now it comes loose easily. Failed.It fits very well, nice and snug. However, overall quality is just so so. The seam that goes around the side is very noticeable, some area even have ""leftover"" silicone sticking out.The actual product doesn't look as good as the photos here. It's like the juicy Big Mac ad, the real thing doesn't quite live up to the ad, LOL. It's semi translucent and camera button is a cut out instead of covered as shown in the photos.Despite the quality, it seems to be able to do its job; which is provide additional protection from catastrophic drop and scratches. The phone recessed about 1/16"" from the skin all around, that should provide a good protection from scratchings.Unfortunately, there isn't a much options for i937. My first choice Diztronic, but they said there's no plan for i937 model.I might return it since mine has some kind of stuff in the silicone as they didn't clean the mold.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S2BRSODYENK4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00743KSC6#wasThisHelpful","R3S2BRSODYENK4","A68I93HI9W6LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A68I93HI9W6LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This dip stand is an innovated product, it lets you do make many different exercises; a good solution for people with limited space. However, there a few things that I don't like about it.1. It wobbles, not much. But enough to cause strain to the wrists.2. The handle bar is not paralleled. They are either point inward or outward, depends on which direction you're using it. That cause more strain to the wrists.3. The price, $80 (exclude shipping) it kind of pricy for what it is.I already have other workout equipment and am only looking for a compact dip stand to do the dips. Reviews here lead me to Ez2care Comfy Handle Classic Folding Walker, Adjustable Height 32-39"", Lightweight. Yes, you read it right. It's a granny's walker and it works fantastically as a dip stand at 1/3 of the cost of this stand. If you want to go even cheaper, go to your local Goodwill store. They often have the used walkers for less than 10 dollars. Make sure you don't get the ones with wheels.I think this stand is worth it if you don't already own other exercise equipment. But if you're wanting to do dips only, then walker is a great solution. Plus it's a good conversation piece, ha ha.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KDL9Y5UKVRLF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ICHPIK#wasThisHelpful","R3KDL9Y5UKVRLF","A68I93HI9W6LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A68I93HI9W6LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let's be clear, Everlast doesn't claim it as a heavy bag and it's not. It's a striking bag, the bag itself weights around 25 lbs or so (a rough estimate), it's pretty light weight. It flexes quite a bit with just light punches to the center of the bag.When you punch/kick a hanging heavy bag, it swings around with the entire weight of the bag, 80, 100 lbs whatever it be. It would come back at you with that full weight of momentum, and you'll feel it when you hit it again. It's a good way to develop the power of punches and kicks.With this striking bag, you don't get that heavy weight feedback from the bag. Even when it flexes back at you, it just doesn't have that heavy feedback. So if you're looking to develop punch and kick strength, then you better stick with a hanging heavy bag. With that said, this one can be good for cardio workout or something.I live in a tiny apartment where hanging a heavy bag is not an option. So I was looking for a free standing heavy bag, which I don't think it exist. This type of bag is actually not ideal for apartment, unless you don't have a downstairs neighbor. The energy from the hits transfer to the base, creates a deep vibration on the floor.PRO- Well built & solid materials- A good solution for small space- StableCON- flex to easilyLastly, I use furniture slider to move it around.

"TB to dollar ratio, this is an awesome deal. With that said, I would not use it as a primary drive for OS or crucial data storage, NAS/home server. Because it wasn't designed for that as the description stated.For OS drive, SSD is the way to go. For crucial data storage and NAS/home sever, either Caviar Black or Western Digital 2 TB RE4 - WD2003FYYS. Those two drives cost significantly more the this one, but they are in a different class. It all comes down to how much you value your data and time.I've been using the previous generation of the Caviar Green as a backup drive since Sept-2009, still got all green light from recent SMART scan (knocks on wood).

"The fact that there isn't really a way to properly swaddle the legs makes this a pointless product and a far cry from a ""miracle"".I believe the purpose of swaddling is to somewhat recreate the feeling of being in the womb, which will calm your baby and help him/her sleep. Sadly, due to the design of this blanket, there isn't a way to properly swaddle your infants legs, so they'll be able to kick freely and will most likely wake themselves up if they are prone to kicking like our baby is.If your baby tries to kick out his/her legs when swaddled normally, then you'll probably experience the same failure with this product so I'd recommend saving your money.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UQ45CE7UJUMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NEQJNX2#wasThisHelpful","R1UQ45CE7UJUMU","AQHJXW7L8PJGL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQHJXW7L8PJGL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This headset is long-press for volume adjustments, and short single press for track forward/back.Pairing was a bit wonky as evidenced in my video.

Since it's an aging vehicle I didn't feel like shelling out a ton of money on new mats, so these fit the bill.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34V2A2LLQ4XLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNTFDIW#wasThisHelpful","R34V2A2LLQ4XLG","AQHJXW7L8PJGL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQHJXW7L8PJGL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 8:56 Mins I'm an amateur photographer, and for a couple of years I've been using one of those incredibly cheap, flimsy, craptastic aluminum $20 tripods. (Zeikos, if you were wondering).I was in the market for something a level up from that, but I also didn't want to break the bank. The reviews of this tripod were quite favorable, and the price was right, so I pulled the trigger.Hopefully my video review will help shine some light on this tripod, but I'll also outline the pros/cons here.Pros:Height. I'm 6'4"" and at max height I barely have to bend over to be able to look through the viewfinder on my DSLR.Price. At $100 it's a great tripod, and it includes a ball head with great functionality.Extras - the bag included to haul it around, as well as a softer bag for the ball head, as well as a velcro pouch - see the video for a quick peek at each.Build Quality - I'm not sure how qualified I am to speak to build quality being the amateur that I am....this is the highest quality tripod I've bought...but at $100 it seems like a bargain for the price.Cons: (These are going to be nitpicky non-issue items since I don't really feel like this thing has any cons)The small pieces where you loosen the legs come up and away, just a mild annoyance more than anything (I showed this in the video)The AFAITH product name as pictured isn't what was on my stuff - it was a chinese company name. Hardly a problem, just worth noting (Also shown in the video)Bottom Line: I'm going to echo what the vast majority of other reviews have said - this thing is awesome and you can't go wrong for $100. Yeah it's Chinese....but the build quality seems to be above expectations at this price point. If you're on a budget, and you're an amateur photographer looking to upgrade from one of those cheap tripods and you can swing $100....then don't think twice about picking this up - you won't be sorry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJJSG3Q0H11HF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GM477G8#wasThisHelpful","RJJSG3Q0H11HF","AQHJXW7L8PJGL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQHJXW7L8PJGL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:27 Mins Disclaimer: I was provided this product for free in exchange for my honest review.Pros:Good fit in my ears using the medium sized inserts and buds.Music quality is on par with what you'd expect from a $25 bluetooth headsetCall quality is also on par with what you'd expect.I generally like my music loud, and battery life fell slightly short of the specifications, but that's to be expected when I've the volume maxed.Cons:I could nitpick over the length of the charging cable, but I don't really feel like a long charging cable is necessary for these.At times I had to move the microphone closer to my mouth while on the phone to improve clarity for the person I was speaking too.Bottom line: There are a number of contenders at this price range in the bluetooth sweat-proof market. I also reviewed the MPOW Swift headset, and if you don't mind moving up to the $30 price range I'd recommend those over these simply because the controls are on the ear-piece itself and that's a personal preference of mine.However...if $25 is the maximum you're willing to spend then these are a solid choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19LXESJ43J41Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CFCI404#wasThisHelpful","R19LXESJ43J41Y","AQHJXW7L8PJGL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQHJXW7L8PJGL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 5:38 Mins Full disclosure: I was provided a pair of these earbuds for free in exchange for my honest review.My pursuit of good headphones for running has been long, arduous, and wrought with annoyances. I'll briefly summarize my experiences to see if they resonate with your personal experience.I purchased the LG HBS700. Great sound, great battery life, and great functionality....incredibly annoying to run with. They'd constantly slide one way or the other on my neck. I tried regular earbuds - the cord is so annoying it results with them not being an option for me.I then shelled out about $140 for the JayBirds. Something this expensive MUST work amazingly well. But the bounce in the cord around the back of my head made them simply not worth the cost of entry. I returned them.Then an MPOW representative reached out to me to see if I'd be interested in test-driving the MPOW swift earbuds which I graciously accepted. Let's get started.--The Good--The cost. The competition at this price point is severely lacking. MPOW wins in an absolute landslide.The build quality. Noting that at this point I haven't completely put the MPOW Swift through its paces - but I'll be updating accordingly as time goes on. So far it appears very well built. The cord itself on the earbuds is high quality and doesn't succumb to much movement. Sound you hear in the earbuds from the cord movement is surprisingly minimal.The audio quality, keeping in mind the price point and purpose of these earbuds (exercise, by and large) leaves very little to be desired. Great highs and very acceptable lows.Ease of use. Pairing the device is simple - but that brings me to one of my ""small issues"" the button you have to press to power on and pair is also where the light is emitted from to indicate what ""mode"" you're in (powered on, pairing, or off). This is remedied simply by using a smaller part of your finger to press the button. Not a big issue, but could have been designed a little better. The volume keys control the volume, and when held will advance songs or go back songs.Once you have it paired once, the next time you turn on the headset the quickness with which it reconnects was quite surprising to me. My bluetooth speakers and other headphones take about 15 seconds to reconnect. These headphones are about 1-2 seconds after you've turned them on.Battery life is incredible. I worked an 8 hour shift with these and they still weren't completely depleted. Note that the volume wasn't cranked to the max during this time, but it was still moderately loud.--The bad--""Bad"" is a bit of a stretch here. I wouldn't say anything is bad about these. Annoying, perhaps. The aforementioned fact that the lights that indicate the mode are on the button you have to press is a bit of a design flaw, but easily avoided by pressing the button while not completely covering the light.The charging cable doesn't come with a wall-outlet adapter. A non-issue for me since I have plenty kicking around the house from smartphones of yore. Something that others should keep in mind.For now this product is an easy 5-star item, especially considering what other competition is out there at the price point these are being sold at.I'll update my review, as with all my reviews, periodically with new information as I see fit.

"I love backpacks that do what you need them to do and do it well.I was using a Canon Powershot G12 for a while and my Naneu Echo sling served me very well as long as I had it. Then I upgraded to my DSLR (Nikon D5100) and eventually accrued enough lenses to warrant an upgrade. So, the hunt began. After doing loads of research I ended up landing on the Sony LCSBP3. Between the functionality, style, and price, it had everything I was looking for (and then some! a spot for a laptop, and a rain-cover? Sure, why not!)I love the ability to quickly be able to swing the pack around to my front to retrieve my camera. No more having to have the camera around my neck at all times for quick access - extremely annoying (and sometimes impossible) depending on the size of the lens you're using.I've 3 lenses for my Nikon D5100. The 55-300MM lens, the 35MM prime lens, and the kit lens the camera came with. I'm also able to accommodate my flash in the compartments inside the bag. The top compartment holds all of my other gear including cleaning supplies, filters, extra batteries, extra memory cards, et al.If you're upgrading from a P&S or you're just now getting into the world of DSLRs then chances are this pack is big enough to haul the gear you have. Or, if you've a ton of gear, I imagine this bag is big enough for you to take a long a kit that should cover most, if not all, of the shots you'll want to take.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TH85ZMX0HX4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0097DFR8G#wasThisHelpful","R2TH85ZMX0HX4S","AQHJXW7L8PJGL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQHJXW7L8PJGL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a woodworking hobbyist and I was looking for a solution to wearing safety glasses with a mask and having the glasses fog up. If you've done this, then you know exactly what I'm talking about. Those cheap masks (and even some of the more expensive ones with the small filters) just don't create a proper seal, so it's sort of defeating the purpose if air is escaping above your nose - or anywhere, for that matter.Enter this awesome respirator! After putting it on and tightening it accordingly to your face size you'll notice a big difference right away. As long as you purchase the right size and fit it appropriately you won't have any air escaping where it shouldn't be.Finally, I can wear glasses in the shop and a respirator and not have to worry about my glasses fogging up!There is a newer version of this mask that has a quick release so you can quickly drop the mask down, and I think it's only slightly more expensive - if I had it to do over again I'd go with that one for the added convenience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P1M89U9RIKY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001NDN29O#wasThisHelpful","R3P1M89U9RIKY0","AQHJXW7L8PJGL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQHJXW7L8PJGL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My only other experience with plug cutters, before the Grizzly kit here, was a CMT 3/8"" Plug cutter which, while it got the job done, it did so in a less than ideal manner. Because of the bit's slight wobble the plugs it would yield were slightly tapered. Note that it was definitely the bit here, as the drill press I was using ran true with a multitude of other bits.I've used all sizes of this Grizzly kit and there is no wobble from the bit.

"I've been working on some projects that I'm rough cutting on my band saw and then subsequently sanding down closer to what I'm actually looking for using these on my drill press.I was originally going to pick up an oscillating spindle sander, but I figured I'd give this method a shot instead and I'm glad I did!These are also easy to just toss in my regular drill if I'm looking for additional manual control. Note that the grit on these is quite low so you won't be doing any super fine detailing, but if you're in the same camp that I was then look no further.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPS6BHY70ATOS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001XQMRH4#wasThisHelpful","RPS6BHY70ATOS","AQHJXW7L8PJGL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQHJXW7L8PJGL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am incredibly happy with this candle! It looks good enough to actually eat since its so realistic. Down to the metal pan its in and especially the crust, amazing crumbly crust.Its also one of the most scented I have ever had, it has a strong scent even when not lit. When it is lit the pumpkin pie reaches the other side of the house. When it arrived it seemed to be well protected with a tight plastic wrapping around the candle and some bubble wrap stuffed all around it in the box so it arrived in great condition. I did take some photos of the candle after a week of using and some of the crust has fallen off. This was due to handling so I would recommend being careful picking it up and such as the edges of the metal pan are thin and the crust will break a bit.The candle is a lot larger than I thought it would be, bigger than my hand spread out. 5 inches wide, a few inches tall. When burning it does not melt up quickly and seems to last a long time. I have barely even made a dent in it after a week of using every day.Overall, the candle is just beautiful and I feel like taking a bite all the time. It smells as good as it looks no doubt. I will definitely be getting more of these for the holidays.I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R385Z1KBGUT5C2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LTY54M#wasThisHelpful","R385Z1KBGUT5C2","A17CGZ4LXH5URT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17CGZ4LXH5URT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can get enough of Black Tie Mercantile's candy! So, so, good. These ones are among my favorites because they beat out a well known brand name of sour straws that I used to get by the single pack all the time. More flavor plus have more of the little sour sugar stuff packed on to the straws. Super sour! Super better. Also, the percent daily values aren't half bad. So that gives me a nudge towards these for the win.They arrived quick and in a cute black box that actually seems pretty appropriate for expecting candy. It has character. Inside were 10 packs of sour straws. Two of each flavor, five flavors total. I promptly tested each one...My favorite definitely has to be the strawberry because to me it is the most sour out of all five flavors. Its a surprise because I thought that one of the known sour flavors would have been the most sour like green apple or pink lemonade. Nonetheless, they are all delicious and I like them all. Each pack has 9 straws so I did get a good taste test out of them.They are fat free and have 175 calories per whole package, also 33g of sugar each. Black Tie Mercantile candy, these Dorval Sour Power Straws are just yum and I will have my next box on the way soon. Highly recommended if you love sour and love gummy candy with some chewiness.I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FSVJPUH7PBTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NX6FF2Q#wasThisHelpful","R1FSVJPUH7PBTT","A17CGZ4LXH5URT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17CGZ4LXH5URT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I probably wear this bra way to often but I love it. The comfort and the relaxed feel but with good support for running around makes it that good. Im really impressed and satisfied with the order.The bra comes in a few colors, I ordered the white one. It looks cute with the grey piping and grey bottom band. Has a sporty look with the angled pinstripes on the side. It has been super comfy, i'll wear it from morning til night without problems and the material is very stretchy. I actually ordered a size medium although I do have a pretty small chest size. I'm about 5ft 2in and 115 lbs, normal bra size is a 32B. It fits me well but has quite a bit of give if needed. I stretched it wide and all around with my hands to check it out and it would probably fit a woman a couple cups larger because of the major stretch it has.The inside has some thin padding which I most always wear with the bra but there is a hole on both sides where the padding can be removed. I have removed only once and wore the bra but I felt like I did not have enough support without the padding so I put them back in. Without those paddings I think it is a little thin in the front.The back of the bra is so cute, has a criss cross pattern so it makes the shoulder straps hit high more towards the neck which gives me even more support and lift that way. The back straps are comfortable. Also, no tags. No scratchy feel. The bra is labeled with the size and wash instructions but its actually printed on the back strap, on the inside. The material is on there as well in print.Overall, I love the Miny Women's Comfort Cross bra. Its made well and all the seams are tight. Perfect for on the go or just hanging out at home.I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HNXR677CFFTR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZR95QZ8#wasThisHelpful","R3HNXR677CFFTR","A17CGZ4LXH5URT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17CGZ4LXH5URT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most of the time I pair this with my french press and it makes the best sized grounds for it, leaving no pieces in my coffee. For my drip coffee pot I use it and make the grounds a little bigger. Works well every time and seems to keep the quality and consistency throughout use so far, to which it has been used daily since it arrived.Its a little heavy, sturdy heavy though, built well and comes apart very easy for cleaning. The included brush is perfect for it and reaches all the little nooks and crannies. The grinder has a knob on it which rotates so that I can choose the level or how course I want my beans to be. While turning the handle I can also visually see it being done which is handy, the window in front is easily viewed since its on both sides. Handle is easy to turn and to grip but does take a bit of muscle in the first minute or so with the full solid beans. It seems to be attached a lot better than my previous manual grinder which broke. Every time I grind I cant get over the amazing aroma the beans produce from being freshly ground, it makes the absolute best cup of coffee. I will never go back to pre ground. Another thing, its nice to be able to just make what I need instead of a large pile at once. A few cups is what I get from filling the grinder with beans. This way, I can do it once a day and have the freshest cup of joe possible. Works great, I would recommend to all the coffee addicts!I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GGB0NIY8SHTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013AAOCUA#wasThisHelpful","R2GGB0NIY8SHTI","A17CGZ4LXH5URT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17CGZ4LXH5URT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are just fantastic. I have always preferred black out panels over regular curtains but have only ever had plain, boring ones so I was thrilled to hang these up. The design is gorgeous and gives some flair to a basic window and the long, long, length makes my living room look bigger.They arrived quick and in a set of 2, each panel is 38"" wide when measured flat. 84"" in length. When hung up with a pole through the top holes each panel ends up losing a couple inches to be about 34"" wide. Take that into account when measuring windows.I think they are made beautifully, all of the seams are nice and even. Very tightly sewn and no loose threads anywhere. The material is very nice and since its a jacquard fabric its really strong but has some stretch to it. They're also a bit heavy and thick so I feel they will be great for the winter to be a little extra insulation on the windows.The color that I got is the deep and really rich red and it is very much true to the color on the listing picture. I am loving the pattern on the panels, its intricate with a swirl design that is a darker shade than the rest so it stands out.  Silver grommets are a pretty accent as well!Most of all what is important is that they do blackout greatly. Light is blocked out with nothing peeping through. Mid-day, bright sun, and still they keep it out. Perfect for me since it is always so hot here and without the light coming in, its a lot cooler inside. I am really liking the curtains and will be getting more for the spare bedroom.I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25B4JS2IZNYPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T50Y2Y6#wasThisHelpful","R25B4JS2IZNYPX","A17CGZ4LXH5URT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17CGZ4LXH5URT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am in love with the outcome I got from these butterfly 3D decals. I was picturing something entirely different that what they actually were when they arrived but they ended up being better than I hoped for in terms of how 3d they look.They arrived in baggies separated by color. Five different colors, all very bright and vivid. Each color has a few different sized butterflies in the bag, small, medium, and large. They do come flattened and need to be adjusted to make the 3D look. I just took both the wings and bent them outwards a little bit which was really easy since the butterflies are a thin plastic and are very pliable to work with.All of them stick to my wall really well even with my wall being textured so it does not have to be a flat surface to apply. They seem to stick to literally everything. The back of each one has like a little ball of adhesive smaller than my pinky fingernail. So its the smallest surface area that is actually stuck onto the wall which is what gives them that 3D look, like how they look like they are floating since hardly anything touches the wall. It really is so pretty!The butterflies can be placed and taken down and then replaced many times, the adhesive doesn't lose its stick so they can be reused over and over for different settings if need be. I placed a couple down lower so that my little boy could look and touch some and they ended up still in good shape so with a toddler who can be destructive that shows they are tough. The material seems strong. I prefer to stick them to the wall but there is also a little magnet in each of them so there are other options if I didn't want to adhere to the wall, the magnet is strong and they stay up well on the fridge.I love the overall outcome and I think they would make a beautiful addition to a weddings decor or a childrens party. Right now I just have them in my kids room and they look awesome!

"Too cool! I heard about these type of color changing spoons in the past and have wanted to try them out for some time. I ordered these BabieB ones and I am not disappointed! Its a really cool feature to have especially when safety is the number one factor I look for in childrens products.They arrived quickly, in a pack of 5. All are a different color so they appeal well to the little ones. My little niece has been using them with her jarred baby food and some purees which we heat up before feeding her. They work by just simply sticking the spoon in the food and stirring it around for a few seconds. If the spoon changes on the colored part of it, to white, then the food is too hot for baby. If the colored part of the spoon does not change then its cool enough for baby. Simple as that, nothing crazy. Definitely handy though and an easy way to test quickly.The spoons are rubbery in feel but do not bend, it reminds me of the coating on some toothbrush handles. It does make it easier for my niece to grip and hang onto the spoons especially with the curve they have where baby's hand goes. The only thing I would change about them would be the actual spoon part where the ""cupped"" area is since some food falls off easily. If it was deeper and more rounded I think the food would stay on better but they are close to being flat with a little curve. Overall, love them, and would highly recommend new parents try them out.

"These bowls have been perfect for our weekly road trips for my sons specialist doctor. Since we have to make the trip every week, 4 hours each way, it makes it a lot easier to pack snacks and such because the lids actually stay put so much better than the plasticware I was using before. It is difficult for my toddler to take the lids off so in turn it leaves me with less random messes and more saved food.They are great at home as well of course, with the suction cup being able to stick onto his high chair table. Suction is good and does work well on the plastic. I just place the bowl on the table and push down to get a good stick. The bowls all have handles on the sides so my son loves to carry around his cereal in them or whatever he has and I love the safety factor, all plastic, BPA free, and super easy to wash. I have not had problems with staining from food. I stuck one in the microwave yesterday to warm up some leftover spaghetti for him and all was fine. Same with the dishwasher but usually I just hand wash.

"I received the dolly in a box full of all the pieces and parts which needed to be built together before using. Building was not a problem and was fairly easy to do so. Upon opening the box all the pieces were in I discovered that they included a screwdriver! How cool is that? I didn't even need to provide my own tools to put it together which is extremely handy. Also, there was an included tape measure that will be perfect to measure furniture before putting on the dolly. Great additions. On the listing picture it shows an included level although I DID NOT see one of those in the box.So putting it together. It took about 15 minutes to put on all the feet and wheels, corners, sticker things, etc. ONLY because I actually used my own electric drill for the total of 16 small screws that are for the wheels. The other screws which are the 8 black for adjusting the length of the dolly were easily put in by hand. If I were to use the included screwdriver I assume it would have taken an additional 10-15 minutes.All of the pieces went together nicely, evenly, without issues. I am surprised at the durability of the dolly. All the plastic is very hard and thick, definitely strong. The metal feet are a great quality along with the wheels being thick and super hard. The whole thing has a great construction.I found that the wheels swivel well. I did not have problems with them turning or getting stuck, all are really smooth. The dolly does adjust and can be pulled larger just by unscrewing the black screws a bit and making it larger or smaller that way. It does not move once locked in. So nothing will roll off even if on a small downslope.I have to say I am impressed with it. For the current listing price, its a great deal.

"Its a great bag and has worked really well for me as an upscale looking diaper bag which I carry as my purse anyways so I dont need multiple bags. Since its so large I have everything in it plus plenty of room so that it doesn't look stuffed up.It arrived in great timing, only a couple days. Good condition, protected by a dust bag. The bag is a good size, a little wider than I thought it would be so in turn it looks a little short but I still think its cute. Even the handles were wrapped up in plastic. Inside is really pretty, lined in a silky fabric. The fabric inside is light colored so it might stain easily. Also, would be hard to wash the lining but the outside is very easy to clean since its a faux leather and can just be simply wiped clean.The leather is a beautiful color (I received the 'Brown') which is like an orange / rust. It is definitely an IN color for the fall season and will go with a lot of the current fall styles and shades. Its a fake leather so it does arrive a bit firm, not as soft as real leather of course but it seems to be softening up a bit as I use it more.There are a bunch of handy pockets. One of the sides has a zippered pocket along with the main large pocket which has a zipper as well. The inside has some various ones about the size for a cell or some keys. A zippered one which is great for my wallet and some pens and checkbook. Plenty of room and makes for good organization.It does seem to be built nicely, all of the seams are even and tight along with the handles firmly on the bag.

"I have a few flashlights around the same lumens as this one and it has compared well to those, keeping a bright light and multiple settings is unique so I prefer to use this one when heading out at night or coming home.The current cost for it is good and in my opinion worth it because of the features it has like being able to switch light settings from bright, medium, and even a cool looking strobe light. The flashlight also has a dial near the head that can be turned to change the focus from very thin and sharper to a wide angle for more spacious lighting. All this is actually done a lot easier than I expected and I dont really have to put in much effort to find the right setting at the time. Thats especially great in the dark when I wouldn't be able to see the flashlight anyways.While on Bright, the light is definitely vivid. Its the setting I use most, with a lot of strength and area coverage. It reaches really far down the street when I shine down it so nothing can hide! Other than the light settings it came with some additional accessories, the bike mount which I have not installed just yet but looks simple enough to do. No tools or anything are required to put it on. Also, the flashlight has a couple attachments like the lanyard that I like to keep around my wrist so I dont drop it and the metal clip on the side (very different!) which can be attached to my belt if I wanted.Its a good length, fits right in my hand at a bit less than 6 inches. It weighs more than I thought it would, has a nice durable weight to it. Note- the flashlight takes 3 AAA batteries that are NOT included and are installed into it by unscrewing the flashlight.

"This dish has been wonderful for large casseroles! It seems to heat food thoroughly without any overcooked areas, all even throughout the food. I made a green bean casserole in it last week that turned out amazing. Since the dish is nice and deep I can add more but still have it evenly baked. Last night was lasagna night and the meal turned out so nicely. Of course its a great place for the food to be in but it also looks really nice for presentation. The sides/handles have a textured feel with a cool design and the edges are smooth and rounded off.It was in great condition when it arrived, with no marks or scratches, so it was well protected. The size is the same as it says in the listing, 2 inches deep and 10.25 long by 6.5 wide. When its time for cleanup the dish washes nicely and does not give me problems with stuck on food even with that sticky lasagna. Most times I will stick in the dishwasher, no issues.The dish is a strong, nice glass. Made of borosilicate which in my opinion is the best option for glassware being as its a lot safer in case of drops it wont spread sharp ugly pieces all over, mostly staying contained.

"If your looking for a scooter that has a safety factor along with an age appropriate design, this is great and has worked so well for my toddler! He is young and not ready for anything that he would have to manage balance on his own so this Tackedoo scooter with one wheel in the back and double wheels up front gives him that balance he needs. No matter what, the scooter stays firmly on the ground so peace of mind is at play.The scooter arrived quickly and in a funny triangle box, all I had to do was pull it out and pull the handle up. It was folded. When folded up, its quite small so storage is no problem. It was a little smaller than I had anticipated but a good height for my kid nonetheless. From the deck where he has his feet to the handlebars (which is a t-bar) is about 2 foot. That does give some room where he reaches down to hold instead of the bars being right in front of him. It makes no difference and is still easy for him to ride. The weight limit says 44 lbs, my son is about 30 lbs, I actually stood on it for a few seconds to try it out before he did and it still held up without bowing or weakening so its extremely durable and built strongly.The entire scooter hardly weighs much at all. Just a few total pounds making it really light and great for little ones. Even with the scooter being lightweight, the pieces and parts and dense. Thick, sturdy, and seemingly tough. Deck is reinforced and the steering springs are strong.I noticed that this scooter is different from others with the way it works. Instead of the handle bars being turned to make the wheels turn, it works by leaning. Lean to the left and the wheels adjust to turn left, same with the right. The handlebars do not move at all. They are firmly stuck in one spot. On the back there is a break, my son just has to lift his foot up and on it so its pretty easy. The break works super well, one touch and it stops the scooter in its tracks with no problem.The wheels on the scooter are smooth and run so nicely on so many surfaces. Of course outside on the sidewalks but even inside on a thick carpet did not slow it down. That was great to be able to have my son practice on the carpet before heading out to the big dogs. Its a perfect height and size for my kid and it provides so much entertainment while being a source of activity so that kids are not inside in front of the tv all day. I think he really loves it and will grow with it for a few more years of use.For this review I am taking everything into account, the quality and craftsmanship along with the current cost and its totally worth it.

"This organizer is an awesome option for makeup storage. I have stuffed it full and still have some space left if needed. The drawers with the non-slip piece of material in them has been handy, keeping lipsticks and liners from rolling around when I shut or open it.It arrived in great condition, all wrapped up to prevent any damage to the very clear and clean acrylic. No scratches or scuffs on it, it was perfectly new and pristine. Since the entire thing is clear acrylic I can see everything inside. No more searching around for the right shade of shadow or the new matte raspberry lippy! Its all right in front of me. The organizer has nice wide drawers, bigger than I thought they would be. Just about 5-6 inches deep with a little over 9 inches wide. Each drawer has around 2 inches of space from top to bottom so its easy to fit a couple palettes stacked and side by side. Plenty of my compacts and single sized shadows fit too.The top half has a ton of different little compartments, different sizes and lengths. Some area on the side for compacts or whatever, a few inches wide. The compartments right now I have some smaller eyeshadow brushes and liner brushes in, as well as some general lipsticks. Great area for mascaras. The way its shaped like a half circle is super cute, unlike a lot of other acrylic organizers I have (most are just flat and simple).All together, its sturdy and built really well. Thick acrylic that wont break easily. All of the drawers slide nicely, no sticking. I do want to mention that the drawers are not connected to the box, but are just slid into it. So if pulled to far out they will come out. This is actually good for me though because I like to pull whole drawers out while doing my makeup. If working on my eyes, i'll pull the ""eye stuff drawer"" out. The top half fits well onto the bottom and does not slide around at all. The whole thing is a nice quality so for the current listing cost comparing to others of similar likeness, its worth it and a good deal. I have had no issues and right now am obsessed!

"Gosh I really liked this wig! For this review I am basing my rating on the features and quality of the wig along side the current price which is amazingly low for what I got. I wanted it just for some dress up and a change of my look for going out without having to go a full permanent direction. It works out well for me and I love the style.The color of the wig in the listing picture is a super bright red and when mine arrived it was exactly on point. Matched up. The red is vivid and wild! Love that. The length, measures up to about 28 to 29 inches at the longest point and has some really cute layers. The bangs are a bit longer than I wanted but I trimmed them up a little and it looks good. The hair even feels good, pretty soft for synthetic hair and definitely pulls the real look off. I would not think anyone would guess it was fake other than being so bright and obvious that way of course. Since the roots area is completely packed with hair and sewn in very tight, the lining is invisible. All evenly sewn into the lining.The wig came with a cap and a comb as well. Comb is okay, it works for untangling without making it all frizzy. Sometimes a little bit of hair will shed but its not an unreasonable or unexpected amount, just a normal shedding that happens. I havent had any bare spots or absurd hair loss on the wig. When combing with the included comb there is not a lot of hair pulled.On the underside is a mesh cap that is pretty stretchy. I dont have a large head, actually its kind of small, and it fits me perfectly with plenty of room to spare. Since there is a stretchy band that is attached underneath it I can tighten the wig on my head so it wont move around. Personally I do not use the strap much and instead I use some bobby pins which works nicely for me. It has not adjusted or fallen off ever while wearing.I do want to mention that when the wig arrived it was shiny. My real hair is not close to that amount of shine so to get the wig looking 10X more realistic looking I put some baby powder in a bowl and used a huge kabuki brush to brush all over the wig with the powder making sure to blend it in well so the white powder was gone but the shine was non existent anymore. It looks fantastic with the powder so its not super shiny anymore.The red is so wild and brings out such a fun playful side of me. I love wearing it out and people asking about it! I know that EmaxDesign makes some other colors of wigs as well so I plan on getting another for Halloween coming up. They would be perfect for adding to a costume.Another note: I tried to use a curling iron and a hair straightener on the wig and it seems to be ok at a low temperature, under 200 degrees Fahrenheit is okay. The curling iron added a little bit of extra wave to it but the straightener was better and smoothed out the waves nicely.****I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E8GYITP0TKU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y832XG4#wasThisHelpful","R2E8GYITP0TKU0","A17CGZ4LXH5URT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17CGZ4LXH5URT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the brushes! The whole set of 10 has all of the brushes I need to do a full face of makeup, including an eyeliner brush and an angled eyeshadow brush. The set arrived quickly and packed into a black drawstring pouch so portability is easy. I personally have them now in a makeup case but for travel the pouch will be handy.All of the bristles seem to be in the handles nicely, no issues with shedding while using or washing. They're a lot softer than expected for being synthetic and work really well for blending powders and eyeshadow. After washing the brushes I did not notice a change in the way the bristles feel so they seem to keep that softness regardless. The bristles are dense and packed with the fibers.They have nice handles as well, with gold toned metal attached to a black stem. All are comfortable to use with some being thick and some long and thin. With loose powders, the brushes pick it up well and transfer nicely. Some loose powder falls when doing my eyeshadow but nothing more than expected. They're beautiful and for the current listing price, worth it.I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KCGN1A85MMTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012SBVNY0#wasThisHelpful","R1KCGN1A85MMTV","A17CGZ4LXH5URT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17CGZ4LXH5URT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These cases have been great for downsizing. We had a ton of dvd's that have been collected over the years, tons just stacking up and filling up a dvd stand with no more room. I got these and since each case has a spot inside for 4 discs I was able to take all the excess and fill these cases up. That down sized our stand a lot and made a ton more room. For every four cases that I used to have stacked up, now I have one.The thing I was surprised about with these cases was that they are no larger or fatter than a normal dvd case is. I thought they were going to just be bigger but they are pretty much the same size. All of the 4 spots in them have a part in the center that holds the disk in and I have not had problems with the disks falling out or loose at all so they seem to be made well. The center flap on the inside is thin but durable.On the outside of the cases is some clear cover, so I can add a paper cover in it which I wrote all the names of the disk titles on. Helps with keeping me organized. For the current cost of the 10 pack and how much room it has saved me on the stand I think they're worth it and really great.I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R107QD9SDWNUE3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008KNDTB6#wasThisHelpful","R107QD9SDWNUE3","A17CGZ4LXH5URT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17CGZ4LXH5URT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a few different cosmetic organizers since I have so much makeup and I just love the way they look. The clear drawers, everything see through makes it look great and being able to see exactly where all my lipsticks and compacts, palettes, and jewelry are without even opening it up.It arrived quick and in really great shape, there were no scratches or marks and was super clean and clear. The drawers were already inside and the top organizer part fit right onto it perfectly and even. If I wanted to get another one I think they would stack with each other nicely. The top section has a bunch of spots for lipsticks and other pencils and mascaras, a larger spot for compacts, and the 12 lipstick spots are about 1 inch so they stand up nicely.The main drawer section has plenty of room for things. I did notice that the picture on the listing and the one I got looked a little different with mine having round handles instead of squared, either way it looks great. They slide out well without any getting caught. The drawers are deep enough for long and wide palettes with room to go. I have it filled with a ton of makeup and still have room. The bottom two are long and the top two are side by side, half the length of the bottom drawers.Overall, I love it and it keeps everything so nice and organized. I just really like these organizers and think they look so good when set up with makeup on a vanity.

"The closet was a bit of good and bad. With it being very compact in the box I had no idea it would be so large, so the end result is great being as it fits a lot of clothing. When opening it up and laying out all of the pieces and parts it was a little confusing figuring out which was what just from the illustrations on the instructions but eventually I got it.Setting it up was a little hassle since there is an extreme amount of bars and connectors, every piece needs to be correct and the right side or like me, you will end up having to take down a lot to fix one piece. The instructions were ok, not the easiest to follow, it took me about an hour to set the whole closet up. With the layers of fabric for the shelves, I thought they are alright for setting lightweight stuff onto, anything heavier like a stack of jeans would be iffy.I did notice that toward the end of building the closet a bunch of the poles would pop out from the connectors while I was trying to connect another, too loose maybe. They would not stay in very well.When it was all done and I got it all put together, it looked nice. The cover is strong and durable with the zippers on each section and that makes it easy to get what I need. The poles are sturdy and take hanged clothing well. Its a lot stronger at the bottom so I would recommend the heaviest down low. Overall, it does its purpose alright. I will give it some more reinforcement by using some heavy duty tape maybe.I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HUB4X0452A96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XO3DK98#wasThisHelpful","R3HUB4X0452A96","A17CGZ4LXH5URT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17CGZ4LXH5URT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The glasses arrived quickly and came with the silicone ice ball included, nice set and they seemed protected from scratches and such since there wasn't any apparent marks on the glass. The size is great and perfect for a whiskey drink, as well as the shape being curved inward at the top so rolling whiskey is a lot easier. Spills are prevented without making it harder to drink from.The glass is nice, thick enough that I dont think they would break easily and its really smooth, no dings. The ice ball is very cool and easy to set up. The top has a little hole that is filled with water after the two pieces are connected. Once full, goes into the freezer and a few hours later a large ball of ice is done.Awesome thing about the ice balls is that they fit into the whiskey glasses perfectly. Since they're large they dont melt as fast and keeps drinks cooler for a lot longer.

"Comfortable socks, the sizing seems great and they fit as they should. I usually wear a size 7 and they arent snug but they dont hang much over my toes either so there is a good amount of room for me.The pack comes with 12 pairs and all of them are a different color. For the current price and the amount received I think its a good deal. They are a bit thick so I am going to be wearing these during the winter. Although they feel like a nice thickness, the socks are still breathable.All of the seams are tight and I have not found any loose threads, washing and drying is fine and they didnt shrink.

"These are great! Perfect for crafts and they'll be useful for my next project coming up. I have used a bunch for some jewelry hangers I made and still have plenty left so the 100 pack is nice to have, the current cost for the huge bunch is a good deal as well.They were a little smaller than I expected but still a great size to use for the jewelry hanger. I took about 5 of them and also used a wooden clothes hanger and screwed them into the bottom of the hanger. After they were in, I just hung it up and put necklaces and earrings on the hooks. It looks really pretty and works fantastically.For my next project I am going to take some little glass bottles that have corks in the top and screw the screw eyes into the top of the cork. In the bottle will be cute sea shells.Point being, I have a lot of ideas that came from getting these cool screw eyes and there are plenty more to come. The looped part on the screws is just about closed, there is a tiny area that could be tightened to ensure a closure though and its done easily. If I wanted to open it more (which I did with the hanger project) then its easy to pull it open a bit more so hanging from them can be done. The metal is strong and sturdy but easy to work with and the length of the screw part seems to be long enough to stay durable in whatever, wood, plastic, cork, etc. I have a lot left but I will definitely get more of these when the time comes.I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25C6NC5B5Q2ZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQBMPKS#wasThisHelpful","R25C6NC5B5Q2ZW","A17CGZ4LXH5URT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17CGZ4LXH5URT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered two of these since each order only comes with one panel, so if you need more than one for a window you'll need two. They arrived in great shape, folded up onto a hanger so they looked presentable. Since they were folded, there was creases on some parts but after hanging for a few days those creases ended up just flattening out themselves without an iron needed.Based on the color I got which was the green, I thought they would be a bit less blackout than say black, but they are wonderful. I am looking at them now in the middle of the daytime and there is no light shining through the curtains whatsoever so they block out anything fantastically. Most blackout curtains are thick and bulky, too heavy, etc but these are nice and light without that extra bulk. The material is flowy and silky soft but with a matte color, no shine. They look great hanging up in my living room.The window I have them covering right now is about 90 inches wide and the two curtain panels cover it well. The length of the panels is very long so that was no problem.

"Getting the screen protector on was a simple process and it did come with some instructions to follow along with a wet wipe, a dust remover, and a micro fiber cloth for preparation and removing all the little particles before hand. It fits evenly and properly over my screen, although I can tell its there since its not extremely thin. Not a major issue, but I did have to get used to the feel.My stylus works fine with the protector, it doesnt have an effect on sensing my fingertips or the stylus and works as though nothing is there. Protector seems to be really strong, preventing any scratches which is what I wanted it for since my son likes to play with my phone all the time. I have not had a new scratch since applying.If the screen protector were to break then it would be a bit safer than not having it because it would just shatter itself into a bunch of tiny pieces instead of my screen breaking into sharp pieces of glass.

" 1:53 Mins One thing I forgot to mention in the video is that the duvet cover has the Slothzilla on BOTH sides, so thats great. It arrived packed all nice and tight into its plastic bag and only had some wrinkles on the places where it was folded. After washing and drying the wrinkles were gone. I didn't notice any major shrinkage from the dryer since it fit just the same. It seems pretty true to size and has a great length so there is a little hang over on the end of my bed. The bottom of the cover has the zipper which does not go from end to end, its more so in the middle so getting the duvet in was like putting it into a pillowcase. Took only a minute or two.Since its made out of 100% cotton, it is super soft. That makes for a really good nights sleep without being too hot. You seriously just have to feel it, its so nice. The printing quality done on the cover is excellent, clear picture and amazing artwork, all even so that the picture is centered. Sharp Shirter did an awesome job on this.

"I've been needing one of these for some time now, since I got my desktop and the numbers are just so awkward with placement on the keyboard. Being as I used to be a call representative doing the billing for a major company I had to use a numeric keypad often. So I got this one and I am really satisfied with it, all of the keys work properly and it works well.It arrived quickly which was nice and packed in a tough plastic container, one of those that seems never ending when trying to open and 100% requires scissors..It had the keypad and the little USB nano receiver included. It does take a battery but that was included, a AAA, so I loved that because not often now do I see things with the batteries in the package already. Installing was simple. Nano receiver went into the back of my desktop. TIP** To turn the pad on and off you need to push the NUM LOCK key, which is sometimes hard to remember.I tested the keypad out on a word document which it did well. All of the keys pressed smoothly. Nothing stuck. The surface of the keys is nice and has a soft feel. The underside has rubber feet so it doesnt slide around on my desk. I really liked the tilt it has so it feels more natural to rest upon it when using, tilted upward away from me.

"I wont go a day without having a screen protector put on my phone, which has definitely helped tremendously for the time I have had it on there so I got this one for a friend who thought her case was doing the job fine but could use more protection against scratches on the screen.The protector is made from a high strength and tough built tempered glass which is a lot better and more resistant to breakage than normal glass because of the chemical or thermal process and safer if it does break since it will shatter in to a ton of tiny fragments that wont have sharp edges (unlike a phone screen which will). So its a tough cookie. I bent it around and tested it out a bit before applying to the phone and it held up nicely. The corners are all rounded and fit well against the edges of the screen so there was not any overlapping.Applying it was easy and the pack came with some tools to make that so. An alcohol pad to wipe clean the screen before hand, a dust remover because of all the little particles that might be missed and so there wont be an irritating little piece in there after the protector is on, and a microfiber cloth which is nice and removes fingerprints and dirt after too. The instructions were easy to follow so I had no trouble and since it fit well, it has stayed put through the week without issues. Using the touchscreen has been no different, the only thing I can say about it is that I definitely know its there. Its not like a super thin piece of glass so I can feel the difference from before.

"I was able to do a few different vases with the one order of these gel beads. They look really cool and add a bit of something nice to look at other than just water so they're pretty appealing to the eye. For the current cost, the amount I got is great. When they arrive they're in a clear plastic bag, very lightweight, and completely clear. There was definitely thousands upon thousands of those little beads in the package, probably about a mm in size when dry.The easiest way I found to use them was to just fill the water up in the vase with them inside instead of trying to transfer afterwards because they become extremely slippery and about 1/4-1/3 inch size when fully absorbed. Just dont over fill. It takes about 8 hours but starts to have some growth after an hour or two.Its been a week and they have not had any problems like mold or any scent, the color has stayed as clear as they were when they arrived. After a few days they started to feel a little less moist than before so adding a bit of water helped and plumped them up so I would recommend adding water twice a week to prevent them from shrinking back up. My roses were not harmed in the vase of beads and seemed to act as though it was just in water so apparently these do not effect plants which is great.

"Beautiful! I love this bag for my monthly overnight trips that I take with my son and its large enough to fit both of our necessary belongings without feeling overly bulky. The leather canvas is modern and looks great with all of the brass pieces on the straps. On the bottom there is a thin strip of leather that matches the straps as well so the design is really unique.The inside is amazing, with the super pretty lining and so many pockets! Multiple zippered pockets and large compartments so the storage area is wide and plentiful. My laptop fits inside along with our clothing and necessity's, my sons toys, some snacks, diapers, etc. The front has a zippered area as well and the reverse side has a vertical pocket that is perfect for money and phones. All of the zippers are easily pulled, no problems getting caught or pulled off of the track. On the bag are the straps which also work instead of being strictly for looks. They can be tightened and adjusted as well as the shoulder strap included. The shoulder strap does come off so it can be used as either, holding the handles or not, and its comfortable being thick.All of the bits and pieces attached to the bag give an amazing cosmetic appeal but also have a lot of function. Since the bag is so well made and extremely well built it will last a long time and through a lot of wear and tear through the years. Its seams are all nice and tight, constructed so well and evenly. I can tell a lot of hard work went into crafting the bag and for the amount of use and functionality it will give, it deserves 5 stars and more.I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WTDU4NGUGZJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QF8ZF56#wasThisHelpful","R1WTDU4NGUGZJM","A17CGZ4LXH5URT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17CGZ4LXH5URT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The cat decals arrived quick and in good condition, there was one minor flaw which was the bend in the paper backing and vinyl of one cat but once stuck on the window its hardly noticeable. They are a bit small but with the glow in the dark feature, they stand out wonderfully. All of the cats are rolled up and come off of the backing easily and are placed onto any surface nicely. I have mine on the window without any air bubbles or problems with the sticking.At first they do not glow but seem to need a charge to get them going. To do this I just held it up to a bright light for about 2 minutes and then when its dark they glowed fantastically. So now that they are already placed, I will use a flashlight to ""charge"" whenever needed.Each individual cat decal is different from the next so the variety included is nice.

"I actually do not have a recliner. I have a sofa that has a middle console where the remotes and magazines are placed with a couple cup holders in the center so its really hard to find a protector for it with the odd shape it has. I figured I would try this since my sofa if cut in half would be similar to a recliner and have the arms. Well, it worked! It worked really well. I placed the protector over one side of the sofa and the arm cover parts lay perfectly, one on the arm and the other on the middle console area. The top of the protector covered nicely as did the bottom.With spills and such I think its great, I have not had any issues with stains. The material is thicker than I thought it would be so it does have a comfortable feel on top of the couch. The straps keep it on so it doesn't budge when my son is jumping around on it. Also, since its reversible we are able to use either side to change it up whenever which is nice. I plan on getting another one of these for the other side since it worked out so well. Thick, durable construction with tightly sewn seams so it will definitely last a long time.I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34MPQ1DPG5AI9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XFMCJ68#wasThisHelpful","R34MPQ1DPG5AI9","A17CGZ4LXH5URT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17CGZ4LXH5URT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Miss Piggy really has it going on. She is a lot larger than I thought she'd be at a true 19 inches tall and with her natural pig curves of course. Stunning to say the least.The plush is adorable, the details are wonderful, and the hair is pretty realistic for a plush stuffed doll. Imagine a huge barbie filled with cotton. I love that the dress is velour, its really pretty. Miss Piggy has makeup on, jewelry, even high heels which is super cute.I did notice that when I took the plush out of the package the hair was a bit frazzled and could use a combing but that was easily fixed. The seams are all nicely done and tight so a child with the toy wont be a problem or be ruined quickly.Its a great addition to a Muppets collection or a child who loves her!I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O3N78DG3O2TV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8VLCUA#wasThisHelpful","R1O3N78DG3O2TV","A17CGZ4LXH5URT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17CGZ4LXH5URT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are great, for the right person. If you are like me, a little craft challenged, then maybe go with another option or have a friend do them for you because they can be confusing to put together. The instructions are okay but I would have rather saw some illustrations with more detailed info on how to make them.They pom pom balls come in a bag and are all flattened. After trying a few times and failing I finally figured it out. The string that is tied around the middle of the flat paper needs to stay tied around the paper, then one by one, take each piece and pull outward until all of them are pulled out. After that, adjust as needed to fill in the empty spots and to make it look like a pom pom.Note- you have to be careful to pull the paper outward because its very thin and will tear easily.The balls end up being from 5"" to 11"" and are really lightweight. They will hang easily without any issues. Since the pack I got only came with 5 of the pom poms I was a bit disappointed since it was difficult to figure out the first couple. After messing up the first ones its hard to make them work as the paper gets wrinkly and torn. If you know what you are doing then they are awesome though so I would recommend a crafty friend to go along with them!I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ41E5OYV5VG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FDJY6WQ#wasThisHelpful","RQ41E5OYV5VG5","A17CGZ4LXH5URT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17CGZ4LXH5URT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its been a long time since I purchased CoverGirl eye makeup but I really needed a dark shadow quick and cheap so this is the chosen one. Im satisfied more so than I thought I would be with it and the vibrancy of it is impressive. I think that this brand has came a long way and improved a lot since the last time I used it over 5 years ago. This one is called Shimmering Onyx, although I dont see much shimmer when applied, its dark and smooth. Blending is easy, I recommend using a blending brush and not the one included. For the current cost of the shadow its worth it. The eyeshadow compact piece is pretty thick so it will last a really long time. Most of all, it lasts enough time. I did not expect it to last all day of course, but it lasts through work fine without having that annoying creasing effect. I tried it out with a shadow primer and it gave about an hour extra in lasting time. For what its worth, I would definitely get this shadow again and have already got a couple more shades.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FCSGYVA1P2MQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001KYO0NS#wasThisHelpful","R3FCSGYVA1P2MQ","A17CGZ4LXH5URT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17CGZ4LXH5URT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The fit of the slippers on myself is excellent. I usually wear a size 7 in shoes but got these in a 38 which is about a 7.5 in US sizing, they fit great. Not too big or too small. Even the width is fine, not squeezing the sides of my feet or anything but a comfortable fit where I wont slip out.They have some great padding on all sides and the bottom is wonderfully cushioned. I can walk outside to the mailbox without feeling the rigid hard ground underneath although they are for indoors. On the plus side as well is the bottom which has a rubber sole with some texture that keeps me from slipping and sliding all over the hardwood floors. Even if I tried to slide I couldn't with the grip it has.I am in love with the super soft cotton and polyester blend material on the slippers. Just incredibly comfy and feels amazing to slip into after a long day, such a soft smooth fluff all around.

"I am really surprised at the vivid and bright color produced by these. Of course everyone knows that Crayola has always been one of, if not the best, brands of crayons and the most quality produced so I knew what to expect but these ones still blew me away. I dont know if its a different formula of crayon wax or a change in production but they do feel a little different. The crayons are a lot smoother and seems a little softer when touching the tips. When put onto paper the crayons do not have to have much pressure to notice a lot of the color transfers so much easier.  I am impressed to say the least.The box is standard with 24 colors. The pack comes with 3 boxes though so its definitely worth it. I have put away the other 2 boxes after giving my son one to start with and the one box is lasting fine. I have not noticed any issues with the quality whatsoever and none of them are breaking due to being cheap.On the box it says they are washable which is great although I do not have issues with my kid drawing on himself to need a crayon washing but since they do feel like a softer wax I can tell they would not be hard to show up on skin. So being washable is a great feature that I have not seen in crayons before.They are wonderful and like always, Crayola has done really well!I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LUAS5T01ZF94/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0033LWTL6#wasThisHelpful","R3LUAS5T01ZF94","A17CGZ4LXH5URT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17CGZ4LXH5URT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The creativity and imagination that comes from such a simple item is fascinating to witness. Watching my little boy use what he has and explore that creative side is a lot of fun. The Wikki Stix are just made from a strand of standard yarn, about 8"" each, and coated in a thick layer of silky hardened wax which makes the stix really pliable and able to adhere to almost anything. I think its a genius idea.I got this party pack that came with 3 packs each with 6 colors (4 stix of each color totaling 24). In the packs there were small instruction sheets with illustrations on them, ideas for kids to start with projects to make. All of the stix were easy to tear from one another and were in great shape when opening. We loved the bright vivid main colors.Overall, the Wikki Stix are just so much fun. My husband made a fish and stuck in on the wall, it has still not moved so the stickiness is amazing! My son has been playing around with them for days, bending them up and then unraveling his creation only to begin on another so they truly are reusable without issues. After each use they can be re flattened simply and its not noticeable that it was used before. I also noticed that the stix do not pick up hair and other stuff in the wax if they were to be played with on the carpet so they look good all the time. I think they would be perfect for a classroom setting and as a teaching tool. Great fun item for the kids!I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25A6JUCEYZGJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010R3002M#wasThisHelpful","R25A6JUCEYZGJ8","A17CGZ4LXH5URT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17CGZ4LXH5URT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"D'Eco cosmetic organizers are my absolute favorite! I have many of this brand and every time I get a new one its always the same great quality and craftsmanship I expected it to be.This one has a lot of room. The sizing is large and plenty of drawers to put makeup or jewelry into. Almost 10 inches in length, about 4 inches wide, and almost 6 and 1/2 inches tall. It has two longer drawers on the bottom that fit almost all of my palettes and some compacts. I have some liners and mascaras in the bottom as well. The four smaller sized drawers on the top half are the perfect size for lipsticks, hair ties, clips, and jewelry. Drawers are deeper than I thought they would be at around 1 3/4 - 2"".  Its made really well, the organizer does not have a bunch of glued pieces and parts, looks like it was 3D cut along with each of the individual drawers. All the handles are firmly and evenly placed, drawers slide nicely without sticking so its super smooth.I love having the ability to see through it, the acrylic is extremely clear as though it were glass. I dont have to dig around to find the item I need since its visible and organized. I would definitely get another one of these 6 drawer organizers from D'Eco, especially since the top is completely flat so its entirely possible to stack them on one another easily and safely. They're sturdy and durable so it would not be an issue. It would also be hard to damage since the material is so strong and well made.Highly Recommended!!

"I am disappointed in the Home-Complete shoe rack organizer for the reasons stated below.1. Quality of materials- The box comes with the pieces and parts needed to build the shoe rack by hand of course. Eight thin metal poles which are light and hollow and the two black plastic side pieces that the poles are arranged into. The eight poles that are included seem to be somewhat fragile, to where they would bend if a heavier boot is placed on it. With the side pieces, they're just cheap. Thin and easily breakable plastic that will crack after a short time.2. Difficult assembly- After trying four or five times to arrange and assemble the poles into the sides I finally figured out the issue. Out of all the poles, 3 of which were a 1/2 inch shorter than the other 5. With the poles varying in sizes there was not a fully functional way that I could assemble the shoe rack without having a couple poles pop out while I added one more. It was just a circle of frustration. Also, the sides have many spots for the poles to go into, depending on how you want the rack to be, but the holes did not seem tight enough to keep them in and be able to set shoes on.3. Storage area- I was not able to fully complete the assembly of the rack although I did see the spacing in between the poles at the largest and the smallest. At even the largest spacing apart (for larger shoes) it would still not be able to hold large mens work boots. My husband wears a size 13 and they would not have nearly enough room to sit on the rack. The smallest spacing would work for my toddlers shoes.So with these issues, I cannot give much of a good rating. The rack could have potential if the poles issue was corrected and for smaller sized shoes though. I actually am fond of the design and style of it and hope to see one similar with a higher level of durability in the future.I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UZF5H8P4WWZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JUQOVGY#wasThisHelpful","R2UZF5H8P4WWZM","A17CGZ4LXH5URT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17CGZ4LXH5URT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have built up quite a collection of these acrylic organizers and I love them. This one is so useful since I have hundreds of lippys and liners that need a spot so its quite full now.There are 24 little compartments in the organizer, each of them about one square inch in size. I do want to point out that in the listing it says it can hold nail polish and bottles but honestly it would not unless they are very small. The squares fit lipstick, liners, and brushes fantastically though which is what I think its perfect for. The whole size of it is about 5.75 inches wide, almost 4 deep, and about 3 tall at the highest point (1.75 inches tall at the shortest point). Its angled upward like stairs so every cosmetic item placed in the organizer can be seen easily behind the other.Its really strong in material and construction since its all one solid piece. There are no pieces are parts glued together in a way that it could break, just one laser cut to guarantee durability. When it first got here my son threw it around a few times when I wasn't looking and it doesnt have a scratch on it. Well made and will last a long time.

And this was the best price of anywhere I shopped!  And, even with the ripping problem, I'll still buy more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CT0F3N3SRM26/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BWJ2TE8#wasThisHelpful","R3CT0F3N3SRM26","A2DQQUEPK53ORW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DQQUEPK53ORW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these for my dog's allergy.  I give him half a pill during the high pollen season, and it works great!  I think I'll start using them, too.

"This is a terrific series that a lot of people haven't found!  It's put out on the History channel.  I was lucky enough to watch the very first episode and I was hooked.  Great story line, great acting.  LOTS of violence, though.  So, if gore gets to you, you might need to hit the fast forward MANY times.  My brother caught one episode at my home and immediately asked what ""movie"" it was.  Excellent production quality.  I don't think you'll be disappointed if you get this series.  I love it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MMQIFGHGY0NT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9AHY2K#wasThisHelpful","R3MMQIFGHGY0NT","A2DQQUEPK53ORW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DQQUEPK53ORW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"They say southern schools are behind those of the north.  It would seem this movie agrees.  The boy comes home to tell his dad he learned all about ants.  And, that there is only one female in the whole colony!  SO WRONG!  Anyway, I hate movies that make such obvious errors.  I watched the movie on cable and it was okay considering tgat there was nothing else to watch on a Wednesday night just before the TV seasons are changing.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F6MX942MHPJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003N3J6RO#wasThisHelpful","R2F6MX942MHPJY","A2DQQUEPK53ORW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DQQUEPK53ORW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love PUR filters.  I use them on my faucets and in my bedroom pitcher.  I have a disability that often keeps me in bed, so I have a small refrigerator and electric teapot in my bedroom.  I used to have to come downstairs to get fresh PUR water, but that was too hard for me, so I bought the large pitcher.  Now I get my water from the bathroom faucets and run it through my PUR pitcher.  The water is great and I can have my cup of tea without all that extra effort.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36URP7XA2AOCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000067DZX#wasThisHelpful","R36URP7XA2AOCU","A2DQQUEPK53ORW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DQQUEPK53ORW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These remind me of the thin plastic bags we used to get at a deli.  They are NOT like the plastic lunch bags from the supermarket from Hefty, etc. but, for my purposes they are fine.  I buy large quantities of meat and deli meats when it is on sale.  I also cut up my own steaks, and roasts by buying an entire beef tenderloin, etc.  I then put them in vacuum sealed bags before freezing them. In order to keep the meats from freezing into big blocks, I put them in separate plastic bags, like theses, before placing them in the vacuum bags.  The bags work rather well for that purpose, and keep the moisture in the meats.  I have now added an additional piece of non stick silicone between them.  Now they never stick together and the meats can be taken out in just the right portions I want.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EGGX38SHC8U2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZZUJT4#wasThisHelpful","R2EGGX38SHC8U2","A2DQQUEPK53ORW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DQQUEPK53ORW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not really sure HOW to rate a hair brush, but it works fine for me.  I keep it in my handbag for those fix ups you might need during the day.  I like teasing brushes and have several.  They all seem to work fine, BUT, if you are using a blow dryer and a teasing brush, like I do, get natural bristles. The brushes with plastic bristles will soften with the heat and bend out of shape.  At least, that was my experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROX2F46F0R8VI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036OJEFO#wasThisHelpful","ROX2F46F0R8VI","A2DQQUEPK53ORW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DQQUEPK53ORW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I paid a small fortune buying these from Excaliber for use in my dehydrator.  I had no idea that I could buy them elsewhere!  Silly me!  When I saw these, they LOOKED the same, so I thought I'd try them.  They are exactly like those I paid a fortune for!  Fantastic!  The only thing I don't like about ANY of them, I'd washing them. They're large and you really need a flat surface to wash them.  Then you need a place to put them to dry.  THAT I dislike a lot.  If someone has a solution to the ""washing problem,"" I'd love to hear it!  The two sets I bought here, I cut into smaller pieces to use between pieces of meat when I vacuum seal and freeze them. I specifically wanted them to freeze cold cuts.  I put the cold cuts into lunch bags, separated with pieces of these mats, vacuum sealed them and put them in the freezer.  Last night I took out a few bags for dinner.  They separated without ANY effort!  Love these things!  So many uses I can think of.  Now, any suggestions for washing them?","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MXFEXAN57XFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PLE1O4#wasThisHelpful","R1MXFEXAN57XFJ","A2DQQUEPK53ORW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DQQUEPK53ORW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have lots of silicone items in my kitchen, silicone baking pans, silicone utensils, silicone pot holders, silicone funnels, etc.  NONE of them had a bad odor when I got them.  This is the first time I got a silicone kitchen item that SMELLS!  It also has a top piece that looks like it was hand cut to its round shape by a child who couldn't cut well.  It might work, but I don't like it.  It looks like something I'd find in a dollar store.  I'm not sure I'd feel safe using it around food.
