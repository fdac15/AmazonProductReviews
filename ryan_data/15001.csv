"We have a 13 lb. Havanese, and he figured this thing out after using it a couple of times.  Now we feed him his meals from it, and he gets super excited when he sees anyone pick it up.  We generally keep the holes wide open, because his kibble can get stuck, otherwise.  It now takes him around 10 minutes to eat, instead of maybe a minute (if that).This is made of hard, durable plastic.  It WILL make a lot of noise on a hard floor, but I don't find it that bad - usually he's eating while I'm cooking supper, or he's eating breakfast while everyone is getting ready in the morning.  We also feed him in the next room so that the cats can eat without being bothered.My only issue is that I wish it was easier to fill.  Putting a few snacks or a small amount of kibble is fine, but trying to load the full small scoop for his dinner is a little time consuming.  But it's not so bad that I will remove a star, because this thing's a hit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRLT1DYMK6KL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YHB8EI#wasThisHelpful","RRLT1DYMK6KL6","A22Z554ZQ8NFPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22Z554ZQ8NFPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's such a simple thing, but it works beautifully for what it does.  In the past I've washed my rice right in the pot from the rice cooker.  This uses a lot more water and seems to take forever.  This bowl allows the water to drain slowly, and the results so far (3-4 batches of rice made) seem to be superior.  No starch scorching on the bottom of the cooker, rice is less ""gloopy"".  Overall, a noticeable improvement.Plus, it's well made and I see no reason why it won't last forever.

"From looking at some of the negative or mixed reviews, I think people have unrealistic expectations for this little guy.We've been using this for about 2 months in our bathroom (about 8 x 10).  The bathroom has a small window that opens and a (pretty much useless) ventilation fan, but we still get mildew on the ceiling over time.  The bathroom gets strong afternoon direct sunlight, but it still has trouble drying out, for whatever reason.First, this small unit does not work as quickly as a large compressor-based unit.  The reservoir will fill in about 2 days, if left running constantly.  There is a small amount of noise - and I mean it's very minor.  I don't see how anyone could complain that this is noisy.  It has to have a fan to circulate the air, and it produces a low-level hum in the background.  When it's running we can still have conversations with the kids when we're brushing teeth before bed, etc.  It's a very minimal amount of noise.The unit has a smallish, fairly narrow wall-wart, which isn't too obtrusive, but it does take up more space than a standard plug.  Not a huge deal.Removing and draining the reservoir is very easy.The pattern we've followed this summer is that we open up and air out the bathroom after a shower, then the window is left open just a crack, and the door is mostly closed while the dehumidifier runs.  Within a few hours there is a noticeable difference in the feeling of the room.  We generally leave it running all night, and during the day when we're home.  We generally get half a reservoir of moisture every day, and while it takes awhile to notice the difference, there is a big difference in the room now.If you're not getting good results you may have it in a room that's too large, or the humidity level may not be high enough for this unit to make a noticeable difference.  For us, it works.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GUCFHZAN317U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000H0ZDD2#wasThisHelpful","R1GUCFHZAN317U","A22Z554ZQ8NFPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22Z554ZQ8NFPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I found this book very enjoyable, and I'm a fan of the HBO series.  There are some who seem to feel that the author is somehow denigrating the USMC, First Recon, or the US Military in general in this book, but I don't find that to be the case at all.There is always going to be some subjectivity in reporting like this.  So much of it is based on Wright's memory, etc.  What I think this captures very well is the devastating nature of modern warfare and the logistical impossibilities of major military operations, especially when multiple branches are involved.It is truly amazing that there weren't more friendly fire deaths during this operation, considering the many close calls First Recon seemed to have.  This book does not glamorize war, nor does it place an unfair moral burden on the young men tasked with the invasion of Iraq.  It's so difficult to generalize about a book like this.  The enlisted marines come across as very brave, sometimes foolish, often conflicted, and very human.  Officers get less coverage, and though the decisions of the higher-ups at times seem to border on the absurd, I feel that this book gives the reader the very real sense that the person giving the order is usually just the messenger, and that messenger may be at odds with what they're expected to do.Also, and perhaps most importantly, this book really gives a sense of how random and tragic modern warfare is.  Civilians get killed constantly.  I don't see this as a reflection on the marines portrayed in the book - they are put in an impossible situation with regards to how to execute their orders while keeping themselves and their comrades safe, while accurately identifying military threats - but rather the nature of the modern war machine.Politically, it doesn't matter where you sit.  Regardless of the Rolling Stone byline, I don't think Evan Wright brought any particular agenda to the table with this book.  It is not intended as 100% accurate history, but rather his perceptions of things as they happened.  I found that I was in the position of rooting for the marines and for the safety of the innocents caught up in brutality, as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X7TMK3E27QPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425224740#wasThisHelpful","R1X7TMK3E27QPL","A22Z554ZQ8NFPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22Z554ZQ8NFPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I prefer cargo shorts and needed some new ones and saw these.  I liked the idea of the stretch fabric.  If you're unsure, a 13"" inseam is long.  They probably hang 2-3"" below my knee (I'm 6' 3"").  The fabric is slightly stretchy, they are not like sweat pants or some other super stretchy material.  They feel just like any other Dickies work pants or shorts, if you've ever had them.  The fabric feels almost like denim.  I wore them for the first time today and they're very comfortable.

"I have a little Sandisk mp3 player with a wide spring-loaded clip built into the back side of the unit.  I've had it for a few years now and the clip has held up just fine, but I noticed a couple of weeks ago that the unit was not sitting flat, but was at a slight angle when resting on the clip.  It turns out that one of the plastic mounts for the hinge of the clip was starting to break.  There was a crack, and opposite the crack on the other side of the mount, the plastic was turning white.I tried some cheapie dollar store super glue, which lasted about an hour before coming undone - and that was after letting it set overnignt.  The place I needed to fix is in a cramped place, so my options were pretty limited.  I decided to see if there was better super glue out there, saw the ratings for this stuff, and gave it a shot.I glued the crack and taped the clip to relieve pressure on the joint while it dried, and let it set overnight.  It's been about a month now and the bond is still holding, and I use this thing every single day.Needless to say, I'm impressed, and I now know that all super glues are not the same.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GD0I3U4LQ4BE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Y49R7G#wasThisHelpful","R2GD0I3U4LQ4BE","A22Z554ZQ8NFPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22Z554ZQ8NFPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using this for about a month now.  I've been snoring for a long, long time and my wife has gotten used to it.  A friend told me about good results with an infomercial product that was similar to this - and much more expensive.  I liked the fact that you mold this mouthguard to your teeth.  That process is very easy - I just poured boiling water into a large coffee mug and followed the instructions.  If you've ever molded a mouthguard for sports, it's basically the same process.So, yes, this thing initially feels large, but it's not uncomfortable.  The breathing holes are large enough that I never feel claustrophobic while wearing it.  Initially my teeth were a little bit sore, but that went away after a few days.  Now I wear it without issue.The other night I forgot to put it in and my wife said she couldn't sleep because of my snoring - so it actually works.  And that's the thing - I don't hear myself snoring, so I can only go by what my wife says, and she is very happy with this thing.  Also, I absolutely and in all seriousness feel more refreshed in the morning.  That was something that I noticed right away.  I really feel better, and I no longer get groggy and sleepy in the afternoons at work like I used to.I couldn't be happier with this thing.  I hesitated to buy something like this for many years because all these things seem like gimmicks or scams.

"I'm not a tennis expert by any means, but when I was younger I played casually quite a bit and I have a (very) basic grasp of fundamental strategy.I got this a week or so ago as the FAOTD and so far I'm very pleased.  I play this on a Samsung Galaxy 2 7.0 tablet.  The graphics are very good and the game is fun.  The touchscreen controls, which use finger swipes to indicate the type of shot, are generally responsive.  I've not tried to use the virtial control pad options because the idea doesn't appeal to me - I want my tablet games to be simple, and simulated gamepads never work well for me.  I don't have the patience to master something where I can't feel the buttons.My only gripe with the game is that the game sometimes confuses a shot command with a movement command.  To position your player you simply touch where you'd like him to go.  The instructions tell you that the quicker you give your shot command after the other player hits the ball, the more power you'll have.  Well, if you, say, reposition your player to the center of the court, and then give a shot command while he's in motion, the game will often read that second input as another movement command, so your player will run to another part of the court.  This happens more than I would like.  I've tried to be very deliberate with my finger swipes, but it still happens.Overall, this is a great game, especially for a FAOTD.  Fun and challenging, and worth the time I've spent with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31ORU4JMMYGIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CWMAQYY#wasThisHelpful","R31ORU4JMMYGIP","A22Z554ZQ8NFPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22Z554ZQ8NFPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'd gotten the idea of sketching with flat pencils from a book on drawing I'd read a few years ago.  I've tried to use some carpenter's pencils before, and they certainly work, but the ""medium"" lead is more in the 2H range, and I prefer darker tones if I'm using a large drawing medium. (although, now that I think about it, I can probably use both together very successfully, which I haven't tried yet).These pencils are more of a flatish oval than an actual carpenter's pencil, but the lead is roughly the same - wide and flat - and these are longer than a carpenter's pencil by an inch or so.I just carve away the wood and leave the lead square so that I can get broad strokes with the wide side, thinner with the thin side, and relatively fine lines with the corners or edges.  These are a lot of fun - it's like painting with a pencil.  I like the 4B lead - it allows me to easily get at least 4 or 5 tonal values for my sketches.Obviously these work best with larger sketches or drawings, but I enjoy the results, and it's easy to rough in a thumbnail with these, as well.One last note - I did not purchase these through Amazon.  As large a vendor as General is, you'd think Amazon would carry more of their stuff themselves, but I guess this is a niche item.  The price and shipping asked by the current 3rd party vendor is a bit absurd and I wouldn't pay it.  Look around and you can find much better deals.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FWI0WG1SRPWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001RCJXLW#wasThisHelpful","R1FWI0WG1SRPWQ","A22Z554ZQ8NFPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22Z554ZQ8NFPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been exploring some old PS2 racing games lately and this was one I picked up a few weeks ago.If you don't follow rally racing, then you need to understand that this is purely racing against the clock on linear courses.  You don't see other cars and you're just trying to go as fast as possible and get the best time.  Each rally is several stages (4-5 in this game, many more in real life) and the driver with the lowest overall time wins that rally.The Ps2 certainly has its limits, and this is a 10 year old game, but it's still extremely fun. The cars have a good feel, the sound design is excellent and there's a good variety to the stages.  There's a lot of content here, and because there are so many courses, replayability is very high.  The controls work very well (I just use a dual shock, I've never made the investment in a good wheel setup) and the game has a good sense of speed.  Also, there is a good cockpit view that's fun to race with, though it feels a little bit more cramped than it should (it feels like the driver - i.e. your view - has his head resting against the window.  The left door post shouldn't obstruct your view to the extent that it does), but it's still fun, and makes the game challenging.My gripes?  I'd like to be able to create my own driver.  There is damage modeling, but it's very forgiving.  There should be more of a time penalty for rolling your car or driving off a cliff.  For example in TOCA 3, you can hit a wall and you're simply done if your car is damaged too much.  That kind of realism as an option would be nice.  It also would've been nice if car setup had more options - you get three choices for things like tires, suspension and brakes.Overall, though, a fun game with decent graphics that is still a blast many years after it was released.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X731PDLKEN6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000063RRM#wasThisHelpful","R1X731PDLKEN6H","A22Z554ZQ8NFPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22Z554ZQ8NFPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Obviously the meaning of ""How to Read a Painting"" can be interpreted in different ways.  This book, as other reviews mention, focuses on the history and some of the symbolism, and not on the artistic, aesthetic point of view.For example, the author mentions that a Van Eyck has the husband near the window because he is connected to the outside world while the wife is more connected to the inner workings of the home.  Composition is otherwise not mentioned from an aesthetic sense.I love this book.  I'm very far removed from my college art history classes, so delving into this area with a fresh mind has been a lot of fun.  Yes, the information provided is selective and limited.  But I'd rather learn a little about a bunch of masterpieces than read a textbook, which can get old very fast.This, to me, seems like a perfect starter book.  It is an easy read because the text is limited - but it still provides a wealth of information.  Also, though the pictures are small, the printing is of high quality, so details can be viewed with a magnifying glass, if need be.I've learned a lot from this book and I'm very glad to have it around.  It is a starting point, not the only book on art history you'll ever need.  I think it does what it sets out to do very well.Another reviewer suggested Mary Acton's books, and I may move on to them next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCEEUBX8RJWXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CDUGYU#wasThisHelpful","RCEEUBX8RJWXO","A22Z554ZQ8NFPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22Z554ZQ8NFPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is your basic, no-frills Bic pen that you've seen a thousand times.

"I have a few of the Lyra water soluble graphite crayons, which I love.  I bought some of these, thinking I was getting more water soluble graphite (I was unaware at the time that Lyra made both kinds of graphite crayons) but decided to keep them.So, think of this as a big graphite stick.  I don't know what the filler content is, it doesn't seem waxy at all like a crayon.  So far the only difference between this and my regular drawing pencils is that these don't seem to blend quite as smoothly.  In other words, if you block in some shapes and/or tones, and try to blend them together with a stump, some of the lines may remain visible - but softened - within the area of tone.  With a regular pencil or charcoal it's very easy to make the lines completely disappear.  Of course this can be mitigated by applying the lines more evenly or smoothly or lightly, or using the broad side of the crayon to put down areas that will be blended.To me this isn't a huge deal.  I don't always blend my sketches, and a little texture never hurt anybody.  As I've been using these I've been trying to maintain the ""pencil point"" shape by using the side of the sharpened area for shading, which keeps a bit of a point for smaller lines.Again, these are fun and it was a happy accident to have them, so I have no complaints and I find myself returning to them because I'm enjoying them so much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NZO3WXGD2MS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012EVORQ#wasThisHelpful","R3NZO3WXGD2MS","A22Z554ZQ8NFPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22Z554ZQ8NFPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My favorite ballpoint for drawing is the Uniball Gel Impact 1.0mm, which has a great flow of ink and a nice bold line.As far as felt tips go, the Pentel Sign Pen is now my number one.  I actually had a weird deja vu moment after I ordered these.  I remember that I somehow acquired a blue one many years ago and which is now long lost, but I recall at the time loving the pen and not being able to find more of them.Anyway, this pen is a bit unique in that the nib is pretty long and has a nice taper to it.  It's almost like a short, stiff brush pen.  Don't misunderstand, there is no flex to the nib, but the length allows you to get fine lines with the tip and broad strokes with the side.  Having that range is very nice.  Also, the nibs are pretty substantial so they hold their shape well.I also like that this is a very compact pen, and very economical.  It will fit in any pen case, or your pocket, so it travels easily.The ink flows well, so you don't get ragged lines, and they seem to last a good long time.This is one of those pens that is inspiring to use.  It's such a simple design, nothing flashy at all, but it's so satisfying and functional in a unique way.  This is a true ""classic"".Oh, and by the way, I don't know what it is, but I'm glad that I'm not the only ""pen freak"" in the world - which I've discovered from reading pen reviews on Amazon.  I think it's the way that different pens feel and react with the page, so discovering a new pen is always a fun experience.

"Yes - 3x love.  Having a nice, chunky piece of graphite is great.  But the fact that it's water-soluble is the big seller for me.  I also have some (very nice, useable) water soluble graphite pencils, but the big difference with these crayons is that you can lay down tones without imprinting the paper, which sometimes happens with a pencil (I never said I was a great artist).These crayons allow you to fill large spaces with color (tone), and then soften it with a wet brush.  Works great and looks beautiful.  I like softening pencil sketches with stumps, etc, but being able to use a brush and get watercolor-like B&W images is magical to me.  Endless fun.Oh, and FYI:  I have 2B and 6B versions and I find both to be very useful.  I don't know that I need anything darker than the 6B, and so far I find that I can get whatever variation in tones I need from these two, as well as my various other water soluble graphites.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTX53O9BSEEMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00524EZEQ#wasThisHelpful","RTX53O9BSEEMU","A22Z554ZQ8NFPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22Z554ZQ8NFPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not a seasoned or experience artist, though I've been drawing and playing with watercolors for several years.  I wanted to get a good volume of paper because I want to get more serious about practicing my art, and this seemed like an excellent value.So far I'm very pleased.  For 500 sheets of 80 lb paper, this is an absolute steal.  The paper has a small amount of texture and has been a pleasure to work with.  I've done pencil sketches, colored pencils, pastels (which I don't use very much but I wanted to give them a try for a simple value study exercise) and I even did a bit of light wet work with water soluble graphite.Excellent results so far, and I've got quite a bit of paper to keep me busy.  The paper of course buckled just a bit with the use of the wash for the graphite, but not too bad - I purposely kept it light.  (this was not a background wash, but I used a damp brush to fill out the details of a tree I'd drawn - I primarily wanted to see how the paper worked with a bit of moisture).Anyway, if you are a more experienced artist you will likely be more picky than I am, but this is a tremendous value and it gives me a huge stack of quality paper to practice my skills - which is a great feeling.I think Sax's drawing paper goes up to 90 lb, and I might try that next time, which was only a few dollars more.  But regardless, I think this is excellent paper.EDIT:  I just wanted to add that over the weekend I was experimenting with some water soluble graphite sticks I purchased, and did some drawings with background washes.  These were not as heavy as a watercolor wash, but still, a good portion of the paper was wet at one time or another.  Yes, the paper will curl, but after it dried for a few minutes I put a drawing pad on the picture and weighed it down a bit.  The result is not completely flat, but acceptable.  So, in my opinion, this paper can take a reasonable amount of wet media, but you then need to flatten it out either as it dries or afterward.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V5KNORPOZF54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003U6P2FO#wasThisHelpful","R3V5KNORPOZF54","A22Z554ZQ8NFPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22Z554ZQ8NFPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am quite pleased with this expandable hose.  I have had several shorter ones, but they are not long enough to reach around to the full front yard.  After putting sod down this year, and not being able to reach all of it with my spray hoses, I realized that I needed to get one that was at least 75-feet.  This one is perfect.  I can reach all of the edges of my yard now and don't have to drag any heavy hoses across my new grass.The spray head fits nicely in my hand and is not overly heavy.  That's a big deal for me - not only because I have wrist issues but because yard work and watering - whether it's a lawn or a garden or cleaning an automobile - involves long term standing.  The weight of many spray heads is just too heavy and feels heavier the longer you go.  This one, being relatively lightweight, makes the work a lot easier.The hose itself has no leaks and is really easy to hook up.  Just remember that you can't turn the water on full blast when you first start to fill it.  I love that this doesn't tangle up or kink and that there is no heavy dragging of a hose because this is so light.  I love it.  It's absolutely excellent!!!

"I ordered this scalp brush with one thought in mind - I need something strong to relieve the ever-increasing itchy scalp issues that I have.  I have tried everything.  I use Tea Tree essential oil in my shampoo which does help quite a bit, but lately I've been plagued with hair that becomes extremely oily even shortly after shampooing it.  Nothing was helping - I even did an oatmeal and brown sugar scrub.  My scalp felt so dirty, as if the shampoo wasn't even actually getting through to the skin.  So I would come out of the shower still feeling dirty and oily.  And oh-so-itchy!!!The first time I used this, I was a little disappointed.  I remember thinking that it was just too stiff for me and that it could potentially actually scratch my head.  I almost gave up on using it.  But I didn't.  And I'm so happy for that!!!  Because now I have learned just what pressure I need to use when I am using this.Through trial and error, I have learned that I need to put the shampoo on my head, rather than on the brush.  Sometimes I get my hair all suds up with my hands first.  And sometimes I pour it on my head and brush it through.  I definitely have better results when I use this at different angles instead of just running it down my hair like I would with a hairbrush.What have I discovered in the week that I have been using this?  My head, in general, itches a lot less.  My scalp absolutely, without a doubt, feels significantly cleaner.  And my hair is a different texture - it's no longer weighted down by the oil.  It is lighter and fuller looking and looks healthier in general.  I wasn't expecting all of that - but the ONLY thing I changed was when I added this brush to the routine.  Now whether I'm using it the way I'm supposed to, I'm really not sure.  I haven't read up on how these are supposed to be used.  I just did what felt right to me and it's working great.I ordered this at FULL price and absolutely do recommend this and would order it again!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R133GRU9PCFQPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NJG82W#wasThisHelpful","R133GRU9PCFQPL","A2OPG55EZEX2XO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OPG55EZEX2XO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:21 Mins***Photo Slideshow Attached***I discovered this TRESemme FreshStart Refreshing Mist a few years ago and absolutely loved it.  The bottle lasts a LONG time - even with regular use.  That's a blessing and a curse - one bottle will go a long way.  However, I think, because there wasn't the constant need for customers to run back into the store to order more of this, TRESemme decided that it wasn't an item that they wanted to continue selling because they weren't making enough money off of it.  That's a really sad thing.  Greed takes so many awesome products off of the shelves.This bottle originally sold for between $3 and $4 prior to it being discontinued.  I just very happily paid the new FULL price for this item, which was $33.13 and if TRESemme were still selling it I would still be buying it even at the higher price.  This is an excellent product that works exactly as it is supposed to and smells absolutely wonderful.  I highly recommend it and hope that TRESemme will consider putting it back on the store shelves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPKEHDLK0QVFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003LBWQQQ#wasThisHelpful","RPKEHDLK0QVFD","A2OPG55EZEX2XO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OPG55EZEX2XO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally fell in love with Chai Tea when I worked near a Dunkin Donuts store.  Once I found discovered it, I would go there every single morning to get a cup.  But then our office moved and I was no longer close to the restaurant.  So I essentially went on a mission to find Chai Tea that tastes as good as theirs.  Trust me - I tried A LOT of different brands.  As in, I would go into a store and buy every single Chai tea mix, bag, powder, concentrated drink, etc that they had.  And none were comparable - actually, 95% of what I bought were so bad that I couldn't even finish them.  I had almost given up when I discovered this Oregon Chia tea while shopping in a store in New York during our summer trip.I brought the box back home and found that none of our local stores - even the big name ones - carried it.  So I began my online search.  This is sold in single serving size pouches, but they're quite expensive.  I found that this is the most economical and only affordable way for me to buy it.  This comes in a resealable bag (good quality).  So you simply scoop out enough for the cup/s that you are making and seal it back up and put it in the cupboard.The taste is absolutely excellent and extremely close (possibly even the same brand) to Dunkin Donuts Chai Tea.  I absolutely will continue ordering this.  I got this at FULL price and highly recommend it!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ4KLNN026S5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EJJKUI#wasThisHelpful","RJ4KLNN026S5U","A2OPG55EZEX2XO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OPG55EZEX2XO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a fan of Wonder Hangers ever since they were first introduced.  I actually never realized that they made anything other than the plastic ones until just a few days ago.My plastic ones finally have aged out and the plastic started getting brittle and snapping on them over the past year.  When I started looking for new ones, I came across these metal ones and decided to give them a shot.  I am sure glad that I did!!!These are stronger and can hold more weight.  They also have one additional hanger space compared to the plastic ones.  They work exactly the same, but they are stronger and therefore - no more brittle plastic and no chance of them breaking under the weight of my clothes.The ONLY thing I don't like about these is that the support hooks are a little too small for my thick closet racks.  I really have to struggle to get them to snap on the bar and therefore they do not attach or remove as easily as I want them to.  But again - the bar on my closet racks is definitely thicker than the average sized one, so most people probably won't run into this same issue.I absolutely will be ordering more of these.  They're excellent!!!  I paid FULL price for these and consider it a perfect price to pay for this quality.

"I have experience with several different dash cams and this one is absolutely the best one I have tried thus far!!!  I love all of the extra features on this that most dash cams just simply don't have (the night vision is really cool and I love that this has GPS on it!!!).This mounts easily and doesn't randomly fall off (unlike others I've tried in the past).  This one also includes a sd card with it - none of the other ones that I tried did and I had to purchase cards for those.  This one is pretty user friendly and wasn't hard to initially set up.  The quality of the video is excellent.  An added benefit to me is that this offers a one-year warranty, which gave me a lot more confidence when I ordered this that I would be getting a quality item.

Unlike the vast majority of clothes I have ordered online, the size for this is actually really accurate. I love everything about this!!!The color is really pretty!!! The color is actually a little brighter in person than it appears in the photos, which makes me love it even more.  I tossed this in the washer on the hand wash/delicate cycle for the first washing, and - as a precaution - washed it all by itself. I also decided to wash it inside-out.

"My husband is endlessly going through socks.  I'm not sure exactly why, but he always ends up with weird holes in the rear ankle part of them, so I am always having to order more.  I've noticed that socks made from this type of material seem to last him a lot longer than cotton ones, so it may have something to do with the fact that these are stretchier.  He is quite pleased with these - they fit him comfortably without sliding around or bunching up on him.  The quality of the material is excellent.  We ordered these in the solid black color.

That says a lot because I have used her recommendations for pillows before - and they're always super expensive.

"This hair is great!!!  My hair is thin…I’ve been interested in trying some human hair clip in solutions.  I was excited when this was offered to me!  I was unsure which color to go with, but I often have home-done highlights in my hair so I got something in-between to add a fun color twist to my hair color.  I was impressed first by the softness of the hair, it’s very silky and smooth!  I wasn’t too sure how the 7 pieces the listing notes were, I couldn’t quite tell by their photos.  I was pleased to realize there were some wider and some narrower sizes.  There is one that is 4 clips wide, 2 with 3 clips, 2 with 2 clips and 2 with one clips.  With this variety I can really add hair where I need it and have a neat layered color variety throughout my hair.  To open the clips just push in the middle and it flexes out.  There are enough teeth that they tuck into my hair well.  Push on the sides of the clip and it’s in.  I was shocked at how well it stayed attached to my thin slippery hair…normally things just slide out of my hair.

"I really appreciate that turmeric has come into vogue as a regular supplement.  There are so many benefits for your body that it provides.  My friend uses this all the time and the biggest one of those benefits that is great for her is the anti-inflammatory properties.  She has had aches and pains for many years.  They’re not enough to always warrant taking ibuprofen, but it was still always nagging pain that wasn’t comfortable for her.  She started taking turmeric a bit ago and has been so amazed at how much of a difference it makes for her!  She's rarely had to take ibuprofen and is much more comfortable and it’s easier for her to move.She switched over to this specific brand a little bit ago (week or two) and says she has been doing about the same as she had been with other supplement brands.  She does also eat a lot of pepper, pepper really increases the absorption of the supplement.  If you don’t eat a lot of pepper you may consider swallowing a peppercorn with your pills to give this an extra boost.Full Disclosure: I was blessed to receive a free sample of this item for free in exchange for testing, inspecting and reviewing it.

"Isn't it interesting how so many couples tend to be opposites - even when it comes to the temperatures that we like the house to be set at?  That's the situation with my husband and I.  I absolutely cannot get a good nights sleep unless the temperature is set to 70-degrees or even lower.  My husband, on the other hand, wants to be warm when he sleeps.  I sleep with practically no clothes on, on a cooling pillowcase and we both lay on a cooling mattress pad (though he doesn't realize that is why it's so cold - shhhhh!).

"Ah, the original Bazooka bubble gum - even with the cute little wrappers inside of the wrapping.  The gum tastes just like I remember it tasting when I was a kid.  Slightly hard but, then again, I'm pretty sure that it was that way when I was a kid too.  I love the nostalgic feeling that this gives.  I did find it strange that this came packaged in a simple press-seal baggie like you can get from any grocery store.  I would prefer a package that is packaged with outer packaging that cannot be opened.  But the gum wrappers themselves were tight and I felt comfortable chewing them.  This is awesome gum for blowing bubbles and ""snapping"" to drive others nuts.  Tasty and it definitely brought those nostalgic memories back.

"This is a pretty neat concept.  This cord can charge multiple devices (though not at the same time) because of the different heads.  They are easy to switch out and the heads and cord are all of good quality materials.  That said, the heads are small and we all know that small pieces can be lost.  I am not that great about keeping track of little things like that - especially with a curious six-year-old at home.  That said, this would be ideal in an office scenario.  Back when I was working in an office, it seemed that three or four days a week, co-workers were asking if I had a charging cord for their device.  It would have been great to be able to whip this out of my desk drawer and offer it to them.

"This is sooooooooo cute!!!  I originally ordered this toy for my six-year-old daughter, and gave it to her straight away after it arrived.  She loves it!!!  But she instantly decided that this should go to her best friend Ricky, who is a Minion fanatic.  She said that he should have it because of that, even though she loves it and wants it for herself too.  I'm so proud of her!!!  This is really well made and is quite large.  It is stuffed well and that stuffing is not lumpy or clumpy either.  The materials it is made from are high quality, the stitching is accurate, even and complete.

"I ordered this top in size XL in the ""wine"" color and it's even prettier than in the photos!!!Unlike the vast majority of clothes I have ordered online, the size for this is actually really accurate.  I love everything about this!!!  The sleeves are super long and the color is really pretty!!!  I tossed this in the washer on the hand wash/delicate cycle for the first washing, and - as a precaution - washed it all by itself.  I also decided to wash it inside-out.  This came through the wash like a champ.  The color actually appears even nicer after the washing - which may or may not be my imagination playing tricks on me.  I opted to hang-dry this, so I don't know how it will do with coming through the dryer.This top is very stylish and unique - I love the crooked pocket (intentional design) and the extra long sleeves.  The seams are even and complete.  And there are no loose threads on this at all.  I personally am just a little bit big to fit this now, but have been losing weight and this absolutely is going in my closet as a keeper.

"My husband was recently assigned an iPhone 5S as his work cell phone.  They provided him with a partial grip case (only covers the back) and one of those belt clip cases.  He hated both of them.  He didn't think any case would be better though, so he really wasn't excited that I had ordered him this.  But then tonight, when I put it on his phone, his whole attitude about it changed!  He loves how it fits and how it makes the front of the phone look too - like it has a nice, thin black border around it.  The case itself doesn't make the phone thick and heavy like his other ones did.  It is relatively smooth but does give you a little texture to grip onto.For other phones, I've tried a lot of different styles of cases.  I've never actually seen a ""slider"" case like this and I initially thought it was broken when I removed it from the packaging.  But there is a reason that this is called a ""slider"".  First you slip the long (top) portion of the case over the phone.  There is a thin ridge on the case, barely noticeable when you are putting it on, that slips onto your iPhone.  It fits absolutely perfectly.  Then you do the same with the bottom, slip it on and it snaps into the top portion.  Flawless!!!We are so happy that I ordered this.  I would expect this to be a significantly higher price - this is great!!!  I highly recommend this case!!!Full Disclosure: I was blessed to receive a free sample of this item for free in exchange for my testing, inspecting and reviewing it.

"This is the coolest kit!!!First off, this kit comes in packaging that prevents it from being obvious that you received a spy cam.  So if you open the package and someone happens to see you-especially someone you might not want to know that you have a spy cam-they will simply see a silver-colored package.  They would have absolutely no idea what you ordered.The kit itself is already put together but, as stated in the ad, doesn't have a housing.  You can mount this or place this in so many places.  From the inside of a teddy bear for a nanny cam to being in a register vent to watch what is happening in your office to being hidden inside of furniture or electronics.  Google for more ideas on where to put it if you are struggling to find something that would work for you.  I'm actually in the process of sewing this into a specially made padded bag for one of my relatives, who is in need of a temporary nanny cam to give her the peace of mind that her daughter is being cared for appropriately.  The bag will double as a purse or, in her case, a diaper bag.  I'm having fun with creating this and the cam is so small and lightweight that it will be relatively simple to hide.The cool thing is that we can always remove it from one place and place it somewhere else at some point in the future.The cam itself has a lot of cool settings on it.  For the bag mentioned above, we will be using this on the motion-activated camera and it gives email alerts when the camera detects motion.  But there are other options too - you can keep it on all the time or even have it turn on at a set time.  This is really neat and I keep thinking of new ways to use this and places to put it.  Definitely handy!!!Full Disclosure: I was blessed to receive a sample of this item at a discounted price (it was not free) in exchange for my testing, inspecting and reviewing it.

"This is an excellent quality certified lightning cable!!!The packaging this comes in is equal to the quality of that which you would find hanging in a high-end electronics store.

" 0:21 Mins ***Video Slideshow Attached***I am quite pleased with my experience with this Benzoyl Peroxide acne treatment so far!!!  I struggle with sensitive, oily skin that is very acne prone.  I'm always hesitant about trying new facial products, as my face (especially my nose area) is sensitive to some products and if it starts burning, the burn continues for quite some time.  But I've had good experience with acne treatments with similar ingredients in the past, so I felt like I should give this one a shot.  Thankfully, I have had no negative reactions to this at all since beginning to use it.The bottle arrives well wrapped and sealed so that there will be no leaks while it is on the way to you.  Though it is recommended to use this three times a day, I am only using it once a day and am starting to notice that my skin has been changing in a positive way.  Though I still am having some acne issues, it has already been reduced.  I suspect that, if I were using this the recommended three times a day, I would likely see an even bigger difference.  So I'm pretty excited about this and am quite pleased with it.  I'm going to continue using this!!!Full Disclosure: I was blessed to receive a free sample of this item for free in exchange for my testing, inspecting and reviewing it.

"***For my video review and more information, please view it at this link:  https://youtu.be/qtSABGgaNoE***For my photo slideshow, please view it at this link:  https://youtu.be/DryiVmx51voI'm really impressed with this tablet - It is an excellent value for the price and it runs quickly and smoothly.  We have experienced no delays or glitching at all since receiving it.In the past, we have used a Proscan 7 (which broke with the first drop within weeks of getting it), a ProntoTec 7 tablet (which I purchased new but somehow had already been rooted??? and operated horribly) and an Acer 10-inch tablet which we only use for homeschooling purposes.  This tablet far surpasses the Proscan and ProntoTec tablets we have used and it is right up there with the $300-plus valued Acer tablet that we have for homeschooling.I absolutely love the fact that this included the bumper case.  I had to buy bumper cases for the other tablets and they are not only difficult to find a perfect match with holes in all of the right places, but they are also expensive!  So the fact that this one, a perfect match and perfect fit to this tablet, was already included in the box is really pleasing to me.  It's one less expense and it's one less hassle of trying to find the right one.  The bumper case is good and thick and absolutely should support and protect this tablet if it is accidentally dropped or bumped.The tablet itself charges relatively quickly, boots up fast and does not hesitate when you give it commands.  The screen has no bad pixels at all.  There is 8gb of storage which is pretty good space for a tablet that children are going to be using.  But if that's not enough for you, you can also pop up to a 32gb card into it for A LOT more space.  And you can always add and remove apps from time to time to switch it up a little.  I do plan to get a tempered glass screen protector for this just as an added safety feature to protect it even more.We have been using Zoodles ever since my daughter was a toddler and we love how it adjusts with the child's age so that it holds their interest.  My daughter is six years old now and still loves it.  Yes, there are in-app purchases available but there is so much free content that continuously changes that we've never opted to purchase anything from it.I'm extremely happy with this purchase and highly recommend this tablet!!!Full Disclosure: I was blessed to receive a sample of this item at a discounted price (it was not free) in exchange for my testing, inspecting and reviewing it.

Not too fast & not too slow.

" 0:56 Mins ***Video Slideshow Attached***I really like these hanger clips!!!I personally have used Wonder Hangers for years, but I have an issue with those breaking.  I had intended on ordering more of them when I saw these and decided to give them a try.Note that these come in a random color.  Mine are kind of a greyish-brown color, which I am really happy with.  I had actually not realized that and had expected a colorful assortment, but I really am happy with what I got and much prefer all the same color over an assortment of them anyday.These are firm enough that they are not going to stretch and allow the clothing to drop.  They are padded so that they don't harm your clothes too.  And no lint came off of them either.I discovered that the coat hangers that I prefer actually are not even even at the top, as you can see in the photos.  They have kind of an angle on them.  This did not allow the hooks to lay perfectly evenly on them, but even then, they still hung great and are working perfectly.  I was able to hang all of my shirts and to take up very little space while doing so!!!  When I remove clothing, the hook stays on the hanger and is ready to be used again.

Also included were the black stickers to label what you put into each bottle and plastic pipettes.Everything in here is great quality.  The spray bottles are absolutely excellent - the caps screw on tightly so that they do not leak.  The spray pump sprays a fine mist without dripping and the tube that attaches to the mister actually reaches the bottom of the bottle with no extra space - so it actually will spray ALL of the liquid.I personally don't care for plastic pipettes - but that's just me and my personal preference.  I did check them and they do work for the purpose, but I will be using my glass droppers to fill these bottles as needed.

" 1:59 Mins *** Video Slideshow Attached***I am a big fan of TENS units.  As someone who is in pain 100% of the time, I do have a high pain tolerance - but sometimes I simply cannot bear it.  I was injured in a bad car accident when I was thirteen and also suffer from Fibromyalgia.  To top that off, I have liver issues that prevent me from taking most pain medications and I refuse narcotics because my family struggles with addiction and I don't want to take the chance of ever having to deal with that.  So TENS units are such a blessing to me.I've tried several, from a small unit that simply sticks to your body to units that have snap-on electrodes to a prescription-strength $600 Theratech unit.I'm pleased with this unit.  It works quite well and has quite a few options / settings so that you can adjust it to the sensation that you personally need.  If you're anything like me, the settings can be vastly different depending on the day and the location of the pain.  I love that this unit allows you to use four pads at the same time, as sometimes I really need that.The pads themselves are the quality I would expect.  They adhere well.  I personally extend the life of my pads when the adhesive starts to run out by using TENS unit adhesive.  And then I use the pads until they literally stop working.  A side hint that my physical therapist told me is to store the pads in the fridge to help them last longer.I'm really happy with this unit and am glad that I ordered it!!!Full Disclosure: I was blessed to receive a free sample of this item for free in exchange for my testing, inspecting and reviewing it.

" 1:10 Mins ***Video Slideshow Attached***I use essential oils on a regular basis and have well over 100 bottles in various sizes.  I had been storing them in shoeboxes and a cut down cardboard box - but that looks really bad and many times they would clunk into one another (especially when the washing machine and dryer are running).  This box is an excellent start to helping me to get these nicely AND safely organized and to prevent them from breakage.The box itself is gorgeous!!!  There are no rough spots, nor are there any areas that I could find that would cause slivers.  I love the fact that this has the built-in (it cannot be removed) squares to prevent the glass bottles from clinking into one another.  That's much better than what I had been doing.  Now I only need a lot more of these to put the rest of my bottles in!!!The hinges are high quality and work perfectly with no catching or noises at all.  The same with the latch on the front.  It is strong enough to keep the box closed and yet not so tight that you have to struggle to get it open.

"I have been a Harmony remote user for many years.  They really dominated the high end universal remote market for over a decade.  In particular, their library of devices is huge and they are usually quick to add new devices to their list of compatible devices.  Lately though, home automation systems have grown to control not only smart switches and devices but home entertainment as well.  Meanwhile Harmony is looking to control those home automation devices with systems like the Elite.The Elite is a device that aims to be a complete home system both controlling your entertainment system and your home devices.  The centerpiece, unlike previous standalone Harmony remotes, is the Hub.  Setup is pretty easy.  I simply plugged everything in and used the remote to start the setup process.  Unfortunately the transfer of my ""Activities"" from the previous remote only worked for 2 out of 3.  I had to download the desktop software (recommended regardless) to configure the 3rd Activity.  With the desktop software you have way more control over what you want the buttons to do and also you remote LCD screen functions.  The desktop software is the best I have used from Logitech.  It is pretty easy to select what device and function is assigned to the buttons on the remote.  The functions of the device are pretty complete and come from Logitech's list of compatible devices.  If there happens to be a function not listed, you can have te Harmony remote learn the function with the use of the device's remote.  I have to say that everything works perfectly.  The system, with it's included IR blasters, never fails to turn off or on a device--a problem that used to aggravate me with all previous Harmony remotes.  Also, the PS3 can be controlled and turn on/off by pairing with the Harmony Elite via bluetooth--works perfectly and no need of the previous Harmony PS3 adapter!  I have not yet tested the home control option but look forward to adding a Samsung SmartHub with room light switches.  After reading the documents and online info, I still was not completely sure which home automation systems were compatible though.  Wish there were more info for people who want to build a system around the Harmony Elite.  I think people with existing home control systems would have no issues.  Overall, this is hands down the best Harmony remote I have used.  Highly recommended!PROS:Easy SetupDesktop software improvedHighly customizable remoteLarge list of compatible devicesSmartphone control (iOS and android)More reliable device communication (with hub and 2 IR blasters)Home automation control capableExcellent remote (battery life, sharp/bright screen, vibration, motion wakeup, layout)CONS:Expensive","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K787SOFH6V23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014PDFP9S#wasThisHelpful","R2K787SOFH6V23","A2JP9E1H0SF392","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP9E1H0SF392?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I first looked at Parts stores online but they only had one lower cam that turned up when I input my refridgerator model #.

"I am using this speaker on my desktop in lieu of my normal NHT SuperZeroes, powered by the M-Audio Super DAC II and Dayton Audio Class T integrated amp.  Although the sound is very good and unfatiguing, I find that there is a disturbing resonance in the upper midbass.  Otherwise the highs are very clear and smooth.  It has way more bass than my SuperZeroes.  You do get a lot for you money in this inexpensive bookshelf speaker.  Overall the sound is very good but the resonance that I referred to earlier being the main failing.  I hear it bass guitar, lower registers of vocals, etc. so it is not inconsequential.  Perhaps the thin MDF used to make the enclosure is to blame.  The knock test showcases a very lively box.  So at least B5 vs. SuperZeroes, I will have to give the nod to the NHTs.  The B5 does have a fuller sound that plays louder but loses points for ultimate neutrality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R236L4N7JXQ6ZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014GSER6O#wasThisHelpful","R236L4N7JXQ6ZK","A2JP9E1H0SF392","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP9E1H0SF392?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Differs from other bike locks in it's versatility.  It has a loop around one end and the locking end you loop round to a metal hub on the cable.  What that means is you don't have to make one big loop with your 8' cable--you can secure one end to one area and the other end to a totally different area.  This is a good product and does not command a price premium.

"This mug is very similar to the Nissan Thermos mug that has been around a while.  There is a button up top to open and close the sippy opening.  For the most part, it is water tight and won't spill when knocked down.  The amount of liquid that is allowed to come out when opened is not a lot which is bad for people who like bigger gulps.  The lid is also not easy to clean.  The mug is vacuum insulated which means it has excellent insulation properties for warm and cold.  To be honest, most of the vacuum insulated mugs I have do about the same job unless you get one in the thermos form factor which provides better insulation.I find that this mug is pretty decent but wish it were easier to clean the lid and wish the lid let out more coffee.Edit:  after further use, I cannot recommend this mug because of the lid.  There is a cavity inside the lid from the button that retains water after cleaning.  It never fully dries out.

"We have been sleeping on this bed for the past week on our platform bed frame.  Previously, I have had a 7"" memory foam mattress and a Comfortaire air mattress with memory foam insert.  I like the Brentwood Home S-Bed the best.  Unlike other mattresses that use memory foam and allow you to initially sink and then meet a much harder layer, the S-bed feels more supportive without being hard--more like a traditional mattress.  Knowing that it won't go lumpy like a coil spring mattress is reassuring.  I won't claim that back pains are a thing of the past because that is asking too much of any bed.  That said, we get a well rested sleep in the S-Bed and it doesn't call attention to itself--which is a good thing.Setup was easy.  We simply moved the bed to our sleep area and unboxed/unsealed it.  It looked pretty good within minutes but we let it fully expand for 24 hrs (instructions say 48hrs).  There were no strong odors of any kind.  The outer covering is a pretty durable cloth unlike some memory foam mattress covers.  The bed is pretty uniform throughout except for the edges which seem less firm than the rest--if you lay at the very edge of the mattress, you feel the tendency to fall out.  Not an issue during normal use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SYY5CPC2A1KD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5EI4C4#wasThisHelpful","R1SYY5CPC2A1KD","A2JP9E1H0SF392","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP9E1H0SF392?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This fan is not a personal fan despite it's diminuitive size.  It's not quite powerful enough as a whole room fan either.  It is large enough to provide a nice breeze while operating 6-8 ft from a sofa which is where I use it.  It has a quiet oscillating feature and you can tilt the unit to point up at you.

"This style of ear bud is a category all it's own.  It lets in ambient noises so that you are in tune to your surroundings whether it be biking, hiking, walking, running, etc. as long as you don't play the music too loud.  The trade off for this is usually lack of bass.  this Actionfit ear bud is no different.  The sound quality is not bad but certainly not in the same league as in-the-canal earphones.  The highs are not as clean and refined as the Bose Soundsport.  Why am I giving this product 5 stars then?  For one thing, the cost is affordable.  The set is a quality one with 4 different ear pieces to fit a wide range of ears.  For my big ears, this is the best fitting sport ear buds I have ever owned.  There is no way to shake these out and yet they are very comfortable and light at the same time!  The sound quality is probably as good as the Monster iSport Strive.  Sound and fitment are much better than Yurbuds or Philips SHQ1200/28 ActionFit (old model).PROS:-allows you to hear ambient noises-awesome fitment for sports-sound quality is decent-long cord with shirt clip-affordable priceCONS-lack of bass (as with ALL similar style ear buds)-not the highest sound qualityHighly recommended!

"Nicely sized Qi charging pad.  It goes without saying that your phone must be Qi Wireless capable or you must have a Qi charging pad or case to enable your phone to have be Qi charging capable.  With that said, this pad is a good size and my phone does not slip on it's top surface.  It is easy to position my Note4 smartphone with it's Qi charging pad underneath the cover.  Charging is on par with what I would expect--nowhere near as fast as the Samsung RapidCharge feature but it is plenty fast for overnight charging.  One problem that I've found is that if you placed the phone in a marginal position, it my cycle continuously between no charging and charging and delivering an annoying beep from the phone.

"This wireless fence differs from the buried wire fence systems by sending out an adjustable width system that is detected by the collar and gives a warning sound then corrective shock once the width is breached.  I personally like the buried wire system but it is a lot of expense and effort to install that sort of system.  If you do it yourself, you can save money.The Motorola is a very good product.  There is some interference by objects/structures but in general, it is pretty reliable.  The main negative that I see is battery life.  I find I recharge the collar every third day.  On buried wire systems, a battery in the collar probably would be good for 3 months!  That takes getting used to.  My dog is used to collars and shock so it was easy to train him to the motorola.  I put out flags once I determined the boundary and when he approaches them, a sound goes off.  Not sure he has been shocked yet but he sure obeys the flags.  This system is nice because you can take it on the go as well.  When my brother dog sits while I'm on vacation, I just take my dog to his house and set it up with the flags.  Good to go!  If you have more than one dog, just be aware that an extra collar costs about $120.  That's about the going price for a collar that does not say Invisible Fence on it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6YACT3P7C7AV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFW0LHM#wasThisHelpful","R6YACT3P7C7AV","A2JP9E1H0SF392","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP9E1H0SF392?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a universal fit blade and comes with two adaptors. Without them it fits natively to my Dremel. I tested it by cutting a chunk out of a 2 x 4, including a knot, and a framing nail. No drama, no noticeable damage.Its bimetal construction is like a quality hacksaw blade and it does tout titanium coating that they say does extend the life of the tool. I know my original blades died almost immediately upon contacting a nail, so while I suggest to always try to avoid nails with these tools it should survive a number of encounters.Blades are better these day, thank goodness.

"I suggest practicing on garbage bits first, experimenting with the angles both when you set the depth and then when you set the angle on the final, vertical step. Start with light pressure. You have to be mindful of the cam action when you do the sharpening and keep the chuck in contact with the pin on the body of the device. This will only make sense when you read the directions, watch the video and then get to sharpening.My first project was a cobalt 1/2"" bit that was blue from overheating caused by dullness. Now it works fine.This is a touchy feely device. You can't just stick a bit into it and have it come out perfect, but as you work with it you build a rapport and all is good if you pay attention and work with a deliberate pace.The body is plastic, but mounted to a metal substructure. It seems like it will last, except of course you have to replace the diamond wheel now and then, but that is easy.This is a clever and useful device for those of us who have boxes of dull old drill bits.

"Stores a lot of wire away nicely, prevents knotting, is cheap and just sturdy enough to do the job. Obviously if it was a nice  metal unit it would cost a lot more.As for how to wind the wire:The doubling of the wire method was a pain for me. Hard to unwind, hard to wind up. I thought it would be best and tried that first, but...nah...Todd Pravata's method was best, doing it as he suggests with the male end protruding. The alternative, with the female end hanging out seemed like a good idea, but that leaves you with the reel and a couple of feet or wire where you are working. My leaf blower and electric chain saw both have stubby little power cords which means I would be dragging the reel behind me, up ladders, etc. If all of your tools have long power cords it might be ok doing it like that.So, the prize goes to Todd even though you have to walk back to plug it it. I attached it to the wall, hanging on a hook so it can be unwound by simply walking away with the female end (snort).

"One otherwise very nice sink was really disgusting with a corroded drain. This is a quality replacement with nice bright chrome and it made a huge difference. Note that the tailpiece, the bottom section of pipe, is quite short, maybe only four or five inches long. My old one was about eight and so I bought a long tailpiece, cut it to length with a hacksaw and screwed it in. You can also buy an extension that slides on.

"It must have been really important for Kohler to have drains that look identical but where some take a 1/16 smaller stopper. Must be to keep people busy, designing stuff that is just fine and doesn't require an update. And some of these have a metal lower part and some plastic, and that can be two different sizes as well. I loathe this sort of thing cuz it cost me money as the packaging is in atom bomb proof ultra strong and thick plastic that even a high-end knife is more likely to bounce off and slit your wrist than to cut through and then of course it is not returnable. What a waste. Hope people who specify these changes spend considerable time in the afterlife dealing with their bad ideas, over and over again as the hot sulphur flows waist high.The quality seems good just in case you got lucky and this is the right size for your installation.

"These are surprisingly big. Make sure you have enough room amongst the pipes and such under the counter. Use flexible braided supply lines, 1/2 ip at the tank end and normally 3/8 compression at the shut off and faucet end. Be careful at the hardware dept as other types of lines are often improperly displayed.Lines are normally found in twenty and thirty inch lengths. Attaching the line from the red outlet on the tank to the line hanging down from the faucet will require using a 3/8 compression union. Take off the nuts and washers and the ends of the line will screw right on. Be careful to buy compression fittings as pipe fittings will not work.When you run water through it for the first time you will hear air hissing out. When that stops, plug it in and turn it on. Don't turn it on before then as you will burn out the element.I was surprised how fast the water heats up. Do know that the first gallon or so will be hot, but as cold water comes in the temp will go down as the element cannot heat water coming in instantly. But there is enough to wash your hands and after awhile the hot water from your main tank gets there. It is all good.The plastic pipes on the heater are scary. You have to be really sure you are not cross threading on the outlet lines and it is hard to know how tight you are getting them, a trait of plastic connections. Just be careful and attach the lines where you have good access and check for leaks. Mine turned out fine.I found a baking pan that works perfectly for a drip pan and I found a down pipe with a branch outlet on it and hooked up a line from the TP valve (included) to a down pipe with a branch on it.I was put off by the warranty that pretty much says you are out of luck unless a professional plumber installs it. The directions are not detailed and assume the installer has skills, tools, etc. And the plastic pipes are something that requires some care and touch.Made in Japan. I noted that Chinese made heaters seem to be more unreliable than they should be. There is no new technology here and they all should be totally reliable unless cost cutting is excessive. Also, these are not cheap, the WaiWela being on the expensive side.

"My Kohler Fairfax single-level faucet was feeling stiff and funky. It had to be this cartridge, and it was. Now it is silky smooth and I feel much better about things sink-wise as I replaced the side spray as well (another review).You can watch a certain video channel, You know it, and get instructions. Of course it isn't that easy taking apart an old faucet. This is how to do it:1. Pry out the hot/cold cap on top.2. Remove the screw (some may have allen screws, mine was Phillips). Careful as they can be stuck.3. Remove the lever assembly. It too can be stuck. Lift and kind of push back on it. If it is still stuck get a piece of wood, around 3/4 thick, push the lever down at the front and put the wood between the back of the lever dome thing and the ridge on the part below it. Lift up on the handle and the lever assembly will lever off.4. There is now a dome looking thing with the hole in the middle being where the top of the valve sticks out. Unscrew it. Mine was fairly easy, but some may stick. The IMPORTANT thing to do is to not let the body of the faucet turn as that will ruin the little hoses that screw into the faucet. You can buy them, but they are expensive and usually only available on-line. You can try penetrating oil or perhaps a hair dryer, some sort of clever way to get ahold of things and unscrew it.5. Now there is a retainer that holds the valve in. It too can be stuck. Lift up the swiveling faucet and hold the bottom with a pipe wrench or arc joint pliers so that you can apply pretty strong pressure on that top nut. The bottom wrench should be on the skinny lower part, not up where the faucet parts rotates around.Again, DO NOT LET THE BODY PART ROTATE.6. Lift out the valve. It has a gasket on the bottom. Make sure the old one is out of the faucet. Sometimes they come off of the old valve and you don't want two gaskets. Drop the new one in. Note that there are two protrusions on the valve that fit into depressions in the valve.7. While the rotating faucet part is off, clean the surfaces and lube the O-rings with silicone lube. I suggest ordering the O-ring kit at the same time as the valve, cheap enough and it comes with the lube. The faucet will leak at its base if these seals are bad. The swiveling action will again be nice.If things are really stuck, take the faucet out and deal with it on a bench.Assembly is easier than taking apart old plumbing parts. You will have a nice, smooth faucet that was not cheap to buy, has parts available to fix it and can probably be kept going for decades. I have done all the above and it is exactly as good as new now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CLS2FKS2VGKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GZX92O#wasThisHelpful","R1CLS2FKS2VGKK","A3MMJEMXBJOJ8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MMJEMXBJOJ8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are lots of kettles offered on Amazon, some much cheaper, so why did I buy this one? Because the Oster I have now has been in constant use for over 40 years!!! It just started to leak and it was not always turning off for the last couple of months so it was best to replace it. My Oster blender also is working perfectly and has for over 40 years!!! I like Oster and will buy their products when I can.Oh, also I had to see the blue lights. Blue boiling water, who would have thought! It is mesmerizing. Not for use by some residents of Colorado or Washington State as the water will never be poured...Looks great, is entertaining, boils water quickly enough, pours nicely too, no dripping. Stylish appearance. There might be lighter units for those who are gravity-challenged.Here is the caveat though: It is labelled an Oster and promised the legendary Oster performance, but Sunbeam and Jarden Consumer Solutions own and operate the Oster brand, and this product is now made in China, the original being made in the US...what can go wrong here?

"It is little. The suction cup holds it just fine. It is simple and cheap. It works. I tried it on my worst knives, including a couple that were made of very hard steel and were difficult to sharpen with other devices, including a motorized one with diamond wheels. The SliceXL did it perfectly.Now there is a little pile of steel shavings as this device does not grind a blade, it shears off little slices of steel. You get used to the tilts and the pressure required to do it right. The first few strokes, especially with hard knives, will feel rough, but as the nasty parts are shaved off, it gets smoother. You can follow up with a sharpening steel if you want. On some knives this makes it even sharper after just a couple of strokes, on other knives I did not think it did anything.

"Many readers like to have the scene and characters set in the beginning rather than to have to read through explanations of relationships and situations later in the middle of the story. Zander sets the scene early and then gets on with it, a quite interesting and rich tale with an interesting ending. You zoom around in different worlds and if you are curious about the cultures in it you will enjoy this read.Some people do not like the product placement technique, but I found it to be interesting. Possessions and consumables do give a quick and often accurate look at what a person is like. They also ground us as we have a shared understanding of commercial products.

"My old one, must have been 10 years old and well used, started to die 400 miles from home where it was being used on a Thanksgiving turkey I was enlisted to cook. Back home I took it apart, hoping it just needed oil. No, was in the motor itself and it got so that I had to hit it with a stick to get it started.Bought this, the #199 that fits the charcoal 22.5 Webers as well as some gas ones. In the description there is only mention of gas models. I suggest buying them only by the model number of your original. There are some similar looking ones that may not work. Who knows.When I first looked up the price it sure seemed they were over-priced, but when I took my old one apart I found a very complex all-metal gear system. Many appliance gear sets  are now made of plastic to save $1.23 for the company jet fund. And it is made in Taiwan which probably adds a couple of bucks and so on.

"This has a clean and modern design and works just fine. The hose, swivel ball joint and the fittings are metal, while the head part is chromed plastic. I used the provided 2.5 gal/minute insert as we are on rationing.Just to give a sense of its size, the head is about three inches in diameter. It does not overwhelm a small shower stall.The flow is quite good even with the insert, the swivel holds its position and looks like it will last (my last different brand hand shower flopped all over the place). The massage action is decent, but with this low water flow there are limits.It comes with a bracket that you can attach to hold the wand part in a different location. Actually, the swivel and being able to turn the wand in the holder allows you to move it down into any position you are likely to need, except perhaps for those who sit in a shower. Nice option, but you probably won't need it.The metallic hose is quite long and hangs down properly and out of the way, much better than my previous model with a plastic hose.I never heard of this brand, but it seems to be of good quality and I couldn't find any flaws. One could do better perhaps with one of those $8000.00 units...but for the price no complaints at all. BTW, a reviewer noted that this unit made an unpleasant noise. Mine is totally silent except in massage mode where it makes the expected chuga chuga sort of noise that all such devices make, nothing bad. Again, this is with the insert.

One thing is odd though: the center of the tip is not where the line is drawn. the upper portion of the tip represents the actual center.

This is on an iPhone 5s using the nice App called Sketch Pad.So, for now I will call this a feature and not a bug. And maybe it is the App that does this.

"These tomatoes are for cooking only, especial the famous fried green tomato recipe. They are delicious cooked and terrible raw. There are nice tomatoes on a vince on December 17, but they are not an early variety. Plant as soon as you can. Pick when they just begin to look yellow. They will feel hard but don't worry.I dip slices into half and half or butter milk and then into an equal combo of corn meal and whole wheat flour, then fry them in bacon fat or olive oil. They are also good on pizzas or tomato pies. These go with other breakfast things like bacon and eggs or grits. Hot sauce is good for me, and of course salt and pepper, or hot pepper. It is sort of a southern thing. Very good.These tomatoes are rarely available in nurseries, so seeds are the only way to go. Not so well known, so get them when you can. They seem to be disappearing, so gather seeds. About seventy-five percent of them sprouted.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37DM4TFV4CPFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009P67G48#wasThisHelpful","R37DM4TFV4CPFJ","A3MMJEMXBJOJ8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MMJEMXBJOJ8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a line-level thermostat. Line-level means the full ac power goes through the unit and on to the heater. Most thermostats and heaters make use of low voltage controls. I use it to control a Broan 124 heater.Kind of clunky looking and pretty much the opposite of a Nest or some other high-end thermostat. It could have been a whole lot nicer looking and should be really. On the other hand, it has simple analogue controls and actually works. Only a small percentage of programmable thermostats actually are programmed correctly or at all. It is a joy to just turn it on or off, hotter or cooler.It will not turn all the way off  so even if the unit is set to its lowest point it will turn on if the room really does freeze. On the other hand it is best to keep a room, even if rarely used, to some base line temperature that is above freezing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L0NK8YMP5H0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LO7A4E#wasThisHelpful","R3L0NK8YMP5H0","A3MMJEMXBJOJ8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MMJEMXBJOJ8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This looks like a duct and uses a line-level thermostat, like the Broan 86W. This means full ac power goes through the thermostat and to the heater. You must use this kind of thermostat with this heater. The downside is that fancy thermostats usually are low voltage devices and would not work with this.But, then again you probably don't want to use a thermostat that costs twice as much as the heater.It is quiet enough, puts out enough heat for any small room and fits easily between studs. It is simple to pop out the entire heating part and install the bare box. The price and utility are just fine and I recommend this for many applications.There are plenty of heaters of different configurations that have thermostats mounted on the the unit. I thing those are fine for bathrooms, but bedrooms, hallways, etc. should have a thermostat mounted some distance from the heater and which is up on the wall for easy access and professional appearance. This looks fine on the wall, as does the thermostat.The white headed screws for the grill are too long and you have to drill a clearance hole in the wall.I also looked at flat radiator models, but all of them were big, had no fan of course and had built-in thermostats. For me the small size and fan were better.This is recommended for many small room applications.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VFWEGDOBZXRI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001ZLQHK#wasThisHelpful","R2VFWEGDOBZXRI","A3MMJEMXBJOJ8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MMJEMXBJOJ8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have an industrial grade set of jumper cables, but the car parking at my house means I have to join them together to get the length and then rig up some romex house wire to conned the frames...it works but is a the pain you imagine. I bought a cheap unit a couple of years ago, but it simply did not work and was one of my very rare returns to Amazon.Before buying this I asked the company which model to buy as I have a V-8 truck and a BMW with the battery buried in the trunk and jump starting terminals in the engine compartment. They suggested the 4000.This is a big and heavy and clearly rugged device and started the Bimmer quickly as one of my kids managed to kill the battery the day after I bought this. What I can't know is if the smaller and cheaper version would have worked just as well. Oh, well, no excuses now!The cables are indeed short and for some cars where the battery is really far away would probably be a problem. For most cars and trucks this would be fine.

"When I was a kid there weren't even seat belts and often we stood up and looked out the window as we were driven along. Babies were held on laps...some of us lived through that. Now you have all sorts of safety stuff built into cars and it is a whole lot safer to drive now. One of the changes was mandated hooks in the back seats to which you can attach baby and kid's seats. The seats themselves are subject to government requirements and tests and over time they have gotten better and better......And also more expensive, but if you have kids and drive this is just part of the deal. The Graco 40 is a high-end, modern seat that adapts from newborn to older babies with the use of included inserts. This is much better and safer, and more comfortable than a one size fits all seat.The base is normally kept attached in the car and the upper part easily detaches from that and is brought inside where it is easier to strap and unstrap the baby, clean it, etc. Then it just snaps onto the base. Pretty easy, not like those seats which you have to remove entirely and you know that is no fun at all.The padding snaps out for easy cleaning, the adjustments and straps are easy and perceived baby comfort is as good as can be I think. It has a shade and carrying handle and snaps into Graco brand strollers. The materials are high quality and you get what you pay for.The only problem is that the handle is too close to the shade when it is pulled up.Hecho en China, but seemingly to high standards.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG9AOZ8P5XMYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LIRJ2NU#wasThisHelpful","RG9AOZ8P5XMYW","A3MMJEMXBJOJ8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MMJEMXBJOJ8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I grew up with close family in Tennessee, so I have always been fascinated by the South.  While I despised the views expressed by my uncle, I learned from my cousins in long discussions.  Now, with the rise of political rage and cultural tensions that I sometimes find incomprehensible, I was looking for an in-depth explanation of what if anything has changed in the South.  I did not find all of what I was seeking here, but it was worthwhile nonetheless.Thompson starts out with long explanations of the warped version of history - that states' rights and not slavery were the cause of the war - and the region's intense religiosity.  As a history buff, I felt that I learned very little here and for the most part skimmed the first 150 pages.  There were also many descriptions that I found too lengthy, such as the operation of a capitalistic church.  While she mentions the hypocrisy and tendentious nonsense of much of this, I feel she should have offered more perspective and detail.  Nonetheless, if not hard hitting enough, she never crossed the line of appearing apologetic or obtuse; for that, I respect her courage as many from her region will be alienated and angered.It was in the last 100 pages - on Atlanta as a city and the socio-economics of the region - that I learned the most.  First, the South is becoming far more diverse than it has been, with Mexican and Asian immigrants as well as blacks in ""remigration"".  Second, the rural areas are progressively becoming de-populated, a brain drain to the cities that is decimating the traditional society.  Third, and most interestingly, she explains the Southern notion of community in a clearer way than I have yet seen.  It is a masterful performance, with much moving, personal detail.  Fourth, she looks at a city that is dominated by business-oriented ideology, which is growing haphazardly out of control in a variety of unsustainable ways; even in the face of the evidence, its politicians resist the notion of some guidance of the process.The most significant failure for me is Thompson's insufficient examination of what has happened to entrench Southern conservatives into believing in the Tea Party and candidates like Donald Trump.  Southern politics seems to me excessive and wildly unrealistic, unable to distinguish between opinion and fact, just blindly ideological and absurdly entrenched.  I do not mean to judge them here or make a political argument against them, but I did want a better understanding of what is spawning their rage.  I will have to seek it elsewhere.This is a good book, but I was hoping for more.

"This is one of those history books that defines an era, setting a standard that is either accepted or opposed by all who follow.  Because it is one of the turning points that most fascinates me, this book was a particular pleasure, at once an over-arching synthesis yet accurate in its evocation of detail.The book begins at a turning point in Roman history.  After the golden age of the Empire, Roman political institutions entered a period of deadly instability:  with its army outmoded, its politicians incapable of long-term compromise, and outsiders pressing on the borders, it appeared that Rome was doomed.  However, with the reorganization of the society and army associated with Diocletion (244-311 CE), a little-known political genius, the state was once again mobilized on a scale even grander than it had known, with a more evenly distributed system of taxation and the opening to talent outside the traditional aristocracy (for both the Army and a massive new bureaucracy).DIocletion's reforms offered a reprieve to Greco-Roman culture, in existence for nearly 1,000 years.  This ancient tradition was based on an established literature and rhetoric, the mastery of which were the basic requirements of any public career; acquiring it was costly and time-consuming, which for the most part only the aristocracy could afford.  Religiously, it was polytheistic, allowing flexibility for local cults that served the notables of each region and city to celebrate their uniqueness and reinforce their power.  However, by opening the army and government to talent outside this tradition, Dioceltion weakened this culture.  Moreover, as the centralized bureaucratic state dominated Roman institutions with the cult of the emperor, the local polytheistic Gods were losing their clout and Romans began to explore monotheistic alternatives.  Once the borders began to be threatened again, this search accelerated under extreme crisis.The appeal of the various monotheisms - and there were very many that Brown describes - was that they offered new ways of seeing the world that were more accessible to the common man than the rarified and largely unobtainable classical tradition.  Suddenly, anyone could ask philosophical questions within new communities, of which Christianity was only one of the most prominent.  With Constantine's conversion, in this scheme, Christianity slowly moved to the fore.When the western portion of the Empire fell to barbarian invasion, the surviving local notables made their peace with the new masters (who were almost all members of various Christian sects). This provided a stability that nurtured the growing churches, allowing landowners and others to enter the clergy and thereby retain much of their influence.  Meanwhile, in the east, Byzantium kept much of the Roman tradition alive, in its Christian version; up until the autocracy of Justinian, it was a bureaucratic state run on relatively rational lines.  In Brown's telling, the long war between Byzantium and Sassanian Persia weakened both states, offering an opening to the Arabs with their new Islamic monotheism.  By the time the Umayyads had conquered Northern Africa and most of the Levant, the classical era was decisively ended and the Medieval Ages had begun.This summary cannot do justice to the subtlety of Brown's argument, which examines social and cultural change rather than explains the fall of Rome.  He encapsulates this period to near perfection, but if the reader is unfamiliar with the period at the undergraduate level, the book could be pretty rough going.  Brown is also a wonderfully elegant writer, his language a great pleasure.Recommended with enthusiasm.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23B212SIZ3G06/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393958035#wasThisHelpful","R23B212SIZ3G06","AUM3YMZ0YRJE0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the first great feature-length comedies and it is a marvel to see.  This set is a testament to Chaplin's pioneering genius, it is worthy of study by any film buff.As a French production, it is a bit odd:  the principal disk is of the sound edition that Chaplin created for re-release with narration and music in the early 1940s.  The viewer can choose French, English, or Italian for sound and many more languages for subtitles.  It is only in the extras that the original silent version of 1925 can be found (along with a 5-minute documentary).

"If you want the definitive one-volume take on Lenin's revolution and all that it entailed, this is your book.  I was mesmerized from the first page and it lasted right until the end, complete with characters who are followed throughout the entire story, quick and dense analyses of the forces behind events, and a full explanation of the consequences that inevitably followed.  It is a masterpiece of historical exposition.The story begins with an analysis of the old regime, the last major one to survive in Europe.  On top was the Tsar and the aristocracy, which dominated government and much of the bureaucracy.  They owned most of the land, had the most education, and controlled the armed forces.  There was a slim tranche that represented an urban middle class, a rising bourgeoisie that dominated commerce and the rudiments of a manufacturing industry, but they were too weak to have much political influence.  All the rest, over 90% of the population, were peasants in primitive villages, most of them illiterate; though serfs until the 1860s (bound to the land under the total control of the gentry), they had recently gained some legal rights, including minimal self governance; they were a mix of reactionary conservatives and the disgruntled, who carried a simmering rage.Nicolas II, the Tsar, was so ill-suited to his role that the socio-political forces he faced led to complete catastrophe.  Rather than take an interest in the reforms needed - or even in the practical tasks of governing - he chose to live in a dream world in which he imagined the ""people"" loved him as the eternal soul of the entire country.  After a series of assassinations and violent uprisings, he indulged in the idea that autocracy was the answer for the Russian Empire, egged on by his German wife, who believed he should rule as Ivan the Terrible had done.  Because Nicolas II was suspicious of anyone who challenged his authority, he actively undermined the government and bureaucracy, preferring the fawning nonsense of manipulative courtiers and religious figures, such as Rasputin.  As the social situation worsened, he remained studiously unaware of what should be done to protect Russian institutions and his office.  After the 1905 revolution, the Tsar agreed to establish a Parliament, the Duma, but he did not choose to nurture or work with it, losing a significant opportunity.Had there been peace, more peaceful political change might have eventually come, but Nicolas II chose instead to join in the Great War as a Western ally.  This war - the first fully modern one that required both an industrial capacity and more flexible institutions - brought the situation to a head.  Not only was the aristocratic military revealed as incompetent and uncaring of the lives of its peasant foot soldiers, but the catastrophic conditions under which the war unfolded completely undermined the support of the masses for the Tsar's autocratic government.  The result was a revolution that forced him to abdicate in favor of a new parliamentary democracy, which was soon identified with Kerensky.One of the weaknesses of coverage is the precise configuration of the institutions that emerged to fill the gap created by the collapse of the autocracy.  First, the Duma remained unrepresentative and weak, particularly with the absence of any viable middle class.  Second, there were the Soviets, which apparently were more spontaneous groupings that better reflected the revolutionary forces, though they varied widely in their composition and openness.  It was here that the Bolsheviks (the ""Reds""), Mensheviks, and various Social Democrats met to debate courses of action.  Third, there were disparate groupings that might be seen as power centers, including conservative Aristocrats (the ""Whites"") and many others, such as ethnic groups, but few added up to any coherent force.  I was never clear on how these interacted or what their powers were.Nonetheless, the politics of the situation is very well covered.  As the rage of peasants was unleashed in a series of violent movements that attacked and disenfranchised the landed gentry, the Duma appeared impotent to restore order to the situation.  Meanwhile, as the war wreaked havoc on the economy, the Bolsheviks emerged as the only ones who clearly opposed continuing to fight (as well as the only party to endorse the aristocracy's destruction as wholly desirable as well as the takeover of industries by workers).  This won them the political heart of many peasants, who identified the Reds as the only true force genuinely supporting the revolution.  No one else seemed to understand these political facts in the civil war that erupted after the Bolsheviks seized power in the October 1917 coup - the Whites appeared to want to restore the monarchy and land rights of the aristocracy, which at this point was politically impossible and hence completely undermined their cause in the medium term.It is at this point that the personal stories become important.  Figes proves that Lenin was the dominant politician of his time, pushing the Bolsheviks to seize power and establish their own form of autocracy, improvising the whole time with decisions that would prepare the ground for the ambitious Stalin to take over the party apparatus and soon (with his ability to appoint cronies in key positions) the entire government.  The portraits of these men and scores of others are compelling and fascinating in their quirky detail.  Figes is of the opinion that, due to the institutions that Lenin set up, Stalin was an inevitable and natural outgrowth of all that followed, even though Lenin came to oppose him while on his death bed.Once the Bolsheviks were in power, even though they withdrew Russia from the war (with great difficulty), they made a series of mistakes that plunged the country into famine, renewed civil war, and desperate anarchy that took years to set right.  To keep themselves in power, they relied on terror in a similar manner to the Tsar, but with ideological purpose guiding their actions and a huge bureaucracy that they installed, often run by uneducated and inexperienced peasant revolutionaries.  Figes covers this process well, but his explanations of the impact of Marxist theory were less than satisfying for me, perhaps due to my own ignorance of it (i.e. he goes on about the lack of a capiltalist class, which had to be skipped).Throughout the book, Figes exhibits an admirable skepticism, never indulging in romanticization of any of the characters or their ideas.  Except for certain individuals, no class or group comes off well - not the peasants, not the revolutionaries, not representatives of the old regime.  A very interesting analysis is offered regarding the mentalities of each group.  Cut off as the vast majority was from the ideas in ferment to the west, there was a poverty of ideas under discussion, with few alternatives emerging organically from the society.  Instead, the few ideas that did get into the country were viewed as exclusive panaceas rather than part of a mix that required compromise and negotiation; rather than an openness of mind, the lack of education and ignorance promoted rigid minds that rarely questioned opinions once they were adopted.  For their part, the Bolsheviks disdained the peasants and workers, in whose name they established their dictatorship.  I cannot due justice to the subtlety of Figes' ideas here, but it was one of the most interesting cultural aspects of the book for me.  (For example, he views the search for philosophical answers to everything as a key to the appeal of the great Russian novelists of the 19C.)This book is as satisfying an intellectual meal as the general reader could hope for.  I simply could not stop reading it and almost never felt bogged down over its 800+ pages.  It is an astounding achievement:  for the first time in my life, I feel I truly grasp this revolution and all that it meant.  While sometimes exhaustive in its detail, Figes never covers events to excess:  there is always a purpose to his narrative, so that every single battle or political maneuver is not described; instead, significant or illustrative episodes are highlighted, a relief for lay readers.Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L2LXO9C5B93W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=014024364X#wasThisHelpful","R2L2LXO9C5B93W","AUM3YMZ0YRJE0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a masterpiece of hard scifi.  The narrative, of a mysterious woman hunting hitchhikers, immediately draws the reader in.  Her character is angry and frequently in pain, but cunning in a cautious way.  It is very subtle and a consistent portrait is built over the course of the novel.  Why she is doing what she is doing remains a mystery for a long time, which is fun, though it is spelled out a good deal more clearly than it was in the film.  Behind her complaints (in particular at the surgical mutilation of her original body) and class resentments, the structure of the alien society also emerges, and if it captures your imagination, it is very interesting indeed.What is so intriguing is how slowly the truth emerges, layer after layer peeling off, often in contradiction to what the woman is thinking or assuming.  For example, an elite scion arrives unexpectedly, and she wants to avoid him.  Then, they have a long discussion that leads into a number of hidden places on the farm, revealing much about the purpose of their presence.  He proves to be far more complex and questioning than she wants to admit to herself, though it hardly gets her to think much more.This is a very different work than the slow, if excellent, film with Scarlett Johansson.  Of course, you can get what is not explained in the film, but the plot and basic details diverge significantly, so much that they are separate works of art.

"This is a wonderful adaptation of the Wolff novel, in which a family and their friends are seen in a brief vacation to the summer house and then in retrospect.  The viewer gets to know how each of the people, with all their qualities and eccentricities, feels and perceives things.  There is nothing extraordinary about them, there is plenty of tension and faults, but also as solid a bond as there can be between such disparate people.  It is a question of taste and preference, but I found them absorbing and interesting.The patriarch, an educator and philosopher, is a crotchety man whose career is on the decline, full and disappointment and regrets.  He is something of a bully with some of his children, has favorites and designated failures.  His wife is saintly, supporting him without question, giving to everyone, and aware of the balance of personalities and needs at every moment.  She is the anchor of the family, by far the smartest one of all, a force of nature, but ill.  Branaugh is a self-absorbed student and invitee, who doesn't fit in and burns with the need for attention.  There are also 2 artists, one a stodgy poet out of favor and a painter-spinster who strives to meet her own highest standards.  Each is a beautiful person in their own ways, but essentially mediocre.  Finally, there are all of the children, ranging from the favored eldest who moves into the place of the departed mother, the middle children, and a spoilt younger boy.  The personalities and places they occupy are distinct with a crystal clarity.It is their last time all together before they leave home from marriage, deaths, and careers, initiating a deeper deterioration as the father resents his decline into professional irrelevance - he no longer has any good ideas.  Yet they go to the house once again, seeing everything in retrospect, not necessarily resolving anything, but somehow feeling having come full circle, even if sadness and loss reign.I saw this when it came out and loved it.  Now, seeing it again 30 years later, I saw more layers to all the characters and was amazed at how much seemed new to me.  That is a mark of great art.I recommend this warmly, but given the price, it might be best to watch it online.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15RLMB9A0HFF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00018Y0UC#wasThisHelpful","R15RLMB9A0HFF0","AUM3YMZ0YRJE0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though less slick than a Hollywood production, this is a subtle and moving update of the 18C novel of aristocratic intrigue.  It has some of the best acting that French cinema has to offer, with Jeanne Moreau, Gérard Philipe, and the astonishingly beautiful Annette Vadim.  Valmont, in this version, is a young diplomat, a product of the most elite French schools.  He has a cynical partnership with his wife, Cécile (Moreau in a perfect casting) in which they play at sex and love, which they record in letters, disregarding the damage they wreak.  They set out on vacation, setting a goal of seduction of Valmont's young cousin, but finding a surprise along the way, a young Danish woman of impeccable character whom Valmont decides to have.  Of course, he can't handle genuine emotion, and it ruins everything for themselves and those they touched.As a long-time American transplant in France, this film was a particular pleasure.  I went to the school (Sciences Po) that this Valmont did and it is a good reflection of the milieu at the time, when France was brash and young, the economy booming, and everyone was obsessed with style and the pursuit of personal pleasure.  The vacation setting (Megève) is even near to where I now live, the perfect resort playground for this vanished elite.  The film portrays this section of bourgeois society with great accuracy and panache.  The music script is also wonderful, mostly Thelonius Monk, but the jazz of that time permeates the mood of the film; it is pure gorgeousity.If there is a criticism I have of the film, it is the light Hollywoodish moralizing at the end.  Nonetheless, I recommend this with enthusiasm.  Too bad it is not available on dvd.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IX6XUZZ4MX2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=6301910338#wasThisHelpful","R2IX6XUZZ4MX2K","AUM3YMZ0YRJE0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The principal idea behind this book is that we should not let the Holocaust completely dominate our perception of German culture.  In his massive intellectual undertaking, Watson attempts to shift our attention to the flowering of the German mind from 1750 to 1933 as well as its transformation post-WWII.  Though often a bit too encyclopaedic, Watson succeeds in putting it all into context without neglecting Hitler.  As a read, it is thoroughly engrossing and enlightening, an inspiration regarding a subject that western historians have indeed neglected.The story begins with the father of Frederick the Great, who began to institute a more comprehensive educational system.  He was a pietist, the Prussian version of the Puritans, with a great belief in education as a way to improve one's character and, by implication, the nation; this was called the Bildung, a grounding in general culture in the humanities with an emphasis on classical antiquity.  Frederick the Great expanded his father's policies, but in the tradition of the Enlightenment, his were more secular and skeptical.  This led to the emergence of an educated middle class, the largest in Europe, with rates of literacy far beyond all other nations.  They were to be the employees in the bureaucracy as well as replace clerics and pastors as the intellectuals in the society.  This also culminated in the establishment of the modern research university in the 19C, complete with PhDs, specialized publications, and research institutes that far surpassed those in other western countries in both quantity and quality.In addition to this, given the autocratic nature of the Prussian state, the Bildung was largely inward-oriented - encouraging introspection and self betterment rather than political reform or activism.  This created a serious tension within the society, a kind of top-down imposition of policies by the state for which there was little alternative.  Nonetheless, to fill the void that secularism was opening in German hearts and minds, Watson argues that philosophy rose to take Christianity's place with the idealist concepts of Kant and Hegel, to mention only two; this makes for some pretty turgid reading and cannot really serve as an introduction to the complex and often obscure contribution to western thought.  Beyond philosophy, there was an extraordinary flowering in all the arts, from writers and painters to composers.  That being said, the population apparently persisted in placing a significantly larger amount of unquestioning trust in the authorities, who ""knew better"" and had their ""interests at heart""; this left the German political culture stunted and undemocratic until after WWII.During the 19C, the innovators themselves, though too numerous to cover in any depth, are sketched out in context, often showing their inter-relationships.  For example, the great German symphonies were regarded as philosophical works, mirroring their counterparts in the academy; this astonished me.  Innovators included Nietzsche, who opened the way to post-modernism, essentially denying that any meaning or truth can be taken as absolute or categorical, but is only relative and uncertain.  (He summed this up as ""God is dead."")  In the economic realm, of course, there was Marx, whose revolutionary philosophy was one of the most consequential of the 20C.  Freud introduced new concepts as well, leading to a therapeutic approach that attempted to make sense of one's life as a meaningful narrative, i.e. a new kind of introspection that quickly spread to the rest of the world and remains a mainstay of the modern mindset.  While the thumbnail portraits are fascinating, they are of necessity rather superficial and vary in quality.  (For example, Watson makes some pretty glib claims about Freud's accomplishments, dismissing them as ""wrong"" or arrived at under ""faulty"" methods without offering sufficient proof.)  I often found this frustrating.According to Watson, it was at the dawn of the German industrial revolution that the balance of power began to change in Germany:  manufacturers, managers, technologists, and financiers began to displace the cultured bourgeoisie, whose humanistic Bildung could no longer monopolize elite status outside of royalty and the aristocracy.  Furthermore, scientists were also gaining in influence, again without the introspective underpinnings of the Bildung.  With the lack of political reform, Watson argues, this left less and less space for the middle classes, who when the economy collapsed could offer little effective political opposition to the fascists.To his credit, Watson acknowledges that the rise of the Nazis and their apocalyptic excesses may never be fully understood.  Nonetheless, he shows how they transmogrified many of the innovations credited to the great German intellectuals, such as Nietzsche's superman concept, social darwinist racism and eugenics, and the concept of a superior ""Volksgeist"" or ""spirit"" of the German people, which was always a nebulous notion to me.  Watson also covers how the Nazis and those willing to unquestioningly follow them, including Heidegger and many other intellectuals, destroyed much of the educational and research systems that had grown over the previous 200 years.  As everyone know, it is a sad chapter from which Germany is still recovering.Finally, Watson argues, once the western allies created the Federal Republic, the break with a past of political authoritarianism is at last accomplished.  With the institutional groundwork imposed from outside, the protests of 1968 set off a transformation towards modern democracy, according to which the younger generation asks questions that the older one was unable to do, in particular when addressing the Nazi past.  This was the least convincing to me, kind of thrown in at the end.  Having lived in Germany near to this time, I still found students rather rigid in their ideologies and arrogant as to the superiority of the German culture over American capitalism (""Die Amerikaner sind alle kulturlos."")  That being said, I completely agree with the author that Germany has created a decent society that has grown beyond the Nazi catastrophe.I cannot do justice to the breadth of Watson's coverage.  For example, towards the end, he abruptly gets into Heidegger's warnings about technology, which (he argues) the age of genetic engineering has proven ""relevant""; I was left unconvinced and feel that Heidegger is over-rated for nationalistic reasons.  Nonetheless, in terms of content, this is an exquisite sketch of the basics.  I am not sure if what he claims is true - that the intellectual movements actually meant what he says they did - but the connections often made sense to me and put things in a new light.  This is a great intellectual adventure and it left me very hungry for more, a sure sign of the book's success.Warmly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O00E1UWEPLG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060760230#wasThisHelpful","R1O00E1UWEPLG3","AUM3YMZ0YRJE0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The result is a convoluted story that takes place in at least 3 time frames - 4 if you count Sarah's recollections - in which characters meet their younger selves new personalities are forged, etc.  Even though I have enjoyed all the film-length versions, I found it hard to remember who was supposed to know what when, etc.  Rather than feel completely drawn into the story, I was constantly aware that someone had made it up while I waited for an inevitable conclusion.  The action is spectacular, of course, but we expect that as a minimum backdrop in all these mega-productions now.I would recommend this for action movie fans, kids, and nerdy aficionados that revel in all the nuances.  But as a consumer of hard scifi, I found it rather contrived and so blatantly commercial that it was tiring.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37T2LH2KOV2JD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01013I9DU#wasThisHelpful","R37T2LH2KOV2JD","AUM3YMZ0YRJE0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very interesting, true story about how a talented woman emerges as an artist.  Violette is the bastard daughter of a troubled woman, on her own, impoverished, and lonely.  Still she has great talent, not only for airing issues that no one has written about - bi-sexuality, lesbian love, the need for intimacy - but as a pioneer of confessional autobiography.  With a great stroke of luck, she finds in mentor in Simone de Beauvoir, one of the literary stars of the post-WWII era.  De Beauvoir immediately recognizes her gifts and sets about to nurture her, offering suggestions, criticism, and finally money to keep Violette going.  Their relationship is extremely subtle and portrayed with a beautiful ambiguity, even mystery.  I found it thoroughly engrossing and refreshingly un-Hollywood in its pacing and themes.Beyond this seminal relationship, Violette becomes friends with some of the most fascinating literary talents of the period, including Genet and Camus.  This too is handled with humor and by implication, leaving a great deal for the viewer to fill in, particularly by their knowledge of the writers and that period of French history - it stimulates a desire to learn more.  De Beauvoir's sexuality is also left out, which would never have been the case in a Hollywood production.THis is not to say that her path was easy.  She remains isolated and often in despair that the way of her art is too difficult.  At one point, she has a nervous breakdown and is given electroshock therapy.  But de Beauvoir is always there, offering the right word at the right time, pushing her ever so slightly into some promising direction, displaying unshakeable faith in Violette's talent, and expanding her horizons when necessary, such as her suggestion to travel.If you like modern EUropean film, this is one of the best I have seen in years.  Warmly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPZQTWZJH3SWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MIA0FH8#wasThisHelpful","RPZQTWZJH3SWV","AUM3YMZ0YRJE0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agree with Hughe's assessment that Crumb is like a modern-day Hieronymous Bosch.  He is like a focal lens for all the alienation, angst, vainglory, and hypocrisy of the age, but it is all played out in the pursuit of pleasure and status, leavened by the most hilarious cynicism and existentialism.  He was the original underground comix auteur, and has evolved into one of the most interesting voices of the 1960s generation.  I know his vision permeated mine as I was coming of age.This volume contains his later work, which is often more realistic and documentary than his usual surrealistic sexcapades with human/animal hybrids or nutcase con men like Mr. Natural, though there are a few of those.  I loved his autobiographical material, such as the ""I'm Grateful, I'm Grateful"" piece on why he loves his life, which is one of his best ever, but his stuff on blues musicians and perverts is also first rate.  If anything, his graphics style has gotten even better as has the maturity of his writing.  This was the time when the Zap energy was clearly on the wane, really already done. Of course, the themes remain similar:  sex, lust, the emptiness of popular culture and the mainstream, and mystery of relationships.  I loved every single panel.  There are also many straight portraits that Crumb drew, which are wonderful.In my opinion, this is a must have for any counter-cultural aficionado or postmodernism buff.  You can read these over and over and see more and laugh each time.  He proves to be as much a shaper of one's imagination as Van Gogh or Picasso.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K3QVFMSOC0KN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0861662253#wasThisHelpful","R3K3QVFMSOC0KN","AUM3YMZ0YRJE0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Goldsworthy is, I think, the best living writer on Rome.  His books, which are at once a pleasure to read as well as at the cutting edge of current scholarship, never disappoint.  In this book, he takes on the man who completed what Julius Caesar, his great uncle and adoptive father, might have had in mind (or might not have).  When compared to Julius, Augustus is far less interesting in appearance:  he is cautious rather than bold, not a military man of genius but a delegator, somehow just bland.  Nonetheless, Augustus was a builder of institutions and a molder of society in the very deepest sense, bringing stability after nearly a century of upheaval and the author of images of power that would survive as the principal model of government until the 19 C CE.  And, apparently, he died in his bed.Augustus was born Octavian into an aristocratic family, whose mother was Julius Caesar's niece.  Aside from that, there was nothing to particularly distinguish him outside of his own ambition.  He was sickly and the times were in terrible upheaval:  the institutions of the Republic were badly blocked, with factions able to easily veto the actions of their opponents through multiple channels; with depressing regularity, civil war broke out,  decimating the ruling classes of talent.  The titan of the era, of course, was Julius Caesar, who beat Pompey, Cato, and many other enemies to achieve dictatorial power.  Once assassinated, Cicero and a new generation emerged to reclaim power, including Marc Antony and, at the age of 19, Octavian, who surprised everyone by being named Julius' heir and adopted son in his will (and re-named Octavius).  After a long struggle, Octavius eliminated all his rivals and reigned unopposed for 40 years.  While this is not by any means a boring life, Augustus attracts less scholarly and popular attention than many other figures.  This, Goldsworthy proves, is a mistake.First, Augustus effects an institutional transformation. Goldsworthy argues convincingly that this was not a visionary undertaking, but one of improvisation and expedience. Giving up completely on the power-sharing of the Republic, which had been failing in gridlock since the Gracchi brothers 100 years before, Augustus essentially monopolized power but maintained the appearance of the traditional institutions.  He was ""first citizen"", elected often to the consulship, but preferred to play the powerbroker in the background with others as figureheads under his control.He became, in effect, a military dictator - with control of the armed forces, which answered directly to him instead of to the Senate.  In this way, he could impose order after 50 years of regular, increasingly savage, civil wars, beginning with Sulla.  At his death, he had sewn the seeds of a monarchy, reversing nearly 500 years of experimentation with a republican form of government that was relatively democratic at times.  He may even have believed that these changes had provided for orderly transfers of power, though as we know, this was only partially successful.  Nonetheless, it provided the essential model for government all the way to the Enlightenment.Second, he fundamentally altered the political balance in Rome.  This was accomplished for the most part by proscription of everyone who opposed Augustus, starting with murder and expropriation in cahoots with Marc Antony, and later in softer versions of exile.  The net effect was to wipe out almost entirely the old senatorial aristocracy, leaving more compliant descendants or new men in their place.Third, employing his trusted and brilliant side kick, Agrippa, he mopped up a vast array of military conflicts and internal rebellions.  Augustus knew he was not a great general or warrior, so he had the sense to rely on an impeccably loyal subordinate, who did not have his kind of ambition.  In the end, the Empire achieved stability over a vast area, almost its maximum extent; in accordance with Augustus' policy, it should remain stable and consolidate itself rather than expand.Fourth, he began a process of professionalization of the administration, installing bureaucrats for longer periods of time than had been possible in the Republic, which sometimes changed administrators once per year, when the new consuls took office.  Aristocrats still occupied most positions, but there was a new rigor to who was allowed to serve.  Heretofore, Rome had governed more as a city state, dominating the periphery with blatant corruption and nepotism.  I do not mean to exaggerate, but he initiated a process that took centuries to refine and work out.As the self-styled ""father"" of the country, Augustus sought to impose a kind of moral order on Rome.  Aided by Maecenas, another of his loyal aides, Augustus mastered the use of propaganda for this purpose. Nonetheless, his daughter and adoptive children essentially made a mockery of, in what can only be called a personal disaster of epic proportion. It was the start of a kind of conservatism that truncated the diversity of morals and literature that characterized the Republic.  While there were many official masterpieces during his reign, some believe that culture and society lost something.Goldsworthy is conservative in the interpretations that he offers, always sticking to what is irrefutably provable and refusing to speculate on the gossip that advanced such rumors as the murderous nature of his wife, Livia, or the rivalries of his heirs.  As such, we do not get any confirmation of the colorful personalities and motivations in popular fiction (e.g., I Claudius) or even in certain contemporary sources such as Suetonius.  He also refuses in many instances to render judgments on what it all meant.  In my view, at its worst this orientation airs on the side of the driest scholarship, making the read less fun and interesting.I recommend this as an essential source for anyone interested in Rome, in the history of government and imperial institutions, in politics as an art form.  It is as first rate as anything that Goldsworthy undertakes.  The research and writing of this took at least 2 years, and it shows.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VDTKYU9QU67J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300178727#wasThisHelpful","R2VDTKYU9QU67J","AUM3YMZ0YRJE0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

After a brief period of hope, all seems doomed to failure and a gloomy emprisoned life stretches ahead.  But wait!

"I grew up in the 60s and think it was the last time America was truly interesting.  So I love fictional takes on it.  This is a very good film, with some truly fine acting.  Sutherland is a sensitive boy from small-town Maryland, which the Vietnam conflict is finally beginning to penetrate.  His sidekick (Downey), a lifelong neighbor from a single-parent household, is falling victim to all the worst excesses of the time - protesting, turning on, dropping out.  Meanwhile, a serious young lady (a radiant Ryder in her prime) is falling for Sutherland as he tries to help her brother.  Their parents are all struggling with aging and the times.  Add to this Sutherland's straighter brother, who disappears in Vietnam, and you have a powerful mix.I can't be too objective because this is so close to my own experience.  With the exception of a kind of cheesy ending, I found the film moving and fairly realistic, with sprinklings of the occasional cliche.  It's not Coming Home, but it is good.

"This is a wonderfully dead pan take on the gangster movie.  They are all essentially petty idiots in a very brutal game.  First you have the Laurel and Hardy heroin addicts, who blunder into a big score.  Then, you have the organizers of a gambling den, from the bottom feeders to the middle managers.  Finally, to clean up the mess, they bring in bullies and a seriously efficient killer.  They are all wonderfully acted characters, even Brad Pitt whom I normally bypass as over-rated.  Gandolfini has a wonderful cameo as a drunken hood trying to retire and more interested in partying, who Pitt tries to salvage from his bender.Perhaps this wasn't a hit because it is so horrifically violent.  I found it entertaining, smart, and vivid.

"My father was a psychiatrist, so I grew up respecting Freud while very aware of the failures and rigidities inherent in his method.  This sparked a lifelong interest on Freud in me, though from a historical perspective rather than as a practitioner.  I have read many histories of the period and about all the other theories that his ideas spawned.This is an absolutely beautiful dramatization of Freud's greatest period of discovery, when he resisted the prestigious medical establishment in Vienna to forge ahead with his radical theories.  Not only does the film outline the process of scientific discovery, but it presents the basic ideas lucidly and with surprising historical accuracy, given the compromises needed to form a Hollywood narrative.  This is an extraordinary accomplishment, in my opinion.Through wonderfully dramatic case studies, we experience Freud's development of an new approach to hysteria (that it exists and can be dealt with through hypnosis, involving the re-experiencing of the original trauma and thereby eliminating it for good); the founding of the theory of sexual neurosis (obviously questionable with what we now know with subsequent science) as the principal basis of psychological trauma; the discovery that dreams and free association can lead to communication with the unconscious mind; and finally, the working out of how this should work therapeutically.  Freud explores not just the pathologies of his patients, but his own neuroses, all the while managing his professional and personal relationships.  In my opinion, it is a brilliant success as a drama and an informative documentary - it does not unacceptably over-simplify or transmogrify, but portrays Freud as the brilliant humanist and healer that he was.This is a pioneering film, I have never seen anything like it as means to transmit ideas.  Recommended with enthusiasm.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34M4TMDTLL11T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007AJGI3W#wasThisHelpful","R34M4TMDTLL11T","AUM3YMZ0YRJE0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very rarely, you find a scifi writer who can combine unbelievably fascinating concepts with a great narrative.  I have read 1000s of OK scifi novels, fun passtimes that are easily forgotten.  But this series (like just about everything that Butler writes) is far superior to potboilers, it is truly a product of superior talent.The story is about human first contact with an alien species. In the aftermath of a terrible war and environmental devastation, a vast ship, of incomprehensible biologically based technology, has appeared and taken a number of human survivors on board.  The aliens, masters of genetic science, are so different - even to the point that they recognize humans as condemned to hierarchical relationships - that their motives and behavior remain tantalizingly opaque, but understandable (or better, interpretable) as the trilogy unfolds.The first book is about the initial contact, with details of the alien culture; the characters are compelling and very human.  The second covers the conversion on Earth, of still largely inscrutable purpose, and the actions of a boy - a hybrid of alien and human - who sees a problem and attempts to rectify them, with unfathomable consequences.  The final volume is about the emergence of the third sex, an Ooloi.  The most amazing thing is that it is all completely believable, yet unimaginable.Recommended as one of the best scifi series I have ever read, perhaps only surpassed by Butler's other series, Patternist.  No one will ever surpass this as an accomplishment of the human imagination.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ77987LZPARB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000X1AVFK#wasThisHelpful","RJ77987LZPARB","AUM3YMZ0YRJE0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So I want to start off by saying that Tracey is one of my very favorite authors. I LOVED her Cauld Ane books so much and those were ones I really didn't think I would get into because quite honestly I am not a ""paranormal"" fan. Those turned into one of the best series I have ever read. So I thought I would give this series a try as well. I am not a fan of time travel at all, like I NEVER EVER read them because they just don't appeal to me, but I am really glad I decided to give this one a go. I am a huge fan of how Ms. Jackson writes. She has the ability to draw you in and make you want to know more well past the end of the book. I want to also say that the first 15% didn't grab me very easily. In fact, I thought I really wasn't going to like it, but at the same time I really wanted to know what was going to happen. Once I got past about 15% it really took off and I was hooked. It got better and better as the book went on. And after finishing it and just beginning the second book, I really feel like even though it didn't grab right away it was needed. In my opinion, I think she had to really set the tone for the rest of the series. She introduced you to a lot of characters in the beginning and where I was questioning some of situations, I feel like you really need to have a handle on all of them for the rest of the series. I look forward to seeing where this series goes and who all gets their own book.

"Scandal is part one in a three part series.  This one is a short quick read that ends in a cliffhanger.  I knew there would be a cliffhanger because it's part one but I didn't expect it to but such a big cliffhanger.  I immediately wanted to read part two but I thought I would write my review for part one first.Ella works for The Daily Scandal.  She's not a sleazy paparazzi.  She is caring and kind hearted.  Her former step sister, Madison, is a Hollywood star and is killed.  Ella ends up investigating the story for The Daily Scandal.  During the investigating she meets super sexy Jaxson Cole.  Jaxson is Madison's ex.  There are some many things wrong with Ella starting a relationship with Jaxson.  Some things about Jaxson seem off.  The cliffhanger at the end is crazy and I'm off to read part two to see what happens next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GFS32U85BIOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZNY96OE#wasThisHelpful","R1GFS32U85BIOC","A1QDU32SAI8LO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QDU32SAI8LO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love reading reading about real life prison breaks and one of my favorite shows to watch is I Almost Got Away With It.  So, when I read this blurb, I had to read this book.Tessa has fallen in love with the paper version of Max.  She has read his file and seen his picture and she likes him.  When her boss can't make it to Max's parole hearing, she goes in his place.  Tessa is having a bad day and it gets worse when she become parts of a prison break.Max is as sexy in person as he is in his file picture but at first he's not as nice as Tessa excepted.  I wasn't really sure about Max.  He has times where he seems super nice then there are times where we see a completely different side of him.  Tessa goes through a lot of different things and emotions throughout her ordeal.  I really liked Max and Tessa together and I was hoping that when everything came to head that their relationship would last.Unlawful Seizure is a great read.

"Pretty In Ink is book two in the Bodies Ink and Steel series.  It can be read as a standalone.  The first book is Blurred Lines and that one is Riley and Blake's story.  If you read that one you already meet Stevie.  This one is Stevie and Wilson's story.I love Stevie.  She's a great down to earth girl.  She speaks her mind and you always know where you stand with her.  She's not like a typical girl, there is nothing fake about her.  Stevie thinks she wants a bad boy biker but that hasn't panned out for her.Wilson is anything but the type of guy that Stevie wants.  He's rich, caring, and sweet.  Sometimes what we think we think we want is not always what works best.  I was glad Stevie gave Wilson a chance and Wilson didn't change to fit the mold of a guy that Stevie thought she wanted.Wilson character has a lot going on.  He had kind of a sheltered up bringing and some of the things his parents instilled in him effect the way he is now.  Wilson's mom is a little crazy and causes trouble for Stevie and Wilson.  I was definitely surprised at some of things that Wilson's mom did.Wilson and Stevie  are great characters that have an amazing story.

"Wow, just wow.  This book was great.  Tegan is a herion addict and the author doesn't hold anything back.  We get the raw and gritty view of Tegan's journey through getting hooked on heroin and getting clean.  We go back and forth between the past and present.  I really liked that and the transitions between past and present were flawless, there was no confusion with switching between the two.Tegan has had a trouble past, drugs became her way to forget the memories.  At rehab she meets Asher.  Asher isn't a patient.  He's a counselor.  Asher has been through a lot too, he's a recovering addict who has turned his life around.  He and Tegan bound pretty quickly.  He not judgmental and he's a very likable character.  They work closely together and feeling get involved.  Their relationship is kind of taboo because it a counselor patient relationship that is frowned upon.I really enjoyed reading this one.  I was rooting for the characters relationship to make it and be something serious between them.

"You know those series that have you so hooked you never want it to end? Yeah, that is this series for me. I fall in love with each book and each time I think, it isn't possible for it to be as good as the last, and each time I am proven wrong. I must say I really have been looking forward to Olivia and Dylan's book from the beginning. Liv has been such a strong character from book one. I knew there would be some major things she has had to deal with in her past and the only one who could help her with it would be Dylan. Boy was I right!! He is the perfect match for Liv and he is willing to do anything to prove that to her. I am truly in love with the Dare family!! I am so excited to read what comes next!

"This is the first book I have read by this author and I am hooked!!! This is such a great start to what promises to be a great series. I must say I fell in love with all the McKinnon Sisters immediately. They are such a close knit family and I love that. I, myself, have 3 younger sisters and found that I can totally relate to each one of the McKinnon sisters and how they protect each other. Now onto this book, Faith and Cain are two lovers who have really been through the ringer. Cain went off in the military and had some horrible things happen to him and in the process of that he basically sent a ""dear john"" letter breaking off their engagement to Faith. He firmly believes that he is not good enough for her until a certain McKinnon sister goes and pays Cain and visit and basically knocks him up side the head and tells him to get his crap together and get Faith back. And things are not smooth sailing for sure, but I love that. Love isn't always easy, but it proves to always be worth it. I love Cain and Faith so much!!! This book was a 5 AMAZEBALLS stars for me!

That really helps us to see how she got to where she is today.  She has a always had a huge crush on Jagger.

He always thought that Ronnie deserved better then him.  He has one major job that he need Ronnie to help him with.

Danny is Kerr brother and he rents the room across from Devon.  Where Kerr is cold and not very friendly, Danny is friendly and nice.  There is a lot of mystery about the characters.

"I have read all the books in this series so far and while you can read them as standalones, I really believe you should read them in order because they all have intertwined characters and well honestly because they are really dang good. When Decklan was first introduced in Gabe's book (Dare to Surrender) I have to be honest and tell you that I knew his book was going to be freaking awesome. Decklan just had this ""thing"" about him that drew me in and made me really want to know him. I have to say it did not disappoint in the least. I was hooked from page one and did not get anything done until it was over. And then I decided I had to start the next one because I just could not wait. This series is not one to be missed.

I keep thinking there is no way this series could be any better and every time I am proven wrong. I really can't decide who is my favorite Dare man so far. Gabe is the cousin to Ian and Alex from books 1 and 2 and boy does he heat things up!! I love the whole Invitation to Eden element too. Isabelle and Gabe are another awesome couple in this family.

I totally fell in love with Alex in Dare to Love and honestly couldn't wait to read his book and was super excited to know that his was next. Alex goes through something traumatic in the beginning and really doesn't handle it well. And while Madison wants so badly to be there for him, he won't let her. Then fast forward a few months and he knows he screwed up and is going to do anything possible to get her back.

He is a super sexy faery who has know Sahylee most of her life.Shaylee is thrown into a world that she never believed existed.

She is now free from it and wants a tattoo.  Blake is a tattoo artist who owns his own shop.  Riley goes to his shop for her tattoo.

"I honestly don't even know where to begin with this review. Ok, now onto this book....Shawn and Taralynn have known each other practically their whole lives. Their brothers are best friends so in turn they are friends. Taralynn wants much more than just friends with Shawn, but he just won't give in and making her feel like he doesn't want her as anything more than a friend. However, Shawn does want Taralynn he just doesn't think he is good enough for her. STOP RIGHT THERE....this is where I wanted to strangle him. Like reach into the book and strangle him. I really loved Shawn from the get go although there were many points I wanted to not just strangle him, but throttle him as well. This book had me hot one minute, mad the next, and bawling my eyes out next. Ms. Henderson has a way of pulling you in and holding on so tight. I truly felt like I didn't breathe until the very end. It was a rollercoaster of emotions. I recommend this book and any book this author publishes. She is one of my MUST READS!!! A copy was gifted in exchange for an honest review.

"Love Burns is book two in the  Caged Love series.  It can not be read as a standalone, you must read Love Hurts first.  Love Burns picks up where Love Hurts left off.I was pulled right into this book and it kept me glued to it the whole time.  The beginning starts off with a bang.Andrew is back and things about him are not actually what I thought they were.  It seems like Frankie didn't know everything that was going on with Andrew either.  Deacon is a fighter and a fierce protector.  When Frankie is faced with danger he goes into protector mode.There is a lot more action and suspense in this one. Of course there are some great steamy scenes with Deacon and Frankie.  Love Burns is a great read.A copy was received for a review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ1YECGM5ZXRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015M5L9A2#wasThisHelpful","RJ1YECGM5ZXRW","A1QDU32SAI8LO2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QDU32SAI8LO2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Saw ""The Martian"" a week ago - loved it.  Received the soundtrack today, played the Score on Disc 2 by Harry Gregson-Williams on my 5.1 system. Totally immersive.  It sounds awesome and takes me mentally back to the sense of awe when I saw the movie.  My favorite track is #3 ""Making Water"" but each song of the score is shines in it's own way.  A mix or organic and electronic sounds:  orchestra  combined at times with sequenced / arpeggiated analog synths with delay.  Digital synths.  Obscure instruments.  Sometimes I think I  hear Tibetan prayer bowl on some of the ethereal scenes.  This is in the same realm to me as ""Valley In The Clouds"" by David Arkenstone as far it's ability to evoke space and mystery.  As for Disc #1, the one that has all the pop Abba, Donna Summers, disco, etc.?  I'll probably play it occasionally for grins and giggles.  It was funny in the movie theater to see Matt Damon rocking out to Hot Stuff in the middle of nowhere.  I already own the Bowie track (""Starman"" from Ziggy Stardust) but I'm glad a new generation gets to hear it.TECHNO INFO FOR THE GEEKS (Skip if you want):  Audio quality is excellent for a conventional 16bit 44.1 ""Red Book"" audio CD.  Good dynamic range.  Smooth, un-harsh.  The audio peaks are not clipped or compressed.  It can give you stereo a really good workout.  You'll want to turn it up.SUMMARY:  I love it.  This will tide me over and put me inside the movie until the Blu-Ray is released in (supposedly) Jan 2016.  Maybe by then I'll be living inside the score!  I think the score disc will be something that holds my interest over time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPA1RBI19IGH2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01604Z00O#wasThisHelpful","RPA1RBI19IGH2","A95A9XOSHTQKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A95A9XOSHTQKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's BIG.  I wanted a dress watch and bought this from Amazon online.  I'm not tiny by any means.  5ft 11, a fair amount of pounds on me.  My shirts are XL to XXL, broad shoulders, large hands, etc.  The dial diameter on this watch is still ** almost ** too big for my wrist.  I'm keeping it, it works, but I would caution those who have medium to smaller builds/ wrists that this watch may look out of proportion on you.  I'm going to have 1 link taken out of the band.  It would be nice if they had something(s) next to the watch to give a sense of scale.  All that being said, it's eye catching and seems to be well made.  It came packed in a nice case with a micro size padded ""pillow"" to wrap the watch around.  For 60 bucks I will keep it.  So far, I can't speak to it's accuracy.  HISTORY WITH PREVIOUS ARMITRON DRESS WATCH:  My last Armitron Men's dress watch ( a sort of Rolex Oyster blue dial knock off) did and (even now)  still does keep good time.  However, the band clasp failed after 2 years use and the * correct * band that goes with that model costs 2/3 of a new watch ($39.95).  My previous Armitron to that (divers watch with all stainless case, blue dial) lasted 3 or so years.  My opinion:  Armitrons are a compromise, you get a decent looking watch that will probably cost you 1/2 to a 1/3 of a Seiko and last you about 3 years of constant use.  In the case of this watch, if your usage pattern is:  occasional use, night on the town, ""bling"" watch, that spends most of it's time in a drawer except for every other friday... it might last you 10 years (with the required battery changes of course.)  Most definitely this is NOT the watch to wear for everyday rough trade / carpentry, work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UU400J6R2UY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L3VGTXW#wasThisHelpful","R1UU400J6R2UY5","A95A9XOSHTQKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A95A9XOSHTQKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my boot / OS System C drive for my new PC build. It's very fast, I have a very short boot time to Windows 10 login screen. Rock Solid performance. No waiting, no freezes, no blue screens. Other components for reference: MSI Gaming 7 motherboard, 32GB DDR3 RAM, Core i7-4790 CPU.P.S. After a week of using this ""as is"" (which was damn good by itself), I downloaded a trialware copy of a RAM drive software (there are a lot of these on the Net, mine has perfect in the name) and created a 2 GB RAM drive. This slowed down the boot up a bit IF you are doing a true, full reboot. In exchange though, it made my PC even faster overall and I believe it reduces some of the wear leveling stress on the drive (i.e. improves reliability a bit). PC is now ridiculously fast. I've never had it so good. P.S. except for completing patching or certain new program installs, rarely (in my case) is a full reboot needed. So...

"I installed WD Black 3TB as my data drive on a new PC build (modern MSI mobo [Gaming 7] with fast Intel CPU).  This WD 3TB drive is not my boot drive.

I then imported (transferred) around 1TB total data from an external Mediasonic USB 3.0 enclosure that had a 7200 rpm Toshiba drive in it.

"This worked GREAT.  I am so pleased.  I was doing a brand new PC build, my Thermaltake Chasar A41 ATX case has toolless drive bay ""inserts"" or ""slideout"" units.STEPS:1.  I first attached my Samsung 2.5"" SSD drive onto the connector of this Sabrent template/frame device. (You slide the drive a half inch onto the Sabrent card connector, slight pressure needed, no drama).2.  I snapped the Sabrent template/frame into my Thermaltake drive bay slideout unit and then...3.  I snapped the drive bay slideout unit that now contains the Sabrent template/frame & SSD drive into my ATX case.4.  VOILA!I was ready to cable up in less than 2 minutes start to finish and some of that was just briefly looking things over.  I've never had a drive install this easy in the 19 or so years I've been building computers.CAVEAT:  Now, half of that ease-of-use depended on the engineering of my particular case design.  If you had an older school case, you will probably have to get out the screw driver and deal with screws.  Those will tool-less cases will be in heaven.I do like that this Sabrent template/frame presents an interface right to the edge of of a 3.5"" format.

"I found these to be high quality stereo audio cables.  The connectors have a snug but workable fit.  The 1.5 ft length IN REALITY (when it arrives and you are actually going to use it) is shorter than you'd actually think, a bit restrictive.  For my purposes it was ""just enough"" to work with.  If you are trying to eliminate clutter (and yeah I was) and your audio components are right on top of each other, this length will work.

"I bought this specifically for Moonlight Drive which was not included on my 2 Disc Doors Greatest Hits compilation (a crime!)  While I can appreciate Horse Latitudes (Song #5) as intense method acting of poetry, I can't listen to it for pleasure.  The Doors did have a lot of guts though and they believed in what they were doing.  As far as the technical audio quality on this Elektra/Rhino/DMC release with 2007 copyright, its quite good!  i.e. especially for what looks at first glance to be a ""plain jane"" commercial Red-book audio CD release costing $7.99.  Very clear sound, yet the upper midrange has none of that digital harshness I normally associate with CDs.  Lots of air, soundstage and ambience.  No ""Loudness Wars"" here.  (i.e. this disc is very well mastered, it does NOT have it's dynamic range severely compressed). Quite refreshing in that regard. I believe that ""People Are Strange"" and ""Love Me Two Times""  from this disc sound way clearer than the same songs from my 2 CD Doors compilation (purchased probably 15 years earlier).THE BONUS STUFF:  As a bonus you get Take 3 of People Are Strange and also Love Me Two Times.  The People bonus track has a long studio banter and a bunch of false starts, not a complete song.  It's interesting to hear the creative process but most won't want to hear that repeatedly.  On the other hand the Take 3 of Love Me Two Times is a full song.  It's pretty darn close to the final cut we all know and love.  I prefer the final version of LMTT though, I think the vocals are recorded better but the bonus take is no slouch.BOOKLET, PACKAGING & OVERALL QUALITY EXPERIENCE:  The 20 pages (back to back) booklet is very well done. It contains cool/interesting photos, lyrics to all songs, and background on the album recording sessions.  Some good stories in there.  There's a cool sepia toned photo of the band underneath where the disc is seated.  You can tell that that a lot of loving care was lavished on this CD release.  Comments on page 2 of the CD booklet from Ray Manzarek imply this audio is taken from the original master tape.  I believe it, it sounds so good.  I love the sound of the snare on this album, the overall ambience.  The original engineer (Bruce Botnick) did this ""40th Anniversary Mix"".  It's not just a cash cow or an afterthought. It's a labor of love.  I admire the heck out of Ray and Co. for seeing to it that the band's legacy is preserved this way.In short  --->  You are getting a lot for $8.00, this is a good deal.  A quality experience.  I can recommend it.The disc I purchased has a UPC of 081227999841.P.S.  For those who remember the Doors ""13"" vinyl LP back in the day, that was my first wider exposure to their catalog.  I loved the sequencing of the songs on that compilation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVSRX0S64EFEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MCIBAW#wasThisHelpful","RVSRX0S64EFEL","A95A9XOSHTQKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A95A9XOSHTQKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Initial review.  Just received these today, 9 days after I placed my order. The discs literally shipped from the city of Hamamatsu in Shizuoka prefecture, Japan.  Arrived in perfect physical condition, undamaged.  They have both Kanji and English text on the case.  Note:  Nothing on the package specifically states in English ""Made In Japan"".You are not getting a manufactured by Sony product.I ran DVD Identifier, it's a Ritek.  If you Google for Ritek Blu-Ray reliability, the reviews are not good.  There are reports of discs deteriorating after 1, to 1.5 years.  Note:  It's very hard to find perfect, long term archival Blu-Ray discs.  I am going to look at Blu-Rays as one part of my backup strategy, alongside pen drives and magnetic spinning hard drives.

"Rough ride on initial install.  I have purchased many video cards (AMD & nVidia) for many system builds over the years.  I bought this card to add to my new Windows 10 PC build (Intel i7-4790, MSI Gaming 7 motherboard, 32GB RAM, brand new, totally current hardware).  I had an older AMD card that worked fine but I wanted to have any performance edge that could be obtained without generating extra noise.  I can say that this card is - so far - totally silent.  I'm not a gamer by the way, primary purpose of PC is general surfing, some hi-def movies, and work from home (business).After disinstalling AMD drivers and Catalyst, setting restore point, rebooting,I find out I had to find very specific Win10 drivers that were only 2 weeks old  355.80-desktop-win10-64bit-international.hf.  I install them and find that, right after the desktop loads, there's this hesitation and settle down period where my mouse wont respond, screens don't totally respond.  This is subtle in some ways, you don't usually see an hourglass (or circle going around in this case).I have had to replug my mouse, etc.  I have the latest nVidia driver for Win10 64bit.The everyday display quality / contrast, sharpness, etc seems a bit lackluster.  Don't know why.  Quite honestly my older AMD 6670 card or my nVidia GT430 card - either one of them seemed to have more snap or clarity than this card.  I could swear that general latency (from mouse click to screen or video delivered) is lacking compared to my old video card.I find the Strix will run 1080p YouTube videos no problem.  No dropped frames.  The video quality seems a bit ....subdued.This may be an interrupt issue or an initial driver release issue.  It works, it's just not the improvement I thought I was going to get.Maybe if I get some sleep and come back to this it wont seem so bad.  I may move card to one of my other PCI 3.0 slots this weekend to see if (again just speculating) if it's a card slot/ interrupts, resources issue.  I was somehow expecting less hassles and a sharper snappier picture for $170 over my old videocard.  The jury is out on this.  I will check back later with more info.UPDATE:  9/05/2015  Things are a bit better.  1.  I have 3 PCI express 3.0 slots, moved card from the top slot to the middle slot.  Peformance seems snappier, less ""settling"" when changing screens, etc.  2.  I upgraded from my older 500Watt Seasonic power supply to a Cyonic 650 watt modular PSU (Seasonic sourced/rebadged PSU).  Probably overkill but that was part of this last change I just made.  I still feel/experience on a body intuition/egonomic level the text readability / legibility / ease-on-the-eyes of my older AMD 5970 card was sharper than this nVidia card.  Obviously that older AMD card would not have a prayer of matching the video/multimedia/gaming rendering performance of this card but a lot of my usage scenario is looking at text.  I will run through the clear text settings - again - to see if I get any improvement.  At this point: yeah it works...now after putting me through some changes, I am keeping it.  Will report back later with longer term usage report.  P.S.  My monitor on this box is a Viewsonic VA2431wm which I have had for a couple years and have loved.  Set to 1080p using DVI connector.UPDATE 9/19:  Working good, this videocard is silent for the purposes I use it for.  I suppose if I did gaming the fans would spin up enough to be noticable but for now dead quiet.UPDATE 9/27:  It works fine now, no hassles, just a rough start due Win 10 being newly released for general retail sale at the time I purchased this card.

I paired this with a Samsung 850 Pro SSD (OS / boot drive), WD Black 3TB 7200 rpm hard drive, Intel Core i7-4790 running stock,  Noctua cooler Noctua Premium Quality Quiet CPU Cooler for Intel 1150 Socket NH-U9S,32 GB of GSkill ARES DDR3 2400 RAM, 550 Watt Seasonic power supply. It's screaming fast.  I am spoiled. I can have many multimedia windows open and nothing stutters or breaks a sweat (CPU hovers at 50 degrees C , 122 degrees F)  My rig is near silent.  The BIOS is very posh... the graphics, navigation, etc.  I have never had so much information, setting choices (and decent EXPLANATIONS regarding setting choices) BUT!  --> You are ** not **  forced to use all that info it you don't want it.  Just set the time, take the defaults.  It's all good.For Overclockers and those who want to fuss with settings:  You ** could ** spend most of your adult life manually tweaking the plethora of RAM and CPU parameters here.  I can't be bothered with that, but it's certainly there for those who want it.OTHER COOL THINGS:  The slot spacings are wide enough you are unlikely to have component spacing conflicts.  There are dual LED hexadecimal readouts that give you codes you can look up to see why something might not be working.  Aside from the excellent functionality, did I mention that it looks flat out great?MSI gives you two USB 2.0, six USB 3.0 and 2 (two) USB 3.1 jacks, so..those who can't afford a USB hub to begin with have a generous supply of USB ports to work with .  The 3.1 jacks were a deciding factor to me - future proofing without taking up a card slot.It has an M2 socket but I passed on that.  If you use the MD2 socket, it will eat up Sata connectors 7 and 8.There is a single PS2 connector that supposedly can be used for either Keyboard or mouse.  (Yes PS2 is ancient but some people have beautiful PS2 input hardware they don't want to part with just yet.).I didn't bother with the onboard video but you are given a lot of connectors for that.  For audio, I'm using an external DAC but, if I wasn't, the Realtek sound chips have gotten so good that it wouldnt be a bad solution.The built in Ethernet networking (NIC) is the ""Killer"" (brand) licensed hardware.  I don't game anymore really so I can't speak to if it's any faster than an Intel NIC but it certainly delivers solid, zippy performance.I declare this board a winner.  I didn't buy it here at Amazon but I can certainly recommend it.ADDENDUM:  I got some RAM DISK software and created a 2GB RAM BOOT DISK.  You have to wait a bit for the boot to happen but Gads!  the surfing is blazing fast now.  Very please with how things turned out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPZ08OQVI3PBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UN7ARW6#wasThisHelpful","RPZ08OQVI3PBD","A95A9XOSHTQKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A95A9XOSHTQKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It works!  We recently bought a Samsung Blu-Ray player as a gift for my son-in-law and his sweetie.  Their flat screen had so-so built-in speakers and their old skool receiver had no HDMI inputs, just stereo RCA analog audio inputs.  I purchased this unit and ALSO purchased this cable C2G / Cables To Go 29115 Velocity S/PDIF Digital Audio Coax Cable (6 Feet) .  When we hooked it up it immediately worked.  Audio content from movies sounds good, clear.  Sound is in sync with the picture.  Now their setup has some real bass and oomph.  This will be a solution for them until they can afford a modern 7.1 surround receiver/speaker setup.Note:  We went into the Blu-Ray player's audio settings and confirmed that PCM was set as the default.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -CAVEATS, TECHNICAL ADVICE:Caveat 1:  This only produces stereo output (Left and Right analog audio jacks).  In the setting of your Blu-Ray player:  You ** have ** to use PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) output setting if you want this to work right  -- it specifies that right on the box.  Now, some people may have an older receiver that would have a feature to synthesize surround for a 5.1 system but usually, if you have that feature available to you, then one would ""tend to"" also have HDMI inputs on their receiver.  If you have HDMI inputs on your audio receiver... why bother?  This is a work around for those who don't.  IF your receiver has HDMI inputs, the high likelihood is that you don't need this.  IF your receiver has HDMI inputs and you aren't getting audio output 1. Check your settings and the sequence in which you turn components on  (I find that turning on my plasma TV before turning on my receiver works better).  2.  You might need to find an HDMI cable that specifies it has ""audio return"".All that being said, if you need this kind of workaround solution to deliver an analog feed an older sound system, then  ---> running your Blu-Ray player's sound output through a decent stereo's analog inputs using this interface conversion box beats the pants off using the the wimpy speakers in most TVs.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Caveat 2:  OREI DOES ** NOT ** GIVE YOU A NON-OPTICAL (i.e. copper wire) CABLE ...which I believe will be the solution most people actually want.  YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE ONE SEPARATELY.  I strongly recommend buying a speficially ""Digital"" cable, labeled as being meant for SPDIF (Sony/Panasonic Digital Interface) like in the link I mentioned above - they run 5 - 10 dollars.  If you try using a conventional RCA analog audio cable the digital signal may corrupt or the sound could stutter, especially over longer cable lengths.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Caveat 3:  I suppose there may be some Blu-Ray players out there that, for cost cutting purposes, have omitted the SPDIF connector that looks like a single RCA jack.  In which case this product would not be a solution you could use.Final note:  This unit also comes with an optical connector interface and a probably 3 ft optical cable.  I did not use that feature or test it so cannot speak to how well it works.  You * could * run the blu-ray player's HDMI cable to your flat screen and then, IF it had an optical out, use the supplied optical cable to this OREI box and then run RCA analog cables to your stereo.  The big unknown is:  Will the audio output ""lag"" or stay in sync with your TV?  Sometimes you can set video / sound delay in your TV.  You'd just have to test.  Again, if your receiver has HDMI built in, there is usually no need to use this kind of product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BVSRX915E1HO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008EPW7TA#wasThisHelpful","R3BVSRX915E1HO","A95A9XOSHTQKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A95A9XOSHTQKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Clean Win 10 Pro install on a blazing fast PC, runs smoothly, quickly, I'm coming to like it more and more.It was time to completely rebuild one of my PCs that had very old hardware and Win 7.  I had choices.  Did not want to cling to Win 7.  I wanted the known performance improvements to the network stack, WDDM, etc that came along with Win 8.X without it's known UI aggravations.  I made a conscious decision to purchase Win 10 Pro.At first I hated the tiles until I learned how to customize them and also create my own.  Runs very smooth and fast on Intel i7-4790K 16Gig RAM , Samsung 850 Pro SSD setup.  No real complaints here.  I have yet to get a blue screen, no OS crashes.  I did choose ""Custom"" install option and opted out of all the nosy nelly information sharing settings with Microsoft.  I have no doubt that some remain.  C'est L'vie.  I have read that people doing an upgrade install instead of a ""clean"" (fresh) install can supposedly have slow boot issues.  I guess I'll find out when I take the free upgrade offered on my other two older PCs.One review I just read said it about right:  ""Look at it as Windows 7.5 and you wont be disappointed.""P.S. Note: Some perpective:  I avoided Windows 8.X like the plague as I hated the interface.  The interface for Win 10 I can work with.Trouble in Paradise?  I noticed tonight that while Windows Media Player 12 that comes with Windows 10 allows for ripping files to FLAC,etc., I cannot seem to RIP the songs of my legally purchased Doors ""Strange Days"" album to my hard drive for my music server.

"My downstairs PC was a very old 2.6Ghz 4GB Core2 Duo circa 2008 that I upgraded piecemeal at times (Win7, more drives, etc).  I realized it's performance was holding me back and I had done the frugal ""get your value out of an older device"" thing long enough.  I looked at all the current options, including Skylake and X99 40 lane mothboard / chip combos.  I finally settled on this, MSI extreme 7, Samsung EVO 850 Pro SSD, 16gig Gskill RAM and Noctua CPU fan Noctua Premium Quality Quiet CPU Cooler for Intel LGA 2011,1156,1155,1150 and AMD AM2/AM2+/AM3/3+,FM1/2 Sockets NH-U9S.  Boy am I glad I did!  It's just NIGHT and DAY faster than my old system.  Nothing crashes anymore, I have simply thrown a battleship's worth of resources at the problem and hey IT WORKS.  Surfing, telecommuting no longer has any lag.  The thing resumes from sleep in less than 2 seconds.P.S.  it's running just fine with an older Seasonic 550 watt power supply.  I am using a modest, older AMD video card (6670)  as gaming is not my focus.  My CPU temperature hovers at 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) when just surfing but multiple windows open.

"Upon initial purchase, I was not impressed.  Reason:  I have large hands and found myself wishing this keyboard was inflated in overall size (except height) by 1 or maybe 2 percent.  I don't like the gritty feel of the tops of the keys.  It's like fingernails on the blackboard to me.  Mind you most will say the ""grit"" is a subtle texturing but it instinctively irritates me.Understand that I LOVED my older Microsoft ergonomic keyboard.  I thought it was ergonomically perfect.  Smooth key tops, everything instinctively in the right place - no mistyping as far as reach and finger placement goes.  It's only failing was that it had a PS2 connector.This Perixx, it's hard to put into words but I don't have a solidity / confidence / certainty when I type.  I'm making adjustments, the tips of my fingers at rest ""notice"" that they are touching the sides of the next row of keys.I may send this back.  I also ordered a Microsoft 4000 ergonomic keyboard - it's on it's way.  I'm told the MS keyboards have kind of devolved into mediocrity.  We will see.  If the MS 4000 beats this in any way, this is going back or being relegated to a backup.Maybe people with smaller hands who like the gritty feel of the keys will like this.  I can't fault the overall feature count, just the feel.  It ""looks"" good.  I simply can't recommend it.P.S.  Point of reference regarding my hand size:  I wear a size 11.5 - 12 ring on my ring finger and can, with a slight stretch, reach a 10th interval on a real Yamaha or Steinway piano.UPDATE 8/28/2015:  BIZARRE BUT TRUE:  Ergonomics on this keyboard got much better for me once I put a 3/4"" thick piece of wood that is 3 inches wide under the front part of the keyboard.  This piece of wood is probably 16 - 18 inches long.  Long enough to have an inch of extra wood showing on either side of the keyboard.  It makes sense in a way - there have been other ergonomic keyboards with detachable front spacer/elevator components.UPDATE 9-01-2015  I'm raising this from 2 stars 4 stars since my ""fix"" works - put something (a small board?, piece of plastic, etc. ) that is of size:  3/4"" thick X 18"" long X 3"" wide under the front edge of this.  It's may be a funky fix but it transformed the ergonomics for me.  Your mileage may drastically vary.  I just know it changed this keyboard from a loser to a winner for me.  The one star taken off is for me having to come up with this fix.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HP0JWI88LX8N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0076KUTKS#wasThisHelpful","R3HP0JWI88LX8N","A95A9XOSHTQKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A95A9XOSHTQKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was looking for ATX cases that still have front 5.25"" bays --- that still had some kind of styling.  They are getting hard to find.  With bluetooth, MP3s, etc, there is less demand for optical drives.  Me, I want those front bays to put in a Blu-Ray/DVD burner (yes I still burn discs), possibly a fan controller, or multi-slot card reader, etc.I order this, it shows up and it's very easy to look at, well styled.THE GOOD:*  This case has GREAT CABLE MANAGEMENT as it gives you a section partitioned off behind the motherboard with multiple pass-through grommets to feed cables in such a way that they don't interfere with airflow or look unsightly.*  The TOOL-LESS SLIDE OUT BRACKETS FOR HARD DRIVES - WORK GREAT.  Very smart idea to position them 90 degrees perpendicular to the case itself.  VERY easy to work with.* Ditto the tool-less slide out brackets for the front 5.25 bays.*  I like that they have made it so you cannot lose the 4 back-of-case screws as they have retainers.*  It has a TON of top ventilation.  Big surface area.*  It has 3 built-in fans.  I will probably never use all of them.  Gamers or people in hot climates with no AC might care though.  The fans all use 3 pin connectors.  If your particular motherboard only supports PWM type 4 pin connectors, you'll need to purchase Molex-to-3 pin adapters or buy a fan controller / adapter cable or, if it really means that much to you, physically swap out the fans.  Again, Joe Average business user, occasional light gamer wont care.  For serious gamers the factory parts are just a starting point.  I'm not in that world.  I just needed a zippy, good looking, easy to maintain business / surfing PC case and this totally fits my needs.You know how you have some cases you dread opening?  This is not one of those.*  The metal the case is constructed of is medium thickness, decent, sufficient.  The paint job is good.  The switches and connectors seem to work fine. I have had previous cases that were beefy tanks (and weighed like tanks) and I've also had the elCheapo 25 dollar project cases that I could almost bend with 2 fingers and cut myself on.  This case is neither.  It strikes the right note of quality and heft.  I have not cut myself on anything with this case.*  It looks damn good.  I didn't purchase the case because of the side window feature but I do think it's pleasing to look at just the same.TIP:  For installing my 2.5"" Samsung Evo 850 Pro boot drive, I used this Sabrent adapter (purchased separately) http://www.amazon.com/Sabrent-Desktop-Converter-Mounting-BK-PCBS/dp/B00UN550AC/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1440552776&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=sabrent+2.5+to+3.5+inches+internal+hard+disk+drive+mounting+kit+bk-hddh  and it was effortless.The BAD:  If you want extreme sound deadening to muffle 5 screaming noisy drives and a zillion fans and dual high end video cards, well.. I don't see this case as any kind of heavy sound suppression enclosure.  If you buy SSD drives or non-Enterprise regular HDDs and keep your hardware count low, this should not be a big deal.  Right now I have a Noctua fan on a Core i7-4790 4.0 CPU and the PC is completely inaudible.  When I eventually add in the TWO (2) Western Digital 3TB Black drives I bought to run Raid 0 + 1, then yeah, I expect to hear sound from this case.  I don't think it's going to be that bad though.  Note:  I just use an older, low power consumption AMD card at this time (6670) - I don't even think it has a fan -- so that figures into my review and usage scenario regarding noise.*  I have read that the built-in top / front panel USB ports are ""only"" USB 2.0  This is not a big deal to me.  I'm going to buy a USB 3.0 /3.1 front bay or hub anyway...but this might be a big deal to you.  YMMV.SUMMARY:  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  It's a winner!P.S.  I also own the Snow (white with black and blue trim) version of this Chaser A41 case from another outfit.  It looks really cool.  It functions exactly the same as the black one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWP2SKY9S03T8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUX8NVE#wasThisHelpful","RWP2SKY9S03T8","A95A9XOSHTQKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A95A9XOSHTQKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My original Qwest Zyxel 1000 (?) VDSL2 router was starting to cut out every few days.  I work from home and things ** HAVE **  to work. The Zyxel modem died in the middle of my weekday telecommute / work from-home day.MY UNIT PURCHASED MID-AUGUST 2015:  I bought this Actiontec at a local big box store that has those initials: BB.----->  SETUP WAS EXTREMELY LOW HASSLE!!! and IMMEDIATE. It was glorious!!  <-----After swapping out the old router hardware for the Actiontec, the minute I pulled up my Firefox browser, it immediately brought up the Century Link install wizard!  I don't even recall entering in the numeric IP address.  I was then prompted with maybe 7 screens asking me very short, intelligent questions.  All it really needed from me was my email and account number (or phone number)---->  I ZOOMED through to having good connectivity again in less than 3 - 4 minutes!!!  <-----At no point was I prompted to put a disk into my computer or download anything.In this day and age of overcomplication this is astounding to me!  The total and I mean TOTAL, lack of hassle was an unexpected Godsend.I never had to call Century Link.  The router's built-in software did offer a chat line, phone number, etc. but I didn't need it.SO...I * admit *  I know nothing about the longevity of this device and yeah I'm on the smitten ""honeymoon"" with it.CAVEAT:  I CAN'T SPEAK TO WI-FI CAPABILITIES EITHER WAY ON THIS UNIT:One caveat regarding my review:  I cannot speak to Wi-Fi quality and range as frankly I don't really use it.  I just need solid, functioning, work-from-home desktop Ethernet bandwidth with NO hassles and so far I'm impressed.Even if these boxes were to only last a year, for business purposes it's worth it to keep me on hand if it saves me an hour or two in phone calls, troubleshooting, cussing,  tweaking etc.  Your needs and expectations may differ from mine in that regard.  I've learned that I'm not above throwing money at a solution (within reason) as I place a value on my time and aggravation.  Ask me down the road when I'm retired and this mindset will reverse of course.SUMMARY:  If you have Century Link and you hate hassles and need your DSL modem replaced BUY THIS THING!  You don't need to dread the swap-out process, they make it extremely easy to get running again.P.S.

"Spartan elegance and high value in a small package!MY JOURNEY:  I have a sound system for my back deck (hot tub / barbeque area) that is kept in a weather proof outdoor enclosure under the eave...like this:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E9DPDQ?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage*  That sound system had a DIFFERENT BRAND of amp (which shall remain nameless), an awful amplifier designed for marine use. That ""other"" amp sucked, no high frequencies, flabby bass, etc.  I was determined to get rid of it.*  For my needs, I have primarily analog inputs (high quality separate FM tuner and a blu-ray / CD player.  I was set on finding a 50 Watt per channel RMS into 8ohms high quality mini amp and a mini 4 channel mixer (occasionally relatives come over with their iPOD for parties).  After going through 2 defective mini-mixers and trying a mini-PA amp, I started re thinking my needs.  I only really needed 3 inputs.  Much as I didn't want to give up tone controls and wanted more power, I took a chance on this amp.THE GOOD:>  It's well built, looks cool.>  Gold plated NICE, STURDY speaker posts that I believe accept banana plug aside from regular wire.  The two inputs are ""always on"" (i.e. ready for input).>  STEREO PRE-AMP OUTPUT that tracks the gain knob (for future expansion).>  USB input that goes to internal Burr-Brown DAC (which I've yet to test).>  22 Watt AB class amp (8 ohms) that sounds great>  Headphone output which mutes the speakers (for if I want to read on our back deck at night using headphones without disturbing neighbors.THE ""sorta"" BAD>  No tone controls>  Only 22 watts per channel (8 ohms)>  I have to run the volume at 80 - 90% to rock out, but it's fine for moderate/background levels at 1 o'clock position - WITH INEFFICIENT SPEAKERS!>  Not recommended for people wanting CONTINUOUS UBER HIGH Sound Pressure Levels with visceral deep bass,  i.e. certain metalheads and rap / electronica lovers.  If you want it loud enough to feel in your gut all the time you'll probably want to look elsewhere.  I'm guessing you would either be frustrated with this amp or you might roast it trying to drive large (12"" or over) heavy magnet speakers that could drop into low impedance ranges.  Now, with smart planning (and additional expense), you COULD use this as the front end for a beefier system using the speakers from this as your ""fill"" - just make sure that the downstream ""Mack truck"" system has it's own, separately manageable, gain controls and EQ so you can balance what takes the beating in your system.WELL GUESS WHAT?>  This 22 watt per ch. amp produces ample volume for my purposes with inefficient 6.5"" two-way (outdoor, made to look a ""rock"" cabinet) speakers (Sensitivity 86db).  [Test music examples:  Crowded House - ""Farewell TTW"" Live, Pink Floyd ""Dark Side"", ABWH - 1st album]>  The amp has a ""mellow"", rounded audiophile sound with good soundstage - the highs are certainly there, every so slightly recessed but IT DOES NOT CUT MY EARS TO PIECES.>  No hiss that I can find. I feel it will improve with ""burn in"" (most solid state electronics improve or settle into a final sound after 40 - 100 hours of use.  I have repeatedly found this to be true over the years).OTHER GOOD NEWS:>  My other worry was about quality control.  AudioEngine must have seen the older forum complaints from various about the volume knob feeling unsmooth, scratchy/cheap because the unit I received DOES NOT have that problem.  The travel of my volume knob rotation is very smooth and it's * NOT * ""cockeyed"" in any way.>  For large get-togethers, I augment my system by sending the Line Out to a large boombox I have which doubles my bass radiating area - the sum total of the two systems is provides very satisfying coverage on an 18 X 22 foot deck.>  The smoothness of this system is less likely to offend my neighbors.  (Some of perceived annoyance is distortion - aside from unawareness and bad manners, which I do not practice.  It amazes me how many people brag online about being able to offend their neighbors with their stereo.  For the 3 or 4 parties a year I have, they are made aware of in advance and I encourage them to contact me - good relations).>  TIP:  YOU COULD INCREASE ""OOMPH"" (VOLUME OUTPUT) BY CHOOSING SPEAKERS with 92 db or higher sensitivity.>  With my Sony dynamic headphones, it blasts my ears off.  No problems there.WHY I CHOSE THIS:SIMPLICITY:>  It seems odd, but you'd be surprised at how the simplicity of the ""one knob"" (and no input switch choice decision to make) is appreciated on a visceral level.  It's like my old Corolla:  I JUST TURN THE DAMN THING ON AND IT WORKS!  No Decisions.  High Quality sound.  In this complicated world, I love it.I have 3 other stereos that all involve choosing settings (Dolby or DTS, surround ambience, crossover cutoff, input choices.)  None of that here.  Whew.  What an oddly freeing experience!  Especially for my back deck chill-out system.BUYING A NAME WITH A REAL SUPPORT NETWORK:I seriously considered buying one of the TriPath 80 watt per ch. amplifiers for $200.00.  I think they are probably great in most cases.  What swayed my decision:  After problems with 3 different previous attempted hardware solutions, (new Rolls or used eBay purchase Furman mixer, used mini-PA amp), support became a crucial issue for me rather than an afterthought.I CAN ACTUALLY -->  FIND <--  THIS VENDOR AND GET SUPPORT IF THERE'S A PROBLEM.  I don't have to ship this to China or try and hunt down a support network.  And yes this is probably made in China like everything else these days.  Once you experience aggravation, the idea of a support network and customer service moves up to become 30% of one’s purchase decision.Now, down the road, I may buy 2 more speakers and take a chance and try purchasing a Lepai type amp to drive a 2nd set of speakers off the Line Out.  For now, this is the ""anchor"" of my future system and I am quite happy with what I have.-->  THE MORAL HERE:  >  Once I let go of my obsession with wanting a tone controls and high wattage, I found this exactly fills the bill for this purpose:  high quality casual listening system.  >  The amp itself sounds so good YOU DON'T NEED TONE CONTROLS if your source is high quality.  iPod users can use their internal software EQ to tweak things as a workaround.-->  SUMMARY:  VERY PLEASED!  Sage advice:  Just accept the simplicity my son!  Accept that you can simply turn something on without fiddling and it will fulfill your needs!  ahahaha.  I will report back on how it sounds after full burn-in later.**************************************************************************************************************ADDENDUM - HIGH QUALITY (Name Brand) ALTERNATIVES TO CONSIDER:Emotiva Mini-X - nearly same price, 1 less inputNAD D 3020  Rave reviews, over 2X as much money, 1 less inputPS Audio ""Sprout""  Rave reviews, 4X as much money 4 inputs_____________________________________________________________________________GENERIC SAFETY NOTE RE ** ANY ** OUTDOOR SYSTEM:  When in the hot tub, I manage my input devices (i.e. make radio station or CD track number choices) with their own, respective wireless remote controls.

"Very good rainshow emulation, good patterns, ergonomics, I'm pleased.OK I got three pack assortment of sprayers at a local Grocery Outlet on a super deal: $9.99.  The star of the show here is the Wand type nozzle which has IN USAGE very precise patterns that work better than other garden nozzles.  The ""shower"" is the closest yet to emulating a real rain shower.  The Jet throws water at least 25 feet.  All fo the patters are good on this.  I LOVE IT.  My wand has one minor, defect annoyance that I can live with  - the label does not match the actual spray patterns.  At the price I got it for, I'm not complaining.  The middle nozzle (ray gun looking one) like most of these, is sort of a forgettable freebie - OK for a car wash, not really for watering plants.  Finally, the short handled multisprayer is very good, just a stubby version of the wand sprayer.  HOWEVER, the wand sprayer, aside from being very comfortable in the hand and more aim-able has this COOL ROCKER SWITCH on it turn the water on and off and - if you are careful can even be a variable flow switch.  Knowing what I know now, I would have paid even the full $19.00 bucks that is being asked on Amazon.  I can recommend this kit, just forget the middle ""ray gun"" for anything precise and/or kind for garden watering.  Over and out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C2N5Y0XZ2RQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JSID46W#wasThisHelpful","R3C2N5Y0XZ2RQA","A95A9XOSHTQKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A95A9XOSHTQKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BACKGROUND:  I know Skechers is capable of making good shoes.  My significant other absolutely loves her Skechers Go-Walks.  I used to buy Skechers for my son growing up.  Skechers is supposed to be Nike's latest main competition.  My beloved New Balance 475 shoes were wearing out.  The replacement New Balance did not have the color or price that I wanted.  I tried finding an equivalent, ordered these.They run larger and half-step sizes are not offered at the top of the size range (normally a 13 works for me, these are oversized even for that) and I couldn't get a half-size in my size. ( Ideally what I needed from them, if they offered it, was Size 12.5.)  Worse is they seem to have no arch support.  Me adding inserts to take up slack and add additional support do not seem to help.  These shoes are extremely well padded on the heel but so much that it almost pushes my whole body posture into a lean forward type position - even if I'm just walking or standing still.  I have to compensate, it's awkward, not comfortable.SUMMARY:  I hate to say this but for my purposes, these are sloppy shoes, lacking support and agility.  Cosmetically they look ""OK"" but don't seem to have the quality of construction I have gotten used to with the New Balance shoes.  I will probably grudgingly wear these or obtain some better fitting / looking /construction shoes from another brand.  These Skechers will probably be relegated to gardening / dump run / painting type shoes.  I certainly wanted to like them.SAVING GRACE?  I could say that the only saving grace for these shoes is, IF you are a ""heel striker"" with wide feet and you have an extreme sensitivity to impact, these ** might ** be your ticket?  But as far as ""steering"" your feet and agility - forget it.  They are sloppy boats in that regard.  They are not mega expensive compared to what's out there in Nike, New Balance, etc.  I notice that lately the New Balance shoes that I would be interested in are around $80 - $85.00.  As usual, you get what you pay for.  It's possible there are other models of Skechers in a higher class of shoe design but this purchase has left me ambivalent about trying anything else from this manufacturer.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36TANH4L1RO13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOWBNOK#wasThisHelpful","R36TANH4L1RO13","A95A9XOSHTQKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A95A9XOSHTQKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Defective EQ out of the box, not impressed, sending back.THE GOOD:*  It has a gutsy gain structure, capable of decent output, did not hear any noise or hum.*  It's got a lot of features for this price point.*  The case is sturdy, all metal.*  The knobs and general hardware quality seem good.*  The input / output jacks on the backplane do not buckle when you attach plugs to them.*  The size and small footprint of this is attractive for certain set it and forget it audio type installs.THE BAD:CON1:*  My EQ circuit was broken - out of the box - for the Line 1 & 2 inputs.  It's a global EQ - i.e. it affects (or should affect) the 1st two Line inputs.  -  Treble EQ did absolutely nothing.  Zilch.  -  Bass EQ changes were so subtle as to be almost imaginary.  Something is wrong with a solder joint or tracing, etc somewhere.  In short:  There was certainly ***  NO ***  + or -  12DB of bass or treble happening with the particular unit I received.  (Yes, I double-checked the dip configuration switch for system setup)CON2:  While audio is I would say ""clean"" it is also kind of clinical / nondescript / perfunctory / forgettable.  There I said it.  One input on my Mackie VLZ1202 compared to this blows the doors off it.  I get spoiled by that.  Yes the Mackie costs almost 4X as much but they have the cheaper models now too.  I was looking for this form though as I didn't want an entire conventional mixer ""footprint"".BACKGROUND:  I own (and have owned) many many stereos, boomboxes, audio devices - more than probably the average person in their lifetime.  I currently have 3 stereos including a Mackie / Yamaha Professional power amp component type setup.  I used to do DJing and some live sound reinforcement/recording.  Have run ARP2600, hand soldered a knockoff of a Sequential Pro 1 (400 piece kit) long ago.  I'm unafraid of mixers, patchbays, DACs, impedence, EQ, etc.SUMMARY:  I probably got a bad one.  It happens.  I just know I'm not impressed with my time being wasted like this.  It's going back.  This may be fine for some.  Others report success with this.  If the EQ worked I probably would have kept it but still longed for something better sounding.  Will keep looking.P.S.  Shure makes a mixer very similar to this one except is costs 2X as much ($260.00).  The Shure unit has an internal power supply and probably works better (known Shure's reputation).  I myself have never heard it though.P.P.S.  Radio Design Labs and Furman are other manufacturers that make equipment somewhat in this design scope..","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FXKH482RXI3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026K3NFG#wasThisHelpful","R2FXKH482RXI3B","A95A9XOSHTQKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A95A9XOSHTQKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am using this on the older Windows 7 PC in my basement, circa 2006 motherboard, strictly USB and 16/44.1 WAV audio content at this point.  This DAC works fine, and to my ears is a cut above the ASROCK motherboard's built-in Realtek audio I had and some of the $30.00 basic soundcards I have owned.  It has good clarity and separation of instruments, bass is not bad for the price.  This is not a DAC that seems to emphasize bass.  It's enough, decent.  I wouldn't call it ""fat"", it's neutral.  Is this DAC a cut above the basic audio?  For my purposes yes.  Internal soundchips have come a long way since my ancient motherboard but this external DAC does get you away from noise and crackle issues.  I have ZERO noise and crackle issues, that some others here mention in their Topping reviews.  Why they have these issues , I can't say.  My USB cable is nothing fancy.  I've used headphones (open back, large diaphraghm dynamic headphones) with this, it drives them fine, sounds fine.  I have a good time, enjoy the music.POSSIBLE SHORTCOMINGS:  Design decisions get made for a price point.  I would say if you turn this up screaming loud with certain material for LONG periods of time, it might occasionally fail in the sense that you'd want it sweeter /warmer sounding.  But on most of my material , at moderate to lower volumes, its on the crystaline side of nice.  Or the nice side of crystaline/ detailed.  Mind you this is --> hair splitting <--- for the price, don't take this impression too far,  this is still quite a bargain for what it is.SIDE STUFF:  The actual fit and finish of the case and hardware parts are very good.  The action of the switches ""feel"" quality and the front panel looks cool.  I ""think"" the entire case and panels are made of metal.SUMMARY:  Do I long for something richer sounding?  To some minor degree.  There is a $700 DAC I would like but can't afford right now.  This DAC is good enough that, in the meantime, I'm quite happy listening to this.  Heck the DAC IC chip part cost alone (in this Topping) goes for $18.00 dollars.  I have yet to try this Topping DAC with 96/24 tracks so can't report on that.Much fun can be had with an inexpensive DAC and you can be using it NOW.  I have 3 entire home systems, can't afford to lavish a mega expensive DAC on all 3 of them.  I remember the occasions when I got each of them away from on-motherboard audio to an inexpensive separate DAC how much things improved.  I tend to forget that over time.  It would suck to go back to the old audio.  It's like peeling a veil off the sound and getting quicker transients.  My advice:  Find something that works for you and is affordable - don't look back.P.S.  If you are strictly looking for a DAC and don't care about the headphone output and extra inputs, something else to consider for a few dollars ($35.00) more:  HRT Music Streamer III  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K2436MI?colid=ALWE9DUPA0FK&coliid=I17MGWABWYE33T&ref_=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_ttl","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NA7T1MONTQC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006GJ2SK4#wasThisHelpful","R1NA7T1MONTQC5","A95A9XOSHTQKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A95A9XOSHTQKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good looking pitcher, holds a lot - infusion or notAt work they are giving us free fruit-infused water.  I got the bug and bought this pitcher and also two personal use sized infusion bottles (by Bevgo).  Yes the infusion stick works but as many pointed out, you don't have to buy a product with the special separator to get started making your own lightly flavored water, it just makes it easier to manage if you are doing a lot of refills.  We make lemon / cucumber and cucumber mint.  You don't need to go nuts with the amount of added fruit and I actually recommend against it - I want subtlety that makes the water un-boring without having it funk out later and get too intense.  A small lemon wedge and one sliced wheel of cucumber are enough for me.  If you were having a party or had a large family and expected to be refilling this 4X a day, I could see adding more fruit than that.In other news:  This makes a great pitcher for mixed frozen OJ.  You could mix 2 large cans of frozen OJ and it would probably all fit in here.I have not had any issues with the handle or with cracking that some report so far.  There is NO WAY I would put this in the dishwasher, forget it, that would be a recipe for problems.

"REVISED REVIEW:This drill is supremely well made and precise.  I used this recently to drill through a section of my house that had 4X4 lumber and layers of siding in two passes.  I started with a long 3/8"" Morse drill bit then switched to a Bosch 1"" spade bit.  It was smooth sailing using the the first bit and fearless on the 2nd.  I never heard the motor bog down. The chuck has no slop in it.  I like the forward handle, it's a great assist when you're trying to keep things even while standing on a ladder.  So...I have my cordless Ryobi's for small jobs.  My cheapo Kawasaki (Alltrade) for those jobs where I don't care to risk expensive hardware.  Then I have this Bosch drill when I need precision and ""can do"".  Highly recommended._________________________________________UPDATE on 8/10/14I don't want be alarmist but I would caution do-it-yourselfers who are buying their first drill and are elderly, frail, inexperienced and/or not prepared for the sheer ferocity of this machine.  Reason:  If the drill binds on something you are drilling and you are not prepared for it with strong steady hands -- using the supplied brace, the torque could possibly wrench your wrist back.Another thing I would mention - if you are thinking of using this drill for backing out screws or lag bolts (with a socket attachment). I tried it. Forget it. I found that it's too easy for the power curve on this to run away from me (i.e lose control). Use a battery powered drill / driver instead.  This is a Jaguar XKE of 3/8"" drills.  Yes it's variable speed but it is not meant for jobs or purposes when you want to ""hold back"".  I have accidentally bent a Bosch wood spade drill bit due to the bit binding (probably on an unseen nail) at an angle in some decking.  I have also stripped the threading on a Blu-Mol hole saw.  My point is:  when there's a conflict: the drill didn't give - everything else, the wood, the bits or the (possibly) operator is going to give.  Be physically fit, careful and thoughtful when driving this - it's more powerful than you'd imagine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DAAGCFVU9H80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004SUOI#wasThisHelpful","R1DAAGCFVU9H80","A95A9XOSHTQKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A95A9XOSHTQKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I have my large boombox and my tiny Sony elcheapo ($12.97) radio but....What do you do when you are in a hurry and want something VERY portable with a semblance of actual bass output?  This is it!  It has rich full sound for it's small size.  I'll go out on a limb and say it's almost compact hi-fi.PROS:>  The fact that it can play MP3s from a microSD card (they call it a TF card) is a bonus.  Up to 32GB capacity card and max. 9999 songs.>  It has a STEREO HEADPHONE output jack (3.5mm) and output even though the unit has mono speaker.>  RICH SOUND.  Don't worry about the ""mono"" speaker!!!  It's sound output is punchy and wonderously GREAT!!!>  It has a 3.5mm Audio In jack.  Meh... might be useful.>  Many options given to you for selecting channels:  You can do direct keypad entry, or let it auto-search or use a wheel (i.e. old skool) to search for stations.>  It stores stations.>  The charging ""guts"" are built in.  It uses a cell phone battery.  You can charge it via (USB from computer or USB from Wall plug - which they do not give you) and you can charge spare batteries.What else:  It has Shortwave (2 bands) which I haven't bothered to check out.  That might be nice in an emergency?CONS:*  This radio ""comes into it's own"" (sound performance-wise) when you turn it up to a level of ""5"" (where the marker line on the volume wheel is centered.  However, by that time it's so loud that you are not listening to this just for yourself.  You are (at that point) blasting to everyone in 25 - 30 feet.  At lower volumes you won't fully experience the entire bass and punch this radio's amplifier and built-in speaker can put out.  It's not bad at lower volumes, just more ""polite""/subdued.  Now, even at low volume levels you always have vocal clarify. The bass comes out when you turn it up.*  They give you a little plastic outrigger ""footie"" stand that plugs into the back of the unit in case you want to have radio sit on a table ""tilt facing"" you at a 45 degree angle.  This works, it's a nice idea,  but the little plastic outrigger piece can get easily lost.  Possible solution:  Keep it attached when not in use with a small dot of Velcro?*  You have to hold in the power button for a second or so to turn off the unit.  This is intentional because it also has a sleep timer integrated into the power button.  Once you get used to turning it off properly, this is no big deal.*  It's $40.00 bucks.  Which to some will seem like a lot for a tiny radio.  Wait till you fire it up though.OTHER things:  They give you a 1ft USB adapter.  They give you a short 3.5mm male plug -->  3.5mm male plug cable.  You get a hand strap.UNKNOWNS:I can't tell you about remote gain or distant selectivity / cloud skip / ""DXing"" etc.  I live in a large modern city and have my choice of 6 well spaced FM stations.  I'm not deprived of good stations where I live.  I  **  can  **  say that I have no cross talk, wavering, static or distortion when I tune in with this unit.  Just warm clear sound.OTHER INFO:*  You get a strap which they leave it to you whether to install it or not.*  This is really a ""Kaito"" brand (source manufacturer) device.*  There is a very similar version marketed with a model number of ""M8"" - I suggest not buying it as for the same price this unit has all the same features and includes the 2 ShortWave bands.  By choosing the S8, you are essentially getting the shortwave feature free.SUMMARY:  If you want a quality audio experience in a grab-and-go small package, I know of no other self-contained unit that sounds this good.HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDADDENDUM 6/29/14:  What I've realized is so cool about this radio/mp3 player is: unlike your big stereo where it ""takes over"" the room sonically, engulfs you and you almost ""have"" to listen to it - with the Meloson, it's more of an ""inviting choice: It can be a pleasant, steady companion you can appreciate while reading, hanging out, etc. yet it's good enough to dance to if you turn it up. (We found ourselves spontaneously dancing in the kitchen the other day to ""The Night Time is the Right Time (Ray Charles).  At first were merely listening to other songs, liked it, turned it up and voila...a micro party of sorts : )  This somehow never happens with the computer feed to our big stereo.  My best analogy is: You are not ""told"" to listen, you are invited to engage.  It may sound woo-woo but that's how we experience it. While the mp3 songs are not as searchable as an IPOD (just folder numbers and song numbers), I find myself more pleasantly surprised.  I will take this over an iPod anyday.ONE CAVEAT:  Be careful of which SD card you get.  We purchased what we considered to be a legitimate Sandisk brank MicroSD card and the unit does these subtle micro-hiccups every 2 - 3 minutes.  The owner's manual states that not all cars are compatible but does not proceed to tell you which ones ARE.  I'm not going to ding a star for that because I love this unit just the same.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT1YL7LJQ4EP3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FEQVENM#wasThisHelpful","RT1YL7LJQ4EP3","A95A9XOSHTQKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A95A9XOSHTQKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ON PLANE FLIGHTS:  It's common knowledge that the airlines turn off some one or more of the air scrubbers to lower fuel consumption.

"I did not pay $23.00 for this so that affects my review rating.  I bought this at a local discount chain for $9.97.  At that price it's a steal.  I use the machete to show roots that I discover who is boss.  Ditto blackberries.  The saw is useful for more ""wooden"" substantial roots, small limbs, etc.  I also use it for cutting / loosening rootbound roots and for opening planting soil bags when I don't have a box knife handy.  I don't think I would ever pay more for this than I did but at below 1/2 price ($9.97) I will say it's a good deal.P.S.  It comes with a external scabbard made out of something like cordura.

"I bought this for the heck of it.  The reviews showed that this original was better than the remake done in the 90s (which I have not seen).  I didn't expect much from this film but it held my attention.  My only complaint was the obnoxious character that Ernest Borgnine had to play(Trucker Cobb).  I was not sorry to see the Cobb character's role end.  I came to really like the Heinrich Dorfmann character played by Hardy Krueger.  Kruger is a good actor!  Jimmy Stewart's character (Capt. Frank Towns)was so pigheaded and became so aggravating at the end of the movie that I wanted to throw things at the TV.

"Where can you get anything that provides this much fun and usability for $12.97 shippped?  Tell me!  I want to know!!I bought this to have something that would play tunes while I was outside digging in the garden.  Little did I know I would fall in love with it.PRO's:  It looks good.  It has clear sound.  Excellent vocal intelligibility.  Amazing volume and throw for it's small size.  It's a marvel of excellent design within a price point.  It's inexpensive enough that you won't cry for the financial loss if it gets stolen.  You will cry however because you will bond with this damn thing!  It's cute!  It's a throwback.SUMMARY:  In a time when everything is supremely over priced and fails to deliver, this thing delivers.  Who thought a plastic device could be beautiful in it's reliable humility?  It's the best cheap, low hassle device you will ever own!CON's:  Of course it has no bass.  So what?  At this price?  What do you expect.IF YOU WANT REAL BASS IN A COMPACT RADIO * and * a STEREO HEADPHONE OUTPUT:  Then ** instead ** go with THIS-->  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FEQVENM/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1The Melosound S8 sounds twice as good as the Sony, but then again it costs THREE times as much.  It's also about a 1/3rd larger in size.  I can say that the Melsound S8 is a absolute wonder.  Music sounds excellent on it.  Scope,function and price point.  Each radio has it's place and yes you do get what you pay for.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!_______________________________________________________MONO OUTPUT VS. YOUR STEREO HEADPHONES.P.S. Mono (1 speaker) sound output is * SO *  long ago for most younger people that they wonder why their stereo ear buds only work on one channel with this unit. They even think this unit's headphone jack is broken/defective/who knows.What you need are ""Dual Mono"" or ""Dual Monoaural"" earbuds.  They are not very common anymore but they exist.Here is one example:  http://www.amazon.com/Headset-E-20-Dual-Monaural-Earphone/dp/B000ET2N5M/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1401255025&sr=8-6&keywords=dual+mono+headphones+3.5mm+olympusPlan B:  Alternately you could obtain a converter plug.  Specifically a 3.5mm stereo female jack to 3.5mm mono male plug adapter for probably around 3 or 4 dollars.  I don't recommend this as these converter plugs are relatively bulky and, due to their size and the way they stick out, they will put stress on this little radio's earphone jack.______________________________________________________________________________ADDENDUM/TECHNO-CRAP/EXPLANATION:  WHY DID THEY BUILD THIS THIS WAY?WHAT FOLLOWS IS BORING. YOU * HAVE * BEEN WARNED!  : )*  The mono transistor radio is a throwback to the late 60's.  While stereo grew in importance, it was a luxury for portable devices back then.*  To support delivering audio to 2 separate channels, Stereo headphones require a plug with 3 sections: a ""TRS"" or Tip, Ring, Sleeve plug.  *  The tip of a TRS stereo plug is the Left side speaker(or earbud's) positive signal, the Ring (middle section between the bands on the plug shaft) is the Right side speaker(or earbud's) positive audio signal and the shank (longest metal part closest to the plastic base) is a shared common ""ground"".---->  In a Mono radio, the female headphone output ""jack"" has NO third metal conductor/sensor inside it to make contact with the Ring part of a stereo plug.  <----The cool thing would have been if they wired it for dual mono at the factory but that would have added another wire & soldering process, a different jack, driving expense up, yadda yadda.  This thing is what it is: OLD SKOOL shabby chic to the max.  Deal with it.  If you crave dual speaker audio, then find dual mono headphones like referenced above.Over and Out.

"This is one of the few times that an expanded album with outtakes is actually an improvement.  Most of the extra songs (except for ""Pedestrian Walkway"" which I don't care for) are * very *  good, immediately likeable (especially ""Urges"").  Why oh why were they not put on the album in the first place??  Maybe record company stinginess at that time or their marketing department? ...who knows... The extra songs raise my respect for Mr. Dolby and confirms that he had a entire extended concept and place of mind... his musical talent was certainly more than a fluke of the original songs.The DVD of a live performance in front of a probably hand picked audience is very good.  The humorous interleaved theme of Ray also being a theater projectionist with all of his boredom, distractions and crisis in projecting the film is amusing.  My only slight complaint is that it messes with the DVD's audio levels for the music for the times when it cuts back to the projectionists room.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!P.S.  While this is an Import, the DVD plays just fine in my made-for-U.S. market Sony BDP S-790 Blu-Ray/DVD player.

"We bought these for my sweetie.  I did a comparision of the over 50 for Women's vs. Men's in this brand.  Only 2 differences I could find:  a bit more calcium carbonate in the Women's vitamins, a good boost of extra Selenium in the Men's vitamins.  Heck, You'll laugh but I can't see a major reason to not take these myself.Note:  We used to use Phamasomething Nanometer (euphemism, you'll figure it out) vitamins  and they were good vitamins but 6X over priced compared to these vitamins which do the exact same thing.These vitamins are USP certified which is supposed to be a plus.  Reason: I've read that something like 60% of the various vitamin suppliers can put anything or nothing in vitamins.  There's what they ""say"" is in there and what is REALLY in there.You get (I would like to think)  a bit more assurance with the USP certification.

"I bought this back in 2006 on DVD - it looked ""OK"".  On Blu-Ray its very sharp, good color rendition, no visible grain on my 60"" plasma from 11 ft distance from screen.  Sound is Dolby 5.1 or Dolby stereo.  Dolby 5.1 soundtrack had sufficient oomph for the movie.  Dialog is clear.  The big scene at the start when Krypton self-destructs is pretty impressive.  I remember when I first saw this roughly 35 years ago in a giant screen theater in Portland.  I was agog, it was so well done.  I was digesting the impact of this movie for a couple days.  Some aspects of it are a bit dated now but the basic story is still pretty powerful.

"I started with a 2GB a few years ago, then over time bought two other 4GB units.  I just now ordered an 8GB unit because it's only $19.97 with prime shipping - cheaper than the 4GB right now which is still at $39.99 - go figure.MAIN SELLING POINT:  If this drive were to drop out of your pocket or purse, etc. onto the sidewalk (scenarios), or be burglarized from your house, the finder/stealer cannot see your data even though he/she has physical possession of the drive.  They could reformat the drive and use it for other purposes but they would NOT get access to your data.  After 10 failed login attempts the drive is programmed to lock out any access attempts and MUST be reformatted.  (Kingston has a built-in process that forces you to choose a decently complex password so bad guy is never going to guess your password in 10 tries.)These have worked for me on both Windows 7 and the dreaded Windows Vista (I got rid of my one Vista PC about 6 months ago).  I now have Windows 7 on all PCs.I have turned off autorun for security reasons.  Instead, I trudge down through Windows Explorer to find the DTPrivacy launcher file on the drive in the file tree.  It works, it's just some extra effort that's all.I only dock this drive when I need to.  If it's not plugged in, it's less likely to be hacked.  Common sense.Some people ( a few) might run into issues with the E: drive being blocked or in use because Explorer shows the E: drive letter is taken up by the CD/DVD optical drive (which is common).  It is not hard to get around this.  Either try taking the disk out of the Optical drive unit or you could go to Computer, Manager, Disk Management (IF you know what you're doing, be careful here) and reassign the drive letter of the Optical drive to a ""higher"" letter to remove the conflict.ADDENDUM / OBSERVATIONS:I find that while doing a file save of CHANGES to a 28Megabyte using Microsoft Word to the Kingston drive of a particular .RTF file with a lot of mixed tables, graphics, custom text formatting can be dog slow (like 45 seconds to 1 minute) .  The hourglass for that save process takes over the entire computer.  Fortunately, I don't have to save that file very often.  I'm just used to it.  Yes I have tons of space  remaining (over a Gigabyte or more) on my Kingston drive and hard drives - that's not what's causing this.  I'm not worried about it.  I figure it's encryption processing that is parsing the entire content of the file for changes.  Just a guess.  My Text file and PDF file saves go quickly.Years ago, in the early XP days, I did own an earlier 1GB gray colored predecessor of this drive which - it was eventually discovered - had a security flaw intrinsic to the firmware of that particular earlier series.  Kingston was aware of the flaw and discontinued that series long ago.  Back then these were like (trying to remember) $80 dollars(?) for 1GB.I have deliberately passed on Windows version 8.X up till now so can't speak to usability.  I wasn't up for the aggravation although I'm told it runs faster.  Microsoft has recently announced (April 2014) that they will finally ""fix"" Windows 8.1 usability issues in two separate passes.  When they will drop the shoe on part 2 of the fix, I don't know.  I just know it's been announced.  In the meantime, I'm happy with Windows 7.While I would be disappointed if my current blue DataTraveler drives didn't work in the revised Windows 8.X (or even future Windows 9), it wouldn't break my heart.  To have simple, reliable, off-line, self-contained security ( I leave one of these at work in case my home had a catastrophe) is a small price to pay for the peace of mind these relatively cheap backups bring.  If worst comes to worst I'll purchase the new iteration and be out max $80 - $100 for 4 drives that work with the latest greatest.  I doubt if it will come to that but if it does, no big deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DLTL6XM6KHFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014ZBPYA#wasThisHelpful","R1DLTL6XM6KHFY","A95A9XOSHTQKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A95A9XOSHTQKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this on a whim, years after reading ""Eaters of the Dead"".  I read the negative reviews and so, then, dreaded watching it.  Well, it's not that bad.  I don't know what Omar Sharif is so embarrassed about.  Neither is it that great.  It was OK.  I was entertained for it's 102 minutes.  The movie cost $100 million dollars.  They didn't cut corners on the sets and locations.  I actually liked Antonio Banderas in this, normally I don't care for him (except in Mask of Zorro).  They deleted and/or quickly glossed over the most brutal aspects that were in the book regarding the Viking funeral - for that I am grateful.  I liked some of the other 12 (the Viking) actors.  The leader seemed a bit subdued and less fierce than what I pictured from the book.  Oh well.  Call this high budget, high quality cheese with a zippy lack of depth and substance.  It's almost like they were afraid to really develop the characters for being accused of having a movie that drags.  (The fear of action movie directors everywhere!  Gore Verbinski is the opposite of that, he needs to learn how to edit things down.) I bought 13th warrior DVD in used condition for 4 or 5 bucks including shipping.  Probably because Amazon Instant didn't offer it.  I've certainly seen worse movies than this.  I have no burning urge to rewatch it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37MT1OJNFAHJV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=6305692688#wasThisHelpful","R37MT1OJNFAHJV","A95A9XOSHTQKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A95A9XOSHTQKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted a new PC for my sweeties kids who were still using XP.  I was worried they would get hacked.  This Optiplex arrived in 6 working days, FedEx looking immaculate.  No dings, scratches, dust bunnies or smoke smells.  Mine has a 1GB Hitatchi Ultrastar (a cut above) 1 Terabyte hard drive installed.  This PC was a big deal circa 2007 - 2008.  The E8400 CPU (processor chip) in it is still pretty darn fast if all you are doing is business / office stuff.  6Megabyte on chip cache. The video Intel Video CPU in it is nothing to write home about but yes it will render YouTube 1080p videos just fine.  Comes with 64bit Win7 Pro installed.  I suspect this could be upgraded to 8GB or RAM but for my purposes I don't see the point.  Those who wanted somewhat more gutsy video response at decent price could slap a $70.00 nVidia GTX430 card in here and you'd be good to go.SOFTWARE I INSTALLED:  I put Firefox, Adobe, Flash, CCleaner, the usual suspects then I installed WebRoot Anti-Virus on it (was onsale for $29.00 for 1 year download & disc) and also Kingsoft Office Professional (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED).  If you want 95% of what Office does and you don't care about Outlook and you don't want to pay $350 on up for Microsoft Office, there you go.  Kingsoft. now opens and saves .docx and .xlsx and works better than MS Office in some ways, also looks elegant to me.BASICALLY, once I bought the Anti-Virus and Office clone suite from Kingsoft.....for around $350 total I have a pretty decent PC.  Microsoft will probably support Windows 7 until 2018 or longer (if the past is any precedent).  Heck MS Office alone would have cost as much as this PC.SUMMARY:IF you are looking for a fast workhorse business / school type PC  and... You are NOT doing stuff requiring bleeding edge video and processor core count (like editing movies, doing CAD, hi-res gaming or serious SQL stuff) then...PERFORMANCE IS SOLID, apps open quickly, it surfs well with zippy response.You could run Office and surf quickly on this PC till the cows come home!  I CAN RECOMMEND THIS !!!________________________________________________________________________________ADDENDUM / TIPS/ MINOR CAVEATS:1.  I installed and ran the free ""Speccy"" program from Piriform.  This program will show you all fo the technical details of your PCs hardware guts and configuration - sort of like Device Manager on steroids.  There is a status ""reporting"" protocol in the firmware of most modern hard drives called S.M.A.R.T.  Speccy is able to give you a direct view of this data in a Windows session.For my hard drive, it said it had been initially powered up since 1750 days ago, which translates for 4.8 years.  HOWEVER,  another data field showed that the drive had actually been IN USE for 90 hours when I got the PC, and that probably included 24 hours that I put on it myself.  I speculate/guess that a nearly new / refurbished Hitatchi drive was swapped into this PC as part of it's refurbishment.  Which is fine by me.  The Speccy software utility showed no major error correction / remapping of bad sectors.2. One thing to be prepared for.  I turn it on, put in the activation key (which went fine..) then I go to Windows Update:  155 patches to download!  This took 2.5 hours 12MBps bandwidth  So,  I do that download and two other successive passes / reboots and I'm current.  Just letting you know, be prepared to walk away and watch a movie, a lot of catching up to do.  You get past it, it's done.  Just sayin'Don't bother installing the latest Adobe Flash player until AFTER you have downloaded all the security patches.  I found it would not work right until I did so.3.  Since Amazon proper does not sell this, I chose to buy from an Amazon vendor with a 98% rating and a past customer base in the multiple thousands range.  I feel it's not worth it to save a few bucks by taking the low ball bid from someone with a rating score in the low 90's or (egads) 80's.  This is the way I have purchased from Amazon resellers for a decade now and following that procedure I have rarely been burned.  Your mileage may vary but that's my advice.Again, I can recommend this Dell 755 Refurbished PC if you have the technical background to tweak it into shape.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ7RX0XXCJA65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C02YJMG#wasThisHelpful","RJ7RX0XXCJA65","A95A9XOSHTQKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A95A9XOSHTQKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This show was obviously a TV documentary in episodes setup for a lot of commercial breaks.  While I'm fascinated by the story - and it's a heck of a story,  what detracts is the constant ""recapping"" of things: at the start of each episode, many times after returning to a subsegment, etc.  OK producers:  I got it the first or 2nd time, I was paying attention, you don't have to tell me the 3rd and 4th times!  If you took out the recursive ""recapping"" this would have made 3 episodes that had no fluff in them.  Nonetheless it's a great story and worth watching.  One of the remaining 4 elderly pilots interviewed when this was made comes off as a real sweetheart of a guy.

"I bought a couple boxes of this at a local ""Grocery Outlet"" (discount closeout food store chain) and didn't expect much.  WOW.  Very tasty.  Very few unpopped kernels.  Up till now Act II popcorn has been our staple / point of reference popcorn.  I now totally prefer it to the Act II.  The quality of the actual corn on the Bearitos is quite obviously higher than what I've been buying.  The price they want for the Bearitos here however is staggering.  I got mine for $1.50 a box.

"I had no idea of how far the sacrifices that were made went to gain an awareness of enemy plans during The Cold War.  The challenges this team took on to come up with and implement near-impossible inventions to stay on the bleeding edge of surveillance boggles the mind.  From 10w-400 oil,  cameras that can resolve license plates at high altitudes, fabricating your own titanium screws, variable intake ramjet engine nacelles, zero radar signature cross-section airframes, and on and on.  We have a SR-71 blackbird in the Evergreen Aviation museum not too far from where I live.  I have walked around it a several times.  It's just mind boggling to be in it's presence.  Hats off to real innovation.  When I read this book, I feel that anything is possible sometimes if you can just conceive of it and persist.  Highly recommended.Favorite story in the book is when the French Mirage plane pulls up alongside the Blackbird and demands their ""clearance code"" to overfly France.  The SR-71 crew accelerates leaves the Mirage standing still after giving the French pilot his, um... ""clearance code"".  hahahaAddendum:  If any of you are into project management, this book is a good lesson on what it is possible to achieve when you hire a small sized team of smart people, give them the right resources and keep the bureaucracy out of the way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XLK9USAH3D68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316743305#wasThisHelpful","R2XLK9USAH3D68","A95A9XOSHTQKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A95A9XOSHTQKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's fairly compact and svelte for an elcheapo $27.00 phone.  Triple minutes, you can find the minutes cards almost anywhere and, if you can't, you can purchase minutes online at the Tracfone website.  Clear, vibrant, sharp display screen.  Quick response to icons.  Exception:  Surfing on this is abysmal due to browser given and performance but that's perfect as I don't want my son wasting minutes surfing.  Has a slot for a MicroSD card.  They give you a 2GB MicroSD card as a freebie but I'd pump it up to at least 32GB if you want to turn this into an MP3 player.  I transferred my son's old T-Mobile phone number to this phone on a Saturday and the process was fairly straightforward.  They (Tracfone) ask a lot of nosy questions - really.  My address I can understand if there was loss or theft of the phone.  My email address - I said ""no"".  They had the nerve to ask for the last 4 of my SSN.  I said no way.  Things proceeded anyway.  Phone number was transferred within 4 hours.  You just power off and power back on and there ya go.  When they prompt for ""activation"" it's kind of a misnomer.  What they really meant in my case was ""Add Airtime Minutes"" which I did.  A $39.95 200 minute card became 600 minutes due to the Triple minutes.  This is what I wanted as, while I liked T-Mobile it is very difficult to get enough ""talking"" minutes from them under $50.00 a month.  Yeah they (T-Mobile) and Walmart sell a lesser known (semi-hidden!) $30.00 per month service but it didn't meet our needs.  This is my speed.  If you don't use your minutes you have (I think) 90 days before they expire.  On my personal tracfone, I can get through an entire year by buying maybe 3, 120 minute cards ($29.95) that get tripled to 360 minutes.  So...geez...for a years worth of mobile phone, I pay around $90-$100 dollars.  If web surfing is not your focus, then I can recommend this phone.

"I had previously bought the tube / grease form of SuperLube  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XBH9HI/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1  It worked fine for things like kitchen drawers, it was easy to wipe off the excess, didn't stink to high heaven.  The spray however (which I tried using today) even the tiniest application of it indoors sent us running to open all the doors for ventilation.  I agree with many that WD-40 is an old skool thing and, while it works, there are much better products out there.

"Disclaimer:  My significant other is the Clam Chowder connoisseur in our family.  She eats it often. I am reporting back the feedback she has given me.  I order it for her, she consumes it, I myself don't eat it.  She can't find any decent canned New England Clam Chowder locally (in the Willamette Valley) without driving to Whole Foods, specialty stores, etc.I found a general trend of reviews on the Amazon product review forms that state the Progresso and Snow's brands of New England Clam Chowder are not highly regarded  (that's an understatement).The ""gold standard"" for my sweetie here in Oregon is to go to a place on the coast that specializes in seafood cuisine.  One in particular is a restaurant chain that has an name that starts with an ""M"", sounds similar to a guy in 3 Stooges who was always poking his colleagues in the eye and knocking them in the head.  (There's a few of these ""M"" places up and down the Oregon coast).BACKGROUND:For a couple years we purchased Bar Harbor New England Clam Chowder.  My significant other would add 1/2 a can of milk to that and was very pleased with the taste from that brand.  I get bored with ordering the same thing all the time and saw the good reviews for Chincoteague New England Clam Chowder, thought I'd surprise her with something new, possibly better.  The case arrived today( 2/26/2014), my significant other immediately opens a can, adds a half can of milk to it, cooks it on the stove and sits down to eat it.VERDICT:  She's not that impressed with this stuff, says she finds it bland, lacking in any noticeable volume of larger clam pieces.  Frankly she said that the Bar Harbor tastes * much * better  than this Chincoteague stuff and has more actual clam in it.  Go figure.  I trust her opinion in matters regarding New England Clam Chowder, she eats it probably 3 times a month and loves to find it cooked well in a nice restaurant as a specialty.P.S. We have yet to try the ""Atlantic"" brand of Clam Chowder but after this experience, we're going to stick to Bar Harbour as the ""sure thing"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LUSBHMT2U95H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001G0NZMS#wasThisHelpful","R1LUSBHMT2U95H","A95A9XOSHTQKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A95A9XOSHTQKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Many movies I have bought to have because ""they are a classic"", or they are famous, they were a hit, etc.  blah blah.  The truth is they get watched once, maybe twice and then sit there on the shelf - sometimes to be loaned out.  I'm here to say that Concert for George is a joy to watch and holds up to repeated viewings.  Everybody is in top form, playing * together * , no egos, no diva attitudes, just a love and tribute to their friend who they played with over the years.  I find myself playing this video concert at least twice a year.Video and audio quality:I bought this in DVD format back in 2005.  I have long since gotten a Blu-ray (1080p) setup with a Plasma TV.  Normally I have fussed and gone back and rebought some movies that I am really fond of.  The video quality is so high on this particular DVD that I have no motivation to buy it in Blu-ray.  Maybe there's something about it that upscales well on my player(?) don't know - I just know that it looks great and sounds great.Mark Mann (the tall guy wearing the beret cap) and Andy Fairweather-Low are the band's secret weapons.  Amazing tandem slide guitar work.  Gary Brooker does some wonderful piano licks.  Good vocals all around.  The expressions of drummer Henry Spinnetti are amusing and his drumming along with Jim Keltner's is first rate.  It's rare to have 3 or 4 drummers on stage and have them sync up so well.The Indian orchestra part of the movie is well done if you are a fan of that kind of music.  I've watched that a couple times, appreciated it but typically pass over that for the ""George's Band"" section with Western musicians.  I also pass over the Monty Python stuff much as I liked Life Of Brian and Holy Grail.In closing very cheerful, energetic and heartfelt for a goodbye concert.

"It's not a speed demon but for the price (64GB under 40 dollars) as of Feb 2014 - it works.I decided to back up years of family photos and videos off site.  Ya never know when disaster might strike.  I have no faith in the ""cloud"".  I also burned DVD's but  wanted a single point of backup too.  Eventually I'll get a DL blue ray burner but this will do for now.By the way, I bought this particular drive (early Feb 2014) after reading numerous reviews and finding the sweet spot of lowest price AFTER THE CONSIDERATION OF ** reliability **.

The reviews I found on Amazon seemed to show particular drive one having less than it's share of problems at a reasonable price.  I didn't need to go broke to archive rarely viewed photos.

"Good balance, seems solidly built, the bearings sound smooth (compared to the bottom of line Kawasaki drive I returned).Gutsy acceleration, controllable / limitable by the variable speed control which works well.  The drill does not seem to wobble.It's probably equal or slightly better than my Skil cordless 3/8 drill that just died after 5 years of continuous use.The drill is not really made by Kawasaki - it's just Alltrade using their name under license.Main complaint:  No bubble level.  Sigh.  Of well, it's 15 dollars cheaper than a DeWalt.  If you are on a budget, are weekend warrior or want a 2nd (i.e backup) drill  - her ya go.  Eventually I'm going to get a Bosch.

"I wanted to like this drill.  My previous drill was a Skil 3/8"" corded drill that served me well for years through LOTS of use.  The gearbox finally broke on my old drill.  I researched drills and thought I'd give this a try.PROS:*  The variable speed governor adjustment wheel works.  I like that.  You can keep this thing from roaring away if you want.  I still would caution you from relying on this feature to use this drill as a screwdriver - it's not ideal for that.*  It's fairly compact for a corded drill so you can get between joists, enclosed spaces.*  It's inexpensive as far as drills go.*  It's lightweight and well balanced.  People who tire of holding a drill for a long period of time might like this.*  It has a bubble level.*  The keyless chuck is a nice idea but.... (see below)CONS:*  The deal breaker:  The unit I received,  I go to put a drill bit in for the first time and the chuck is solidly locked up, I can't get it to dis-engage, unscrew and I have large hands.  First use attempt!  I look at the manual and I'm doing everything right, I look at the ""Grip"" / ""Disengage"" markers/arrows on the chuck itself.  No go.  Now...I * could * break out the vice grips and a cloth and risk marring / damaging the chuck and losing the ability to return this.  Why bother?  The thing is brand new!  I shoudn't have to!  Sending this back.*  Yes it has bubble level but it's smallish and since the drill casing is green, and the bubble fluid is yellow or green on that green background, it's difficult to see.*  I can hear the bearings and they sound rough / noisy.*  Lastly:  When you are running the drill motor at medium to high speeds.... you can easily see yellow /blue sparks from the motor brushes via the side vent holes.  And this is a copious amount of sparks with like a 1/4 throw.  Run the motor for 30 - 40 seconds and there's an ozone smell.  And again THIS IS HOW IT BEHAVES NEW.  Imagine what it will deteriorate to as it ages.  I don't recall my Skil drill doing this ever, or if it did, it was mostly visually and physically shielded from me.*  The drill says Kawasaki but it's really made by Alltrade and Kawasaki has allowed Alltrade to license the use of their name to make some dollars.  If this drill is indicative of the general quality of the line, then I feel sorry for Kawasaki as this will besmirch their brand.IN CLOSING:  Maybe mine was made on a monday by a bad robot that didn't have it's WD-40.  I just know I don't have the patience to try again on this model.  I think if you could get it to work and you were a very occasional picture hanger, whatever, then this might work for you.  You'd have to have low standards.ADDENDUM:  Oddly enough, I simulataneously ordered a better model of Kawasaki that has a keyed chuck - BEFORE I NEW BETTER.  It's on it's way.  It's $15.00 more.  Watch for my other review of that.  Hopefully that will go better.The drill of my dreams is a $110.00 Bosch 3/8"" drill.  My purpose in ordering this little drill was just to have an extra small job drill.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RDHMR0X6DC6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00548SVM2#wasThisHelpful","R2RDHMR0X6DC6Y","A95A9XOSHTQKX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A95A9XOSHTQKX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I unpacked the 4 pack tonight and put one of these in the my Coleman (Johnson Controls) gas furnace.  Examined it briefly, it looks to be as well made.  I used to buy the 3M Filtrete next to top of the line filters.  I remember the Filtrete's costing at least $12.99 apiece.  I did an analysis and looked at comparative reviews of various brands of furnace filters - both on Amazon and Home Depot's websites.  I found that I can get these cheaper off Amazon Prime than purchasing a comparable filtration level filter from my local Home Depot or Lowes.  The True Blue's cost $36.00 for 16 months of clean filtered heating airflow (assuming you follow their change filter every 120 days suggestion).  Another way to look at is:  these cost $27.00 a year, and really - in the Northwest where I come from -- who runs their furnace in July, August and the 1st half of September?  You might even get more mileage if your local climate allows you to write off Summer as a time of usage.

"I bought these to -  I don't know - try something different/save money.  The first two units out of the pack were dull (mediocre sharpness)on first use and the 3rd one gave an OK but not spectacular shave.  I've yet to use the last one.  I won't be buying these again.  Aside from inconsistency of sharpness, it feels like there's some subtle difference of the angle of the blades that is less effective, more prone to mishaps compared to...PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE:  I like my old standby, the Shick Extreme 3 razors much better.  I find I get cut less with the Shick and it's a closer, hassle free shave.  With Edge (or Barbasol) the Shicks are fearless taking on even 3 day beard stubble.  (I don't have fine hair by the way).To be fair, the Shick razors cost aprox. 47% more money but it's worth it to me not to rip my face to shreds or to discover missed spots later.

"Overall Rating:  4.5 Rockin’ ★★★★☆Take one high powered NYC boot scooting lawyer from Texas mixed with her ‘All American’ high school crush then add in a true Southern twist and you will have the first book in Nicole Hite’s The Southern Gentleman series.  Carrington Mason and Colton Wilson two exceptional individuals formed a unique bond in high school that even though neither recognized at the time, survives in Ms. Hite’s novel Justified Love.As soon as graduation was over, Carrington left Avery, Texas behind.  During her formative years those bad girls that we all love to hate made her their target. An overweight geek with a crush on the school’s quarterback gave them plenty of opportunity to inflect damage.  With her own girl posse as backup, Carr survived those years even though the scars on her soul lingered. She is now a successful high powered attorney with a prominent firm in New York.  When her father requests her help with a legal matter, she makes plans to go home and help him.  She is no longer the overweight, insecure girl that left.  Carrington just hopes she does not run into Colton, but a girl has to do what a girl needs to do for her family.Colton had always felt like a big disappointment to his father.  He never felt good enough for his parents.  During high school he was looked at as the golden boy, the guy everyone wanted to be or be with, but he had wanted a geeky shy girl.  Carrington intrigued him and he wanted to know more about her, but she was driven away by others.  Now Carr had returned and he was not letting her get away again.  Colton is painted as a man that loves deeply and is intensely loyal. The care and protection he lavishes on Carrington is beautiful.  He is still all male and dominates while developing his relationship with Carrington. Long hidden secrets begin to unfold and they threaten to destroy the relationship he is building with her.Interaction between the two main characters is sexy and sweet at the same time!  The friendship that the author develops between Carrington and her girl posse is a true high point in this book.  The way they are used as a support system for each other is also a brilliant and remarkable part of the story. The conclusion allowed the reader a glimpse of the couple’s future together.

She was from an Agri, farming community, that was destroyed in the war.  Her family was killed and a cyborg saved her.  She swore she would pay it forward and dedicated her life to helping the cyborgs.  She studied hard and excelled at the academy and was placed on a battleship ready to service the cyborg she would be paired with.  The commander did not want a female aboard his ship and allowed cruel and mean attacks on Joan.  She lived daily in fear.  When she finally is given a cyborg to pair with she is taken aback when Rage is presented to her.  He has been sorely abused by his previous engineers and loathes humans.  He killed his last one!This story is about trust and forgiveness and a sexy hot cyborg finding his heart.  I loved the buildup of trust the author developed between the couple and the yearning for acceptance of something neither understood but wanted.  The secondary characters were important in providing pivotal information about the story.  This is a must read for sci-fi romance followers and a welcome addition to anyone's eBook library.

"Overall Rating: 4.25 Rockin’ ★★★★Life can be cruel at times.  You can do everything right, be a talented and beloved artist, but still end up on the short end of the stick, or sometimes on the abusive end of a fist.  In Misha Elliott's newest book, Saving Leah, she delves into the horrific world of domestic violence, while interlinking a love story so beautiful that it will leave you breathless.  The author creates characters that touch you as if he or she could be your best friend, someone that you know and love.  The design of the characters and the plot is elegantly crafted with agony as well as heartfelt hope.Leah Campbell is a prodigy on the violin.  Since she was a small child she captured her audiences and the hearts of everyone that heard her play.  After the death of her parents when she was still a young adolescence, her life became something she didn't recognize. A secret so dark and haunting plagued her into adulthood and her music was adversely affected.  Now she is trying to pick up the pieces, trying to move on with her life and heal the best way she can as a victim of violent abuse.  Not trusting anyone and becoming somewhat of a hermit, Leah is thrust together with a most unlikely companion.  A man who just might be able to push beyond all of her defenses and become a balm to Leah's shattered soul.Asher Sky is an entrepreneur of sorts.  Asher knows loss, devastating, heart wrenching loss.  But life must go on, so he molds himself and makes a decent living modeling.  However, he feels his life is missing something, someone.  When he meets a beautiful girl, Leah Campbell, in a tragic incident, things become clear to him.  He begins to yearn for something special, only his.  Asher knows that something is off with Leah, she is broken and he wants to help her mend.This is truly a beautiful yet a difficult story at times to read.  The fact that the author was able to probe into the cruel savagery of abuse while giving us an unforgettable story that fills hearts with such passion and grace is beyond astounding.  This is definitely a must read, but just make sure you have plenty of Kleenexes available!  Fearlessly executed, Misha!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27LAM37XNLB6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LR45R6#wasThisHelpful","R27LAM37XNLB6S","A1FCQLP8ESWLDM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FCQLP8ESWLDM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall Rating:  4.5 Rockin’ ★★★★☆Sometimes you need to stop and smell the roses. I heard this quote so many times growing up and as I read this novel, I realized how long it's been since I actually took that advice. During my literary voyage reading the fabulously written novel Hollywood Dirt by Alessandra Torre, I did just that! Hollywood charm meets Southern grit and that combination had me in stitches at times, while I thoroughly enjoyed the plot as it unfolded. This is Carson and Summer's happily ever after and their journey to discover their true inner selves.  It is something you do not want to miss!Carson is Hollywood's golden boy. The perfect actor, perfect husband, perfect male specimen until he returns home one evening early to catch his wife with another man! His world is rocked and shifts to an ugly fight over property and his newest venture a movie he is producing and starring in.  Summer is southern to the core. She grew up in the little town of Quincy, where Sunday church attendance is required and everyone knows everyone else's business. Her southern drawl is as feisty as her temper and manners of course are mandatory!  When the two collide, sparks ignite and a love/hate relationship blossoms. But being a gentle bred lady, Summer reigns in her temper and tries to maintain an aloof persona towards the handsome entitled actor.I must say Ms. Torres has written a magnificent book from start to finish. The elements that she inserts remind me of growing up in the south and I can relate so well to the characters. The interaction between the main characters keeps you involved and the secondary are perfectly woven to fit flawlessly into the story. Bennington was the scout looking for places to film and when he meets Summer a true friendship begins. She helps him gain access to the families that he is looking to use their properties as location spots and in return he helps fund her way to get out of Quincy. The rooster is one of my favorite things in the story, loved Cocky and all he brought to the read. Such a welcome addition to my library and I cannot stress enough how you need to buy this book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DNTASTRQVUR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UA70U8#wasThisHelpful","R3DNTASTRQVUR2","A1FCQLP8ESWLDM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FCQLP8ESWLDM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Overall Rating: 5 Rockin’ ★★★★★As I read this book, one thing really stood out and that was the story itself. Mayra Statham has produced a memorable love story in her latest release, Davenport Harbor.  I loved the way it started and also the technique she used to build the complex relationship between Anne and John. Switching back and forth between their POV was a fantastic way to let the reader inside the thought processes and feelings of each character. The interaction between the two main characters is perfect and it explains so many things that happen to them in this book as they move toward their HEA!John is the ultimate alpha male that knows how to control his environment and those around him. He grows as the story progresses into more, as he becomes a loving, caring friend and lover! The past haunts him and he is trapped inside his memories of another time!  When he intervenes and rescues a stranded motorist, little does he know that it is his new beginning? A woman also haunted by her past and an innocent child drive away his nightmares and bring light to his life.Her dreams were filled with happily ever after, not running from a horrific beast that threatened to destroy her if he found her.  Anne had managed to escape from her abusive boyfriend and stay hidden, until he found her again.  When her car broke down on the side of the road, things looked desolate!  Then a beautiful man stopped and would not take no for an answer when she refused his help.  He may seem like an unlikely knight in shining armor, but maybe he was just what she needed.Two scared souls that need each other to find healing meet and begin their journey together. As in anything worth having it is not an easy path that they take together.  Obstacles will be thrown at them and not just from others, but also from each other.  Will Anne and John find their way?

"Overall Rating: 5 Rockin’ '''''Jordan Marie has done it again! Claiming Crusher is a phenomenal five star read! The buildup is steady and the ending will blow your socks off.  Sit back with a nice glass of wine, box of tissues and enter the world of the Savage Brothers MC.  There are multiple storylines running parallel throughout and the growth of each character attests to the brilliance of this author. In Loving Nicole we were left hanging, full of questions about Dani and Crusher’s relationship.  Many disliked Nicole’s haughty best friend, especially after the shooting incident. Her character was portrayed as a party girl, stripper looking for her next fix, but as we read we learn that there is so much more to this intricately complex character.  Her background was a mystery, and little did we know of the absolute horror that the young Melinda suffered at the hands of her abusive husband.  Questions are answered about why she is running, who she is, and what she wantsaa from her new life.  Attraction and desire between the hero and heroine and their battle between good and evil dominants this book. You will not want to miss the happily ever after ending, Crusher and Dani are given.Crusher is the VP of the Savage Brothers MC, and a playboy. He carries a burden from his younger years of a love tragically lost.  When he first meets the red lipped, feisty beauty, he is drawn to her lost soul.  Time and time again, he tries to break through the barriers she has erected, only to be turned away.  He hurts deeply for her and loves even deeper.  You will laugh, cry and hurt alongside him as he forges the impossible by claiming a woman that has no desire to ever be claimed again.Melinda aka Dani aka Hellcat is a strong courageous woman that fought for freedom from the dark oppression and gloom of a marriage arranged by her father to a monster named Michael.  In the previous books, I had strong feelings of dislike towards Dani because of the drama her actions caused to unfold between Dragon and Nicole.  You will not feel this way any longer. Jordan Marie humanizes Dani to a point you literally will feel like you are crawling inside the character’s mind and soul.This book delves into domestic violence at an extreme level.  The horrific punishments dealt out by Michael and his henchman Donald, are graphic and yet the story being told about Dani would be incomplete without them.  The ending is comical, therapeutic and gory all at the same time.  I look forward to the next book in this series.  Each one continues to shine a light on the club, but also on the women that are opening up the readers understanding and perception of the Savage Brothers MC.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V50RT5DRM16K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0145JMH5M#wasThisHelpful","R3V50RT5DRM16K","A1FCQLP8ESWLDM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FCQLP8ESWLDM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall Rating:  4 Rockin’ ★★★★They grew up together and have always been friends.  In Laid Out, Worth the Fight series this friendship grows and evolves into something entirely different than either expected.  Author Sidney Halston once again delivers an incredible, heart stopping read for her fan’s enjoyment!  The book is set in Tarpon Springs, Florida and centers on a group of MMA fighters, the gym they train at, and their friends and family. Ms. Halston’s characters in this novel could be your next door neighbors or friends you get together with and go out for dinner and drinks.  This novel is filled with realistic characters and situations that are easily related to while still totally involving the reader in an action pack story.Our hero, Cain Sorensen has loved Violet Channing as long as he has known her.  He gave her, her first kiss and then gave her up because his best friend loved her too.  Struggling for years watching them together almost destroyed him.

"Very nice product. I love it.The Rosehip Oil works well for me. I add a few drops to my moisturizer and apply it to my face and neck every night and wake up to soft, glowing skin. I have noticed also the frown lines on my face are minimized. People tell me I look refreshed. I have also used it on my hands. That is where I can really tell the difference. My hands feel softer, smoother, and look younger than they have in years!  The Rosehip Oil smells very..natural...uh, very light earthy like odor, but not unbearable, and no worse than putting vitamin E oil on; however, you can mix it with a few drops of lavender essential oil to it and it will smell heavenly.I love this product, although only a small bottle, Essential Oil scent is really strong, so you only need a few drops and the smell will linger in your room for hours. The Pure Sweet Kashmir Lavender Essential Oil is 100% pure, great quality.  I use this Lavender oil for a number of purposes. I mix it with Rosehip Oil, Coconut Oil, or use it when I am making my homemade body butter. It is good in the spray bottle; I add water and a few drops of oil and spray the room or add it to my electric diffuser. This product is well worth trying if you have troubles falling asleep. I put a couple of drops on my pillow and I was fast asleep straight away. Definitely had one of the best sleeps ever which is unusual for me as I'm always so stressed and unable to sleep. Lavender oil has been amazing to help me relax and fall asleep.  If you like to give it a try a stress free evening and a good deep sleep in your room with the lavender aroma, definitely buy this.All in all, this is wonderful Organic Rosehip & Lavender Essential Oils combo, excellent quality.Sample product for review courtesy of Aviano Botanicals","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UHJ7MMGD1EO4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VH1D90E#wasThisHelpful","R1UHJ7MMGD1EO4","A3P464V4042EVU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P464V4042EVU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of those items that you could regret not buying in the worst day. These blankets are very thin, individually wrapped, and nice to throw a few in each vehicle and some in the camping gear.  Great to keep in vehicles, while traveling, or around the house.

"These are really cool, unique, and fun. Earphones have an LED Lights which syncs with the beats of music. I never had headphones like these before that lights up like these do.  It comes with built-in microphone that supports hand-free talking and standard 3.5mm stereo audio connector. They are good for when I want go for a run. The blue light is extremely bright and I found them especially useful during night runs where I could go into sketchy neighborhoods feeling safe. The LED light can also be turned off when I don't want to be attracting attention.  The sound quality on these headphones is good. However, ear plugs are not soft and I, personally, did not find the earphones comfortable to use for long period of time. The cord length is a little shorter than average, so I recommend an extender if you use it with your desktop computer. And do not bend the cord in sharp angle as it may easily affect lighting effect, from that point the light won`t work any longer.Sample product for review courtesy of WeiHeng","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31AOAS0UB4MZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V350X4Y#wasThisHelpful","R31AOAS0UB4MZ7","A3P464V4042EVU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P464V4042EVU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Portable Organizer Case is so cool!!! Designed to fit an iPad Mini Air; however, the overall design works better than I expected. The rubberized woven elastic bands is an excellent idea for organizing all the loose stuff in my gear bag.  I don't have to untangle the wires from each other anymore or lose a thumb drive somewhere in the bottom of my bag. These bands are remarkably flexible and grippy, they hold my items well. This case is perfect for small items, electronics, or gadgets. I use it for my technology bag to hold my phone, cables, plugs, flash drives and other small items I need on a daily basis.

"There's so many selfie sticks out there, but there's something different about this one. It comes with the Bluetooth button built into the selfie stick.

The phone holder clamp with orange rubber pad provides extra protection for your phone helps to secure your phone, keeps it more firmly in place and makes me feel confident that my phone will not get scratched up while in the phone clamp and when I need to remove it.To turn on the monopod, there's a small on/off switch on the very bottom which will then try to pair with your phone via Bluetooth. The Selfie Stick connected with my Galaxy 5 rally easy, and the phone clamp was large enough for my phone even with it's otterbox defender case intact. The Selfie Stick charges up in about an hour via a micro USB slot and USB cable of which the other end can be plugged into your computer. Works really well.In summary, This Gotideal® Pro Bluetooth Selfie Stick is lightweight, but still sturdy, easily adjustable, I love the bluetooth capability and the shutter on the handle. The whole thing is small when closed and very light, making it very convenient to carry about like on camping, hiking, trips, or at a party. Selfie Stick Monopod is loads of fun. I never dreamed of enjoying taking selfies until now.Sample product for review courtesy of Gotideal","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YEL0KG7ROLYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N95WK6A#wasThisHelpful","R2YEL0KG7ROLYJ","A3P464V4042EVU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P464V4042EVU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For me the really interesting part of the story is the  location. I live in Montana myself and use the scenery in a lot of my own books, in fact that's why I bought this one. The author did a good job bringing the feel and the problems of small town life and its' unique problems into this novel.Jules is the sheriff in the small town of Blue Deer, MT ( you have to read the book to find the secret behind the name.) In this novel, Jules is up to his eyeballs in murders and finding the killer or killers takes readers into the idiosyncrasies of the people who inhabit the town. The novel was mysterious, suspenseful and touched with humor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28BT0T7ES741G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786860855#wasThisHelpful","R28BT0T7ES741G","A28D20IM3BNAJ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28D20IM3BNAJ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually worry when I pick up a book with all five star reviews, wondering if it will live up to the acclaim. This story did. It is a well written touching story about Martha, a woman suffering with Alzheimers. It is also a story of family,and told through reminiscences of family members as things that happen i the present trigger memories of the past. All families have good times and bad times and this story shares them all with love, tenderness and the  spirituality of hope and dreams. I usually like to read suspense thrillers and this beautiful story, although a different genre, is a must have touching story.

"I found this an interesting an informative read. When you think Taoism all began in 600 B.C. it is amazing.Tao Te Ching is a teaching book that lets people learn about the sacred teachings of the Far East. An interesting background is given about James Legge and Max Muller who put together the book of 50 volumes of these teachings. I think this is a book to keep handy and read over and over again. The beautiful thoughts hold a lot of common sense in how to be a better person and make this world a better place, something we could all try to use in our every day lives. The writing gives a sense of peace and is a great guideline for living life to its' fullest and to bring out the best in us all.

"I read some of the reviews and grab the book anyway because I love James Patterson. For me this was an intriguing look at life and what has happened to our world. I also found this an interesting take on what possibilities are for us if we don't change. I found the characters to be people I would meet in the occupations they are in and felt the author did a great job with them. All in all I found this a great read and think the reader has to take a look at what the author is saying in the warnings that come with the damage done. I am still a James Patterson fan.

"First Sentence: It was a blustery London morning in the autumn of 1876, wind and rain heavy in the trees lining Chancery land, and here, damn it all, stood before Charles Lenox something that nobody should have to tolerate before breakfastA famous foreign pianist disappears from his dressing room, and Lenox’ detective agency is called in to find him. The pressure is on as a former partner of his firm seems to be hijacking clients and trying to solve this case before him. However, Lenox must leave the case to his partners and spend time with his brother in their childhood home. Things become interesting when a local insurance agent’s home is broken into, odd items in the town start disappearing, and a mysterious, rather disquieting, chalk figure appears in several places.What a wonderful opening when the author immediately places you into the environment, and introduces you to the primary character with whose emotions one can empathize. The inclusion of the story of the Bront sisters, is delightful as well as it establishes the time and place.Finch as created such a fine ensemble of characters, particularly with Lenox’ detective agency, that one becomes involved with them even if one has not read previous books. They are fully dimensional with backstories that are both brief, yet complete.Yet it’s Finch’s voice that brings you into the story with descriptions, facts, information, emotion and just the right touch of humor. It is style of language—“Lenox had known him for forty years, since he was a swottish, pedantic boy at the village school, and more or less the same look of circumspection had been on hi fact the whole time. He had never in that time evinced any vivacity…”—and the details of the period which make it fascinating. Small details such as one being able to read a newspaper were one not able to afford to buy it, an interesting note on the importance of hats for men, buying a ‘fish slice’ as a wedding gift, and the history of “the Riot Act,” that bring the period to life.The dialogue has a very natural flow with the language appropriate to the social rank and education of the character with that between Charles and his brother, showing the closeness and east of their relationship—“Edmund, you know my days here are yours.” Edmund nearly smiled. “In that case, I happily transfer ownership of them to Mr. Hadley, at least temporarily—and hope that he will accept mine as well, for I am exceedingly curious about what on earth all of this can mean.” One can also enjoy Lenox’ time with his young daughter.Lest you are concerned that here is not much mystery to the books, rest assured. Yet Finch’s approach is gentler and encompasses far more than just the crimes, including a wonderful passage of Charles’ musings on those who have passed.“Home by Nightfall” has a very good plot with more than one case being handled, plenty of questions, twists, and revelations that change the course of the investigations. Each of the cases is brought to very satisfactory conclusions and leaves the reader anxious for the next book.HOME BY NIGHTFALL (Hist Mys-Charles Lenox-England-Victorian/1876) – VGFinch, Charles – 9th in seriesMinotaur Books – Nov 2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ6N5TU9MGMVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250070414#wasThisHelpful","RQ6N5TU9MGMVO","A2SI6BNK5SWSMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SI6BNK5SWSMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First Sentence:  I spotted the girl even before she knocked on my door.Tough, street-wise Mattie Sullivan hires Spenser to find her mother’s killer.  Even though a man was convicted, Mattie doesn’t believe he’s the killer.  Agreeing on a fee of doughnuts, literally, Spenser is intrigued enough to look into it.  When the trail leads to old advisories, drugs, and the FBI, Spenser, with the help of Hawk, know they need to keep Mattie safe and to find the answers.Atkins does a very good job of capturing Parker.  All the elements that should be there; are there.  In addition to the standard cast of characters—it is nice that Atkins as made Susan rather more likable—Spenser’s client makes a definite impression as she’s a girl who’s had to grow up way too fast and is handling it.  An entire discussion could be held about Mattie in terms of our view of children growing up today, as opposed to how they grew up in the past and their different levels of responsibility.One can also count on Spenser to trigger your hunger response—“I had envisioned a filet, medium rare, with creamed spinach and mashed potatoes.”  He is also the single greatest representative for the Boston Tourist Board possible.  You are in the city with him; everyplace from the roughest neighborhoods, to the best.  But it’s his inclusion of dining spots that is particularly fun; Locke-Ober, Legal Seafood and, a particularly favorite, Union Oyster House; the oldest restaurant in Boston—“A big steaming bowl of clam chowder arrived with a thick wedge of cornbread.  The heavens opened up.  The angels reappeared.”—down to Dunkin’ Donuts.Another retained element is Spenser’s sartorial descriptions—“Vinnie wore a navy cashmere topcoat with a glen plain suit underneath.  His dress shirt was a blue-and-white stripe, and his tie a light purple.”  Rather than interrupt the flow of the story, or simply seem to be fill, these descriptions serve to tell one a bit about the personality of the character:  clothes make the man.A nice segue in the story is a comparison of Mattie and two other troubled people Spenser helped in the past; Paul and Z.  New readers won’t feel lost by these references as sufficient backstory is provided.  However, this reference does help to cement Spenser’s image as a knight errant.  But he’s no Don Quiote with Sancho Panza, in the form of Hawk, by his side.  Spenser’s advisories are very real, and very dangerous.  But so can be Spenser, Hawks, and their colleagues. As we move into the recognition that it is territory and drugs that are behind things—“Territory,” she said.  “How are men different than dogs.”—and when things turn bad, the tension is palpable and there’s no putting the book down.“Robert B. Parker’s Lullaby” is very, very good.  It’s not an homage or an imitation in any form.  Atkins truly captures that which made Parker’s books so successful.ROBERT B.

"First Sentence: “Before I start, can I ask you to look around at this beautiful building?”It’s the week before Guy Fawkes, and London’s banks are under siege.  Although started by the scandal of a corrupt financier, the violence is growing and now includes murder by fire.  But the death doesn’t look accidental to the Bryant and May of the PUC, especially not when a second fire also kills.NOTE:  If you read an e-version, please ensure you start with “Excerpt from a Speech…” rather than just at Chapter 1.Fowler is one author from whom I look forward to reading his prologues as they are always a treat.  In this case, with the “Excerpt from a Speech,” we learn a great deal about the history of London and the PUC, and a wonderful internal memo from Raymond Land, who actually think he runs the PUC.The ensemble cast of characters, led by Arthur Bryant and John May, is one of the most unusual and intriguing one will find.  Although we meet them in short order from the beginning, Fowler doesn’t weigh the reader down with background information all at once.  Rather, we come to know the characters throughout the story.  The interplay amongst them, as well as their physical descriptions, makes them very alive and real to us, causing the reader to truly care about what happens to each of them, including the more secondary characters.Dialogue makes such a difference, and Fowler knows how to write dialogue—“Even after all these years, your every action remains a mystery to me….And why you had to follow him into a theatre of all places—“  “He was a junkie doing some speed-acquisition of tourists’ wallets, John.  I took one look at him and knew he would test positive for stupidity.”  And later—“Look at the state of you…”  “Do you always boil a saucepan of sprouts for at least two hours?” Bryant asked.  “What?” said May, thrown. “No.”  “Good, then you’re not my mother.”At the same time, there are many passages that cause one to stop and consider—“In every decade and generation,…one thing united us:  obstinacy. We’re a paradoxical mix of conformity and rebellion, privacy and bravado.  We will not do as we are told.  That’s how it always was.”The historic details and information are fascinating and add wonderful depth to the story.  One can’t help but respect an author who doesn’t write down to their readers.  Rather, there are times when one finds oneself in search of a dictionary; and that’s a nice thing.There are so many facets to this book:  the history of Guy Fawkes, protests by “anonymous” against the 1 percent, a theory about Rembrandt’s painting “The Night Watch,” Jack the Ripper and the importance of honoring the victims, and so much more.  Yet it all ties together with the base of a very human story.“The Burning Man” includes excellent building of suspense, a dramatic climax, and well-executed twists right up to the resolution.  In the end, though, it is a story of people, our present society, and relationships.BRYANT & MAY AND THE BURNING MAN: A PECULIAR CRIMES UNIT MYSTERY (Pol Proc-Bryant and May- London-Contemp) – VG+Fowler, Christopher – 12th in seriesBantam - December 2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JA0EGJVVSKO1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0857522043#wasThisHelpful","R1JA0EGJVVSKO1","A2SI6BNK5SWSMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SI6BNK5SWSMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First Sentence:  The letter, neatly folded at my plate, looked innocuous enough, but I had a sense of disquiet about it.Someone is threatening Captain Gabriel Lacey by claiming he’s not who he says.  When that threat includes an attempt to harm Lacey’s wife’s son, Lacey takes It very seriously.  Yet he also has the matter of a decade-dead woman to identify, and a killer to find, and his daughter, Gabriella, who is coming out.One can greatly appreciate the use of Ms. Gardner’s expressions appropriate to the social class of the period to describe Lacey’s wife—“Donata had been quite a diamond of the first water in her Season.”  However, it is interesting to learn of the laws of the period and the control men had over their wives.  While women of wealth and position could act and go out independent of their husbands, where women of lower classes could not, for them all, unless a woman inherited directly from her father, it was men who controlled the money, property and the lives of their children.  Even further, in this particular book, Gardner addresses the laws with regard to Jews in England at the time.Followers of the series will be pleased to see how the relationship between Lacey, his wife, daughter and stepson is progressing.  However, new readers will not feel the lack of their history and will quickly understand just how unusual is their relationship, even for the time.  However, this is by no means a book where the marital relationship overwhelms the story.  Far from it. In many ways, the most intriguing relationships are between Lacey; James Dennis a dangerous and powerful criminal; Brewster, the man charged by Denis to keep track of Lacey; and Lacey’s friend Lord Granville, a man of extreme wealth and position whose friendship with Granville helps stave off his own boredom.  Lacey is a former front-line soldier and is not without his flaws, the worst being his temper and penchant to hurl himself into potentially dangerous situations—“Captain, you could find trouble inside St. James’s Palace.”  But it’s Lacey’s empathy for others, and his determination for justice that makes him a compelling and dimensional character; one who would attract such diverse range of associates.That the victim and her family are Jewish introduces a new and interesting element.  The wonderful scene of Lacey visiting a synagogue leads to a particularly poignant observation—“Any man I’d met of the Hebrew religion had been no different than I was, I’d observed—in fact, many came from circumstances far better than mine, and blended into London life more seamlessly than I did.  True, I was able to vote for stand for Parliament…but how did that make me a superior man?”  Shades of Shylock from “The Merchant of Venice.”“The Thames River Murders” is an excellent read, filled with twists, suspense, action, balanced by a touch of relationships and two threads which peak our curiosity of the next book.THE THAMES RIVER MURDER (Hist Mys–Cpt.

"First Sentence:  “Looks as if someone’s sliced her into three,” said Solomon Carter, the police surgeon, chattily.Two thirds of a female body have been found; the head and the legs.  Having been a member of “The Magic Men,” a Secret Service team of which he had been part during WWII, leads Edgar to reconnect with fellow member, Max Mephisto, especially after the shocking identify of the victim has been learned. A letter delivered to Edgar with the name of another magic trick, and another death, focuses him, with Max’s help, to find the rest of their old team…and the killer.It is always interesting to learn the “how” behind magic tricks.  And to consider the existence of a team of magicians, each with their own special skill, is particularly intriguing.  In addition to Edgar, Griffith’s employs an effective segue to the past, informing us of the significant player, their skills and how they fit together.  It is interesting that she chooses to insert this later in the story, but no less effective for so doing.Griffiths has truly captured the feeling of stagecraft and the world behind the theater curtain.  Although it is universal of all cultures, books set in the UK seem often to utilize the theme of a suspicion of forgiveness and hope of the perpetrator of violent crime being a foreigner.  This is quite understandable being this soon after the War, but it need also be remembered that this was a time when people doubted television would ever succeed, thus limiting the exposure to those beyond their shores.On the other hand, the Brits seem to have an ongoing regard for the old beliefs, including an acceptance of ghosts.”Naturally, the police station had its resident ghosts.  The site was once a medieval monastery…and it was said that sometimes a monk could be seen moving casually through the thick stone walls of the basement.”  But fear not, although this is anything but a paranormal mystery. Such injections do add to the sense of theatrically.One can appreciate Griffith’s wry humour—“Max had a sudden vision of the Titanic tilting into the sea while the orchestra (hopefully in better tune than this one) played on.”—and her very visual descriptions—“He strolled through the picnicking families like Moses crossing the Red Sea.  Moses in Italian shoes.”“The Zig Zag Girl” very effectively and steadily builds the suspense and tension, throwing in an excellent twist, with another twist upon that, and another upon that.  Well done, Ms. Griffiths on a very good start to a new series.THE ZIG-ZAG GIRL (Pol Proc-Det.

"First Sentence:  The fishing guide known as Rainbow Sam found the body.The body of a young man with a Royal Wulff trout fly through his lip is retrieved from a log jam, but that’s not what killed him.  Sherriff Martha Ettinger, along with ex-PI, painter, fly-fisher Sean Stranahan, look to find the killer amid the very big-money fly-fishing business of Montana.From the very beginning, we are made aware of McCafferty’s humour—“The client, whose largest trout to date had been the size of a breakfast sausage.”—and given a strong sense of place—“Twilight was an amber smear on the horizon; the river glitters in the slanted light.  In a few minutes the polish would fade from the surface, the current’s mercurial song would slide into bass notes, and the wild night would claim it against further human intrusion.”While most of the characters, particularly Sean and Martha—“She’d been brought up in the tradition of self-reliance, but had the misfortune of being pretty and had allowed herself to be subjected to the wills of alpha makes ever since high school, losing, most of her self-esteem in the process.”--are interesting and work.  These are not ordinary characters.  Each is multi-dimensional and realistic in the sense of them being intelligent people who would want to personally know.“The exception to this is Sean’s “relationship” and interaction, which never quite works.  Even the dialogue between them always seems off-balance. The character of “Velvet,” really never comes across as real or dimensional.  It’s almost as if McCafferty needed the character for the plot, but never really liked her or knew what do to with her.Although most people think of fishing simply as simply a sport, we don’t often think of just how big a business it is, and how much revenue it generates from the offshoot business that support it.“The Royal Wulff Murders” is very much a book for those who fish, but there is a decent mystery there and some very good, layered characters.

"First Sentence:  I felt his eyes before I saw his face.Orphaned Leah Randall has been doing vaudeville since she was a toddler.  However, her career is on the wane and she’s not certain where her next job may be, until she’s approached by a stranger.  Oliver Beckett thinks he’s found his niece who disappeared when she was only 14.  Jessie Carr was the sole heiress to her family’s fortune.  Now Oliver thinks he’s found a way for “Jessie” to return home, inherit and provide him with a life of comfort.  Can Leah/Jessie pull it off amid the suspicion of the family, especially her two male cousins?From the beginning, some with recognize the theme and predecessors to this book and, possibly, be a bit hesitant.  Fear not; read on.  Set in 1979 and in the United States allows for fascinating new elements to the plot.  The details of a life in vaudeville, and the addition of famous people who began their careers there, truly brings the story to life.  Yet, as with the period, Miley correctly uses the labels for different ethnic groups which are unacceptable today.Doesn’t one always love a good plot twist, and the introduction of a threat?  Even the reader is momentarily left wondering what is true, and what is not.A secondary plot adds another dimension to the story, and the opportunity to learn interesting information on the history of Oregon and its native Indian tribes.

"First Sentence:  Joanne Ross remembered the morning she’d first encountered the name Alice Ramsay.Newspaper journalist Joanne Ross comes across the story of a woman who’d recently been tried for witchcraft in a small Scottish town, the first since 1728.  Intrigued the contacts the young reporter who wrote the story there, Joanne makes the trip north.  Alice Ramsey is less than hospitable, but Joanne finds herself drawn to the woman, and so is shocked to soon learn Alice is dead and pronounced a suicide.  Not believing it, Joanne investigates but runs into more layers, and threats, than she could have imagined.Scott starts off by creating an evocative sense of place with both the description and the language—“March was still winter in these parts—with snow on the hills, and the burns and rivers veins of rolling liquid peat, it was beyond dreary, it was dreich.” While Scottish words and phrases are a bit of a challenge for an American reader, their meaning is easily understood by the context and add context to the story.  However, just so you know, dreich is a combination of dull, overcast, drizzly, cold, misty and miserable weather. At least four of the above adjectives must apply before the weather is truly dreich.  But nothing solidifies the knowledge that we are not in the U.S., than the description of a house—“Not that it was old, only a hundred years or so since it was built...”While the book does not include a prologue, it is important to read the passage at the beginning of each chapter as they allow us to know a bit about Alice, and confirm there is more to the events than meet the eye.It’s an interesting group of characters that Scott has created; Joanna who wants to progress as a writer; her husband, the publisher of the local paper; Colum MacKenzie, the young constable completely cowed by his mother; and his much more independent fiancée.  Most fascinating of all, however, is Alice Ramsey, even though she is only physically present in the story for small periods.  In many ways, she fits the classic definition of a wise woman, or a crone; attuned to nature and knowledgeable as to the purpose of herbs; and having experienced enough in life to pass wisdom on to others—“The more you search for your place in the world, the more elusive it becomes,”  She stood.  “My advice is, be content with the little things, and you will make progress.” “We women are always putting off our dreams.” “Just listen to the wind, is my advice.”Scott conveys emotion very well.  You feel Joanna’s frustration at allowing herself to be used and, thus, committing an act of betrayal violating her own principal of “Do as you would be done by.”  She also writes very good dialogue, with occasional humor—“But I have to warn you, this is the last time I buy you lemonade.  Any self-respecting writer knows it’s the hard stuff you need to be a novelist, ladies included.”The injection of new players, partway through, considerably and significantly alters the sense of the story and leads a plot twist that is more emotional than shocking.  The final revelation, is a wonderful “ah-ha!” moment.“A Kind of Grief” is a book with a long simmer that takes time to reach its boil, but it is a very compelling pot to watch along the way.A KIND OF GRIEF (Unl.

"First Sentence:  It as shortly after dawn on a day in the late spring that carried all the promise after summer to come.When an old French Resistance fighter dies, he is found in possession of old banknotes thought to the robbery of the Neuvic Train during the War thought to be the greatest train robbery of all time.  Bruno meets Jacqueline, who is researching a story claiming the US gave clandestine support France’s nuclear program, a fact that would not go over well with upcoming elections.  A burglary, committed by thieves who target only items of value, including furniture, art and fine wines, has occurred at the vacation home of British citizen, Jack Crimson.  However, this burglary includes murder when the victim’s lover body is found.While one can appreciate Bruno realistically having more than one case on which to work as it makes it much more realistic and interesting.  However, Bruno having a profusion of women in his life can become confusing for him, and for us.  Walker is very good about connecting various threads in a rational way.  He also maintains the human element by including the personal lives of some of the secondary characters, as well as displays of Bruno’s own empathy and generosity toward others.Food and wine is a theme throughout the book, and the series.  It is France, after all. Once you’ve read even one of the books, you’ll join the legions asking Walker for a cookbook as the descriptions, detailed as they may be, just aren’t enough to satisfy—Pamela had brought a Monbazillac from Clos L’Envège, which would go perfectly with the strawberries…He’d put the marinated duck into the oven, sliced some ham…and put a place of ham and his fresh radishes at each setting on his dining room table.  Ah added some unsalted butter to each plate and sliced a big round loaf of bread from the Moulin bakery.”There is an increasing depth to the case, and that it becomes one with a far-reaching impact.  The information on the structure of French law and the manner of conducting investigations is interesting, as is the history of the Resistance fighters.  It is also interesting to come across a scene where a Frenchman has never heard of Paul Revere and must have an explanation given.  However, it is the point regarding the importance of a free press and fair elections that truly causes one to pause and consider.There is a very painful scene that might upset animal lovers, yet it is appropriately and humanely done.  This is later followed by a scene of a very personal, painful revelation presented Bruno followed by an interesting contemplation of the options.  Walker knows how to reach the readers’ heart and has imbued Bruno with depth and dimension with makes him real and appealing.  In describing a funeral, one may find it is not only the fictitious mourner’s eyes that well-up with emotion.“The Resistance Man” is a book of many layers and multiple crimes, with complex, dimensional characters.

"First Sentence:  April is a cruel month, if not the cruelest.Chen Cao was on an upward track within the Shanghai Police Department and the Communist Party.  Now he has been “promoted” to a position with no power and few responsibilities.  He suspects, but can’t prove, that he’s being set up for disgrace.  Technically, Chen is in charge of a corruption case against a powerful Party figure.  But without any support, just because you’re paranoid, doesn’t mean they’re not following you.There are many reasons to read a book by Qiu Xiaolong, but one is how much one learns about a place, history, culture and people many of us will never visit.  What’s even better is when the author has a style and voice that brings it all to live and makes us feel as though we are there.  Even the occasional awkwardness of the dialogue remind us that this is not a translation, but written by someone for whom Chinese his first language, which simply reinforces the sense of place.The literary and poetry quotations interspersed within the story, along with descriptions of meals “…crispy fried green onions and shredded port. Qiun ordered plain noodles with peeled shrimp friend with Dragon Well tea leaves, in across-the-bridge style.”...further add to a very clear sense of place and culture.  Xiaolong also makes us stop and consider…”To do nothing, it says in the Taoist classic “Dao De Jing,” makes it possible for one to do everything. Chen wanted to make his enemy believe that he was doing nothing, thereby allowing him to do whatever was necessary while they weren’t watching.”Whilst some in this country may complain about government surveillance, Qui makes it very clear as to what it is like living under a one-party system where surveillance is everywhere and in every form.  He also makes learning about Chinese history and tradition fascinating, including that of the ernai, who are similar to concubines but hold a different status and relationship.Chen is a wonderful character.  He is ethical, moral and loyal to his family and friends.  He immediately protects someone who is innocentJust when one thinks Chen truly is paranoid and we are all being led astray, there is a powerful twist that ratchets up the suspense.“Shanghai Redemption” is a fast-action read and an engrossing one which should be savoured.  The ending is very satisfactory and yet elicits an intriguing sense of future uncertainty for Chen, which is always fun.SHANGHAI REDEMPTION (Lic.

"First Sentence:  Some days I just can’t seem to focus.The body of a young boy is found in Payatas, a massive dump where people, especially young boys, scavenge for their existence.  The severely mutilated body has been brought to Father Gus Saenz, a Jesuit priest and respected forensic anthropologist.  However, this isn’t a singular case and Father Gus, along with his friend, psychologist Father Jerome Lucero, is asked by the Director of the National Bureau of Investigation to help find the killer.One should not bypass the initial page, or the subsequent transition pages, as these provide insight and a bit of humanity to the killer and, in fact, add to the story’s suspense.  However, this is also one of those times when the prologue really works.  In the midst of horror, there is note of tenderness and caring which establishes the tone of the story.Batacan has created a strong cast of characters.  Father Gus is frustrated by the Church turning a blind eye to a pedophile priest, Father Jerome who started as Saenz’ student and is now his friend; Director Lastimosa, the elderly head of the NBI, the very egotistic and ambitious Attorney Ben Arcinas, and reporter Joanna Bonifacio who was also a former student of Saenz.  The combination works to bring the story truly to life, and the animosity between some of the characters is palpable; a sign of excellent writing.It is interesting to learn about the culture and policing in the Philippines.  One can’t help but notice the focus on bathing and snacks, but we also learn of the complete inadequacy of their record keeping, technology, and inability to deal with missing persons.  Much of that goes to explaining why the Director of the NBI would turn to the Father Saenz for help.The author’s descriptions are so well done yet often difficult to read…”the man’s left shoulder touches the woman’s right one, but the corresponding hops don’t touch, as though they’re used to leaving room there for a child…”, particularly when dealing the sights and smells of the dump as contrasted by the evening at the opera with the elite.  The contrast is very well done.  Batacan’s inclusion of the meeting with the mothers and families of the child victims lends a poignancy and humanity to the story.There are three, equally important, threads to the story; the murders, political power-mongering, and the irresponsibility of the Church’s insufficient handling of internal corruption and criminality; particularly pedophilia.  The forensic information is fascinating.  It also provides a very small look into the dictatorship under which the Philippines had previously lived.Batacan’s dialogue is so well done.  The very natural…”You have to wonder what ones on in people’s heads.”  “No, I don’t,” Saenz says, pouring Jerome a cup of coffee. “And I’m a much happier man for it.  Come, sit, sit.  No use complaining about the world’s free press-we fought for it, we got it, now we have to live with the nonsense that it spews out.”, and often humorous, exchanges between the two priests provides much-needed lightness to a very dark story, and solidifies the close friendship between the two men.While many may guess the identity of the killer, and the events of the climax are rather unsurprising, it is very powerful, effective, moving and not without a good degree of suspense.  The offshoot is sadly common everywhere, yet confirms that we must hope, always hope, for change.“Smaller and Smaller Circles” is a very good, well-written book, and one which is a very affecting read.SMALLER AND SMALLER CIRCLES (Myst-FF Saenz and Lucero-Manila-Contemp) - VGBatacan, F.H. – 1st bookSoho Crime – Aug, 2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROE2ZC4TNI30P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q1I2S50#wasThisHelpful","ROE2ZC4TNI30P","A2SI6BNK5SWSMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SI6BNK5SWSMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First Sentence:  The intruder stood quite still and listened.In 1991, a man was convicted of murdering the Reverend Shipbourne during the course of a robbery.  Now, many years later, a letter appears at the police station addressed to the former Chief Inspector claiming there is evidence the man was innocent.  The police already have one case on their hands of someone placing tampered, poisoned food on the shelves of the local supermarket, and another case where a quite recent body is found during the archaeological dig of a plague pit.The story does open with a prologue—suspenseful, thrilling, and compelling without giving anything away or having been lifted from the middle of the story.  Instead, it sets the stage and carries us willingly forward into the first chapter.  At the same time, contrary as this seems, the book also could have done without it as the opening chapter also performs the same function.Although the book is designated as a “Wesley Peterson murder mystery,” this really is an ensemble cast.  What’s nice is that they are individuals, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, personal issues, and habits.  In other words, they are very human.  How can one not like a pathologist who insists on a cuppa and biscuit before discussing autopsy findings?Ellis does have a very good ear for dialogue, adding just the right touch of wryness…”Perhaps we should have a word with ex-DCI Norbert, then.”  “That’d be difficult unless you’re thinking of holding a séance…”There are three threads, from three periods of time but all woven together in the present.  The historical and archaeological information is fascinating, including the chapter-opening diary excerpts.  The plot twists are very well done and the conclusion effective.  Ellis has a remarkable ability to establish a feeling of empathy in the reader, even toward those who killed.  She doesn’t ask us to excuse their crimes, but to understand them.  Yet she then turns that emotion around with an act of complete heartlessness that it like a punch to the gut.“The Plaque Maiden” is a very good, well plotted mystery of secrets, lies, human weaknesses and regrets.THE PLAGUE MAIDEN (Pol Proc/Archeo-DI Wesley Peterson-England-Contemp) – VGEllis, Kate – 8th in seriesPiatkus, 2004","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SJ4DX9920SFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0749906685#wasThisHelpful","R1SJ4DX9920SFJ","A2SI6BNK5SWSMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SI6BNK5SWSMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First Sentence:  “You’re going to die.”A hacker took down an FBI website leaving a mysterious code found to be GPS coordinates which take them to a cemetery in Michigan where it appears a dead girl crawled out of her own grave.  Even more mysterious is that the pathologist declares the woman only died hours before; she is identified by the victim’s parents as someone who died years prior to that.  The FBI brings in Agent Jessica Blackwood, formerly a highly-successful third generation magician and illusionist, to tell them how the crime could have been done. Thus begins an exciting, and dangerous, journey of tricks…and more deaths; possibly even Jessica’s.Mayne has a very powerful, compelling voice that pulls you in and keeps you there, even when you’d rather turn away.One is immediately drawn to the protagonist; her caring and warmth.  Mayne skillfully relates her backstory as an integral part of the story; and her background is intriguing.  The flashbacks to the Jessica’s stage career not only provide a look as to what formed her personality and the level of her skills.  Jessica’s self-deprecation and resistance to being placed in the foreground is refreshing.  She doesn’t want to be seen as heroic and is always questioning the validity of her ideas.  Yet it is also nice for a protagonist to be supported, as she is, by her superiors and other team members.  The secondary character of Damian Knight—her psychopathic sidekick, as it were—is one who is both compelling and very scary.Also intriguing is that the story is told in first person so that readers aren’t given the protagonists first name—unless you read the back cover—until quite far into the story.  It’s rather too back the book jacket spoils the sense of mystery.Mayne provides us with fascinating information on the behind-the scenes look at the practice and methodologies of magicians and illusionists.  It’s done in such a way that it is a natural part of the story and serves to move the plot forward.  He has a natural ear for dialogue, both internal and spoken, and his wry humor is often a perfect antidote to the tension of the situation…”Nobody needs to know how out of place I am.  They’ll figure that out for themselves soon enough.”The plot is not perfect, thrilling though it is.  There is a “tell” that allows readers to see what is coming before the characters do, and there’s one major coincidence.  The biggest question, as one supposes it is supposed to be, is Damian’s role.  The use of him is a bit too convenient as a way to direct the investigation without the use of real procedural work being done.“Angel Killer” is engrossing, suspenseful, and very exciting with a wonderful protagonist and a promise of things to come.ANGEL KILLER (Pol Proc-Agent Jessica Blackwood-US-Contemp) – VGMayne, Andrew – 1st in seriesBourbon Street Books - 2012","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16O7HGABDSV6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062348876#wasThisHelpful","R16O7HGABDSV6C","A2SI6BNK5SWSMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SI6BNK5SWSMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First Sentence:  Michael, Is there any possible change you could sneak a day or two away from Oxford and take a look at a house for me?Oxford Professor Michael Flint receives a letter from his American friends asking him to check out an old house in Shropshire that has been empty and derelict for years, but has been found to now belong to his friend’s wife.  Charect House is in decidedly poor condition, but it’s more than that which causes Michael to be uncomfortable during his visit.  Who is watching him?  Why does he hear a clock ticking where there is none, and who is the woman captured at an attic window by his photograph?  Things become even  more puzzling when Michael meets antique dealer Nell West, a young widow with a daughter the same age as his friends’, and both girls are having the same nightmare, and ocean apart.Do you like “Ghost Hunters,” a show which tried first to debunk claims, or find a rational explanation for them and if they can’t, then it “might” be paranormal.  That is the type of paranormal mystery you’ll find here?  There is plenty to raise the hair on your arms, but it is not bloody, gory, and creepy.  From the very beginning, and the definition of the house’s name, you know there will be suspense and things that go bump and in the night…and in the day.Rayne has such a natural voice.  By opening with the exchange of letters, we learn quite a bit about Dr. Michael Flint.  He is well educated, something of a luddite, and has a cat, Wilberforce, about whom he creates wonderful adventures.  It is that sort of detail with does add humor and light to an otherwise eerie situation. Also, with Nell West and her daughter, we are provided their history, the tragedy that befell them, and how Nell rebuilt her life for the two of them.It is wonderful that the two characters are normal people; neither overly brave, but neither is foolhardy.  It is curiosity—a desire for answers—that drives them on and wanting to ensure there will be safety.  That there is a bit of a romance doesn’t hurt at all.  But Rayne is also a very literary writer occasionally driving one to a dictionary…”welter of jingoism…” or the internet to do research of one’s own.There is a very strong sense of place and atmosphere…”The scent of age met Michael at once, and it was so strong that for a moment he felt his senses blur.  But this was not the musty dankness of damp or rot; this was age at its best and most evocative; a potpourri of old seasons timbers and long-ago fires, and a lingering scent of dried lavender.”This is a first book and it is not perfect.  Although always interesting, there is too much “telling” through letters and diaries, than showing the reader the events.  Even so, without the book being set in multiple time periods, I’m not certain that could have been avoided.“Property of a Lady” is a wonderful paranormal mystery with just the right balance of light and dark that leaves you with a “bump in the night” moment at the very end.PROPERTY OF A LADY (Par Mys-Michael Flint/Nell West-England-Contemp) – VGRayne, Sarah – 1st in seriesSevern House, 2011","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZGVZZ9BHZKUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0727880284#wasThisHelpful","RZGVZZ9BHZKUB","A2SI6BNK5SWSMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SI6BNK5SWSMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First Sentence: Running, running, stumbling, running.Armand Gamache, retired from being the former head of homicide for the Sreté du Québec, and his wife Reine-Marie are now living in Three Pines. Armand befriends a young boy known to have an overwhelming imagination telling stories of beasts and monsters to the residents of the town. When he claims to have found something that others must see, no one takes him seriously. Until he disappears and it’s found the story was not fiction, but very real, and very dangerous; changing the lives of the residents and potentially impacting far more than the tiny village of Three Pines.We begin with a situation that is tense and threatening—or is it. Such is the uncertainty to which we are introduced. Never was an author more adept at descriptions, painting verbal pictures that take us from the sublime to the comic. Penny conveys emotion so well. You feel the support of Reine-Marie, Armand’s wife, for her husband, yet her concern as well, the closeness and teasing of the circle of friends and their concern for one another.Penny has created a cast of characters who become real to us. Even if one has not read previous books in the series, many seem to be as old friends, yet we learn more about some of them, and find some are not as we had previously perceived. Yet, the circle has expanded, as there are new members as well. As with life, all are imperfect people, some with very human phobias; they are, some with character weaknesses; some small, some very large and serious. Some characters accept the responsibilities and results of their weaknesses, while others have buried them away within themselves, and others simply refuse to acknowledge them at all.The underlying theme of the story and an excellent discussion to all art in general, is whether we can, or should, separate art from its creator…”Do you think a work should be judged by its creator? Or should it stand on its own?” …”Would I want a painting by Jeffrey Dahmer, or to serve a meal from the Stalin family cookbook?...” There is a play within the story, and the point at which Penny anthropomorphizes it, is interesting indeed.Penny takes the readers from light, to shadow, and into complete blackness; both real and conceptually. Her imagery can break your heart, and both the readers and the characters are thrust into the completely unexpected. The story is remarkable and frightening in that a central element is based on an actual person in history.Yet not all is darkness. The dialogue is easy and natural. At times it is light and teasing, re-affirming the relationships between the characters. Mouth-watering descriptions of meals shared—also helps lighten the mood…”The scallops were large and succulent and grilled golden brown. They lay on a bed of grains and fresh herbs and roasted pine nuts and goat cheese next to a warm grilled apple.” Yet, Penny also understands the relationship of people to their surroundings…”If the topic of conversation was harsh, at least the atmosphere could be gentle.”One cannot help but enjoy Ms. Penny’s literary and pop-culture references; from Yeats, to “Lord of the Rings,” to old Andy Hardy movies--such things bring us comfort, make us feel safe and add an air of normalcy to the darkness one senses is coming. And yes, darkness is a major theme; the darkness of absolutely grief, physical darkness and the fear it can inspire, the darkness of war, the darkness of men’s souls, and the darkness in our own minds that obscures our perception of what is right and wrong.This book is no cozy, although it does not contain any graphic violence. Plot twists are used very effectively to cleverly and horribly complete a circle. This is a true traditional mystery with emotional depth demonstrating how something which happens locally can have a far-reaching impact.“Nature of the Beast” is wonderfully plotted; intricate and compelling. It makes you think and feel. It contains all the best elements of racing against time and against true evil. And finally, it is about having the awareness of having to face oneself, one’s past and one’s actions, and then having the strength to move forward.THE NATURE OF THE BEAST (Trad/Pol Proc-Armand Gamache-Three Pines, Canada-Contemp) - ExPenny, LouiseMinotaur Books – Aug, 2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZUCMNLQJ49UD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250022088#wasThisHelpful","R1ZUCMNLQJ49UD","A2SI6BNK5SWSMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SI6BNK5SWSMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First Sentence:  Amos Decker would forever remember all three of their violent deaths in the most paralyzing shade of blue.Amos Decker made it to the NFL, but suffered a hit in his first game that killed him; twice.  He was revived and forever changed.  His second career was as a police detected.  That career nearly destroyed his life when his family was murdered, and Amos ended up in the bottle and on the street.  Just starting to put himself back together and working as a freelance PI, Decker is called back to help the Police after a man confesses to the murder of his family.  Is it a lie, or can Decker finally learn the truth?The opening chapter is wonderfully written yet excruciatingly difficult to read.  Baldacci perfectly balances both the horror and the pain of protagonist, Amos Decker.  He draws a painfully accurate picture of a person hitting rock bottom, and then working to survive and rebuild.Decker is a strong protagonist and a memorable one, both for his perspective…”How can killing so many people ever make sense?” she said hotly.  “It doesn’t have to make sense to us.  Just to the ones who did it.”…and for the conditions of synesthesia (seeing people as colors) and hyperthymesia (being able to recall almost every day of their lives in near perfect detail, as well as public events that hold some personal significance to them) with which he now must live.  Although they help him in solving crimes, it’s hard to imagine trying to live with them.It is fascinating watching the way Decker tracks the motive of the case back into the past.  Baldacci likes plot twists.  One finds oneself thinking you know where he’s going, and he may go partway where you expect, but it’s a tease as he doesn’t quite go there.  The result of the twist at the end is definitely not expected.No matter what else, the climax is brutal, yet unexpected and very well done.  The final chapter is touching the very gratifying.“Memory Man” has great characters, well done suspense, excellent plot twists and leaves one anxious for the next book.MEMORY MAN (PI-Amos Decker-Burlington-Contemp) – EXBaldacci, David – 1st in seriesGrand Central Publishing – April 2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LX3S7CTV35ZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455559822#wasThisHelpful","R3LX3S7CTV35ZL","A2SI6BNK5SWSMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SI6BNK5SWSMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First Sentence:  The seventh of July was a magnificent summer’s day, one of those majestic Atlantic days that always lifted Commissaire Dupin’s spirits.Parisian transplant, Comm. Dupin’s morning coffee is ruined by learning of the murder of Pierre-Louis Pennac, owner of the Central Hotel in Pont-Aven.  But who would murder a ninety-one-year-old man.  Dupin needs to find out before the crimes also murders the town’s tourist season.Dupin is a somewhat deceptive protagonist.  At first meeting, one might not be that impressed; yet one’s impression quickly changes with the arrival of a murder.  He has a slight “Columbo” style of “just one more thing…” that is delightful.  LeBar, Dupin’s second, is interesting.  He has come to know Dupin’s style, and to anticipate his needs.  Nolween, the woman who holds things together at the police station, is wonderfully resourceful.  It is through her that we learn the history of Brittany and the Breton.Set in Pont-Avan, it is interesting to learn the history of the town and its link to the Paul Gaugain and the other artists of his time.  Wonderful descriptions provide an evocative sense of place…” Inhale in Concarneau and you tasted sale, iodine, seaweed, mussels in every breath, like a distillation of the entire endless expanse of the Atlantic, brightness and light.”  “As evening came on, the light became more and more bewitching.  The colours of witchcraft:  everything shone brightly, warm soft and golden.”  One is tempted to pack their bags and book a flight.Food features deliciously in the story. Sometimes there are those things which are not so appealing; others times things such as Dupin’s favorite entrecote and chips; aka rib-eye steak and fries.  It’s interesting the diversions Bannalec takes in order to provide descriptions of locations.  It’s not a bad thing, just an interesting style.  It is also interesting the way Dupin will plan to, or say he is going somewhere immediately, but then doesn’t.  Bannalec conveys both the satisfaction of solving a case, and the frustration that can come from the actions of the higher-ups afterward.  Yet Dupin, as does the ancient town in which he lives, perseveres.“Death in Brittany” has a plot definitely keeps one involved and the motive, when finally revealed, was interesting.  There are excellent, shocking twists, yet it is always a delight when one reaches the “ah ha!” moment.DEATH IN BRITTANY (Pol Proc-Comm.

"First Sentence:  I took a walk to clear my head after the long flight and found that it wouldn’t clear.Contemplating ending his life, former seminarian Own Keane, now a detective, comes to Kenya in response to the plea of a friend.  In the process, he is staying with a local priest, befriended by a young local boy, and becomes involved in the investigation of the murder of a man claiming to be the reincarnation of a long-dead warrior hero.Faherty does a very good job of introducing us to the protagonist, but we are still left with many questions unfilled, which may be due to this being the 8th books of the series.  That does make it challenging for those new to the series, however.  Still, Keane is an intriguing protagonist and one can appreciate his references to “Magnum PI” as well as an appropriate quote from Andrew Greeley.  In some ways, the supporting characters are even more interesting; young Basil is a delight, and the mystic Mogu particularly stand out.The dialogue is very well done, with just the right among of humor with references to “Magnum, P.I.” and an exchange relating to Sherlock Holmes…”And then I could have said, ‘But the dog didn’t bark in the night.’ To which you could have replied, ‘That was the curious behavior.’”  “There’d have been copyright issues,” I said.  One can also appreciate a very interesting conversation of a struggle between those of faith and those without.  It is one of those valued elements of a story that makes you pause and consider.Faherty is better at introducing readers into this new and unfamiliar setting, providing both geographic and political information.  Although the story gets off to a rather slow start, he does have a wonderful author’s voice…”A man of my curiosity and spiritual bent. Or curiously bent spirituality.”… and with each page, the story then become more compelling.“Eastward in Eden” is a short read.

"First Sentence:  “Where are we going?”John Rebus is out of retirement, demoted and now reporting to his protégée, Siobhan Clarke.  A 30-year-old murder case has been reopened and Malcolm Fox, in his last case for Internal Affairs, is working it.  A link is made in that that case brings into question the team with whom Rebus first worked, “Saints of the Shadow Bible.”The opening scene reveals much of Rebus’ personality—he’s tenacious…”like a bloodhound with a scent…”; he never gives up on a case.  He is described by a colleague as being “…a breed of cop that wasn’t supposed to exist anymore, are and endangered species.”  For those who have followed the series, it is interesting to see how the character, and his life, has changed over time.  Enough references to the past are made, however, that even new readers won’t feel lost.  Set in the period just prior to vote on Scotland’s referendum for independence, it’s also interesting to see how that affects the case and the transitions it has made to policing in Scotland.A person’s shopping list tells quite a bit about them.  In Rebus’ case, it’s cigarettes and bacon.  The combination of Rebus, Siobhan, and Malcolm Fox is both interesting.  One does see how with maturity comes clarity and there is a nice balance of Rebus and Malcolm being opposite sides of a coin.  Rebus’ actions, while in keeping with the character, are exasperating both to his colleagues, but also to the reader.  It diminishes the story, rather than adding to it.Rankin is a very spare writer.  He tells you what you need to know, but doesn’t waste much of his time on filler.  This well suits worth the characters and the story.  The fact that shootings are so rare in Scotland makes reading about the attention such an incident generates both interesting and very sad as compared to America.“Saints of the Shadow Bible” is a good read, but far from Rankin’s best.  In the end, it seemed rather flat and uninspired.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R342R2QR3QXAX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316224553#wasThisHelpful","R342R2QR3QXAX0","A2SI6BNK5SWSMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SI6BNK5SWSMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Nor did they include learning a local girl had recently been murdered and left in a way that suggests a ritual.  But the killer isn’t done.

Stewart makes her protagonist very approachable and rather self-deprecating; a lovely trait considering Gianetta’s profession.With the same clarity of writing, we also know the other characters in the story through their descriptions, mannerisms and speech.  It’s nice that she included both certain character’s dialects and Gaelic phrases.  What is particularly clever is the use of one of the characters, actress Marcia, who, smoothly and naturally, introduces many of the other characters to both us and to Gianetta.It’s the small touches that make the time and setting come to life, such as remembering that this was an age when most people smoked, or that some placed still used dip-pens.  There were also delightfully British turns-of-phrase…”She wasn’t just hit or stabbed or choked in a fit of human passion.  She was deliberately done to death…”  At the same time, there are ideas from then that still hold true…”Don’t you know yet that there’s no room for pride in marriage?  You have to choose between the two.”…and the age old question of the limits of loyalty.  Her descriptions of place are evocative…”And, locked in the great arms of the mountains, the water lay quiet as a burnished shield, reflecting the deeper blue and deeper gold the pageantry of hill and sky.”Although traditionally regarded as ""romantic suspense""--I suspect by the men who ran publishing companies--the emphasis is much more on the mystery than on romance.  While there is a touch of romance done in classic 50’s fashion of conversations not shared with the audience, and activities taking place behind closed doors, they story is, at its heart with excellent red herrings and plenty of suspense, an exciting climax and a wonderful ending.“Wildfire at Midnight” is one of those wonderful books that doesn’t grow old or passé.  Much more of a traditional suspense than romantic-suspense, it is as wonderful a read today, as it was when first published, and Ms. Stewart should be considered among the classic authors.WILDFIRE AT MIDNIGHT (Sups-Gianetta Brooke Drury-Scotland-Contemp) - VGStewart, Mary – StandaloneWilliam Morrow and Company – 1956","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KMTUWYHV13MU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014CETR8#wasThisHelpful","R3KMTUWYHV13MU","A2SI6BNK5SWSMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SI6BNK5SWSMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First Sentence:  Julia was wild that night, her long blonde hair streaming as she danced like a maenad among the trees.In 2012, a group of friends formed the Cyrenaics, and followed the philosophy of sensual hedonism, until one of their members died of an overdose, another disappeared, one moved to Canada, and another is believed to have committed suicide.  When the last turns up, found in a submerged car two years later, Marjory and are team must find out what really happened.We begin with wonderfully evocative descriptions…”There was an edge of frost tonight and above the angled branches of the trees the black bowl of night sky was studded with diamonds. Tonight you could almost hear the music of the spheres…interwoven with the restless muttering of the trees.”  Templeton is a very literary author who uses language very well, and can reference both Baudelaire and the same paragraph, along with quotes from Robert Burns, courtesy of DI Fleming’s sergeant Tam MacNee.The very effective prologue and first chapter lay the groundwork and compel us into the story.  Templeton has an interesting style of creating the setting, introducing the characters and building the story without the reader being certain of where the path will lead.  Yet one thing of which one is certain is that mystery lies ahead.Rather than the police acting as a cohesive team, Templeton places us within an oft-found group of people with their own ambitions and jealousies, making getting things done all the harder.  The characters include Marjory who tends to be brusque, are not altogether likable and there seems to be a lot of in-fighting, but give them time.  Relationships change and cohesion prevails. Even so, it’s nice to see the personal lives that support many of the characters, including the development of one a new relationship.  .The story is a little hard to get into as there are so many pieces to the puzzle.  There is also a thread that was, rather frustratingly, dropped.Templeton does write good dialogue, sometimes with a bit of wry, Scottish humor…”Never trust those one—“grave, tideless-blooded, calm and cool”,’ MacNee said.  “And school teachers—I’ve never been overfond of them either, except my old English teacher—I’d never have heard of Rabbie Burns if it wasn’t for him.”  ‘I wondered whose fault it was,’ Fleming said…“The Third Sin” is a well-done mystery; it is realistic in that mistakes are made, people aren’t all likable, and not all endings are completely satisfactory, yet there is still hope.THE THIRD SIN (Pol Proc-DI Marjory Fleming-Scotland-Contemp) – G+Templeton, Aline – 9th in seriesAllison and Busby – April 2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3744O5BTR9FWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0749016388#wasThisHelpful","R3744O5BTR9FWV","A2SI6BNK5SWSMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SI6BNK5SWSMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First Sentence:  On a Sunday in the third week of November outside my half-burnt home on Tyler Beach, N.H., while attempting to nail a heavy blue tarp on a gaping hole above the shutters front door, I learned quite the important lesson:  The bright decal on folding stepladders that warns you not to step on the very top is there for a reason.Ex-State Department employee turned journalist is asked to do a favor for his friend, and former lover, reporter Paula Quinn.  Her new fiancée has gone missing.  Considering the man is a lawyer and member of the town council, when Cole starts asking question, no one seems very concerned.  What is odd is that a man who supposedly being raised in Vermont has a Wyoming social security number.  With the help of his friend Felix Tinios, he starts following a trail which becomes more dangerous every step of the way, all the while worrying about the fate of his badly fire-damaged house from an impending hurricane heading its way.It is a good bet that more than a few readers will be able to empathize with the opening, in one way or another.  It is also an effective hook.  DuBois has a very good first-person voice… “A couple of weeks ago, however, the routine had been disrupted—which is like saying the Civil War was a bar brawl that got out of hand--…”  He also creates a nice, impending sense of dread with the hurricane moving up the coast.Although there are references to a previous book, new readers will be more intrigued than frustrated by the references.  If they are moved to read the previous book or books, it’s all to the better.DuBois does create an interesting mix of characters.  Cole has an interesting past which makes it clear he wasn’t just pushing papers for the State Department, but he is a man of strong commitment and loyalty.  He believes in doing what is right and not taking shortcuts.  He is definitely someone you’d want to know.  A nice balance is his friend Felix…”originally from the North End of Boston and now residing in North Tyler as a security consultant—which he always manages to say with a straight face—…”  Well dressed and a lover of the finer things, it is clear Felix has less than legal connections.  Add in his friend and injured policewoman Diane, and you have a strong circle of personalities.  In some ways, the least dynamic character is Paula, the friend for whose fiancée Cole searches.  There are times when she seems remarkably naive for a journalist.In addition to Felix being a particularly interesting character, which he is, he also makes us wish to join him at the table…”Felix placed an order for a filet mignon—medium rare—with a side of two lobster tails, risotto, and house salad.” … “Felix had a veal dish with a side of pasta, while I had lobster fettuccine…”  These, and other instances, provide a nice pause in the action.For those who live in, or know the area of the book, it is very much as though you are along for the ride.  However, even those who do not can appreciate the observations regarding how the Bush recession impacted small towns…”Lots of powerful things were being closed or being threatened.  It must have been nice to live in a time when powerful things were being built and opened.”“Blood Foam” is filled with excellent twists, very good suspense from several sources, and a well-done ending.  One does appreciate a noble protagonist.BLOOD FOAM (Mys/Jour – Louis Cole – New Hampshire – Contemp) – VG+DuBois, Brendan – 9th in seriesPegasus Books – June, 2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YC011VURZKI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1605987905#wasThisHelpful","R2YC011VURZKI4","A2SI6BNK5SWSMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SI6BNK5SWSMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First Sentence:  When Wyoming game warden Joe Pickett received the call every parent dreads, he was standing knee-high in thick sagebrush counting the carcasses of sage grouse.When Joe Pickett receives a call about the body of a girl being found in a ditch by the highway, it is suspected to be his ward, April, who had taken off with rodeo champion Dallas Cates.  Cates’ family gives him an alibi, and there’s evidence pointing to someone else.  But Joe isn’t convenience and is determined to learn the truth…one way or another.There’s no question but that C.J. Box knows who to write a completely compelling book.  He’s the type of author whose story you start at page one, and find yourself in exactly the same spot several hours later when you’ve finished the book.Pickett is such a wonderful, fully-dimensional character.  You know who he is and for what he stands.  He is moral and principled, as well as determined to find the truth, particularly when it impacts his family.  Don’t for a second, however, think that makes him perfect or boring.  He is the sort of person you’d want on your side.  The balance between Joe and his wife, Marybeth, rings absolutely true, with each playing to their strengths.  The same also applies to his relationship with his daughters.  And then there’s Nate.  Followers of the series, fear not.  Nate is there exactly when it matters.On the other hand, Box does create some villains who will make your skin crawl.  They’re not over the top, but they are definitely not someone you’d ever what to know.“Endangered” is an excellent plot-driven story, with great characters and nail-biting suspense.

"First Sentence:  It started at one thirty on a cold Tuesday morning in January when Martin Turner, street performer and, in his own words, apprentice gigolo, tripped over a body in front of the West Portico of St. Paul’s at Covent Garden.Constable Peter Grant is still on probation and about to be assigned a post where his days will be filled with paper.  It is only by happenstance, that he stumbles on a murder scene and an eyewitness who happens to be a ghost.  This unusual situation brings results in his being assigned to assist Det. CI Thomas Nightingale, head of—in fact, the only member of—a unit which investigates the unusual.  In this case, they’re facing a turf war, not between gangs, but between gods and goddess of the Rivers of the Thames.One shouldn’t even try to compare this book to anything else.  Although it has elements of many other authors, Aaronvitch is unique, or a brilliant amalgamation, depending upon your viewpoint.  One does look forward to tiny homage to other characters, as well as very subtle literary references, but there shall be no spoilers here.  He has a wonderful voice with classic wry humor.Told in the first person, we have Constable Grant, who is rather unusual; and Nicholas Wallpenny, who is more unusual still; and DCI Nightingale; most unusual of all…“Nightingale sighed. “No,” he said. “Not like Harry Potter.”  “In what way?”  “I’m not a fictional character,” said Nightingale.  Still, one can’t help but like the completely “normal” DCI Seawall.The book is an interesting balance of the fanciful and the dark.  However, the further you do go into the story, the deeper you are into the world of the supernatural, and the further still you want to go.  However, it is also a fascinating mix of the procedural, forensic and scientific. “Magic, it turned out, was just like science in that sometimes it was a question of spotting the bleeding obvious.”  Aaronvitch also presents interesting historical and geographic facts in a very non-scholarly manner.  How often does one think about where might be the source of the Thames?Aaronvitch is very good at conveying the chaos of one climatic scene, yet not allowing the reader to become lost.  There is very good tension and suspense with a style so visual; one feels as if they are watching a film.“Midnight Riot” is neither Harry Potter, nor Harry Dresden. It is an absolutely delightful, engrossing, marvelous book and, happily, only the beginning of the series.MIDNIGHT RIOT (Pol Proc/Para-DI Peter Grant-London-Contemp) - VGAaronvitch, Ben – 1st in seriesDel Rey – February, 2010 / Kindle Edition – February, 2011","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YGU4C5GZAYR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004C43F70#wasThisHelpful","R2YGU4C5GZAYR3","A2SI6BNK5SWSMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SI6BNK5SWSMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First Sentence:  “Gingerbread?  You’re sure it was gingerbread she asked for, Gracie?”Death comes to a country estate when Lady Truelove is killed by a horse known for becoming violent.  Or was she? Scotland Yard Assistant Commissioner Joe Sandiland is asked to investigate but the situation is complicated by Joe’s dislike of Sir James Truelove, who is also patron of Dorcus Jolifee, the woman Joe hopes to marry.Cleverly excels at creating a sense of time and place.  Here, we have a very clear picture of the titled/social set in the 1930s from dialogue, which is reflective of the time and suitable to the various classes; to food… “Joe was glad he’d taken the hint and declared for the strawberries; the plump miracles of summer magic were duly served on Delft-patterned dishes with a matching pot of yellow Devon cream so think it had to be spooned from the jug.”; to dress, “Suit is from Monsieur Worth and perfume from Mademoiselle Chanel, Officer.”  One also can’t help but enjoy the inclusion of several literary passages.This is very much a character/relationship-driven story with wonderful characters.  It is rather nice to learn that the protagonist has shortcomings and to learn more about his background.  However, there is one scene where one might be a bit disappointed by his attitude.  Although Dorcus—known to readers of previous books—only plays a minor role here, the return of Lily Wentworth, former PC now working as a private enquiry agent, is delightful.  Dr. Adelaide Hartest is also a wonderful addition to the story.“Enter Pale Death” lures you in with bucolic descriptions, underlain with tension, escalating to a rather shocking scene. That said, the interesting and unexpected ending could leave one feeling a bit disconcerted.

"First Sentence:  It seemed to Bosch to be a form of torture heaped upon torture.Retirement is closing in on Harry Bosch, working in the Open-Unsolved Unit.  To provide training to new officers, he has been assigned Lucia (Lucy) Soto, a young officer definitely on the way up.  Their first case is a Mariachi guitarist who was shot 20 years ago, but only recently died from the bullet still lodged near his spine.  Was it a gang shooting, or something different; perhaps even intended for a different target?  That’s not the only case.  When Lucy was young, she was the only survivor of a day-care center fire.  Although it was ruled accidental, that may not have been true at all, and she wants answers.From the start, we have a sense of who Harry is and a tiny glimpse as to what drives him.  However, it also seems very clear that not only is Harry about to retire, but Connelly is very ready to retire him.As always, Connelly’s writing is crisp and spare, but it was also highly repetitive and became mired down in the details.  Yes, the procedural details were interesting and informative, but do we really need to know every road Bosch takes and every detail of every meal?  And let’s not overlook the massive coincidence.  About the only thing that was missed where his bathroom breaks.“The Burning Room” was a disappointment.  Normally, Connelly is a straight-through read.

"First Sentence:  Death comes in on track three at 8:qr in the morning, seven minutes behind schedule.A killer is loose in Naples; anonymous and methodical, yet keeping a diary, known about only to him, of his actions. Insp. Giuseppe Lojancono is mistrusted as a suspected snitch to the Mafia, and has been transferred to an inconsequential post in Naples.  The only thing he is supposed to do is paperwork; no cases.  It’s not his fault that he’s the only one on duty when a call comes in about a murder.  In fact, it is the third execution-style killing of a young person, all within days of each other.  Magistrate Laura Piras quickly learns that Lojancono is the only one to have picked up on clues missed by others and orders he be assigned to the investigation.What a wonderfully evocative and compelling opening.  The narrative, which progresses through the story, is chilling for its complete objectivity.de Giovanni has excelled at creating an excellent character in Lojancono who is isolated by circumstances outside his own making.  It creates a strong bond of empathy to the reader.  Yet he balances that character with others who form a link to Lojancono, yet have insecurities and failings of their own.There are wonderfully descriptive passages throughout…”Dawn on a rainy day.  There’s not a specific moment when you see the dawn.  Suddenly it’s there, sliding into view while you had your mind on other things.”  The one weakness, however, is in the dialogue which often seems awkward, possibly due to issues in translation.This is definitely a darker book than his “Deed” series, but de Giovanni is such a fine writer, he draws you in and makes you want to know about the people and where the story is going.“Crocodile” is, in an odd way, a story of broken relationships, and includes a very good description of grief.  There is an excellent building of suspense as the pace of the story accelerates.  All the pieces are brought together to a stunning conclusion.  de Giovanni is an author very worth reading.THE CROCODILE (Pol Proc-Inspet.

"except the murder scene of the lead’s understudy, in one of the ballets, to have been real.  Which man was the intended victim?  Lord Powerscourt is called in to find out.  But members of the ballet are not the only Russians in London. Two you men from very wealthy Russian families stole their mother’s valuable jewels in a fit of pique. They sent them to London with a member of the ballet company to be sold. Also, followers of the revolutionist Lenin are there to change millions of rubles, stolen from a bank in Russia, into pounds.  Can Powerscourt, with the help of his wife Lucy and friend Johnny Fitzgerald, put all the pieces together?There is much to like in this book, starting with the very chapter headings.  Good chapter headings are always a treat, and Dickinson wisely chose to use ballet terms and their definitions for this book.  What he also does is demonstrate the world of wealth, connections and protocol Lord Powerscourt inhabits, and the hierarchy of investigating the dead: if one was English, they rate an inspector; if European, a sergeant; Africans only rate a detective constable.Dickinson smoothly integrates real historical figures with fictional characters, as well as incorporating historical information into the plot.  One often hears about the Bolsheviks, and their involvement with Lenin and Stalin, but it is nice to learn about them, in a simplified context, and for what they stood.  The story also really makes clear the animosity and distrust between nations.All of the characters, are fully-dimensional, particularly Powerscourt.  We know not only about the investigation, but his family life and how that plays into the investigation through the connections both he and his wife have.  At the same time, it is pleasant that he is not a snob, yet quite egalitarian in this treatment of the young sergeant and others of a lower social class.  What is also delightful is the elements of observation and humor…”The answer came in a whisper.  Powerscourt had often remarked how people thought they could minimize the effect of some terrible news by announcing it in the lowest of voices.”For all the good, however, this is not the best book in the series.  Dickinson is very good at taking a seemingly small stream and adding tributaries until it becomes a wild, rushing, tumbling river, finally opening it up into a wide, flat body of water.  In this case, there were are few too many tributaries and it became a difficult river to navigate.“Death Comes to the Ballets Russes” contains some very effective drama, broken by subtle humor, but the narrative resolution is a bit of an anticlimax.  Still, it is a respectable addition to the series.DEATH COMES TO THE BALLETS RUSSES (Hist Mys-Lord Francis Powerscourt – England – 1912) – GoodDickinson, DavidConstable – January 2015","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23PWUV4PQXYY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PY26WFQ#wasThisHelpful","R23PWUV4PQXYY2","A2SI6BNK5SWSMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SI6BNK5SWSMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First Sentence:  It is a wood-paneled room of sumptuous size—the abbots of Perton have always done themselves well.In 1141, England was engulfed in civil war between King Stephen and his cousin, the Empress Matilda over who would wear the crown.  It is 1180 and a dying abbot has one last important task to accomplish.  He summons a young scribe in order to document a much more personal story set during that backdrop and occurring during a long, brutal siege winter.While readers were heartbroken by the death of Ariana Franklin and the incredible cliffhanger left in her last book in the “Mistress of the Art of Death” series, this does not resolve that series. However, for both prior and new readers, you are in for such a treat.  This book was begun by Ms. Franklin (aka Diana Norman) prior to her death, and has been completed by her daughter, Samantha Norman.  While that is wonderful in itself, what is truly remarkable is that the fusion is absolutely seamless.There is no awkward transition between the two authors; it is all one voice.  No, the language is not of the period.  To that, there was the explanation given by Ms. Franklin at the end of “Grave Goods,” …”…in twelfth-century England the common people spoke a form of English even less comprehensive than Chaucer’s.  In the fourteenth; the nobility spoke Normal French, and the clergy spoke Latin.  Since people then sounded contemporary to one another, and since I hate the use of what I call “gadzooks” in historical novels to denote a past age, I insist on making those people sound modern to the reader.”  One can’t argue with that.For us readers, the story begins with the history given, the stage set, the players assembled and the curtain drawn on what, from the very start, we know will be a wonderful tale.  The narrative is fascinating and, periodically through the story, moves the tale forward while providing historical context. The story provides wonderful details of castle life, and what it takes to run and defend a castle during this period.What a wonderful assembly of characters.  Each leaps off the page into full life and touches our emotions.  Gwilherm de Vannes, a mercenary soldier, and his conversations with God are a true delight…”And what now, Lord?  Eh?  How can I protect her from herself?”  “That’s a tricky one, Gwil.  That’s the question.  Even I can’t help you there I’m afraid.”  Young Pen, whom he rescues, is a survivor who learns to cope with events in her own way.  Maud, forced into marriage and now finds herself having to defend her castle with the help of Sir Rollo, commander of her troops and protect her son, William.  There is a mystery to the story, and a villain which is as evil as a villain can be.  This is the time of the Plantagenets, and the history is important, but the story is very much a human story.However, considering One really doesn’t want to say too much for fear of spoiling what is an absolutely wonderful read. It is a story one would love to see brought to the screen, but only if it included every single page filmed exactly as it is on the page.“The Siege Winter” is exciting, stirring, filled of tension and can bring one to tears but has a conclusion which makes one smile and touches the heart.  Do you know how hard it is to write review notes when one is crying?  It is a story which stays with you long after the last page.  At the bottom of my review notes, I wrote Ex+++++++.  Were it possible to rate a book 10 out of 5 stars, this would be it.  I loved every page; every word.  It doesn’t get better than that.

"First Sentence:  The angel of death made its way through the festa, and nobody noticed.The beautiful Duchess of Camparino has been found dead of a gunshot wound…or was she smothered?  It is up to the solitary Commissario Riccardi and his partner, Brigadier Maione, to solve the crime while dealing with their own personal issues.There is nothing better than an opening which is both compelling and done with very evocative descriptions.  What is particularly clever is that throughout the story, we have the diary entries of a nameless character.  Just when we think we’ve identified the writer, another hint is dropped and we are sent off in a different direction.The cast of characters is extensive, yet each character is distinct.  The most intriguing is Riccardi, who has the gift, or curse, of “the Deed”; the ability to see those who have died by violence—accidents, murder, or suicide—in the last few second of the life and to hear their final words or thoughts. This ability isolates him from all but a few people.  At his side, and ever loyal, is Maione who is married with 5 children, Doctor Modo the medical examiner, and Rosa Riccardi’s childhood nanny who still looks after him.While the story is a police procedural, it is so much more than that.  It is a character-driven novel which is very much about relationships; love, insecurities, passions, and the acts to which one can be driven by love.  The author meshes the characters with the story so skillfully; we feel part of the community.  Each character is fully-developed and we have no desire to by-pass any of them.Yes, the translation can feel awkward at times, particularly the dialogue, but that is easily forgiven. The quality and complexity of the story overcome any other shortcomings.“Everyone In Their Place” is a story of passion and human weaknesses.  There are no perfect characters; but each one is perfectly conveyed.  This is a series I highly recommend.EVERYONE  IN THEIR PLACE (Pol Proc-Comm Riccardi/Brig.

"First Sentence:  On a Monday morning in September, three weeks into the job, the Tiverton policeman took a call from his sergeant:  shots fired on Bitter Wash Road.Paul Hirschhausen (""Hirsch"") has been demoted to Constable, and sent to back-of-beyond Australia where he's mistrusted and berated by his ""fellow"" officers.  Internal Investigations in Adelaide is still after him, trying to convict him of something and willing to plant evidence to do it.  In the meantime, even in his remote locate, there are crimes to be solved, including the body of a 16-year-old girl found by the side of the road.If one ever read Rhys Bowen's ""Hamish Macbeth"" series, Hirsch's posting will remind one of that.  However, that is the only similarity.  Disher takes us about as far as possible from Hamish's Scotland, down to Southern Australia, but acquaints us with the area with wonderfully visual descriptions...""October gathered its skirts and raced past.""Disher provides very good backstory on Hirsch.  The inclusion of his inquest was both interesting, but allows for his speculation as to why some cops go bad.  We also see the frustration of a god cop working for, and with, bad cops; the blindness of ""the thin blue line, and how corrupting that can be.  On the other hand, it is interesting to see the diversity of calls to which a rural cop must respond and the relationship he must maintain with the community.Disher does a wonderful job building up the suspense and tension.  One can't help but appreciate the source from which Hirsch's rescue comes.""Hell to Pay"" is an excellent read; an extremely well-written book dealing with very timely issues.HELL TO PAY (Pol Proc - Const.

"First Sentence:  Betty Jo Dean lay as she had for over thirty years, shrouded in black vinyl, forever seventeen.In 1982, Jonah Ridy, a reporter for the Chicago Sun Times, is given the chance to restore his reputation as an investigative journalist by travelling to a small town for a follow-up piece about a man who has been shot and whose girlfriend is missing.  In spite of his very cold reception, he perseveres, even though people around him start dying.  One death finally causes him to walk away.  Thirty-years later, the town has a new mayor, an outsider.  The more he learns about the town’s secrets, the more determined he is to find the answers—no matter the cost.This is a story of three parts, each completely engrossing.  In the first part, we meet Betty Jo Dean.  Fredrickson makes us feel her fear and desperation.  No mater her background, we empathize with her.  In the second part, we come to know Jonah Ridy.  We want him to be redeemed and to solve the mystery, but we greatly fear for him.  In the third, and major section of the story, we have Mayor Mac Bassett who, with the support of his ex-wife, waitress and others, is determined to find the answers.  Fredrickson does a masterful job of introducing us to Mac and establishing his personality, thereby explaining his actions.The sign of a really good story is when you become so involved and invested in one time period; you are started when there is a shift.  You have to trust that the author will bring the parts together so that it all makes sense.  Frederickson definitely achieved that.The only very, very slight flaw to the book was having a prologue.  Rather than having that section at the beginning, it would have been better to leave it only within the relevant section of the story.  Having the prologue wasn’t really necessary and diminished the impact of the information when it did appear later.  The second, itty-bitty criticism is that the final status of the main characters was a bit twee, but perhaps that’s more a reaction of jealousy.There are some authors one discovers, and enjoys, but feels their writing could be so much “more.”  This book is definitely the “more” for which one has been waiting.  This book is the one from Fredrickson for which I’ve been waiting.“Silence the Dead” is very well plotted, without any reliance on coincidences.  Everything is rationally, logically, or emotionally based and appropriate.  The forensic information is critical, well-explained, and fascinating.  The level of suspense is ratcheted up at a steady pace with excellent twists right up to the very end.

"First Sentence:  On an evening in late March 1917, I climbed to the third floor of Lucius Grenville’s Grosvenor Street house in search of peace, and found a lady weeping instead.A society matron implores Captain Lacey to locate her missing necklace in order to provide the innocence of her maid.  With the help of his friends, Lady Breckenridge, Lucius Grenville and two of his staff, the path leads them to scandals and secrets from the past, as well as in competition with the dangerous criminal, James Denis.Followers of this wonderful series will appreciate this ten-chapter novella, set between “The Sudbury School Murders” and “A Body in Berkeley Square.  However, this story is also an excellent introduction for new readers.Gardner absolutely knows how to capture the reader’s attention from the very beginning.  She does an excellent job of capturing the flavor of speech from the period, without it being overdone, and the wry humor is delightful.  The descriptions of meals are nearly painful to read due to their lusciousness and ability to leave one nearly desperate to partake.Gardner is particularly adept at providing background details of each character, almost without seeming to.  We even learn the particulars of Lacey’s past injuries.  The characters are fascinating, particularly with the contrast of light—Granville—and dark—Denis.  One can’t help but enjoy the relationship between Lacy and Lady Breckenridge.  Marianne is a treat and adds a wonderful twist to the plot“The Necklace Affair” is so well done with a very good plot twist and justice being served in a most satisfactory manner.THE NECKLACE AFFAIR (Hist Myst – Captain Lacey – London  - 1817/Regency) - ExGardner, Ashley – Early in the series yet only recently publishedAmazon Digital Services, Inc. – January 2014","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJOZMPIX2U6HP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0054KIVSE#wasThisHelpful","RJOZMPIX2U6HP","A2SI6BNK5SWSMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SI6BNK5SWSMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First Sentence:  As a practice, Harry Bosch did his best to Stay out of Tunnels but as he came out of Logan Airport, a tunnel was unavoidable—either the Ted Williams or the Sumner, take your pick.Los Angeles detective Harry Bosch is way outside his patch in Boston--Jamaica Plain to be exact—tracking down a suspect in a 15-year-old murder.  He’s not alone, however, and finds himself being watched by local P.I. Patrick Kenzie who is looking into the disappearance of a seventh-grade girl.  It only makes sense for LA and Boston to join forces.It’s hard to beat having two of our finest procedural authors join forces.  They both have such wonderful and distinctive voices.  It’s delightful having Bosch out of his comfort zone…”The passage was wall to wall with cars and trucks—a river of steel under the river of water, only one of them flowing at the moment.”The meeting of the two characters is a very good exchange of “I’ll show you mine..”  with good contracts between the LA and Boston styles.“Red Eye” is an excellent collaboration from two very fine authors, with very good suspense and a great last line.RED EYE (Pol Proc/PI – Patrick Kenzie/Harry Bosch – Boston – Contemp-2005) – ExLehane, Dennis / Michael Connelly – Original Short StorySimon & Schuster – November, 2014","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KS0JNT64G7RJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42WXYU#wasThisHelpful","R1KS0JNT64G7RJ","A2SI6BNK5SWSMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SI6BNK5SWSMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First Sentence:  The night of the first murder.At the urging of his daughter, amateur poet Bob Naylor joins a local writers circle.  At the previous meeting, the group was addressed by a vanity-press publisher who’d come to critique their work; some favorably, most not.  The publisher is killed in an arson fire and Maurice, the group’s leader, becomes the prime suspect.  Because Bob is new and not a suspect, he is recruited to prove Maurice’s innocence, almost losing his own life in the process.  Because the local police aren’t making any progress, Inspector Henrietta Mallin is sent in to solve the case. Now here’s an opening to capture one’s attention.  I definitely compels you want to read on.  Lovesey writes wonderful dialogue with a very natural flow and a fine element of subtle humor…”Come and meet the chair.”  “Why?  Is it special?”  “Chairman.”  “Ah.”The members of the writing circle are a true delight and so recognizable.  One can’t help but like Bob and he holds the first portion of the story together very well.  One does appreciate the cameo of Peter Diamond as a segue to introducing Insp. Mallin.  That said, “Hen” Mallin is a very memorable protagonist being a cigar-smoking, no-nonsense character.“The Circle” is an unusual police procedural, but very cleverly plotted with plot twists, plenty of suspects and very good red herrings.  It’s somewhat reminiscent of “Midsomer Murders” and definitely keeps one involved right to the end.THE CIRCLE (Pol Proc - Insp.

It’s time for Flavia to get to work.Bradley’s wonderful descriptions and excellent dialogue explain exactly why one can’t help but love Flavia.

"First Sentence:  When I think of my wife, I always think of her head.It is the fifth wedding anniversary of Nick and Amy Dunne.  When Nick goes down to breakfast, he finds Amy is missing and the back door open.  Did she run away?  Was she taken?  Or did Nick actually murder her?It is not an auspicious beginning when one starts out intensely disliking the protagonist, followed shortly by an equal dislike for the victim. Two things are required to like a book; at least one character for whom I can feel affinity and knowing that justice is done in the end.  This had neither, except for a couple supporting character and that wasn’t enough.  The book quickly degraded from there.The only redeeming quality to this book is that the disappearance was well done.  Other than that, this is an unpleasant story, about unpleasant people, doing unpleasant things to one another.  Only the twin sister, Go, was at all interesting.As to the plot; about half-way through, the ending seemed predictable.  Hoping my suspicions were wrong, I admit going to the end.  Unfortunately, I was not wrong.  The ending was not only predictable, but illogical and displayed the author’s lack of knowledge.  If this book is supposed to be a look into the minds of men and women, they are people one never wants to meet, let alone know.“Gone Girl” is a book that never should have come in the first place.

"First Sentence:  From Raymond Land to All Staff:  So, it’s a new beginning for us.The Peculiar Crimes Unit is now under the jurisdiction of the City of London and, as usual, their new top boss would like to see an end to the group.  However, two crimes are keeping them in the game.  A young man appears to see a body rise from a grave and claims it spoke.  Have Resurrectionists returned?  But what did the young man see that resulted in his murder a few days later?  Someone stole the seven ravens, symbol of the British Empire, from the Tower of London.  Only Bryant could discover a link between the two crimes.How wonderful that Fowler includes a cast of characters, in the form of a staff roster, at the beginning of his books.  And, right from the start, we are treated to the wonderful voice and humor of Flower.  It’s a rare treat when an internal memo can be amusing.It’s nice to have a true ensemble cast of characters, which each playing a significant role in the story and each being fully developed.  Although the primary characters are James May and Arthur Bryant—what a wonderful relationship that is--Bryant took the lead here.  He seems to have mellowed bit and we learn much more about his past, which is quite lovely, but we did not lose any of that which makes him so delightful.  However, all the relationships are so well drawn, the characters transform into being actual people to the reader.Fowler’s voice, wit and dialogue are such a pleasure to read…”Why have you got a house brick in there [Longbright’s handbag]?’  “Under British law you can’t stop a suspect with a weapon but you might be allowed to hit him with something that would naturally be in your hand at the time,”…. “PC Biggs folded her arms.  No honest citizen should ever do anything that makes a police officer stand back and fold her arms.”  There is also a delightful scene of the pathologist being thrust into a very different role than that to which he is accustomed.  Flower is very good at doing the unexpected.There is one small criticism and that is the inclusion of portents.  Portents are really, really annoying, unnecessary and, rather than create suspense, have the opposite effect.  They are also somewhat insulting to the reader as it’s as though the author assumes the reader won’t continue otherwise.“The Bleeding Heart” is very clever with wonderfully logical explanations of crimes which seemed so odd.

Nothing is quite going to plan, including learning from her druid friend, Cathbad, informing her that a Bronze Age wooden peg is missing.Griffith’s Ruth Galloway is a delight, particularly for those of us who have been known to eschew the accepted sentiments and traditions of the holidays, yet find ourselves attracted to them.  Some may even relate to the “Doctor Who” reference.The story contains delightful humor.  There is the inclusion of the character’s back story, references to previous books and fascinating factual information which is interesting and doesn’t detract from the pace of the story.  Griffith’s provides a very strong sense of place, often using weather to increase suspense.Like her description of faith…”It’s enough that someone, somewhere genuinely believes that the magic will work.”“Ruth’s First Christmas Tree” is not overly sweet, but much more a reflection of many of us, particularly those of us in our middle years, but still with a warm ending.

What isn’t planned is finding the body of a young orphan impaled by an arrow and secured to the maypole via its bright-colored ribbons.  On a personal note, it was delightful that the madrigal referenced at the beginning of the story is one I sang years ago and still remember.Ms. Lake created a delightful cast of non-stereotypical characters.  The vicar and subject to both questions of faith and desires, in a good way, of the flesh, but a true Anglican vicar nonetheless, …”I suppose if Christ came and sat on the bench beside you, you would accuse him of being an illegal immigrant.”  The relationship between Det.

There’s even the Rectory ghost, William.Although the protagonist is a vicar, do not mistake this for a comfortable, English cozy.  Lake addresses all sides of human nature, and she does it well.  If anything, you might think of it as a dark Midsomer Murder.

"First Sentence; First Story:  It’s hard to argue with an old Indian or his tricks.How nice to have collection of Johnson’s annual Christmas stories, all in one place.  Plus, there is the added gift of a new story, and a wonderful, personal introduction by Lou Diamond Phillips, the actor who plays Henry Standing Bear in the Longmire television series, based on the series.  Phillips introduction expresses so much of what I feel about Johnson’s writing, as well as the pleasure of meeting Craig and his wife Judy.The stories are of the same, high quality we’ve come to expect from Johnson.  They are thoughtful and entertaining with each containing a small lesson as well.  From how one should never overlook the basics, to realizing that salvation can come from unexpected sources, to forgiveness and tolerance.  It’s lovely that there is even a small reference to the American actor Robert Taylor, perhaps best known for the Westerns he made in the 1960s, as an homage to the Australian actor currently playing Sheriff Longmire.  There are also lessons on acceptance, remembering others, giving, priorities, desperation and redemption.  But we also learn the history of the term, “Indian Summer.”“Wait for the Signs” is a classic example of Johnson’s humor, wisdom and wonderful writing.

"As per Amazon review guidelines, I have to disclaim that I received this product to test and write an unbiased review.This is a super simple stand–it’s operated by a 1 button locking mechanism. Pressing it unlocks the support which you can adjust around to get the angle that you want. I like the fact that it’s made from metal, because it gives it a nice hefty weight which prevents the stand from moving around too much. However, there are 2 main design flaws that I’d like to point out which are a bit annoying.The first is that the area which holds the stand isn’t very wide. While most phones are quite thin these days, there are cases which add bulk and if that’s the case, this phone stand might not be able to actually hold your phone. Luckily, I had a relatively thin case, so it still worked. The second main flaw is that there’s no way to charge your phone while it’s on this stand if your phone is in the vertical orientation. There are no holes or space to accommodate the charging cable, which is unfortunate. You can fix this by putting your phone in horizontally, but this is still nevertheless a flaw.Aside from those two flaws, I think this is a solid phone stand. It’s super simple to use and the metal build gives it a solid feel.Please note that I was sent this product for review.

"The flavor is fantastic, and this high protein version is a bit more filling than the regular one. It satisfies for around 3-5 hours if you use a full scoop, and if you do follow their slim fast plan, you start losing weight simply due to the lower calorie intake. Also, you can't even tell it's a protein shake from the flavor--it's that good. I really love mixing this with a banana & soy milk to create a lactose free banana chocolate shake, to the point that I don't really even use this to lose weight. I just find it to be a great breakfast/meal replacement for when I don't have time. It's got a good mix of the essential vitamins & minerals, without being too high on sugar.

That being said though, I've not seen this much care and quality put into a bottle of probiotics anywhere else. From the packaging alone, you can see it's different. The decorated glass bottle & the box it comes in is unique and shows a business which cares a ton about their product. They also include a nice personal note about how the business was founded and stuff. It's even got organic cotton!The pills itself have a control-release technology which supposedly increases the bacteria's effectiveness, and it's all manufactured free of the major allergens. This specific bottle is formulated to boost your immunity & prevent colds, and I think it's been pretty effective. Flu season has hit and I haven't felt a single symptom since taking this. It's probably not the only factor, but it's the only evidence I have. The pills themselves aren't so big that they're impossible to swallow, but they're still bigger than your typical capsule. There's no real taste to them (I guess they're a little sour?), so I haven't had any issues with taking these.Overall, this is probably one of the best quality probiotics out there. Everything about it screams premium, and it reflects in the price. For those who can afford it and want the best, this is the product for you. There's definitely more affordable options out there though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GU45ZOYGRRZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012LI64FI#wasThisHelpful","R2GU45ZOYGRRZB","A2EKBJB8H5MDD8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EKBJB8H5MDD8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As per Amazon review guidelines, I have to disclaim that I received this product to test and write an unbiased review.It's a cool idea, and I suppose the illusion looks cooler if you look at the bucket from a certain angle. For the most part however, the illusion falls flat. If you can see it as a bucket leaking water, then props to you. When I looked at it for the first time, all I saw was a piece of transparent plastic supporting a bucket. It's very easy to tell that there's a piece of ""transparent"" plastic holding it up.Regardless, this is still a neat little pencil cup, and I can see this being a nifty little gift for friends & family. It's small so it doesn't take up that much space, but big enough to hold around 15-20 normal sized pencils/pens. I also like the fact that the handle can move, so you can kinda use it as a divider. Finally, despite the illusion falling a bit flat, it's still different from most pencil holders. It makes it unique and I've had people ask about it. For $8, the quality is pretty much what you expected--everything is plastic, but due to its simple design, I can't really see it breaking unless you try to do it intentionally.I'd recommend this for those looking for a cheap gift or a unique pencil holder!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MGSM7YE0RBNI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0116U98Q4#wasThisHelpful","R1MGSM7YE0RBNI","A2EKBJB8H5MDD8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EKBJB8H5MDD8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As per Amazon review guidelines, I have to disclaim that I received this product to test and write an unbiased review.For $16, this is a surprisingly elegant shower head. It comes with everything you need, including the hose & wall mount. There are also some restricters included, which helps you save water. If your water flow is weak though, you might not want to install these, as they do lower the amount of water coming out. I like the stainless steel--it gives it a premium feel and look, despite not costing too much.Anyways, I'm no expert on shower heads, but I was still able to install this with ease. There's nothing to twist and turn here to change the ""mode""--it's a single function shower head. The shower head itself is nice and large, covering a large area. I do think the water pressure is a bit weak (but that's more of a personal preference).Overall, this is a simple to use, elegant shower head.

"As per Amazon review guidelines, I have to disclaim that I received this product to test and write an unbiased review.When this first came in the mail, I had my doubts. The packaging looked a bit cheap and the English on the packaging was poor. It as very obviously made in China, and I questioned how well it worked. Upon opening it though, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the actual flashlight.It’s made out of metal and it feels good in the hand–not too light, not too heavy. I also like the fact that you can adjust the head of the flashlight to focus the light or make it expand to cover a larger. The best part though is actually the battery–it comes with a rechargeable lithium-ion battery & a charger for the battery, as well as an alternative battery holder which can take 3 AAA batteries if you don’t want to use the Li-On battery. It's a surprising amount of stuff to include with a flashlight, but I'm glad they considered all of these factors.When I turned on this flashlight for the first time, I was impressed. It’s really bright–much brighter than a typical flashlight, and in my opinion, what makes this stand out from the rest. You can soft-click the power button to change the modes from normal to dim to flashing, etc. It's a great flashlight for camping and outdoor activities.Overall, I may not have liked the packaging, but the flashlight itself is great. It's durable, bright, and I love the addition of the rechargeable battery/charger. It's nice not having to stress out about replacing the battery.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JEN4QTFITN5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013AJCRT4#wasThisHelpful","R3JEN4QTFITN5Q","A2EKBJB8H5MDD8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EKBJB8H5MDD8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good gaming headset for those on a budget. It’s not going to feel super premium, nor does it sound the best, but it gets the job done just fine. For $18 (at time of review), I'm satisfied with it. The entire thing is made of plastic, so it's a lightweight headset and feels a bit flimsy. That being said, I've dropped it a couple of times and nothing snapped off.The best thing it has going for it is that it's pretty comfortable. The pads are soft and I haven't had it clip my hair. You can adjust it to fit your head as well. I also really like the design. The blue on black as well as the logo makes it seem more premium than it is. As for the sound quality, it's mediocre. I can hear the game music/voice overs as well as my friends over skype/VoIP clearly, but this isn't meant for enjoying music. The sound seal isn't that great either, so it will leak a bit (other people can hear you if you turn it up loudly) and you can hear some of the environment around you as well. This wasn't a big deal for me, as I don't care too much for that ""totally immersive"" experience that some gamers desire. I'm assuming that since you're looking at a headset below $20, you don't care too much either. The microphone works fine as well--people were able to hear me clearly.One thing to keep in mind is that this comes with two cables--one for audio and one for the microphone (voice input). Some of the newer gaming laptops have a combined audio/voice input jack, so this would not be compatible. This should work just fine with most desktops & older laptops though. The cable is also pretty long, and I think it would work for consoles as well.If you are looking for a top-notch, immersive gaming experience, you won't find that here. I doubt you'll find it anywhere at this price range. However, this is still a comfortable & functional headset for under $20. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a cheap budget headset which works.Disclaimer: I was sent this product in exchange for my honest opinion.

"As per Amazon review guidelines, I have to disclaim that I received this product to test and write an unbiased review.First off, for those who have never used biking gloves before, they’re essentially fingerless gloves with shock absorption pads which increase your grip and make it easier to handle your bike in rough terrain. The shock absorption is especially useful for mountain biking as it makes it a lot less painful to grip the bike. Thus, it’s not really made for people who bike to work regularly or anything–it’s more for those who enjoy the sport of biking and do it recreationally.As for this set of biking gloves, I really like them! I chose the green color, and I dig the sporty design. It’s mostly made of a breathable mesh material, and there’s a shock absorbing gel pad near the palm area. There’s also a rubbery type of material for enhanced grip. It works well–you can definitely feel the reduced shock and the grip, making for a much more comfortable ride. For sizing information, definitely consult the chart–it’s very accurate if you measure your palm correctly. There is some flexibility as the gloves are tightened via a velcro strap, so if you’re on the borderline and you prefer a tighter fit, you can order one size smaller.Also, this comes with an extra “multi-purpose head cloth”, which is essentially an elastic microfiber woven cloth with many uses. The quality and design of this cloth is way above average–most freebies that come with products tend to be pretty crappy–so I was pleasantly surprised here. You can turn this thing into pretty much anything you can think of, from a balaclava to a headband, to a biking mask to protect from the sand. The package has a diagram with all the various ways you can use it.Overall, this is an excellent set of bike gloves with some added value in the bonus head cloth. I recommend lots of products, and this is one of the few which I couldn’t really find a flaw with. It’s well made, worth every penny, and the design is excellent. I personally love it, and would recommend this to all bike enthusiasts!Summary: 5/5==The Good==+ Bonus high quality headscarf!+ Gloves do their job and are well made+ Sporty design==The Bad==- None","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL0TZVMRX4ZND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013SPYD1A#wasThisHelpful","RL0TZVMRX4ZND","A2EKBJB8H5MDD8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EKBJB8H5MDD8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those who have never tried Aloe Vera gel, it’s one of the best solutions for sunburn. The relief is near instant and the cooling effect is excellent. Aloe vera gel is extracted from the aloe vera plant which is shown to have certain benefits for the skin.I’m a big fan of this, as I go out a lot (especially in the summer) and sunburns are painful. I especially like that this is a good sized bottle for a decent price. The quality here matches other aloe vera gels I’ve used in the past, so it’s not a phony or anything.On a final note, this bottle comes with two caps: a pump cap as well as a squeeze cap, so you can pick your way of dispersing the gel inside. I found both to work equally well, so it’s really a matter of preference. Anyways, this is a good value bottle of aloe vera gel and I’d recommend this to anyone who gets sunburned easily (especially if you’ve never tried it!). In my opinion, aloe vera gel in general is one of the best natural remedies for sunburn.Please note that I was sent this product for review.

"I’m usually hesitant when it comes to beauty products because it’s to tell whether or not something is working due to the gradual nature of most products. I’ve yet to use one product that works miracles instantaneously, and this is no exception.However, after using this for around 2 weeks, I’ve begun to notice some visible changes. They’re very minor, but some of my old acne scars have begun to fade a bit. I say this because old acne scars are usually pretty consistent in that they don’t really change. After applying this for around 3 weeks, they’ve faded ever so slightly. I hope to see improvements after some continued use!Regardless, this scar gel contains a couple of potent skin-healing ingredients, including strange stuff I've never heard of. I did some research on these ingredients, and there are some articles which claim they work (not sure if they're credible though). The gel itself is this brown paste which smells a bit like honey. The smell disappears after a while, so there's no need to worry about it. Also, It's easy to apply and you use it like a spot treatment, so you really don't use much per application (varies with the amount/size of scars). Thus, despite the small bottle, I can see this lasting a while.As with all beauty products, it works differently for different people. In my experience though, it’s worked out great!Please note that I was sent this product for review.

"After using this for around 2 weeks (every night), I've noticed an overall positive change in the smoothness of the skin. I don't think it's as drastic as they claim in the description, but it's visible--and that's not something that can be said for a lot of beauty products.Looking at the ingredients, this little bottle contains a mix of very potent skin-improving ingredients and oils. For example, stuff like jojoba oil is commonly found in natural acne treatments/moisturizers, and many people have attested to its effectiveness. Also, I've used products from InstaNatural before, and they've all been high quality(I've never received anything fake from them before). As for the cream itself, it's very easy to apply and there's a very light, inoffensive scent. This is good news for those with a sensitive nose, as the smell has never bothered me before.Now, at 100ml, it's not a very large bottle. Fortunately, you don't need too much per application, so apply it sparingly and it should last one or two months. I've found it best to apply after a hot shower, as your skin is soft and the pores are open. Overall, I do think it's a bit pricey at the current cost of $20, but the quality is good and it contains a lot of fantastic ingredients for the skin. If you can afford it, definitely consider giving this a try.Please note that I received this product for free for my honest and unbiased feedback.

"This is a really easy to use thermometer which came exactly as described and looks like the pictures. To use, all you have to do is press the power button, stick it in some part of your body (recommended: armpit, mouth, or in the rectum) and wait for the thermometer to beep. Once it does, you can take it out and it will display the temperature on the LCD display.I’ve only tried this under my armpit, so I can’t talk about the other two (the tip is nice and soft though, so it shouldn’t hurt), and it was pretty accurate. I’ve had slight fluctuations of ~0.2 degrees F, but that could’ve been due to other factors.The only complaint I have is the battery; I have no doubt that the battery included will last a long time, but it seems a bit difficult to replace. It runs off a button battery and to replace it, you have to take off the cap and then take out the entire chipset to access the battery.

"I love the outdoors, so I thought this would be a fantastic tool to protect my phone from the elements, as you never really know when it might rain. After a couple weeks with this, I’m pleased to say that it’s a well made and simple to use waterproof case. I suppose it’s a bit like a ziploc bag, but it’s made of a much more durable plastic and guaranteed not to leak in water as long as it’s sealed properly, making this much more secure.It’s made to fit most phones without issue–I have a 4.7 inch phone with a case–but I think it should be able to fit phablets in as well (6 inch phones might be a bit of a stretch though). I’ve said that it’s really simple to use, and that’s because all you do is open up the two clamps, put your phone in, and clamp them back together. It’s easy to tell when it is secured, and once it is, no water should be able to get through. I tested this by dunking it into a pool of water (while holding my breath) and it was perfectly fine. Aukey does recommend you test for defects by putting this inside a bowl of water first for 30 minutes sealed WITHOUT a phone instead. Your phone is still usable with this case on, but you might have to press a bit harder.Overall, this is a fine case which has made me more relaxed carrying my phone out on hikes and stuff as I no longer worry about my phone being damaged by water. It’s simple to use and it works, and it's not too expensive at the current cost of $6. There’s not much more I can ask for.5/5Please note that I was sent this product for review.

"As you can see from the pictures, this battery pack looks like it costs much more than it does. The design as well as the materials makes this feel quite premium. It has a rubbery material which gives it a nice grip, and the design overall looks very sleek. Even the cable it comes with feels nice and a bit different from a normal micro-USB cable.However, there are a couple of flaws that I’d like to mention. This has an indicator light which shows how much battery is remaining depending on the color. The only issue is that it’s a bit counterintuitive–for some reason, red means that the battery is full, while green & blue means half-full/empty for some reason. In addition to this, the battery has a “shake to turn on” feature where you shake the battery a bit to check the battery level. This is fine and all, but it feels a bit like a gimmick. I don’t see any advantage of this over the normal power button. In fact, sometimes it turns on by itself in my bookbag as I’m walking because of this.Overall, those two flaws are annoying, but they’re also relatively minor. It’s still a well made battery with a sleek design. It’s compact enough to fit into just about any bag, and at 8000mAh, I was able to charge my phone around 3 times. It also recharges at a good rate. At the current cost of $24, I think it's a bit on the high side.

"This is awesome. Compared to the plastic mandoline slicers I’ve used in the past, this is a huge upgrade. Not only is it super sharp (don’t cut yourself when washing this!), it’s also really well made, well designed, and versatile. Thin-slicing tomatoes and cucumbers become incredibly simple with this tool, and julienne cuts become quite easy as well, allowing you to make potato fries, hash browns, etc.It’s pricier than some of the other options for sure, but if you can afford it, this is definitely worth the upgrade.WELL MADEThe whole thing except for the blade inserts & other accessories are mostly made from metal, which gives it a nice weight and high quality feel. It also makes it incredibly durable, especially compared to the plastic ones. I want to give a special mention to the knife, which was incredibly sharp. It cut through all the stuff I threw at it with ease.WELL DESIGNEDThis is probably my favorite part. All the details have been carefully thought about, and this slicer comes with a couple of cool features. First off, there’s a stand with a rubber grip located at the bottom which you can flip out to place the slicer at a more optimal angle. It also comes with 5 different blade inserts (3 of which adjusts the thickness, and 2 with julienne blades at different sizes as well) which are all conveniently placed on an included plastic rack. These are really easy to switch out–you just press the big red button and slide them out. Everything is thoughtfully designed to be purposeful and simple. Having the additional blades also makes this a versatile slicer with multiple uses.Overall, this is a fantastic mandoline slicer with high quality materials and a thoughtfully designed build. It’s a bit pricier than the plastic ones for sure, but I think the durability as well as the ease of use is well worth it.Please note that I was sent this product for review.

"First thing: It’s huge. It has a large round base which is needed to keep the lamp grounded, and there are 3 hinges–one in the middle and two at the top. These allow you to adjust the lamp to whatever angle needed, and they’re tight enough that they won’t move by themselves. It’s a very unique, modern look which I personally enjoy. Just know that it does take up a large amount of space.The whole thing is made from plastic, but that doesn’t mean it’s bad quality. The build quality here is top-notch and doesn’t feel cheap at all. My favorite part about the entire lamp is the whole light “temperature” feature. There are essentially 4 modes–reading, writing, night mode, and the final one is a picture of a teacup (perhaps social mode?). Since it’s all touch operated, you can simply touch any of the pictures to change the color of the light. The icon lights up to indicate whichever choice you’ve selected. For example, night mode is a relaxing yellow color whereas the reading mode is a bright white. It’s a really cool feature which is complimented by the simple, intuitive controls.In addition to this, you can adjust the brightness for each mode by pressing on the +/- buttons. The range here really surprised me–it can go from the dimness of a large night light to enough brightness to light up a small room! There are a couple of nice small details included as well, such the power button lighting up when the light is off so you can always find it in the darkness. Also, there’s a USB port on the side, which works as you’d expect.Overall, I think this is an absolutely fantastic lamp. I love it. It’s certainly pricier than most lamps, but it also offers a lot more than most lamps.

"They work exactly the same as your standard micro-USB cable. They charge just as fast, they can transfer data, and the only difference here is that these are made of slightly more premium materials. The jacks are encased in metal and the cable itself is the more durable cloth type. They feel durable, but I haven’t had them for long enough to actually say.For this price of $7(at time of review), these are a step up from your typical cables at a decent price.

"I ordered the medium ones and they came in a padded envelope. It’s a pack of 2 neoprene sleeves with a silicone elastic band near the top for extra grip to ensure that it doesn’t slip off. You can pull these up to slightly above your knees, near your lower thighs. There’s a sizing chart here, but know that the compression is a bit tight, especially around the elastic band. The medium size fit me just fine, but I can definitely feel the compression. If you don’t like that, consider ordering a size larger.I used these when running, and the grips do a good job of keeping them from slipping. It does get a bit warm with these on during exercise, but they wick sweat well and the compression + warmth are soothing for the muscles. On a final note, I’d just like to add that I love how they look–it’s 85% nylon, 15% spandex (machine washable)--and they look really sporty, similar to women’s workout tights but without the thigh part of course. I’m a guy, and they look perfectly fine on dudes as well, so long as you’re wearing shorts (please don’t go out in these with underwear). The Vive logo is reflective as well, which is a nice touch.Overall, this is a good set of compression sleeves. It’s well made, and it works. Can’t ask for more than that. I do think it’s a bit on the pricey side, but if you can afford it, know that you’re getting a quality pair of compression gear.Please note that I was sent this product in exchange for an unbiased opinion.

"I like this surge protector, but it is a lot larger than most of the surge protectors out there in the market today. That’s mainly due to its design–it’s made with plenty of space in between the outlets to give space to chunky adapters. There’s also the addition of two USB ports near the end for charging portable devices, which does come in handy. Near the tip is a LED light which glows red to indicate power.Now, the innovation here is the so called “smart” charging, which turns on/off the entire power strip depending on whether or not it detects devices using electricity. For example, if I leave a laptop plugged in and it goes to sleep, the power strip will detect that and turn itself off. When I turn on the computer again, the power strip will also turn on. This is supposed to help save energy, and it theory, it sounds cool, but it doesn’t always work well in practice. For example, it seems like the power strip doesn’t detect when USB devices are plugged in, and it stays off.Luckily, you can also turn off the smart charging and just use the normal mode, which turns into a regular, always-on surge protector.Overall, I have no real issues with this surge protector–if you are buying this for the smart feature, just be aware that it doesn’t work too well (I personally don’t think it’s worth the extra cost). It’s well designed and feels well built, it has no issues with large adapters, but at the same time, it is a very large power strip.Please note that I was sent this product for review.

"It’s exactly what the description says–a double walled glass cup with a glass infuser for tea leaves–but it looks absolutely beautiful in real life. The teardrop shape of the inner cup looks very elegant when you add in the tea, and overall, the all-glass build is just fantastic. Check out the pictures to see how the double wall looks with liquid inside!Functionally, it’s great too. It does get warm when you pour in boiling water, but it’s not so hot that you can’t hold the cup thanks to the double wall design. The infuser works just as you’d expect it to, and it’s also extremely light, thanks to the special glass it’s made out of. Drinking from this thing is just a pleasure.Some of the other reviews have noted that it doesn’t keep your tea hot for long and that it lets small pieces of tea leaves through the infuser. In my experience, it kept the tea warm for as long as a regular mug would–it’s not a thermos. Also, tiny pieces do go through, but I think that’s expected for a glass infuser. It’s hard to produce a glass filter fine enough to sift through tiny tea leaves. The one flaw that I did notice was that the cover is a bit loose, so watch out for that.Overall, this is just a fantastic cup by Immortalitea. It’s well designed, it works perfectly, and it just looks stunning. It’s also pricey and probably not made for everyone except die-hard tea lovers, but that doesn’t keep this from being one stylish product.

"I never thought I’d call stickers “cool” ever since I graduated from elementary school, but these are pretty awesome. So like many of the other reviewers have noted, they’re basically thin black stickers which you can stick to pretty much anywhere–jars, closets, etc. It comes with a liquid chalk pen, which feels like those liquid white out pens, except these can be washed off the stickers by rubbing it with a damp cloth.The only thing I’d like to note is that the pens do come dry at first, so you have to shake it a bit and press the pen down in a pumping motion several times to get the ink flowing (you’ll see the tip actually go into the pen as you press down). Other than that, just write on the stickers like you would with a marker, and it looks really nice! I really like the contrast of the white and the black, and they look classy and traditional.Finally, keep in mind that it’s reusable in the sense that you can wipe off your writing and re-write it as much as you want, but the stickers themselves stick on pretty tight after you put them on, and it’s tough getting them to come off again.Overall, I love these stickers. I have them on my cabinets and closets now, and it’s fantastic. They’re versatile and look classy, and it’s a fantastic organizational tool.Please note that I was sent this product for review.

"For a 5,000mAh battery, this is one of the most compact ones I’ve seen. It’s like a size of a thick cigarette lighter, and in my tests, it was able to charge my phone from 20%-100% twice before it drained. That’s pretty impressive.As for the design, it’s not super sleek or anything, but it’s simple and functional. The size and shape makes it easy to hold, and the power button is large. There are four lights in the front indicating the amount of charge left in the battery. I do want to give some credit to the cable included though–it’s a 2-in-1 cable with both micro-USB for Android devices and lightning for Apple devices–you simply have to put the lightning jack on top of the micro-USB jack to turn it into a lightning cable.Using it is super easy–just plug in the cable (USB goes into the battery pack, and micro-USB/lightning goes into your phone), and press the power button. It should start charging automatically. To charge the battery itself, all you have to do is flip the cable around (micro-USB goes into the battery pack, USB goes into your wall adapter/computer) and the lights will start blinking to indicate the charge status.Overall, this is a simple but very compact battery pack. I love the fact that it’s so small as it makes it super easy to just throw into a bag or a purse. The box does mention a couple of smart charging features, but I didn't notice any significant differences compared to charging from a regular wall adapter--they're both pretty fast. Recharging the battery itself takes around 2.5 hours. The versatile cable is cool too. I do think there are cheaper options available, but this has great build quality and works really well.

"I’m not a bulky person (particularly not in the arms department), but the medium ones fit me just fine. It kinda looks like you’re wearing under armor, except without the whole torso part. This makes it more tolerable to wear in the hotter seasons, since your whole body isn’t being covered. The spandex material is similar though–stretchy, tight, and breathable. At the upper end of each sleeve (so the end near the biceps), there’s a small silicone lining which serves as an elastic band and keeps it tight enough so that it won’t slip off. It isn’t the most comfortable, and when you take it leaves marks on your skin due to the grip. It does do the job of keeping the sleeves from slipping off though. I included a picture of the little silicone strips so that you can see.As for the compression, the medium size fits me just right–it’s not too tight and not too loose. Movement isn’t restricted at all, and the compression helped me a bit with soothing sore muscles. It does get a bit warm when exercising, but they don’t get all sweaty due to the material which does a good job at wicking moisture.Finally, I really like how it looks!

"This is a very simple knife sharpener, with tungsten blades for sharpening dull knives, and ceramic blades for fine honing. It’s just like all the other knife sharpeners out there. I do appreciate the rubber grips on both the handle and the base–they make it hard for the sharpener to slide around. Using it is very easy–sliding the knife 3-4 times through the sharpening blades at a vertical angle were more than enough for my knives to become razor sharp again.The rest of the knife sharpener is made of plastic, making this a very light tool. I do appreciate the longer handle, as it does make it easier to grip while sharpening the knives.

"My favorite part about this pitcher is the fact that it comes with 2 cores. One is your typical fruit infusion core, which allows water and the fruit/vegetables/herbs to mix together and infuse, and the other is an ice core, which you can fill with water and then freeze. You can then put it in the pitcher to keep it cool while not diluting the drink (since the ice core is completely sealed). Both those cores are twisted into the cap to hold it in place. When pouring drinks, you do need to keep a finger on the cap to keep it from falling off.Everything here is made from BPA-free plastic, which keeps the pitcher light. The quality of the plastic is good–it’s around the same thickness of a BRITA pitcher, and it’s got a nice design with elegant curves. My only complaint about this pitcher is that there were a couple of scratches on the plastic when it first arrived, but that could’ve been the packaging’s fault.Overall, this is an excellent pitcher, and the inclusion of the two cores make it versatile for not only serving infused drinks, but also cool drinks like iced tea or fruit punch. You are paying a bit extra for it though, so I’d suggest the Prodyne one if you don’t see yourself ever using the ice core.Please note that I was sent this product for review.

"At a size slightly larger than a quarter, this is a simple Bluetooth headset that tries to remain relatively hidden. It’s hard to spot unless someone is looking straight at you from the side or looking closely, especially compared to a standard Bluetooth headset, but it’s definitely not invisible. It charges via an included proprietary USB cable, which isn’t bad, but it makes it harder to deal with should you ever lose the cable. When I first turned on the headset, it talked to me in Chinese, and I had to read the instructions to find out how to switch it to the English mode.Functionally, it’s also lacking compared to the larger headsets, but that’s not to be unexpected given the size. One button controls everything from the power, pause/play, voice dialing, and answering the phone. There’s no fancy volume control or rewind/fast forward here. Despite that though, this headset does its primary job–answering calls–well. The microphone works well, as the person I was calling heard me just fine, and the volume itself is fine. I had no problems using this in external environments, like a car. As for comfort and fit, there’s no replaceable tip here–it’s a one-size-fits-all kind of deal. Luckily, it seem to fit me fine, and it was comfortable enough. Just keep in mind that due to the nature of the design, it ONLY works in your right ear.Sound quality is adequate for calls, but not for music. Since headsets like these are primarily meant for calls, I don’t think this really counts as a negative. I personally love the fact that it’s so discreet, because it sucks walking out in public with an obnoxious headset on your ears and getting dirty looks. One thing to note though is that if you do intend to use this out in public, a lot of people might think you’re talking to them due to the fact that this is almost invisible.Overall, this is a nice, simple Bluetooth headset which does indeed stick true to its claim of being discreet.

"My favorite thing about this lamp is its modern design. It just looks so sleek and modern–there are no knobs to turn, no lightbulbs to replace, and everything from the light to the base has that thin, modern look. The fact that it’s operated by a touch-sensitive power button and dimmer makes it even cooler.The LED light itself is a bright white color which can be dimmed down at night for a softer feel. LED lights are known to have a long life span, while using less energy than a typical light bulb. The lamp at its brightest setting is actually brighter than your typical CFLs, so that’s You tap the power button once to turn it on, but you have to hold your finger over the power button to turn it off. That felt a bit unintuitive at first, but you get used to it. Sliding your finger up and down the dimmer brightens/dims the light.

"Jojoba oil is an ingredient commonly mentioned in many beauty magazines, and it’s with good reason–it’s found in many beauty products from shampoos to moisturizers. This bottle is filled with the pure oil itself, and can be used as a moisturizer for both the face and the hair. Having used this for a month now, I must say it’s a fantastic natural moisturizer.There are a variety of oils out there that also have moisturizing properties, including argan oil and rosehip oil, but Jojoba oil tends to be a bit cheaper than those two. Another thing I really like about this is the fact that it has a very light nutty odor–you can barely detect it. I put this on after a warm shower and applying a toner and wake up the next day with extremely soft skin–I love it! This bottle specifically may not look like much, but since you don’t use much per application, one of these should be able to easily last 2+ months.Overall, I think this is a great starting choice for anyone looking for a natural alternative moisturizer and want to give the oils a try. It’s one of the most budget friendly choices, and it really does work. For those who feel weird about putting oils on their face/body, they actually get absorbed by your body rather quickly and I haven’t experienced any breakouts whatsoever. If anything, they’ve helped my acne due to how nourishing it is for the skin.

"This is a really simple speaker, but it’s got most of the basic functionalities, and it sounds great for being so small(see picture for size comparison). It only has 3 buttons, but they each have two functions (play/pause = power button, volume up = fast forward, volume down = rewind). The latter functions can be enabled by holding down the button instead of a regular press.I’ll start this review with the features I like and then talk about what I didn’t like. There’s a couple of ports on the speaker–one AUX port for non-bluetooth devices(AUX cable is included), one USB out port for its charging feature, and one micro-USB port for charging the speaker itself. I’ll talk a bit more about the charging feature, since that’s something that’s not often found on Bluetooth speakers. It essentially turns the speaker into an external battery, allowing you to charge your phone. This is a clever use of the battery and it makes the speaker useful in situations where your phone is running low, but just know that the battery isn’t very big (rated at 1000mAh). That’s enough to charge an average phone up 20-30%. When using this, the battery drains quite fast, and the speaker will run out of battery, so I recommend saving this feature for situations where you truly need to charge your phone. The speaker’s battery life without using this feature is pretty decent, clocking in at around 5-6 hours.The other cool feature about this is its IPX65 waterproof rating, which means it’s protected against light splashings of water. As long as the ports are sealed by the caps, it should survive exposure to small amounts of water. I spilled a cup of water on it as a test, and it sounded a bit funny as the water got into the speaker grills. After drying, it sounded fine. It’s also pretty durable looking, with the edges all reinforced by some sort of rubber material.Now, for the one issue that I feel like was overlooked is the rewind feature. You have to press the volume down button for a couple of seconds before it rewinds, but unfortunately these couple of seconds are too long, and it simply rewinds to the beginning of the song rather than the previous song. This essentially makes the rewind feature useless, so keep that in mind. Other than that though, I really like this speaker. It has a good sound, it’s compact, durable, and has good versatility in its charging feature. It’s a shame it can’t rewind.Summary: 4/5==The Good==+ Good sound for a compact speaker+ Durable & waterproof+ Versatile charging feature for emergencies==The Bad==- Rewind function doesn’t really work- Battery is a bit small to be an external battery- Lacks microphone/answer call button (I rarely use this feature, but most speakers have it so I’m just leaving this here)Please note that I was sent this product for review.

"With wireless charging, there are currently three main standards–”Qi”, which is what this one supports, “Powermat”, and “Rezence”. Make sure your phone supports the Qi wireless charging standard before buying this!Anyways, regarding the charger itself–it’s a little rubber mat around the size of a floppy disk (er… a large post-it for the newer generation ?) that’s powered by a USB cord which you can plug in to a wall adapter or a computer. Regardless of the power source, the charging speed remains the same. After that, you just place the phone on top of the charging pad and it begins charging and an indicator light goes from red to green to indicate charging status. It sounds simple in theory, but it’s a bit more complex in practice. First, you have to find out where the wireless charging inductor is located on your phone and then place that area near the center of the pad. Not all phones have it in the direct middle, and if you don’t position the phone correctly, it either charges slowly or doesn’t charge it at all. Next comes the issue with a phone case. If your phone is in a case, then it’ll either charge slowly or not charge at all depending on the thickness, forcing you to take it off before charging.When the you take off the case and place it perfectly, the charging works just fine. It charges just as fast as a normal charger and it feels magical. However, that is rarely the case, and the inconsistencies makes it frustrating. I don’t think that’s an issue with the charger itself, but more of a widespread issue with the technology of wireless charging in general.Overall, I think the charging pad itself is well made. It’s small and portable, it looks decent, and it charges fast when everything lines up perfectly. My only question is–why use something so inconsistent when you can just plug in your phone?My recommendation would be to wait for a better, more standardized wireless charging technology to come through before moving on. I think wired charging just works more consistently these days. If you’re enjoy being an early adopter of new(ish) technology though, I suppose this isn’t a bad buy.==The Good==+ Well made+ Not too pricey==The Bad==- Wireless technology just isn’t there yet- Doesn’t come with its own wall adapter- Have to line up phone perfectly for optimal charging3/5Please note that I was sent this product for an honest review.

"If you’re looking for earbuds under $10, this is a serious contender for the best choice. The sound isn’t the most impressive–the bass is good, but the medium & high ranges can be a bit muddy. It’s definitely still an upgrade over included headsets like the ones that came with your phone (apple earpods, etc.). I compared these to other popular cheap Amazon headsets like the JLab JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (Black) as well as the Panasonic RPHJE120K In-Ear Headphone, Black, and I would rate the sound quality on these as a bit better than either.It’s the other features that make these shine. It includes a mic/controller, a tangle resistant cable, and it even comes with a pouch to protect the earbuds. The pouch isn’t anything special, but the other two are well appreciated and work well. There’s also the standard 2 extra sizes of silicone tips. You usually don’t expect these when buying headphones under $10, so having these definitely increases the value of this headset. My favorite aspect of these earbuds is how comfortable they are. They’re pretty lightweight and once you find a tip that fits you, you can barely feel them at all. I actually prefer these over pricier ones due to the comfort alone, even if the sound quality is slightly worse.Overall, I think this is one of the best choices in the sub-10 budget. My one complaint is that there were some scratches on it when I first received it, but that could’ve been from the packaging or the shipping.=The Good=+ Nice set of features for such a low budget headset+ Feels well made+ Sound is decent=The Bad=- Was a bit scratched up upon arrivalFinally, please note that I was sent this product for review.

"With neoprene knee sleeves, their main function isn’t to offer support–it’s mainly for heat retention & compression. This can help with inflammation and pain relief and can be good for runners/athletes who put a lot of pressure on their knees.Now, as for this particular knee sleeve, I think it’s well made. The first thing to note is that this package only includes one sleeve which works on either leg. I got the medium sized one (see the included size chart) and I definitely felt the compression when I slipped it on for the first time. It also felt pretty thick. Indeed, after a short jog, there was actually sweat on my knees when I took it off. Also, because it’s so thick, it restricts your knee movement a little, but it’s not enough to really impair any sort of exercise/walking. It definitely does it’s job of retaining heat and compression. As for the design, it looks very sporty and I personally like it.Overall, I think this would be a good product for anyone looking to relieve joint pain on their knees. Make sure you pay attention to the size (or the compression might be too much/too little) and keep in mind that this is a thick sleeve. Using it in the summer might be a bit overkill due to how hot it can get.Please note that I was sent this product for an honest opinion, and feel free to leave questions & comments below.

"For ~$12, you can’t be expecting super high quality sunglasses like a Ray Ban or something similar. The frame & the lenses here are all plastic, it’s a bit wobbly at certain joints, and it doesn’t feel particularly well made–I’d say it’s slightly above the quality of those $10 gas station sunglasses. One thing that did surprise me though was the fact that it comes with a bunch of extras–a plastic carrying case, a microfiber cleaning cloth, and a carrying pouch.As for the sunglasses themselves, they’re a bit larger than most of the aviator styled sunglasses I’ve tried, so they might look a bit large on people with small faces (see pictures for comparison–this pair is the bottom one). If you like sunglasses with larger lenses, then these are perfect. They do their job fine–my eyes were quite comfortable in the sun–and the sunglasses are indeed polarized for glare reduction (you can test this yourself by looking at a computer screen with these on and rotating your head 60 degrees to see if the darkness changes).Overall, I think that these are a bit on the large side, but they do their job just fine. The sunglasses feel a bit flimsy, but the additions are a really nice surprise considering the price. If you’re looking for a cheap pair of sunglasses which get the job done, this isn’t a bad option.Disclaimer: I was sent this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.Hope this helped!

"I’ve never tried a lighter like this before, but it’s essentially a mini stove top on a USB stick. When you open it up, the heat coil automatically turns on and you can stick your cigarette in, breathe in, and it catches. It also turns on the dark light, which to me, is a bit of an unnecessary addition. The stick itself is made of metal, which is nice, but it also gets hot if you keep using it. After a couple of seconds, the heat coil turns off automatically (for safety reasons I assume). It’s definitely very safe–I tried sticking a piece of paper in there and while it charred it, there was no fire. I haven’t used it long enough to tell you the exact battery life, but it is rechargeable via an included micro-USB cable.Finally, as a side note, the instruction manual is not well written at all. Luckily, this thing isn’t too hard to figure out how to use. It also says not to charge it for too long because you can “overcharge it”, which seem like bad design. I did however forgot to take it off the charger this one time, and nothing happened, so take it with a grain of salt.Overall, this isn’t a very high quality lighter or anything, but it works, and it’s definitely safe. For the price of $9(at time of review), it's not bad. It does have the benefit of being rechargeable, so it'll never run out of lighter fluid like regular lighters. Just keep in mind that the instructions aren’t very good and I thought the inclusion of a dark light to be kinda random.Summary: 4/5Disclaimer: Please note that I was sent this product in exchange for an honest opinion.

"This is a very simply designed lantern, but it works well. It’s just a very bright LED light enclosed in a detachable plastic cup which serves the purpose of diffusing the light, and it does the job. There’s three modes–regular, bright, and off–and those are all cycled through the use of one button. It’s very easy to operate.There is one major drawback to this lantern though, and that’s the fact that it’s just not that bright (it would serve to light up a small tent, and you’re able to see a couple of feet around you in pitch black, but that’s about it). Depending on what you’re looking for when you go camping, this might not be the most ideal solution. For those who simply need a light source in the tent or a small area, this would be ideal.The best feature of this is the fact that it uses a rechargeable battery which charges via a proprietary USB cable–it’s nice not having to deal with disposable batteries, and you can always bring one of those external batteries if you need to recharge it. Battery life is as stated, around 7-8 hours depending on the brightness level. The solar feature is also a nice plus, but it depends on the weather, so it’s not always the most reliable. When it’s charging (whether via solar or via cable), a red LED turns on as an indicator.All in all, this is a very simple lantern. It’s not a very bright lantern, so just keep that in mind. The rechargeable battery and the solar panels are definitely awesome features though, and that makes this lantern incredibly flexible and convenient.Please note that I was sent this product for an honest opinion.

"These baking mats are fantastic and I love the fact that they're reusable. It comes with three different sizes, and each of them are made of the exact same material. I like these sizes--they're set to very standard baking pans, and the fact that it comes with 3 is a nice bonus. I've had no issues baking with these--they're rated up to 450F, and the mats themselves are fantastic quality. They're non-stick so you don't need to add any grease, they're very easy to wash, and this is a fantastic reusable alternative to the classic aluminum foil/baking paper.I suppose the only issue would be that it doesn't work in all situations. For example, with aluminum foil, you can wrap it around the entire baking pan. Also, since the sizes for these mats are set, you can't adjust the size like you could with foil. Personally, I think the reusability factor makes up for these slight trade-offs.Overall, this is a fantastic set of baking mats. They're good quality, easily washable, and they work. I think it's a bit pricey, but I suppose that's the cost of quality. There's a few trade-offs, but it's definitely a worthwhile investment for those who love baking.Please note that I was asked to review this product honestly at a discounted price.

"This is a set of excellent, high quality batteries. Most of the other reviewers have already backed up all of the technical specifications, and I can attest to them as well. Rated at 2600mAh, these batteries should be able to last a while (that's around the capacity of the battery in a large smartphone). Also, since these are made of lithium, they're very lightweight compared to alkaline batteries. You can recharge these in any battery charger which can charge Li-on batteries (most only charge Ni-Mh and Ni-Cd so make sure to read the specifications on your charger!). The same company which sells these also makes a decent charger, so you can look into that if you wish.Just keep in mind that these are very large batteries despite what the pictures say (much larger than AA) and they won't fit in appliances which take standard AA batteries. Make sure to only get these if you have something which specifically requires 18650 batteries.Overall, these are good quality batteries. I assume that if you're on this page you know what you're looking for.

"The ACEVIVI Nail strips are composed of some material that is like a combination of a sticker and a gel. This property of the strips was actually rather helpful as it helps one re-adjust the strips after application on the nail, but the bad thing was how sticky they were. This is good and bad of course.The good: application of the strips is very straightforward; as the packages instructs, you simply peel the strip off of the plastic sheet, and apply to your nails. After applying, they can easily be removed and readjusted. Once applied, the strips dry up and actually last on your nails for a lot longer than nail polish, and also don’t chip¨ (though they do peel a little at times).The bad: while their high-level of stickyness is good for application, I found that after I had done my left hand and moved on to doing my right hand, the strips would stick to the freshly-applied strips on the nails of my left hand, which got really messy and frustrating. Good thing the strips were re-adjustable though so it wasn’t a big deal. Secondly, the strips do take a while to dry. After applying the strips, I didn’t wait long enough to let them dry, so I ended up losing a few strips within an hour, which of course can be pretty disappointing. Third, the strips themselves are rather large for my own nails. I have really small hands with really small nail beds, so the strips, made to be ¨one size fits all¨ often ended up sticking to my fingers because I had so much excess from the strips. Because of this, I came to learn that not trimming down the strip to fit the nail before they dry leads to complete peeling of the strips because of the little ¨flap¨ on the skin that isn’t fully dried on the nail. Also, the package instructs one file any excess from the strips; filing the strip ended up tearing the part of the strip that was already on my nail - lucky for the ¨gel-like¨ texture of the strips I was able to easily hide the tear). Therefore I recommend instead to trim it off with scissors or a clipper. I also found that it helped a lot to have a nail pick to fully fit the strip to all the crevices on your nail! This will help the strips stay on the nail for longer!All in all, the strips themselves are OK. Everything I listed in ¨The bad¨ list can be fixed by taking a few extra measures, but it’s inconvenient.Given their durability and their diverse set of designs, I wouldn’t say that it’s a bad deal. As I mentioned already, I have had my current set of stick-ons for 3 weeks now, and it looks like they’ll be on for much longer. I would take these stick-ons over regular nail polish for a quick, long-lasting fix–just be aware of some of the product’s flaws.3.5/5 stars.-Please note that I was sent this product for review, and feel free to leave questions & comments below!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NW6LW3LQZKLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U8MEZEM#wasThisHelpful","R3NW6LW3LQZKLM","A2EKBJB8H5MDD8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EKBJB8H5MDD8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here’s a compact adapter for families or just people with lots of portable devices. In our increasingly technological world, more and more devices need to be charged, and this adapter is able to fit five USB ports to charge all your devices. Despite that, it maintains a small footprint–it’s around the same size as thick deck of cards. It also comes with a cable of around 3 feet which connects the adapter to the outlet.As for the construction of the charger itself, it’s mostly made of a soft rubbery plastic with an aluminum band (the red part w/ the logo). There’s also a small blue LED light that indicates when there’s power flowing to the adapter. It’s non-intrusive & subtle, and I like it. The purpose of this is to get out of the way and charge your devices, and this design achieves that purpose. Now, in my use, it has gotten warm when I charged more than 3 devices at once, but that’s to be expected. The manual says that there’s a smart chip inside which determines what device is plugged in and charges it at an appropriate voltage, and that seems to work pretty well because both tablets and phones charged at its normal rate.Overall, this is a solidly built adapter which works well and boasts a portable design. I’d recommend this for anyone with the need to charge multiple devices. For the current price of $20, it's not the cheapest one on the market, but I think the build quality justifies the price in this case.==The Good==+ Compact build w/ five USB ports+ Non-intrusive, subtle design+ Smart charging allows for fast charging of both tablets/phones==The Bad==- Nothing!*Please note that I was sent this product for review.

"This, like the title describes, is simply a powerstrip with 4 USB ports instead of outlets. It’s around the same size as a small power strip, but it seems well built. It’s mostly made of plastic with some rubber around the edges as well as on the bottom for better grip. It’s a clean design that gives off a minimalist and sleek look. It comes with a simple power cable around 3 feet long, which is a bit on the short side, but my power outlet wasn’t too far away, so it didn’t present a problem for me. A blue LED light turns on when it’s plugged in and all of the USB ports also light up. This looks pretty cool at night, as you can clearly see where the charger is, but I can also see this being a bit disruptive if placed too close to the bed–I’d recommend placing this on the floor instead.Functionally, it works great. Obviously, the reversible USB ports are nice because you never have to worry about which way the USB is supposed to go in, and it’s been able to charge all devices (tablets, phones, kindles, etc.) at the same speed as a normal wall adapter, regardless of how many devices you have plugged in.All in all, as long as you don’t mind the blue LED lights (I personally think they’re kinda cool), this is a convenient USB power strip to have for those who want a central hub to charge all their devices.==The Good==+ Reversible USB ports are convenient+ Blue LED lights look cool (in my opinion)+ Clean, minimalist design==The Bad==- Power cable is a little short- Blue LED lights could be intrusive to some*Please note that I was sent this product for review.

"Most of the battery packs on the market these days consist of the battery & a micro-USB cable for charging the battery pack. This external battery pack does away with that cable and instead it is replaced with a foldable 2 prong male plug, so you can stick this directly into the wall to charge it. Other features include 2 USB output jacks (so you can charge 2 devices at a time), as well as a LED indicator light (blue = relatively full, green = around 50%, red = low battery, flashing = charging). What’s cool about this design is that it can double as a wall-USB adapter, since you can plug it in and charge both the battery & your devices at the same time–and when you’re on the go, simply unplug the battery, fold in the plug, and it becomes a portable external battery pack. It’s convenient & versatile. Overall, I really like this designNow, it does advertise this “shake & charge” feature, which in my opinion is more of a gimmick rather than anything useful. Essentially, instead of a power button to turn on the battery, you just have to give it a good shake. While that’s novel and different from the other battery packs, it doesn’t serve the function any better. To be honest, I prefer the good old fashioned power button, as shaking it to turn it on can look a bit strange–especially to others who have no idea what you’re doing.Finally, some technical details:- 5000mAh is able to charge most smartphones 2 times- Charging speed is on par with charging your device w/ a wall adapter- I didn’t get an exact timer on this, but it takes a bit longer to charge both devices & the battery at the same time vs just the battery alone.- Recharging time is around 5-6 hrs in my experience, which is a bit longer than other battery packsOverall, despite the gimmicky shake & charge feature, I still like the design & versatility of this battery pack. It doesn’t have a flashlight like most other battery packs, but those usually aren’t any good–and I think the versatility of this device as both a battery pack and a wall adapter makes up for it. Overall, I’d recommend this to anyone looking for a external battery pack and won’t mind the shaking feature. The price is decent, the quality is good, and the longer charging time shouldn’t be an issue when it’s used normally as a wall adapter and taken as a mobile battery pack while on the go.4.5/5==The Good==+ Unique & versatile design+ Compact & portable+ Charging is fast regardless of device==The Bad==- Shake & charge feature feels gimmicky rather than purposeful- Takes a bit longer compared to other battery packs to recharge*Please note that I was sent this product for review.

"For fans of lighter-flavored teas, the green spiral spring tea is one of the better ones out there. Having been to China before, I can attest that it is indeed one of the more famous and expensive tea leaves over there, and many value the green tea for its lightly aromatic flavor and its natural health properties. As for this specific product, it's packaged nicely in a vacuum seal in a tin can, so it's fresh when it gets to your house. The tea leaves themselves are great, and here are some of my recommendations to ensure the best tasting tea (from my experiences in China, at least):- Use water that's just below boiling temperature (water that is too hot will destroy the flavor of the tea, and leave a slightly bitter taste)- This tea is meant to be very lightly flavored, so no need to overdo the tea leaves. A light golden yellow color is the best tasting in my opinion- You can actually freeze the tea leaves after opening to keep it staying fresh longer and preserve flavor.Overall, I'd recommend these tea leaves for those looking for something different from the everyday black/green teas. It's not for people who enjoy strong-flavored teas, but for those looking for a more subtle aromatic flavor, this is a great choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI1GRZ4MB6A5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PI3VL3E#wasThisHelpful","RI1GRZ4MB6A5F","A2EKBJB8H5MDD8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EKBJB8H5MDD8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ACEVIVI eyeshadow “wedding party” palette consists of very neutral, natural colors, such as browns, greys, blacks, peaches and beiges. The palette comes in a black case with a sturdy build and includes a mirror and two eyeshadow applicators. The case itself is very nice and professional looking, and even after having it (accidentally) fall off of  the top cabinet in my bathroom (about 6 feet high) the case was still completely intact!On to the palette: I was very impressed by the color selection. You have all the colors necessary for highlights and undertones that will allow for many designs. Or, if you’re more into simple make-up (like myself) it’s perfect for that too. Personally, I love the smokey-eye effect, and this palette’s color selection made it possible to create smokey eye effects with different colors.As for the eyeshadow itself, for the price you pay, you get good-quality eyeshadows that are rich in color and easy to apply. The eyeshadows are so soft and almost have that “moist” texture that allow them to be applied easily without having to do multiple applications. What’s more, it makes it incredibly easy to blend different colors together to create different effects. One downside of this, however is that if you don’t shake the brush (or applicator) the eyeshadow will sprinkle down off your eye lid and onto your cheek,  but this is easily solved by shaking off the excess eye-shadow from the brush. Once applied, the colors stayed on for a long time without smearing or smudging, even without the use of eye primer, which is great for those rushed moments or when you need a quick fix-up.Overall, I would highly recommend this eyeshadow palette for the quality of the paints and the affordable price. Being a fan of more toned-down colors, I would most definitely buy this palette again.-Feel free to leave questions & comments below!

"I recently had the opportunity to go camping with this lantern, and this is going to be a short review of my experience with this lantern, as well as some things I think you should note before purchasing it.- Made out of plastic, maintaining a light weight but compromises a bit on durability. I haven’t tried it, but I think drops from onto hard cement would damage it.- The light turns on automatically when you expand it and collapses to a portable size of 3.5 inches (around the height of an average smartphone). It’s around the width of a Camelbak water bottle.- Rated at 65 lumens, it was bright enough to light the entire campsite and spot any lingering garbage, raccoons, creepy camper neighbors.- Can also be used inside  a tent, but staring right at it is a bit painful–best used outside.- Bright enough to be used for nighttime hiking!- No issues with battery life during my 2 nights of usage (I’d still recommend bringing extra batteries for longer expeditions though).Overall, this is an excellent lantern with a good brightness for camping. It’s powerful enough to light up 10+ yards outdoors and provide good visibility of the entire campsite, which was all I needed. It’s also relatively portable for a lantern this powerful, which is really nice. I love the fact that it can be contracted and it turns on automatically when expanded–really makes it easy to use. I’d recommend this to anyone who needs a convenient, easy to use electric lantern while camping.Also, for those campers who use propane lanterns, I would say this is definitely dimmer, but in my opinion, the convenience and the reliability that comes with electric lanterns makes it a worthy trade-off.Hope this helps!

"I had the opportunity to go camping with this lantern, and this is going to be a short review of my experience with this lantern.- It’s compact and portable–I was able to stuff it just about anywhere. It’s also versatile, since you expand it for the lantern and collapse it to turn it into a flashlight. Probably the most valuable features.- Rubbery texture feels pretty good with a nice grip. It’s essentially two plastic pieces connected with an expandable spring-like structure, with some kind of cloth mesh. Battery compartment is at the bottom & you twist it to change batteries. There’s also a hook at the top, which can be folded in for portability.- It does have 3 modes, as listed in the description, but at night, when it’s pitch-black out, you’re going to want to stick with the bright mode. (It’s rated @ 30 lumens, which lights up a few yards outdoors).- It’s most useful for inside the tent, since it was able to provide good light to the entire tent without being too bright.- Battery life seems fine; I didn’t reach the full 15 hours of use, but I didn’t have to change batteries either.Overall, this is a fine lantern for indoors or if you need to light a smaller area. Just keep that in mind as you're buying this and don't expect a super powerful lantern from such a small device. The main strengths of this are the versatility as well as the portability. I would recommend a more powerful lantern for hiking trails at night or an activity which requires a lot of light, since this only lights up a couple of yards. If you’re looking for a small portable lantern that can get the job done in a cinch however, this is a great choice.Hope this helps!

"When I was asked to review this product, I got pretty excited. A solar powered battery which could charge your phone/tablets/portable devices?! That sounded pretty awesome and futuristic–a chance to perhaps get off the grid–but alas, it’s not what this product is for. This battery functions more like the typical external batteries that you can find anywhere else, with the solar charging function built in for emergencies. It also features a semi-rugged, water-resistant design, with the entire battery being enclosed in a protective rubber case with rubber seals covering each of the ports. I’ll keep this review short & simple, splitting it into two parts–design & how well it functions.==Design==I personally really like the design. I had the red color, which was bold and striking. The water resistant seals covering the ports felt a bit loose, so it wouldn’t stand being submerged inside water, but it makes it gives it some resistance against the rain. There’s 4 blue LEDs across the top which indicate the battery level, and the first LED turns green to indicate that it’s being charged via the solar panels. In the top right corner is the power button, which you can press once to turn on/indicate the battery level and press twice to turn on the flashlight. Speaking of the flashlight, it’s just a small LED light at the corner. It won’t replace a regular flashlight, but it’ll do in a pinch. The rest you can see in the picture–but I do really like the rubbery feel and grip of the battery.==Functionality==In short, it works. There are a couple of quirks that should be noted though. First of all, it’s rated at 5300mAh, which means it should be enough to charge the average smartphone 1.5-2 times. For the current price of $25, you can get (non-solar)batteries with a higher capacity for this price (just look on Amazon, or message me for recommendations), so what you’re paying for is the extra functionality of solar charging. Unfortunately, the solar charging is really slow. This is no fault of the device–I just don’t think solar technology is there yet–but just be aware that you probably won’t be using this solar charging option very often. Just to give an example, the manual says that 7-8 hours of solar charging = 20-30% of battery in an iPhone. I didn’t stand outside for that long, but from my limited use, it does seem to be quite slow. It recommends you charge it via the micro-USB cable, and I’d recommend that too. In my testing, it took around 4.5 hours to charge the battery from 0-100.My second quirk is this: there’s two USB ports–one on either side–so you can charge two devices at once, but oddly enough you can only do that when your battery is full. It’s really weird, and if you try charging two devices when the battery is at like 50% for example, the battery would shut itself off. I’m not sure for the reason behind this, but it’s just something to keep a note of.Other than those two things, everything else works as expected. It seems designed for outdoor stuff (it comes with a carabiner after all), and I can definitely see this being useful on a camping trip or for emergencies where you have no access to electricity. Before you buy it, you should ask yourself if you really need a battery with a slow-charging solar option, because if you don’t, there are cheaper options available which work just as well. If you’re an outdoors person and could use the solar charging functionally, I’d recommend this battery. Yes it’s slow and it sometimes can’t charge two devices at once, but it’s well designed, it’s rugged, and it works.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HWKSTK2QX91V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNV8SRS#wasThisHelpful","R1HWKSTK2QX91V","A2EKBJB8H5MDD8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EKBJB8H5MDD8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve always thought magnets were cool so when I got the chance to review this product I was pretty excited. Whereas most of these phone mounts work via some sort of clip to hold your phone and a suction cup to mount it to the windshield, this one works with a magnet to hold your phone and a clip to attach to the air vents on your car. While this was certainly a unique take on the car mount, I had a couple of questions as to how well this would actually work–are the magnets actually strong enough to hold it in place? Would the air vents blowing hot air cause the phone to overheat? Does the clip stay on well enough on rough roads? Will the magnet damage the phone? I’ll answer all those questions & more in my review below.First, I’ll start with what’s in the box–you’ve got the clip itself with the magnet. It’s a circular little thing as you can see in the pictures and it’s coated with this rubbery material that gives it a nice grip. There’s also two magnets for non-magnetic phones which come separately. There’s a rectangular one and a circular one. Both of these are like stickers, and you can stick them onto your phone. Alternatively, if you don’t want something permanently attached to your phone, you can just slide the magnets in between your phone and your case. If you have a phone made out of glass/plastic and you don’t have a case, your only option would be to stick the magnet onto the phone.Anyways, I personally have a Nexus 4, which is made out of glass, and a normal plastic shell case. I didn’t want to stick a magnet on my phone, so I just slid it in between the case and my phone. At first I was a bit dubious about how well it would work at first because it would have to stick to the magnet through the case. Granted, I don’t have an otterbox or anything (and I don’t think it would work as well if you did), but it actually stuck on very tightly despite the case. I was quite pleased, and the bond was strong enough to not fall off during driving. As for the other questions–it does block the vent a little bit and the phone does get hot if you have the heat up, but I’ve never had the phone overheat and shut itself off. The only slight negative here is that the excess heat might shorten the battery life a bit, but it’s all very conditional. The clip itself also holds on to the vent quite well, and I had friends comment on how cool it is to see the phone just floating near the vents with nothing holding it in place. My final concern was about the magnet damaging the phone–I’m sure we’ve all heard stories about how magnets can corrupt hard drives and mess up the screen on old computers, but after doing some research, it turns out that this magnet, while strong, isn’t nearly strong enough to damage the phone.Overall, this works really well, and it also looks a lot cooler than your typical mounts. My only reservation would be for those with either a very heavy phone (phablets perhaps?) or those with thick cases. If you have a thick case, your only solution would be to stick the magnet outside of the case, and I’m not sure how many would like that. For those people, I’d recommend sticking to a regular car mount, as the magnets might not be strong enough to hold the phone. For me though, I just leave the magnet in between my phone and the case, and when I get in the car I can just effortlessly attach it to the mount. It makes it a lot easier, and every time I use it, it feels like magic. Or perhaps it’s just magnets.In summary…=The Good=+ Feels like magic. Magnetic magic.+ Magnets are strong enough for most users.+ Looks awesome, easy to use.-The Bad-- Vents aren’t the most ideal position for a phone.- Not as great for users with heavy phones/thick cases.Feel free to leave comments/questions below!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18Y4Z17ZOTJ1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3QPQWY#wasThisHelpful","R18Y4Z17ZOTJ1C","A2EKBJB8H5MDD8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EKBJB8H5MDD8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With this magical little device, you can pretty much turn any regular speaker into a bluetooth speaker. It’s a very small device, but it does come with a bunch of wires. There’s a dedicated power cable/adapter and an AUX cable to connect the bluetooth receiver to an actual speaker. Within the adapter, there’s also an NFC chip which allows NFC enabled phones (search “NFC enabled phones” on Google for a list if you’re not sure) to tap the receiver to pair it up via bluetooth. For those without NFC, you can still do it the old fashioned way (via settings, etc.). Anyways, once you have it plugged in and paired to your phones, you can connect it to any speaker with an AUX input jack, and that speaker essentially becomes a wireless bluetooth speaker! It also comes with the more outdated audio adapter as well so you can plug this into your older speakers/TV and play music from your phone!I’ve personally found this to be useful for my old set of stereo speakers, because now I can essentially stream music wirelessly from across the room. That being said, I do think that this is a product with limited use, since you can essentially do the thing by just connecting your phone to the speakers via an AUX cable. The only benefit this gives you is that it allows you to have a wireless connection between normally wired connections. When I was using it, it took me around 2-3 taps using the NFC pairing function before it recognized it and paired it up with the receiver. After pairing it up however, everything else worked flawlessly. The range is around 30 feet, which is more than enough for my uses around the house. On a side note, since this isn’t battery operated, it has to be kept plugged in at all times. This limits the portability, but it also means you don’t have to rely on battery life.Aside from the limited functionality, it does work really well. I’d like to see it come with something like a car adapter as well, for example, so I could also use it in the car. Overall, I don’t think this is something that would be considered a necessity for everyone, but for those who would like what is essentially a wireless update for their older speakers, this is a solution which works well.Check out the pictures for the size comparisons–it’s around the size of a regular egg.Feel free to leave any questions and comments below, and please note that I was sent this product for review.5/5Summary+ Works flawlessly+ Easy to use+ “Upgrades” older speakers with Bluetooth- NFC function took multiple taps- Limited use- Has to be kept plugged in","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A9QFIDALA16M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZVPD72#wasThisHelpful","R2A9QFIDALA16M","A2EKBJB8H5MDD8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EKBJB8H5MDD8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With a full glass platform, this scale looks really nice and classy on the kitchen counter. It’s operated completely by touch, and with a limit of 11 pounds, you shouldn’t be running into any issues (unless you’re eating a LOT of food). There’s a TARE function which allows you to reset it to zero to take into account things like cups/packaging/etc. You can also change the unit from grams to kilograms, ounces, and pounds. It works well, and the product as a whole is well made. I personally think the size is perfect for a kitchen scale. The only slight downside is that it’s powered by a button battery, which isn’t the best when it comes to replacement time (not as easy to find as something like a AA battery, for example), but it’s not too bad.My one minor complaint about this is that the glass attracts fingerprints really easily. I suppose it’s to be expected due to it being glass, but after using it a couple times, there are fingerprints all over the power button area. It’s not the worst thing, but it does detract a little bit from the look and gets a little annoying.Overall though, it works well, and it’s built well. It’s very simple to operate. The design looks great–the thinness of the device really gives it a sleek look, and if you’re not too bothered by fingerprints on your scale, I’d recommend this kitchen scale to anyone who needs it.Check out the picture for a relative size comparison. Also, for those who want more information on how to use it, here's a summary:- Tap the tare/power button to turn it on- Tap the unit button to change the unit- Tap the tare/power button once on to reset scale to zero- Press and hold the tare/power button to turn it offDisclaimer: I was sent this product for review.

"Jumping rope is something that’s been growing in popularity as a cardiovascular workout, and famous boxers and other athletes have been using it as an alternative to running. There are several reasons why one would choose to jump rope instead of running, namely:- You stay in one place/easier to do indoors (you can do it in your house if you have a decent amount of space)- No need for a more expensive treadmill- Outside conditions may not always be the best for running- They’re both great cardio workouts, though the muscles worked are slightly differentNow, as for this specific jump rope, here are my experiences with it. I’m going to assume you have experience with jumping rope–if not, look up some online guides (it’s pretty easy to learn and it’s fun too!)It feels like a durable jump rope–very well made. I like the fact that you can actually adjust the length of the rope by adjusting the location of the handles, making it suitable for all sorts of people. As for the motion, it’s like the other reviewers have said–very smooth. It’s very light and easy to use, and I think both beginners and more advanced users would like this jump rope. I will say that since the rope is made out of wire, it does hurt if you hit yourself, but this applies to most jump ropes as well. Finally, it does come with that pouch you see in the pictures. It’s a nice bonus, and it’s useful for carrying it around if you travel a lot.Overall, I have no complaints about this product--it works very smoothly and I like how light it is. It’s versatile and adjustable as well. I think this would be a great jump rope for beginners and more experienced users alike.Disclaimer: Please note that I was sent this product for review.

"I got the wind lotion, because I’ve always wondered what does wind smell like exactly? That was the question I had in my mind as I was trying it out for the first time. I was curious. Well, I didn’t have many expectations for this wind lotion, but I tried it anyways for 2 weeks. Just on a side note, I have normal skin, and I tried it on my arms, legs, and various parts of my body. Here are my observations:+ It definitely feels good on the skin. It’s light enough to not feel greasy, but it’s not so light that it feels like water either. The skin absorbs it pretty fast as a result.+ After application, it does leave a cool, tingly feeling. It’s very subtle though–it’s not like rubbing mint on your skin or anything.+  It came with 2 caps, which was pretty cool (one pump-styled, and one that’s seen in the pictures).+ I personally like the design of the bottle–feels and looks quite stylish.+ As for the fragrance… well I can’t say it smells like the wind. It’s very light, and it has a masculine smell to it. It’s not your typical masculine scent (you know, the one that smells like bear piss on evergreen trees)--it’s a bit more exotic. It’s really hard to describe the scent, other than saying it smells a bit like those artificial ocean wave scented candles but way lighter.+ It did moisturize the skin really well, and the scent lasted for around 2-3 hours afterwards.Overall, I loved how it felt, and it worked well. I wasn’t the biggest fan of the scent, but it was tolerable still.Finally, as a disclaimer–please note that I was given this product for review.

"Just wanted to say that I bought the army green one and it's definitely not as dark as it appears in the pictures--it's lighter and not that green, but I'm still okay with the color. I think it looks pretty stylish overall, and I like it for the most part.First off, I love how many compartments there are--2 side ones, one on the front, and there's even a small one in the back that you can't see in the pictures. Within the main compartment are like 4 more smaller pockets to help you organize things better. The canvas feels solid and durable, and the buckles/straps attached to the zippers feel like actual leather (not sure if they are or not though). The zippers itself seem decent, but time will tell. That being said, I do think it feels a bit small (6 ft male here). I think it might be tough to fit something like a 17 inch laptop in here. There's a designated sleeve for laptops, but my 11.6 inch chromebook barely fits in there with a case on. Also, there's no designated spot for a water bottle, which is something I'll miss coming from a traditional backpack. I haven't used it enough to comment on the durability yet, but I'll be using this as my day-to-day backpack, so I'll update the review after a couple months.Some final notes:- It's made in China--the packaging and the tag are in Chinese.- Overall quality feels pretty good; I just wish it was a bit more spacious- Feels comfortable to wear- Did some research to compare prices between canvas bags on Amazon, and this was one of the better deals.

"This is a collection of both floral and whole leaf tea, and it's absolutely delicious. I just wanted to point out a couple of things that I really appreciated about this collection:+ The packaging is great. Everything is vacuum sealed, making all of the flower buds/leaves incredibly fresh.+ Quality of the entire collection is very high+ Goes great with Tea Beyond's teapots, since you can really see the flower blooms unfold in the glass teapots as the tea is brewing. Takes the tea experience to the next level.+ Also great for parties for when you want to make an impression/have a conversation starter. You don't usually see hand-sewn floral tea blooms everywhere.I tried all of the different teas in this collection and I loved them all! I'm relatively new to floral teas, and I thought they were delicious. I wish they provided a little bit more information in the packaging about what's inside the flower blooms since they only have a name like ""paradise"" or ""forever love"", but I would still recommend this to any hardcore tea fans or just people looking to experience tea in a completely new way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VX38K3BWBDRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R7BXYKI#wasThisHelpful","R2VX38K3BWBDRV","A2EKBJB8H5MDD8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EKBJB8H5MDD8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just a disclaimer–I was sent this product for review. Here’s a lightning cable that feels more durable right out of the box, especially when compared to Apple’s included one. Apple’s cables aren’t bad, but they’re not the most durable either–especially for those who carry them everywhere due to the poor battery life of smartphones in general. Now, it’s a bit pricier than some of the other replacements that are here on Amazon, but some of the other cables have gotten poor reviews with them not lasting very long or the cables somehow breaking the phone. This cable just feels incredibly tough and durable–the two jacks are reinforced with metal (aluminum I believe), and the cable itself is like those you find on rugged headphones.

"I’ve never tried magnesium oil–nor have I even heard of it–until I was sent this product for review. I was curious, so I did some research on it and apparently it has a bunch of health benefits, with the most notable ones being better sleep, stress relief, and better digestion. Some of the studies done have found that ~70% of Americans consume less than the recommended dose of magnesium, and this topical magnesium oil should help with that.As for my personal experience, I have been sleeping well and feeling pretty good after using it, but I can't say for sure that it was because of this magnesium oil. There are just too many variables when it comes to digestion and sleeping like better exercise or a better diet. Also, what works for one person might not work for another. Anyways, with that in mind, I’ll write down some of my observations after 2 weeks of using this product:+ It seems to work best after a hot shower, as that’s when my skin was the softest and most absorbent.+ I would compare it to rubbing salt water on yourself rather than an oil–it leaves a layer of salt on your skin after it dries that you can’t see but you can feel. I accidentally applied it to a small wound this one time, and it burned like salt water would.+ Instructions say to rub it on your feet, especially on the bottom of your feet. That made me feel itchy (but only slightly…), which is apparently a sign of magnesium deficiency (oh no!)+ It doesn’t really have a smell. I tried smelling it once after rubbing it on my feet and smelled… my feet.+ I haven’t experienced any negative side effects since using this product.+ It feels a bit funny having salt on your skin, but it’s also oddly comfortable.As always, my advice with health supplements is to try them if you think you need them. In this case, if you think you need magnesium (usually found naturally in cocoa, leafy greens like spinach, and nuts), it wouldn’t hurt to try this out. Most of these supplements rarely have negative side effects, and if it doesn’t work–well you don’t ever have to buy it again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SMUYKOG8AQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q78C1EW#wasThisHelpful","R2SMUYKOG8AQP","A2EKBJB8H5MDD8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EKBJB8H5MDD8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m going to write the review with the assumption that you know what a UV light is and what it does (it’s not a flashlight, and it definitely doesn’t light up the dark like one). The most surprising thing about this model is how powerful it was based on the size. The beam is bright and it can cover a decently large area, despite the compact size. Unfortunately, you can’t adjust the focus like you can with some of the other lights. Using it in the dark provides the best results, as with most UV lights, but it can still work with some light.Build quality is solid. I like the fact that it’s made out of metal which gives it a nice solid feel. When I tried it for the first time, I was quite… surprised by the amount of stuff on my bed.

"Our 3 year old daughter really loves this and takes it with her to bed every night.  No buttons to push to turn it on and none to push to turn it off and it turns off automatically, too.It is definitely not something mommy or daddy could read her a book next to as it is quite dim, but perfect to not disrupt sleep if she takes it with her and cuddles with it.We also like the fact it is a very soft squishy light, in case she were to roll over it, versus a real hard plastic flashlight, not that we would let get sleep with one of those.The only reason I gave 4 stars (instead of  5) is the current price as of this writing; we received this for free as a Vine reviewer, but as parents, we would not have spent more than $10 for an item like this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22UZ0M2FLIBLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z0TQZI2#wasThisHelpful","R22UZ0M2FLIBLZ","A22KGO6Q2YWS0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22KGO6Q2YWS0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We installed this on an 18' ceiling to replace an original and quite outdated foyer pendant light.The product is beautiful, the welds look fine, very high quality.The reason I gave it 3-stars however is because we felt the product dimensions were a little misleading.  We were replacing a 24"" pendant light and this one states it is 25"".  Well, that includes the pole pictured at the top.  The large portion of the light itself is maybe only 16"" tall, the rest of that length is that pole.Even the 24"" pendant light I removed had a 3-4 inch pole at top that connected to the chain and no, I didn't even consider that as part of the overall product dimension, ie...our original light is not really a 27-28"" light, it is a 24"" light.I make a big deal of this, because who cares how long that pole is, you just shorten the chain as needed, what matters is the exact proportions of the light when compared to something like an 18' ceiling!  So yes, we were a bit disappointed.We debated returning it, but decided we'd try it out and though we do wish we had something that matched the perfectly-sized 24"" light we replaced, we were willing to live with this one.And yes, we used every single chain link for the 18' ceiling drop to match the length of the 24"" light we replaced.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QRDX9ONC4GJH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008M4QT2O#wasThisHelpful","R1QRDX9ONC4GJH","A22KGO6Q2YWS0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22KGO6Q2YWS0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was actually slightly worried about the ""gold"" color and looking a bit too ""bling-y"".Fortunately, when it arrived, it was a perfect fit in every way, and because of the different shades of gold (but not 50!!), you really have to look and concentrate to see that it is gold, versus a dark grey, but in different lighting, sometimes a dark gold.

"I don't give a lot of 5 star book reviews, but this book by a former employee is well executed.It starts from the very beginning of the Alibaba Apartment and describes how it has transformed into the world's largest e-commerce conglomerate that most Westerners have never heard of.This book sparked my interest based on the recent IPO in the US on a company I knew nothing about.  The book is a very fast read even though it is 230 or so pages.  I learned a lot about the story, the Alibaba ecosystem that consists of AliPay, Taobao, Yahoo China, Alibaba.com and a few more entities.  I appreciated learning of the struggle of Jack Ma, a former teacher, and founder of Alibaba Global and how he transformed his company.The story of how they were the David to the Goliath of EBay China was fascinating, as well as the not so rosy story of Yahoo China and dipping their hands in the Search business.From 1999 to 2014, they wanted to take care of business first before taking on a U.S. IPO, though they could have tried 10 years ago and ended up with a potentially different business than what they are today.  I found it amazing their transaction volume exceeds both EBay and Amazon combined!  That really helps you understand their size.Overall, a great, enjoyable, informative book that has a perfect title.

Do NOTE this is our experience for OUR 18-month old, your little one might be bigger framed and might be able to easily swallow a piece, just want to make that clear!I give this 4 stars overall, because, brand new out of the package, I did notice a few small chips in the paint in the edge of the blocks that did flake away with my thumbnail.  I have not noticed additional peeling or flaking (even by trying with my fingernail) since then.

"Warning: this 7 piece set is a bit misleading!You really get 6 actual double-ended bits (12 bit ends total) and a magnetic screw-holder, but it actually gets worse than that.There are FOUR of the #2 Phillips bit out of the 12 total!Then, there are THREE of the #2 hex and THREE of the T25 torx.Then you get one T20 torx and one 8-10 flat head.So really you get 5 varieties of bits out of 12; the rest are just duplicates.

"Fun toy, with its own folding, self-storage!This is an excellent age-appropriate toy for learning to use ""Legos"" err, these ""mega bloks"".As parents, we like the fact that it is self-containing storage with its own ""lid""  (The platform becomes the lid and the bloks can be stored underneath).  The height adjustability is nice, even though we keep the legs folded out, but our infant son could use this as a platform with the legs folded in.  Also the fold-away legs helps so you can store/stack it easier when cleaning up the toy room.  We wish more toys were like this to keep all of the pieces together.We also have a separately-purchased big bag of the same Mega Bloks brand that does work with this, too - just so you know.We will be a Mega Bloks family for a few more years until the kids are older, but we are comfortable with our little girl using this and not having to worry about our infant son getting his hands on these large mega bloks and large pieces since they would be very, very difficult to easily choke on due to the large size of everything contained in this toy (and with proper supervision of course).

"This book chronicles the 'transformation' of the author, Guy Spier, as he progresses from his first job out of school to the pinnacle value investor.  He shares many growth stories, from working at a firm with a less than stellar reputation to making mature decisions along the way, including a bid to have lunch with the Oracle of Omaha - the one and only, Warren Buffett.I am left with slightly mixed feelings from the value-principle of spending over half-a-million-dollars on a single lunch even with Warren Buffett, versus the value investment of research, reading his memoirs, listening/watching all of Mr. Buffett's speeches, etc.  He could have spent less than 1/10 that and hired a team of interns to provide him every reference of Warren Buffett online or in print in a few weeks.  But on the other hand, one of the central themes of the book is the concepts from that legendary lunch and it is good to have themes to help tell your story.  (Though admittedly, that theme was slightly a bit too heavy throughout the book!)Overall, I had wanted more of the ""golden nuggets"" distributed through-out the book, versus provided in the ending chapters.  While each chapter builds upon the transformative progression on how *the author* becomes a value investor, the ending chapters do completely switch gears, flow and focus and provides the ""golden nuggets"" for *YOU* to become a value investor once the transformative story has been told.

The material is not super absorbent terry-cloth thick like a bath towel, rather, really thin like beach towels.You wouldn't use this as a bath towel, but as a beach-robe (poncho) or beach-wrap for when you are done with the beach/pool and are walking back to the car, etc.With those expectations set, this is a 4-star beach poncho towel for our daughter, she REALLY LOVES IT!  She loves to wear this as a costume and play around in it.  It is very cute and fits her great, even though she is on the smaller side for a 2.5 year old.As a costume only, we would probably get more of these in other characters, but as long as you understand it doesn't serve as a ""dry me off after a bath"" type towel, but as a beach-poncho or play-costume, this is really great!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32DRQZS1RDVET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H6QQQD6#wasThisHelpful","R32DRQZS1RDVET","A22KGO6Q2YWS0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22KGO6Q2YWS0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am rating this as a 3-Star - ""It's Okay"" based on usage from a 12 month old and a 2.5 year old.First, this was easy to assemble and does seem sturdy and I do like that it has a few height adjustment points, including a low setting for a toddler who might be sitting up.  But our daughter is in the 10th percentile for height and this toy is rated for 12-36 month old kids and the tallest adjustment is low for her.  She's roughly a head shorter than most peers her age at daycare.  So the realistic age would be 12-24months for 90% of the kids out there.In terms of usage, it is quite busy.  She likes to belt out the ""Let it Go!"" song from the Frozen movie soundtrack, but if she wants to play along on the piano while singing, the VTech's built-in songs take over.  If Daddy tries to help out and taps on the drums then a pre-recorded drum tune starts going at the same time the keys are going all while she is singing. :--)I also took 1 star off because I thought she would absolutely love the voice-changer effect like other toys out there that change your voice.  Unfortunately, you can't really hear a difference, no matter the selection, unless you cup the microphone and your mouth and direct your voice in the center of the microphone.  (Ask Daddy how he knows that... ;--)  )  And why can't she hear her voice change (much less my own)?  Because the tallest height adjustment is low even for her in the 10th percentile for height.Now for our 12-month old, whether this product is on the lowest setting or taken off and placed on the floor, it's still a bunch of lights and sounds for him.  So I think 3-stars is pretty fair here, ""It's Okay.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RZZZ7YEL0WAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KG3WYAA#wasThisHelpful","R2RZZZ7YEL0WAE","A22KGO6Q2YWS0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22KGO6Q2YWS0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was excited to receive this product because it doesn't have a horizontal brace along the floor that you can trip on, like other brands do.Unfortunately, this particular design is quite flawed:1. I read the instructions multiple times and myself and my wife could not consistently get this gate to lock in place.2. Eventually, I figured out that you should not expand it to fit the area you want to secure by compressing the pressure-mount pins.  You should expand it so that they barely touch the wall and then, you can more easily press the handle to lock the gate in place.3. Though the instructions state ""baseboard adjustment pins"" are on the bottom, in reality, with every wall I tried this on with baseboards (like to the kitchen) there is not enough ""buffer"" so that the gate will lock in place.4. I could ONLY securely/consistently lock the gate in place in a smooth doorway (but DUHH, you would just close that door!)5. Fixating and removing this in daily use is a chore; we specifically wanted it for our kitchen, which has 2 arch entryways.  The other entryway has a Northgate Supergate on it already which works great and has a swinging gate.6. Yes, THIS model does have a swing mode - but you are still faced with issues #2 and 3 above.  If you have baseboards, which we do, including at the top of the stairs, then you essentially cannot use this product and lock even a swinging gate in place.7. You could install this product above the baseboards where the smooth wall surface is, but then you need two hands to do such since you need a lot of pressure to lock the handle in place which pushes the ""pressure mount pins"" out.  (You still lock the handle in place in the Swing-Mode, just the non-swinging side is pressure-fit)8. Unless a lot of homes don't have baseboards, I seriously have no idea how this product was released and how there could be any positive reviews.  If the manufacturer would move the bottom pins a couple inches higher, most of the issues would be resolved, provided you figure out the trick on how to lock the handle in place that the provided instructions are not clear on.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DYRUFPDSW7CX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009YDFX2Y#wasThisHelpful","R2DYRUFPDSW7CX","A22KGO6Q2YWS0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22KGO6Q2YWS0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just returned this to Amazon, glad they were the actual vendor, else another vendor may not take it back.I wrote that it was DEFECTIVE since the description says it is Heavy Duty.  Never got to use it; put it in the dishwasher to get the darn sticker residue off (had already hand-washed it twice), it came out all grey-black and left black residue on your hands.  I DID save it so I could return it.Why did I even get this given the 1-star reviews?  Well...I was ordering a popcorn machine for a party and this scoop came up on the Amazon page as ""Other customers ALSO bought this item, buy them together"" so although I researched popcorn machines for an hour, I thought a simple metal scoop was a no-brainer and only bought the scoop because it was an Amazon suggestion.  I should've clicked further and seen the 1-star reviews.Regardless of reading the reviews, there should be a disclaimer or sticker stating it is not dishwasher safe.  (Even still, I don't think it would survive too many hand-washings with your typical dish/scour sponge, even the no-scratch variety).This is NOT heavy duty.

"I can only compare this to an Epson Artisan 837 wireless printer thus far.Some notable differences over the Epson Artisan 837:==========================================1. This WorkForce Pro WF-4640 is considerably louder in operation.  (Maybe 2-3x louder?)2. The touch screen unfortunately does NOT pivot like in the Artisan.  This is a feature you don't realize you need until you've used it.  Depending on where you put the printer, having a touch screen window that pivots makes a big difference in ease of use and visibility.3. The WorkForce Pro (WFP) is definitely more business-like and higher capacity, as it is more than twice as tall, and holds probably quadruple the paper that the Artisan holds.4. The WFP is a matte black and doesn't show fingerprints whereas the Artisan is a glossy black that shows everything.5. The WFP has 4 extra-large capacity color cartridges, whereas the Artisan has 6 ""deck of cards sized"" cartridges.  I can only imagine that something that has 6 colors would produce more accurate color prints than something that has to mix 4 colors, BUT THE WFP WINS HANDS DOWN.  I did have to run the Print Head Alignment tests on the WFP 3 times, but once I did, there were no more overlaps and the color out is superior to that of the Artisan 837.  Without color correction, both print outs did look similar with a bluish hue, but with the built-in color correction, the WFP more closely matched what was seen on my monitor and was quite vibrant.  The Artisan, even in non-high-speed, best-photo mode didn't look as crisp in detail as the WFP even when I used high-speed mode in the WFP.  The WFP won all color print-out tests.6. The WFP has a more commercial-like, full physical keypad, but I've never used the fax function of either printer.  The Artisan has a touch-keypad.  The WFP touchpad has a nice tone as you are pressing the buttons, but seems to require just a bit more effort than the touchpad on the Artisan.7. The speed difference is pretty amazing however.  The WFP is probably 10x faster in print speed than the Artisan, yet still produces more vibrant/crisp print outs even in high speed mode.8. Setting up the WIFI on the WFP was a little easier on the WFP than the Artisan.9. Color copying was incredible on the WFP.  First, out of the box, and just pressing COPY, there's no comparison, the WFP was super high quality and incredibly fast and superior.  The Artisan is a good bit slower and still retains a bluish/smudgey printout.  I'm not aware of any other color settings than can be done on the Artisan for Copying to have improved the output.10. Overall, the WFP is probably 2 feet high and 18"" wide.  The Artisan is probably 10"" high and 18"" wide.  The WFP is considerably taller because it likely holds quadruple the paper.  You could make the WFP about 4"" shorter if you took the second paper tray out completely (it stacks on top of it).Compared with the newest model of the ""Artisan 800 series"", THIS WFP model is about $100 more and in my opinion, worth it for the print quality and time saved from the print speeds alone.  It's not really more bulky, rather, just taller on your desk.I was prepared for the ""4-color-cartridges"" to be less crisp than ""6-color-cartridges"" but I was blown away by the quality and 10x faster print speeds.  From print quality to scan/copy quality to incredible speeds that still maintain a higher print quality to more than quadruple paper capacity, this may be a WorkForce Pro for a small business, but still wonderful and relatively inexpensive for any household.  I'd say it rivals even the color laser printers at work in quality and speed that I've seen!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S0QVEEJYHZVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXLGETS#wasThisHelpful","R1S0QVEEJYHZVN","A22KGO6Q2YWS0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22KGO6Q2YWS0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thankfully this was a product that Amazon Vine provided for review purposes, versus something we purchased or a friend may have purchased for us, else I'd feel terribly bad with a 2-star product.My main comparison is to a Baby Jogger City Mini GT with the never-flat all-terrain wheels.We've used the BOB Duallie Stroller on a number of outdoor walks and outdoor festivals and fair events.  In our last trip to SeaWorld, we purposely chose to leave this at home and instead, bring our single City Mini and City Mini GT and push around 2 strollers instead of this one.Why would I give this 2-stars?========================1. For the first outdoor festival, I never remembered to check the air in the tires and simply lugged it through the house and into the car.  When the pneumatic tires are underinflated, it's a pain to push around.  Our Baby Jogger City Mini GT has never-flat gel-filled all terrain tires that never need air, not sure why the BOB couldn't either.2. Part of the reason in choosing to NOT bring the BOB duallie stroller on a distant road trip to SeaWorld is because we'd have to pack a bicycle pump to ensure we wouldn't be stranded with under-inflated tires all day.  Sure there are travel sized pumps the size of a 6"" Subway sandwich, but one less thing to pack and worry about is still one less thing to pack and worry about.3. Back to point #1, I lugged it through the house folded because it doesn't fit through standard doorways from the bedroom to the laundry room to the door to the garage unfolded.4. We wanted to compare this at the big box store (Buy Buy Baby in Dallas) with the City Mini Double Stroller, but the manager at Buy Buy Baby laughed and told us they don't carry the BOB doubles because they are too bulky and heavy.5. For my wife, this is truly bulky and heavy and doesn't really fold flat unless you remove the front wheel.  Lugging it into the back of her CR-V, it takes up a lot of space, leaving little room for anything else.  I consider it bulky and heavy and awkward to carry, too.6. At the next outdoor event that was on the grass, we had to pause numerous times since it was too bulky to get through the crowds.  We made the mistake of going over a nature bridge and everyone on the other end had to stop so we could get all the way across (we couldn't turn around because a dozen people were behind us).7. For various outdoor walks and jogging, yes, it really shines, but then little things like the canopy design frustrate you.8. The canopy design (when folded back) grazes the top of our 2.5 year old's head.  I've checked it multiple times and that's simply how it is designed.  Our kids are also smaller than average according to the height chart, so not sure how it doesn't bother average or tall kids.  We have to either use the canopy or keep pushing the excess material off their heads.  The Velcro-pull straps don't really help clear the head-clearance.9. The ""clear-viewing-flap"" doesn't Velcro out of the way as easily on the BOB like it does on the City Mini, which also has 2 different view flaps, whereas the BOB has one.  The City Mini allows for different angles of the canopy so your kid can still see everything, yet still providing the ""clear-viewing-flap"" at the same time.  The BOB canopy design is a bit annoying.10. Furthermore, the canopy design on the BOB doesn't completely block the sun for a sleeping baby, there are large gaps where the quick-fold handles are.  Both of our City Minis properly shield the sun with no poor design-gaps.11. Reclining a sleeping child requires 2 hands on 2 adjustments for just one seat, hopefully synchronized at the same time.  The City Mini is a simply one-handed recline and it will recline the seat evenly.  (The large gap in the top of the seat back will frustrate you when the bright sun shines straight on baby and wakes them up!)12. We spent ~$80 for a Peg Perego BOB car seat adapter and were never happy with how it ""clicked"" or didn't click in place.  It's a poor design and the bulkiness of that darn canopy gets in the way.  Also, it then forces the other second seat (our 2.5 year old's) to have a bar going across that functions as a cup holder/tray.  It's all one piece, so you don't really get a choice if she's picky and wants to hold her stuffed animal; the bar will get in the way.  Also, you can only have 1 car seat adapter on the BOB duallie.I think if I put a hook in the garage so that we never have to take the BOB duallie indoors and won't bump our heads into it, I'll be much happier with it.  If you are a hard-core jogger, you'll probably love it.  If you don't take it to the mall (won't fit in aisles and you'll take up half the elevator) or crowded outdoor events, you will also love it.  If you have an SUV and plenty of room for luggage (and a travel-sized bicycle pump) and the BOB duallie, then you'll like it.If you want a practical double-stroller to take everywhere and also jog with it, then this one isn't ideal for our needs.  We want a double stroller that will do it all, not just hard-core jogging.  The City Mini GT double-stroller is the closest fit we've found.  For our needs, this stroller is 2-stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I7951Y23VMRH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KASV63M#wasThisHelpful","R2I7951Y23VMRH","A22KGO6Q2YWS0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22KGO6Q2YWS0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wonderful design and usage overall, almost 5-stars!Even though we really love this oil diffuser, it is not quite 5-stars:1. We love the fact that it can ""diffuse"" every 10 seconds or continuously2. Diffusing every 10 seconds it seems to last 4-6 hours3. It glows different colors of the rainbow which is pretty cool4. You can use batteries*, plug-in power*, or USB cable from your computer5. I only tried once, but I'm pretty sure it drained the batteries in 2 days.  Since then I used plug-in power by plugging it in with a micro-USB using an old phone charger.  I'm 99.9% confident it would have still worked if I plug it into my laptop's USB cable.6. I deduct the 1-star because of how fast it uses up batteries and I happened to not have any rechargeable batteries to use with it.7. Also, I deduct that star because it doesn't include a power adapter, you have to fishing around for some extra micro-usb phone chargers you might have laying around.8. I do appreciate the fact that any micro-usb adapter or plugged straight into a USB port in a computer would work.9. Lastly, I do wish it had some sort of raised surface or handle to grab to remove the top.  It is smooth plastic.  When the oil/water condensate, it creates this suction and combined with, heh, the oils you are using, makes it difficult to take the top off.  You can turn it upside down, but all of the liquid condensate will leak out, all of this would be fixed if the top were just easier to grab.10.

"4 stars for the clear design, potentially 5-stars with the following changes:1. If this wasn't clear I might give it 4.5 stars.  But the fact that it IS clear means you can see when it gets cloudy inside from condensation/evaporation of the water.  Not visually appealing when that happens; about as visually appealing when that happens to old windows in your house.2. I do wish the soap-caddy part was removable or re-positionable to the front.  I like to keep this flush with the back splash, but the soap-caddy adds too much depth that we have to keep this on the side of the sink.3. Over time you'll get some ""green gunk"" at the tip of the dispenser.  It's somewhat easy to rinse off, but I don't notice this with other hand soap dispensers through out the house - like ever.Overall: I love the idea, my own foaming soap dispenser for use with any of my liquid soap refills so far, without having to buy the disposable foam soap dispensers at the grocery store.

"I feel 3-stars is fair for this product for several reasons:1. If you cook or wash dishes and absolutely never move your feet whatsoever, then it is true that you don't really ""sink to the floor"" using this anti-fatigue mat because the gel? innards, etc are cushiony enough to prevent that from happening.  Unlike memory foam type mats that are super-comfortable at first, eventually you ""sink to the floor"" and are essentially standing on the hard floor.  We actually like our memory foam mats better, because we are still standing in one place, but do move our feet to load the dishwasher or stir a pot, etc. so we always find comfort in the foam mats, too.2. There's some strange and greasy ""film"" on this mat.  I've washed it with soap and water and a couple coatings of Windex.  If you have squeaky clean floors and step on this mat and step back off, your feet will feel slippery and the floor will too.  (Not a spilled-oil slippery, but like a spilled powder type slippery)3. Most standard size sinks and cooktops are about 30"" wide, so this is a good size and the weight is heavy enough it does not slide around.Overall, this isn't our favorite anti-fatigue mat and this strange ""greasy film"" on it that isn't easy to clean off make it a fair 3-stars product.

"First, I am very thankful to the Vine program for providing such a ""cool"" laptop for me to review and I feel bad to only give this an overall score of 3-stars, but that's the fairest thing to do for the Amazon Community.Why 3 stars for an Alienware Laptop?=============================My review is only for the ALW14-5002sLV 14"" laptop.Initial Impressions:---------------------------My first impression upon opening is that it is well packaged with a pretty slick Alienware outer box, a 'certificate of authenticity' as if I was now a part of some elite club, but then I had the strange feeling that it may have been a refurb.  The entire laptop is beautiful and feels like high quality, but when I pulled out the power adapter, it says ""DELL"" and looks similar to some old Dell power-bricks on an old Inspiron laptop I had.  Had someone swapped the power-bricks on me with a cheapie Dell one??A quick Internet search reveals that Dell purchased Alienware some time ago!  Still, looking up the price for this laptop on Amazon and then getting a power brick with ""Dell"" on it felt a little cheap.  How could such a sharp looking and relatively pricey laptop from ""Alienware"" be stuck with a plain Dell power brick?  This is like buying a Lexus and popping the hood to see Toyota on the engine (Yes, Toyota owns Lexus, but doesn't make it right!).  I do wish they would've ""re-branded"" the power brick to say Alienware and look and feel as beautiful as the overall laptop does.Performance:--------------------I then proceeded to download 9 gigs worth of 3DMARK06, Cinebench and PCMARK and spent several hours downloading, installing and running all of the tests.  Unfortunately, it only scored mediocre and well below the ""gaming-laptop"" benchmarks and only slight better than ultrabooks!?  This is a 2.4ghz i7 laptop on Windows 7 64bit.3DMARK06 - first, it states that the ultimate test, Fire Strike is so strenuous even new adapters have issues keeping up.  And true to that, the Alienware ALW14-5002sLV had a pitiful 5-9 FPS.  In other words, unplayable.SkyDiver from 3DMARK06 was reasonable 50-90 FPS and this is where the Alienware still only benchmarked mid-pack, well under ""Gaming Machine"" and just barely above ""Ultrabooks.""CINEBENCH - the Alienware really shined in GPU performance, but still beneath a true Gaming Machine.PCMARK - Mid-pack results, definitely not a stand-out.Usability/Cool Factor:------------------------------Now in terms of usability and cool factor (but not ""coolness"" - more on that later) - an Alienware laptop is awesome.  You can configure 6 different ""lighting zones"" to be a different color LED and then make it fade in/out, glow, and blink.  From the Alienware symbol on the back of the screen to the keyboard, touchpad, power buttons, etc all configurable in different shades of LED colors!Keyboard feel is excellent and the touchpad is responsive and accurate.  Overall the feel is very high quality.  I am currently typing on my Work Laptop - an HP EliteBook 8570w.  Sometimes the cursor floats on my HP because I put too much wrist pressure because the laptop plastic near the touch pad flexes!  Not so on the Alienware - really, high quality, sturdy and very rugged feeling.  No floating cursor experience at all because it seems to be better built.What I don't like about the Alienware 14"" ALW14-5002sLV---------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. For the price as advertised at this writing, it seems pricey compared to the mid-pack/mediocre gaming performance numbers it generated in 3DMARK06, CineBench and PCMARK.  Now if you don't game, you probably wouldn't spend that much on a ""barely better than an ultrabook"" non-touch laptop to begin with.2. Related to the above, you again, wouldn't spend this much on a non-touch laptop that weighed this much!  THIS site's product description says 4lbs which has to be wrong.  My wife's 12"" touch-laptop is rated at 3.3 lbs and this thing feels twice as heavy.  [Just checked twice on the bathroom scale - when holding this laptop without the power brick, I weigh a little over 6lbs more than when not holding it; admittedly not super-scientific, but I'd say a little more than 6lbs is accurate for this laptop.]3. It's cool, but not cool.  As I type this on my HP Work Laptop, I'm using a CoolerMaster laptop cooler pad with fans because of the heat it generates.  I thought I could use the Alienware without a cooler pad because of the design.  It ""seemed"" like the Alienware laptop was thicker on the bottom because it self-elevated the internal components so that resting on your lap, you wouldn't block any fans or vents.  Well, this is partly true, it's a much better design than my HP, but you still need a cooler pad AND I measured 126 degrees Fahrenheit on the exposed cooling fins on the back!  That's pretty hot!  (Yes it was running 3DMARK tests at the time...)4. The darn Dell power-brick has this blue LED that is not adjustable in brightness like the laptop LEDs are.  It is super annoying and lights up an entire darkened room by itself.  The wife won't approve of it.OVERALL===========1. For the bulkiness (~6lbs without power brick), thickness and ""relatively"" small 14"" screen, you get an Alienware laptop regardless because of the gaming use and ease of portability over hunking around desktops to gaming LAN parties.  For the mid-pack gaming performance and price point, I personally wouldn't have purchased this.  (Again, this is a Vine review.)2. For ultimate cool-factor, yes, an Alienware laptop is cool.  And if you don't care for gaming, then you have yourself a pretty cool, sturdy, high-quality and well-built laptop.  But if you don't care for gaming, would you spend this much on an i7 non-touch 14""  laptop, or would you get an equally cool, i5-based touch-tablet/convertible laptop that was paper-thin and weighed a couple pounds?3. Overall, I feel this specific model Alienware ALW14-5002sLV laptop that I received doesn't fit into any specific category very well at its current price point (as of this writing) and doesn't stand out with compelling reasons to buy for gaming or performance or couch-surfing and email.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3415A1MOD7501/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IMUAYT2#wasThisHelpful","R3415A1MOD7501","A22KGO6Q2YWS0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22KGO6Q2YWS0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With 12 nieces and nephews, we've had a lot of time to explore various car seat options.  Unfortunately, some systems like this Orbit require you to invest in the entire ""ecosystem"" to make use of all the convenient functionality.There's no doubting the swivel-base design is unique compared to our ""static"" Peg-Perego and Britax car seats in 2 different cars.  However, THIS car seat does not include the swivel-base and must be purchased separately.This then makes it the priciest convertible car seat we've seen.  First, the regular price is comparable to a Peg-Perego and Britax, but then the swivel-base and other Orbit components really add up!  [Not related to this review, but we decided to not purchase the Orbit system because we didn't like the stroller design and lack of storage underneath]But back to this car seat, it's heavy and doesn't recline.  This was a deal breaker for us because of the type of cars we drive.  The wife's Honda CR-V has reclining rear seats.  My small sedan does not.  Because of the CR-V rear-seat recline, we can make the seat level the way you are supposed to.  We can also ensure the tether can be fastened over the headrest properly and the bulk of the back of the seat is flush with the vehicle's seat back and feels secure when tugged/jostled etc.  In a small 4-door sedan whose rear seats don't recline (I don't know many?), you lack the adjustment to ensure the seat is level because of the lack of recline. Also, this affects fitment of the seatback as it fits to the contour of the vehicle's seatback.Now to be CLEAR - this is being used WITHOUT the swivel seat base because we chose to NOT invest in the full Orbit system.  Perhaps with the swivel seat base, everything is perfect, but I cannot speak to that.But be it known if you are buying this or gifting this, you're faced with limitations in adjustability in recline and fitment, that we do not face with our Peg-Perego Viaggio and G3 and G4 Britax Boulevard Pavilion car seats.Now, if you are lucky to already have or be invested in the full Orbit system, including swivel seat base, then this may be the best back-saving, convenient car seat you'll find.  (As long as you can get the car seat to the Orbit stroller in short distance, else it is heavy on its own!)","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13AHWF6C3W9OP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GHM87GY#wasThisHelpful","R13AHWF6C3W9OP","A22KGO6Q2YWS0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22KGO6Q2YWS0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this case.  I've owned other ""Otterbox"" types and TPU-plastic types that attract lint or are hard to put in your pocket, but this one fits great and has everything I was looking for.I didn't like the ""Otterbox"" types because although they protect well, they are so dang bulky, that it became distracting in daily use.I didn't like some of the glossy TPU-plastic cases because the glossiness actually affects camera pictures!  Others didn't have a raised front surface to protect the glass.THIS one does it all, no lint, not bulky, good fit, no affect on the camera flash, slides into pocket easily, yet easy to grib, raised front camera surface and none of the connectors are blocked.

"[This is verbatim from my WIFE who READ THIS]I would give this book 3 stars.I really like Rachel Gibson in general. The premise is different. An ex-marine, who is in the security business, is asked to go to Miami to track down the sister of a friend’s fiance. He finds her, and circumstances force them to take a road trip to meet her half-sister in Texas.Although it wasn’t love at first sight, they grew to love each other. This is a bit hard to believe in just a few short days, but it’s a romance, so I’ll overlook the improbability of this. I actually really liked the heroine, Stella. She was funny, sometimes vulnerable, and just likable overall. She was an easy character to root for. The hero, Beau, is a fit, hot ex-marine. What’s there not to like about that?Although I liked the book, there just didn’t seem to be any excitement. There wasn’t an uncontrollable passion between Stella and Beau. There wasn’t any laugh out loud humor. I liked the book, but I would consider it just average.Although I am happy to have read it once, it’s not one I would read over and over.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21QSIKTO7FYYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062069144#wasThisHelpful","R21QSIKTO7FYYO","A22KGO6Q2YWS0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22KGO6Q2YWS0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great 4-in-1 tub that we use for a 2 year old and a 6 month old.  We love the versatility as well as all of the extra accessories that come along with it.It is easy to clean and doesn't have as many 'plastic support ridges' underneath the seat that makes cleaning harder and where mildew likes to build-up in the crevices.  With water and separable pieces, the less small crevices the better for easier clean-up.The primary reason we give 4-stars is because we are unsure about the head-resting-pad-area, since it seems to be some foam pad that is glued on.  Easy fix?  No not really, what type of glue is safe?  What type of glue won't ""leech out"" ?  We definitely don't want to glue it back on ourselves.  (It hasn't fallen off, but it doesn't seem completely secure and permanent)  We wish the ""head-resting-pad-area"" were a snap-in type item, etc so it could be removed and cleaned, yet stays in place and NOT glued in place.We love the built-in hook (we use the plastic rings from the baby's play mat to attach it to a towel rack over the tub) - this is great because when the grandparents stay over they don't have some baby tub in the tub-area, it is nicely tucked away and hanging on the towel rack over the back of the tub.Overall, a nice versatile tub that we are happily using for a 2 year old and 6 month old.[Update: 6-18-14 - wanted to add that our 2 year old is a bit smaller than most 2 year olds, in the 10% height/weight range, so if your 1-year old is in the 99 percentile, you may not get the same amount of usage.  At 2.5 years old now, we have moved her out of this tub as we feel she was getting too big for it.  Our now 9-month old still fits this tub fine and will likely fit it for a few more months, so after 1 year it might be time to replace any tub anyways.]","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y26P0FE8MFQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F2MQ0EQ#wasThisHelpful","R1Y26P0FE8MFQ7","A22KGO6Q2YWS0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22KGO6Q2YWS0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is our second swing, the first was a hand-me-down that was well-worn and only had a single-direction swing.  This is a nice 4-star swing because it is easy to adjust the swinging motion from side to side to front/back.Here's what we like about it:========================1. AC Adapter!  Our old swing only ran on batteries that we've replaced a few times already.  THIS swing lets you choose to use AC adapter or batteries.2. Adjustable swing motion - side to side or front/back3. Has your standard nature sounds/melodies common on most swings4. Adjustable swing speed5. Rotating mobile with mirror that can be turned off (our old swing had a non-electric mobile that kinda just stayed there)6. It has the ability to fold!  (our old swing is a behemoth monster that is hard to even switch rooms with without carefully articulating and rotating it through the doorway)Here's what we don't like about it and why we have only given 4 stars:======================================================1. Currently, there's some plastic piece in the motor that rattled when I was assembling this.  I can only presume something already broke and is loose inside the motor housing.  The shipping boxes looked fine.  Swing seems to work fine otherwise.2. It says it has 6 speeds, but really only 4 speeds are usable.  Our baby weighs 15.5lbs now.  If I set the speed to 5, the swing will sometimes hit its own stand!  Yes, the swing will swing too much and hit the support stand.  (I've noticed this will happen if you help start the swing motion, but the manual says not to and we are not 'helping' the swing motion, the device is doing this on its own and may be out of adjustment - see potentially related point #1 above)  No fret though, we just set it to speed 4.3. The melodies/nature sounds stop after ~20 minutes.  This doesn't make any sense if it is on AC power.  I think 30, 45, 60 minutes would be more convenient.4. This isn't quiet, though the rhythmic noise might be a soothing factor by accident.  It has a clicking and low rumble-rubberish-squeaky type noise as it swings.5. If your toddler bumps the swing, it will swing out of whack and continue that way, due to the design.  Our old swing had 2 pivot arms so if bumped, it would always correct itself; this has a single pivoting ball motion that is easy to ""get off track"".Overall, a nice, modern, 4-star swing that has allowed us to cook or eat dinner or get some light household chores done, which is always a nice thing!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RX5DC5VRC3IC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B9ZRYZY#wasThisHelpful","R1RX5DC5VRC3IC","A22KGO6Q2YWS0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22KGO6Q2YWS0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We decided to get this because my wife made the mistake of showing an episode of Bubble Guppies to our little toddler when she was home sick one day.  Ever since then, the toddler wants to see ""Bubba Gies, Bubba Gies"".For our purposes, we think it is great and provides great protection and peace of mind.  Also, the fitment is excellent for our 2013 Kindle Fire HD - never used the older Fire, so have no idea how similar those were.The only reason we give 4 stars is that a perfect 5-star case would have a built-in stand of some sort that was flexible, kid-proof and could be used as needed.  Right now we are just propping this up on small throw pillows on the couch, etc.One observation, that I am not considering in our rating, as I have no proof, is that we have noticed that we have to continually press the Power button to get the Fire to turn on, as if we may have hard reset it or perhaps the case is too tight and instead of Sleep Mode, it is hard-powering-down.  For example, a light press of the power button won't always turn the Fire on.  We have to continually press the Power button in different ways for it to turn on.  (It will still have like 75% battery, so we know that is not the reason)  We didn't observe this until we started using the case and we also have no proof the toddler hasn't thrown this across the room or used it as seat cushion either.  So far the Fire has always (eventually) turned on for us, so not sure if that's related.  We'd love to hear others' experiences in the comments section.  If there's a correlation, then obviously I'll drop some stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHEMH1AMZ4C01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQZRW16#wasThisHelpful","RHEMH1AMZ4C01","A22KGO6Q2YWS0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22KGO6Q2YWS0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Other things in are diaper bag are not affected, so this is a well-designed, tightly-zippered bag.Sometimes we've grabbed this, a couple dental bibs (far cheaper than any made-for-baby changing liners), some diapers and put it on the dry side and go on our quick trip.

"We have the First Years Spinning Drying Rack http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K53UEI (in white, with the older style pegs that do not have a circle at the top of each peg) and a Prince Lionheart Complete Drying Station http://www.amazon.com/Prince-Lionheart-Complete-Drying-Station/dp/B00018XCJC .Here's why I give the Philips Avent Drying Rack 2 stars:Bottle Storage and Surface Area:============================The First Years Spinning Rack holds 16 bottles and is in a more compact, two tier size, with 2 tiers of surface area.  It's really incredible, you can get all of your bottles, nipples, lids, and pump parts - membranes, horns, adapters.  We use Dr. Brown bottles for our colic-y newborn, and those bottles have 6 pieces to separate and wash, so this rack is a blessing.  It's an easy 5 stars.  Also, the drip-tray is separate and can be removed without touching the rack.Prince Lionheart Drying Station holds 8 bottles like the Philips, but it is far more compact and has more nook and crannies and hooks that it holds far more lids and nipples because you can stack sideways.  It's a 4 star and a great efficient design.THIS Philips Avent Drying Rack is 2 stars because it is pretty bulky and only holds 8 bottles and then 8 nipples.  It's surface area is directly below the dripping of the bottles and nipples, which in theory we don't like, even though we just washed them.  The design of the surface area is pretty limited.  Because the surface area is flat (no nooks, crannies, hooks like the Prince Lionheart), you are limited to what you can lay flat...or stack lids, nipples on top of one another, which defeats the purpose of drying them.  Also, the drip-tray is the ""base"" of this rack, which means you have to delicately hold and balance everything while you remove the base tray underneath to clean.  You can't really see if it is dirty due to the design.  The First Years is just a separate tray on the side that is easy to see when it needs cleaning.Overall=================In our particular household, we use the First Years to dry everything and the compact Prince Lionheart for storage of extra bottles and lids which it is excellent for.With the arrival of our second one, we thought we'd try the Philips Avent Drying Rack, but unfortunately it is no comparison to what we have already - it's bulky, holds less, has a non-ideal drip tray situation, and a very small surface area for the miscellaneous pieces.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ8GPSYUTASUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GULB24G#wasThisHelpful","RZ8GPSYUTASUR","A22KGO6Q2YWS0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22KGO6Q2YWS0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this thinking it was something else, when I realize the product description should just state: ""DUAL KITCHEN TIMER"" nothing more!I have a Taylor BBQ timer which has a meat probe as a remote unit.  I've used other BBQ timers that also contain temperature probes as a remote unit.This is quite simply, just a DUAL KITCHEN TIMER and I find the BBQ part a bit misleading.  If perhaps, the unit detached and you could put a remote unit at the BBQ and one inside of the kitchen, then yes, I think that would be a fitting description, but this is far from that.My BBQ grill is outside and I may have stuff in the oven or cooking on the stove.  Sometimes I want to time my steaks exactly to the minute while grilling outside, but if I leave this outside (and with no extra remote unit) it will be hard to hear in the kitchen.Actual usage and setting of timers could be a bit improved and the readability is pretty poor if you don't have this on a magnetic surface (of which my stainless-steel refrigerator and grill are not, HAH!).  Furthermore, the unit won't lay on it's side, which is silly.I almost gave this 2 stars, but as a plain-Jane dual kitchen-only timer with magnetic surfaces, I think 3 stars is fair for that usage.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22UFEO1Z1S33A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CKKB86S#wasThisHelpful","R22UFEO1Z1S33A","A22KGO6Q2YWS0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22KGO6Q2YWS0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While at the Dallas Quilt Show, a sweet lady told me about these pins and said they were the best she'd ever used.  So I looked everywhere for them and was excited to find them on Amazon.  However, upon receiving them and trying them out, I couldn't be more disappointed.

"I bought one of these at the Houston Quilt Festival last fall, for use with my Mid-Arm and liked it so much, checked here for a second to keep with my serger notions.  The instructions are less than intuitive, but this is how I make it work for me.There are two raised dots on opposing sides.  I call the dots North and South.  So, holding it so the dots are North and South, I grab the thread several inches from the end, and place the thread in the groove (don't pull taught, just gently place thread in groove), from East to West.  Then, still holding it so the raised dots are North and South, place the vertical groove gently over the needle and ever so slightly, press into the needle while gliding the needle toward the eye.  A wire will protrode from the tool when it reaches the eye and a loop of thread will form in the back of the needle.  Just pull one side of the loop until the thread is behind the foot.A little practice makes it second nature . . .but calling the dots ""North"" and ""South"" made it much easier to remember how to do it each time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GS2GDMOE3I3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KYVTA2#wasThisHelpful","R2GS2GDMOE3I3J","A1HAMJNZ7R2XVA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAMJNZ7R2XVA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an extremely robust application which will do everything you need it to do.  However, if, like me, you're a Mac user exclusively (I've been a Mac user since 1989), and have had little to no experience on a Windows machine, you'll find the learning curve even more difficult.It runs just fine on my Mac laptop, but the interface is designed like a Windows interface.  The file structure looks like what one would see on Windows and not on a Mac.  (See photo). Clearly, a Windows programmer simply went in and made the necessary changes to run natively on Mac OS.  The application would be much more Mac user friendly if a Mac programmer went in and made the UI appear more Mac looking in appearance.  (Hopefully this will be done in a future upgrade). I'd gladly pay the full price for an upgrade version in the future, provided it's designed more like Mac.So, if you're a relatively new Mac user, or use both operating systems frequently, you can concentrate on learning the application.

"I've been an avid seamstress/quilter since childhood and one thing I've learned over the years, is the importance of pressing.  As a matter of fact, one can easily spend an equal amount of time pressing as sitting at the sewing machine.  Sew a seam, press a seam and when we return to the iron, it's auto-shut off has kicked in and we must wait for it to heat back up, and the cycle repeats for an entire eight hour sewing session, only to be repeated yet again the next day.  And when the household iron burns out after a year of on heat/off cool/on heat/off cool, we complain, write bad reviews, and spend another $150 on yet another, made for house hold use iron.  After going thru this cycle more times than I care to remember, I finally wised up and began researching better solutions.I looked into every iron on the market, from gravity feeds to pressure boilers.  While the gravity fed irons appear to be fairly common in the garment making industry, they're really similar to household irons with large water tanks.  After discovering some of the best tailors use Reliable pressure boilers, I took a closer look at this iron.I read every review I could find on both the i500 and i300 (Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be a single review online yet, of the i400)  Downloaded all three manuals, and researched thoroughly, the irons, their use, etc.  Since this is a new iron, and there aren't reviews, I've tried to include everything I was curious about before making the decision to purchase, and things I discovered after using, so this will be long.Below are the reasons I finally settled on the i400 over the other two models listed above.1.  Tank size - The i400 holds just over 8 cups of water, same as the more expensive i500 model, twice as much as i300.2.  Pressure regulation valve - the ability to control how much, or how little steam is important.  This feature is sorely lacking on the i300.3.  More compact than the i5004.  i300 is rated for use 20 hours or less per week.  My iron is on at least 8 hours per day, 5 days per week.5.  Less expensive than the i500.6.  50 psi just like the i500.  The i300 only has 35 psiI'm extremely pleased with this purchase.  I immediately saw a difference in several quilt blocks I'd already pressed with my household iron and prepared to sew together for a quilt.  I picked one up, and re-pressed using my new i400 and was astonished at the difference!  The seams were flattened completely and the blocks looked so much better.Pros* Dry pressurized steam - typical household irons and gravity feed irons, heat water up to near boiling, which is right around 212F (give or take a degree or two depending on altitude).  However, pressurized boiler irons get much hotter.  The i400's 50 psi means the water is heated to around 282F (as opposed to 259F for the 35psi i300)  So the steam is invisible and dry, until it condenses . . .giving one the ability to use on fabrics that would other wise water stain like silks and satins.* Because the iron just needs heating elements to heat the iron, not create steam, like in a gravity feed or household iron, the i30 iron that comes standard with all three models I've mentioned above, are just under 4lbs.Cons* The manual is truly one of the worst I've ever seen.  Ordinarily, I'd be inclined to deduct a star for that, but I've contacted Reliable's tech support twice and on both occasions, been given all I needed to know plus more . . .and took copious notes. For instance, the ""Safety Cap"" shown in the line drawing in the manual, is also referred to as ""Pressure Cap"" and ""Fill Cap"" in the manual and can be confusing.* It doesn't point this out in the manual, but I was told by Reliable's tech support that I should drain all the water from the unit once a week.* Manual says the unit will take about 10 minutes before it's ready to use . . .but according to my stop watch, it takes nearly 19 minutes.  The unit must bring the water many degrees above boiling temperature, so I plan accordingly.  Once it's on for the day, I leave it on.* Set up  - instructions begin with ""make sure all packaging has been removed"".  A white zip tie was wrapped around the steam hose and a small spring.  It looked like typical packaging material often found on cords, so I snipped it off.  Only to discover, that zip tie holds the hose to the spring that connects to the hose support wand. . .oops, ordered more zip ties from Amazon.* Hot - the steam is hotter than a household iron.  I use a heat protecting glove I found on Amazon, designed to protect a hand when using a flat iron on hair, works like a charm.  I keep it clipped to a rack on my pressing board.* Expensive . . .but I figure, I can cry once when I buy it, or cry every year when I have to throw out yet another $150 iron and buy another.  Less garbage in the landfill and more money for more fabric, LOL.I highly recommend the Reliable C81 vacuum board to be used with this iron.  It pulls the steam through several layers of the garment and out thru the bottom of the board.  The board is heated, to help dry the board.  You can still use a sturdy non-vacuum board with this iron, but you'll want to keep a supply of board covers on hand, if you use a standard board, because they will be wet.  I definitely would not recommend using a particle board or plywood pressing board with any of the pressure irons as the steam has to go somewhere.Over all, I could't be happier with the i400.  I feel as though I've been using a toy iron all these years.  It's truly stepped up my sewing results and is so much faster and better at ironing laundry.  I'll definitely update this review if there's any trouble in the future, but I don't anticipate anything but many years of happy sewing and no more wasting money on household irons every year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R268KVUM1IL6NW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MSJM9XC#wasThisHelpful","R268KVUM1IL6NW","A1HAMJNZ7R2XVA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAMJNZ7R2XVA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought the Gingher Seam Ripper a few years ago, before the replacement blades were available. The handle has a wonderful feel, very ergonomic. However, the blade is awful. The tip is rounded, not pointed, making it difficult to rip seams by catching every third or fourth stitch, as I learned in school 30 years ago, and has served me well thru countless garments and quilts over all these years.I was excited to come across this listing for replacement blades, since it's the blade that causes so many negative reviews on the ripper listing. I was excited when it arrived and the package said ""New and Improved"". Frankly, it's the same exact, round tipped blade that shipped with it originally. I've attached a side by side comparison of a plain, inexpensive seam ripper, next to this thing, which I even hesitate to call ""seam ripper"". If you're a garment sewer and use the standard 2.5 stitch length, and rip seams by holding the two seam allowances apart, you might actually like this, but if you're a quilter, using 2.0 stitch length, standard for quilting, you'll find this seam ripper completely useless.It's not often that I find myself in the position of leaving a negative review, because generally, I know what I'm getting when I place the order. But this time, I threw common sense to the wind and took a chance that Gingher might have wised up, but, just as my daddy used to say, ""this thing is about as useful as mammaries on a boar hog"".","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11RPK0HJVD6EP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00409NCK2#wasThisHelpful","R11RPK0HJVD6EP","A1HAMJNZ7R2XVA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAMJNZ7R2XVA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, the claim in the description that this pan is 2mm thick, is bogus.  It's really only 1.5mm thick.  I made crepes yesterday using both ths pan and my All Clad Copper Core 10"" skillet.  There was no comparison . . .the All Clad pan outperformed the Mauviel crepe pan in every area.  A hot spot near the center caused a problem with sticking and the brass handle got far hotter than my iron handled Mauviel pots.So while this pan will look nice hanging in my kitchen . . .it's definitely not a good pan for cooking crepes, or anything else for that matter.  If I had a do over, I would purchase a second Copper Core skillet instead.So three stars for it's beauty, but minus two stars for being virtually worthless as a pan.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C78ITOTRE09P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002L5FYS#wasThisHelpful","R1C78ITOTRE09P","A1HAMJNZ7R2XVA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAMJNZ7R2XVA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I rarely ever buy a product before checking out the Amazon Reviews first, however, when our older model finally went kaput this morning, I didn't bother, just went shoppng.  So it was with shock, when I turned to Amazon for accessories and discovered the massive number of negative reviews regarding k-cups.In fact, so concerned was I that I wouldn't be able to use my old K-Cups, I called the company and this is what they said:  all K-cups made since January, have the special grey ring that's readable by the 2.0.  Since K-Cups only have a shelf life of eight months, this really shouldn't be a problem for anyone.And can I just say, this machine is SOOOOOO much easier to program than the older model it replaces.  There are only ten coffees available for the carafe to date, however, Keurig promises nearly all flavors will be available by the end of quarter, 2015.So as of now, minus one star for my inability to use my own beans, but overall, am extremely pleased with the new model.

"I've been enjoyably using All Clad pans for over 20 years and they've held up beautifully.  However, it's important to note, All Clad's nonstick pans are limited to approximately three years use before they have to be disposed of and repurchased.  I've switched from the LTD to Copper Core and but still buy the D5 stainless nonstick because it's less expensive and since these are disposable, no reason to spend more than is necessary.All Clad stainless interior will last your lifetime and that of your heirs but anyone expecting the same from nonstick coated interiors is being woefully unrealistic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11219Y7VYNVG0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008QCWHTG#wasThisHelpful","R11219Y7VYNVG0","A1HAMJNZ7R2XVA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAMJNZ7R2XVA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was introduced to this fantastic baking spray at my favorite kitchen store so when I saw it here at a bulk discount, I jumped on it.The spray contains flour and eliminates the need to flour my cake pans.  I have several Nordic Ware cast aluminum bundt and loaf pans which have intricate designs.  A light spray (over the sink, there's overspray) and then add batter and tap lightly on the countertop to get down in all the grooves and crevices and eliminate air bubbles.  After baking, I let cool ten minutes on a rack, then invert pan and the cake/loaf slips right out.Easy to clean, just warm soapy soponge.  It never leaves a sticky residue or build up.

"I've owned several reading glasses in recent years as my once 20/20 vision ages.  I like these reading glasses so much, I've returned to this listing several times to reorder additional pairs so I'm never without.  There are no distortion spots like some reading glasses have . . .so full vision no matter where I'm looking.  I can easily see over them when looking across the room . . .and the clear ones virtually disappear on my face.

"I own several pairs of Ugg boots, these aren't the most comfortable.  The shearling lining is cropped short and left unbrushed, so feels like it's lined with low pile carpet.  The strap across the top that buckles at the ankle, is an uncomfortable ridge that digs into my ankle after several hours of wearing.  Lastly, my heels slip around because the heel isn't as fitted as the toe box.  Wearing thick socks helps the heel fit better, but causes my toes to fit too snugly, so a catch 22.  The length, however, is spot on.  They're cute boots, and the fit isn't bad enough to cause me to return, but they won't be the boots I most often reach for this season.On a good note, they are very warm.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LBT8DD1E7F16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGMDU9U#wasThisHelpful","R1LBT8DD1E7F16","A1HAMJNZ7R2XVA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAMJNZ7R2XVA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They're clear, and sparkle like real diamonds. The gold overlay is flawless, and completes the high quality, expensive look of the set.Since this is a bridal set, it includes both, the engagement and wedding band.

"Holy smoke --- this frying pan is AWESOME! It's large enough to fry up just about anything. Plus, it's ridiculously high quality. The materials are exceptional, and allow for even heat distribution. This is great, because you don't have to worry about burnt edges, and cool centers. The heat is evenly distributed, for consistent cooking across the whole pan.It's also non-stick, and not chemically treated. So, you don't have to worry about chemicals leaching into your food! Clean up is super easy, just DONT put it in the dishwasher! That's a HUGE no no for any non-stick pan, as it ruins the finish, and reduces effectiveness of the non-stick components.

White candles are nice, but the ""flame"" doesn't look authentic. These Kohree flameless votives are the next best thing. The coloring is perfect, and they look beautiful anywhere you use them. I do wish they were wax vs plastic.  However, they still look great, and I've thoroughly enjoyed them. Plus, I like knowing that if my children somehow get to them, they won't get burned!I received a complimentary set of these candles, for testing and review purposes. Personally, i absolutely love them, and highly recommend them. They work well with flameless pillars and tealights, especially if theyre also a cream/ yellow color as well!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MCNJ7SFJAADC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S7IRJ56#wasThisHelpful","R2MCNJ7SFJAADC","AKGYDQWQS66BR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKGYDQWQS66BR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I came across this book on Pinterest and was intrigued.  Well worth the tiny price - it reminded me of a Matrix type read.It is a very short read but the author packed a lot of detail in it and I felt it was well worth the 99 cents to read it.  Even though it was a short read, it was a cool story with plenty of action and a good ending.If you like sci fi, I think you'll like this cool read.

"As a retired teacher, I'm on a budget.  My daughter and granddaughter are also on budgets. Each of us have a different set of circumstances, spending habits and income. Some of our budgets work better than others.With the economy the way it is, the roller coaster ride we have all been on has affected our spending and saving habits.I came across this book and liked it from the first page.  It is easy to follow and can be used no matter what age, income or spending habits. Sometimes looking at finances can be a gut wrenching feeling, especially when you see there is more going out than coming in or as many say, you have more month than you have income. Sometimes your situation changes - the addition of a baby or pet, an illness, a layoff or a promotion and the end of a credit card bill - so now what?  This book walks you through the now what? and also helps you plan in a smart way for a stress free financial future.

"My granddaughter is newly reading chapter books and we spend a lot of time looking for the right reading gradient as well as a story that she finds interesting. When I came across this book I was intrigued as, like most of us, I recalled the classic story of Pinocchio.As a retired teacher, Pinocchio was one of the long time favorites in my classroom library. My granddaughter's interest was piqued enough by the idea of a story about Pinocchio's son that we decided to purchase this book.It is evident that much time and thought was put into the story.

This year, she asked if she could have a book from Kindle and do one less from the book fair.

"As a retired teacher, I remember how much students enjoyed learning about homophones. Homophones are words that may sound alike but have different meanings such as blew and blue.My daughter has instructed ESL - English Second Language - which is another area that many people do not think about when it comes to homophones.  Learning about homophones isn't just for kids, adults learning ESL will benefit from this book also as it is an easy and fun read.It is important, regardless of one's age, to have a good grasp of the English language and not be ""tricked"" by words that sound alike but mean something different.I purchased this book for my grandkids so we could learn about homophones.

"If you are a parent - seriously consider purchasing this book for your child.  As a retired teacher, I strive to encourage children, including my grandchildren, to read.  So many kids are glued to electronic devices that are not developing skills such as reading and problem solving that they will need in life.  The author tapped into the secret of getting kids to beg to read and I am so glad that I came across his books.The saga continues in this book, the people who live in the village are not out of danger yet.  The zombie children progress further into the mission and mystery.

I don't think the full impact of the story or the author's writing ability really registered until awhile after I finished reading.  This is a fairly fast read but it is rich with detail.  The author has his finger on the pulse of relationships.

"I was pleased to find a summary and analysis of Sue Grafton's ""X"". It is currently the number one bestseller in private investigator mysteries.The original book is one of a very large series centering around the main character Kinsey Millhone. The original book is number 24 in the mystery series.  I was debating upon reading this book and another best seller.  I've found the fastest and smartest way to choose between potential reads is to quite simply read the summary and analysis of each book.I am a fan of summary and analysis books as I've found that they increase my comprehension when I read the actual book and they make me aware in advance of things I may have otherwise missed.  Plus, being blunt, they are a fast way to see if you want to invest a lot of reading time in the actual book.This read was more than useful to me.

"The cover of this book caught my attention and while it is marketed as a YA read, adults will enjoy it just as much.  This is book one in a series - it centers around our main character, Lucas. He is your average kid living an average life until......... he finds himself in a totally different world and his task is certainly not an easy to do, quick fix - he is being counted on to save a group of people - no small feat.This is a great read with plenty of action.  As a retired teacher, this is a book I recommend as it brings a story that will interest kids to read - no small feat in this age of technology.

We follow a child through the story as he asks questions about God.Easy to read and perfect for children, this book is a great anytime read for children.The colorful illustrations really complemented the story perfectly and the author crafted a perfect story to read to children who may wonder - where is God?I was highly pleased with the book and I know we will be rereading it more than once.

"I read The Paris Wife, so when a new book came out by Paula McLain, I was interested in it.Circling the Sun is considered historical fiction - and I am a huge history buff.I recently started using summary and analysis books as they help increase my reading speed of the book that they are a summary and analysis of.  I also have found my reading comprehension is considerably better when I utilize a summary and analysis beforehand. Sometimes I go back to the summary and analysis while reading the book. I am a fast reader but sometimes I would find myself going back and re-reading or feeling like I didn't quite understand a section in a book, now I feel my reading is much smoother.The author of this summary and analysis created a great read that was organized and also pointed out things that I know I would have flown right past when reading. I'm looking forward to reading Circling the Sun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1853PBEJQNYR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HEBTEG#wasThisHelpful","R1853PBEJQNYR1","AECSP64LX662Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AECSP64LX662Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a fan of short stories as they are ideal when traveling or waiting at the doctor's office.This set of stories took me on a different path as they are short stories with an Asian theme.  The author writes in a way that gives one plenty of details and  a lot of bang for the buck.  With an imagination that seems boundless, the author transports the reader from situation to situation in each unique story. Each story is rich in vivid characters and written with solid imagination, the author drew me in on the first page.  I won't say I had a favorite story as that would be like saying one of my children is my favorite.These stories will stay with you afterwards.

"The title and cover of this book caught my attention.  The story is a solid read and the attention to detail - even the smallest detail - is what makes this book stand out.I had to laugh more than a few times since, as a retired school teacher, I noticed the author has teenagers pegged exactly in this book. In the beginning when Grace is tugging up her skirt to get to the shortest allowed length - you have no idea how many times I saw that in my classroom over the years - that action alone in the story showed me the great attention to detail.I think it is more important than ever to have books available for our youth to read that are truly interesting.  While I know vampires have been ever so popular with kids - finding a story that focuses on a coming of age story blended really well with a dystopian theme was a delightful find.  While the book is presented as a YA story, I think adults will also enjoy this story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU41BJH7PYU18/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SM4WCVQ#wasThisHelpful","RU41BJH7PYU18","AECSP64LX662Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AECSP64LX662Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the author’s other book, Flight of the Tarantula Hawk, a summer or so ago as the title caught my interest.  I then went backwards to read his first book.  I read this book because now the author himself has caught my attention with his solid writing ability and I wanted to see what Lance was now getting himself into.What I think I liked the best is how much our main character has grown, and I don’t mean age wise, since the first book. In this story, we know Lance will be called in to help on a case but we also find Lance getting himself into quite the predicament along the way.  This adds a good additional layer to the story.There are the necessary details smoothly peppered in throughout this story and the author has a way of showing the reader what is going on behind the scenes many times while setting the stage for events further along in the story.Put this one on your reading list – I think you’ll thank me later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TY3ZJT044763/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VEZXOXU#wasThisHelpful","R1TY3ZJT044763","AECSP64LX662Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AECSP64LX662Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was looking for a book that would be a good read but not too long as I wanted something to read while I was waiting at my doctor's office.  The nurse had to call me twice lol as I was so engrossed that I didn't hear my name called.She and my doctor both wanted to know more about this book.  The author writes really well and draws you into the situations with him. He addresses the subject of voodoo and the cultural part of voodoo also.  The story is about a contractor and his interaction with someone who professed to practice voodoo.I see now that the author has more than one book and I definitely will be following his writing.

"I bought this book for two reasons - the first reason being I have read other books by this author over the years and have seen his investigative nature which I liked.The second reason being that I have heard about bitcoins numerous times from my grandchildren, especially my grandson, and was clueless as to what exactly this bitcoin was and how one used it.So when I saw the author had written an investigative book on bit coins based on his opinion - I felt it was worth reading.While I see a mix of people saying yay to this book and people saying nay, as a retired school teacher, I keep in mind that one is entitled to his or her own opinions. I personally had no opinion before reading this book as I had no information other than hearing the word bitcoin several times recently.  I'm not sure if I am spelling the word bitcoin correctly as Amazon keeps marking it as a misspelled word.Mr. Robinson is slanted towards those not in favor of bit coins.  He walks the reader through his reasoning and I think he provides good documentation for his logic.Maybe some people disagree and maybe some people agree with his findings.  This appears to be a volatile topic with strong feelings by both the yays and the nays.  In my case, it as given me some interesting food for thought and I will certainly be sharing this book with my grandson to find out his opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SCD21XOZR106/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NUIUQ3A#wasThisHelpful","R1SCD21XOZR106","AECSP64LX662Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AECSP64LX662Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book to have on my Kindle for one of my granddaughters.  As a retired teacher, I remember countless times when children would ask me how things were in the ""good ol' days"" before the rush-rush world that we live in now.  When I saw this book, I thought perhaps my granddaughter would like a glimpse of the past too.The author transports the reader back to the late 1950's - before the Internet, before mobile phones - some people were actually glad to even have the luxury of a regular phone, usually with a party line and when life was a bit simpler.  Yet we find that teens still had some of the same problems that they do now - wondering if a boy or girl likes them, trying to fit in and wondering what the future will bring.This is a well written story.  The author takes us back in time to life on a farm in the late 50s but yet we also see some situations when growing up are timeless occurrences be it 1956 or 2015.From a teacher's viewpoint, this would be a great book to have in a classroom library.  From a grandparent's viewpoint, this is a book I feel comfortable sharing with my granddaughter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N2GGWYD3SMWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAPHZO0#wasThisHelpful","R3N2GGWYD3SMWV","AECSP64LX662Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AECSP64LX662Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a retired teacher, I know firsthand that there  are subjects that are often taboo or passed over in a classroom. Children often talk amongst themselves and other children are singled out or avoided. I also have seen firsthand children who have been in the middle of family battles, courtroom matters and incarceration matters.  In the majority of these situations, the child or children is confused, frightened and in many cases will blame him or herself.This is a wonderful book for children who have family members who are incarcerated.I highly recommend this book","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YOBK6Q54LRVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010PCJUJE#wasThisHelpful","R1YOBK6Q54LRVU","AECSP64LX662Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AECSP64LX662Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this book as a surprise for my granddaughter and as a retired teacher I was extremely pleased with the concept.This is a short read, much like a comic book.  It has  illustrations and a puzzle at the end. As a teacher, this book is ideal reading material as it is fun. The short length makes it easy to finish which helps the child who may need a little boost to become interested in reading.  As an extra plus, the puzzle is a clever addition that tests the reader's comprehension.With so many children interested in electronic gadgets, I worry that developing a love of reading may be a fading experience.  Books like this one are perfect for teachers to have in the classroom and for parents/grandparents who want to help their young readers develop a sincere interest in reading.  Very well done with kudos to the authorThe goal is to make the books ""finishable"", giving reluctant readers a positive reading experience and to test comprehension with the puzzle (without the readers knowing they are learning how to become better readers in the process).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C9CFMATFYQQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010C789IK#wasThisHelpful","R1C9CFMATFYQQD","AECSP64LX662Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AECSP64LX662Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a fun adventure--in a place where everyone does magic and some kids' magic comes out ""upside-down""... so there's a ""flare"" who can start fires but then everything freezes, or a flier who can go up but not come back down, and the main character who can transform herself, but instead of a simple animal becomes a combination (like a dragon-kitten when she is aiming for a simple kitten).The book is fun, adventurous, and easy to relate to. My 10-year-old read through it breathlessly then asked me if there was a sequel. It reads as a complete story, but I'll join her in hoping the author turns the book into a series. Content-wise this is good for any age, but especially for kids who may be approaching ages where friendship dynamics become more complex, since it includes a couple of examples of someone's ""friends"" who aren't particularly nice, and the idea that perhaps your real friends are those who treat you well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VG65SF4E3YB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545800455#wasThisHelpful","R3VG65SF4E3YB8","ALUV2YKWZENKK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALUV2YKWZENKK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think this book may be targeted toward a slightly younger crowd than the previous series. I enjoyed the fast pace (and haven't read the previous novels), but for whatever it's worth my 11-year-old (who read and loved the entire first Spirit Animal series) had this to say: ""It goes too quickly. It's like they had too many ideas and not enough space. If they were going to make this many things happen, they should have made the book longer. Four major things happen just in the first 10 pages--that's too many!""Honestly I think a fast pace will appeal to people who may be slower readers, or who may not have expectations set by the first series.

(Amazon currently describes it as ""16.5 x 1.6 x 13.8 inches"" but I just took out a ruler to measure it, and the product I received doesn't match the official numbers.) In the official product image it looks like the edges might be leather, but in person they look feel more like a plastic denim--really not bad, but if you're looking for fancy this isn't it. Most importantly, I'm not convinced this has enough padding for the way I use my laptops. It feels like maybe 2 or 3 mm (at most) embedded in the sides (which do wrap around to the bottom). It's better than nothing, but most of my backpack-style laptop cases (and certainly my suitcase-style laptop cases) have a LOT more. So this is a decent way to carry your laptop from here to there, but it's not something you'd want to travel with or otherwise challenge.Incidentally, the front pocket *does* have enough room for a cord, though it makes the bag bulge out a bit, ruining the nice ""streamlined"" look.

"Wow, it appears that in the years I've been epilating, women's electric razors have finally caught up with men's! This glides smoothly over the skin and even handles knees gracefully (though you do have to give it some extra time and use small circles). Overall it works well (dry or in the shower) charges well, has a nice grip, and comes with a convenient stand for charging. You *do* have to charge before using because the power cord disables the unit (otherwise you could used it plugged in WHILE showering and risk electrocution). Multiple messages on the packaging say you're supposed to replace the blades every 12 months, so that's good to know up front.Note when you're unpacking: there's a lid hidden inside the cardboard packaging where you'll never see it (nothing else is there). You have to break open the box and cut it out or dig for it, but it's useful to have (though it won't be the end of the world if you overlook it either--it's just a clear plastic cap that fits over the blades).Note to manufacturers: does EVERYTHING for women have to be pink? I hate it, my daughter hates it, but we buy it anyway simply because there are no other options. If you could offer something in another color (personally I'd prefer navy or black)... even aqua, surely tons of people would buy it for the color alone. Think Frozen!

"Overall this is a solid game. Everyone takes turns guessing facts about an animal (locale, weight, length/height, and tail length), and then you pull the card out of the holder to see the real facts, and everyone gets points for either guessing correctly, or being ""adjacent"" to the correct answer. It's fairly well made (about as well as most board games) and attractive, and the cards themselves are sort of interesting to look at--they include the picture and name as well as the details you're guessing about--and the replay value is high since there are about 150 cards and you use only 5-15 per game. The instructions are easy to follow and 2-6 people can play. My complaint? Apart from the animal pictures, it's not all that interesting. I wish they had included intriguing or little-known facts about the animals along with all the data. As it is, it's slightly more fun than memorizing multiplication tables, but it *does* have a sense of ""memorizing tables of data"" rather than ""these animals are inherently interesting.""

"I'm surprised these aren't more popular among the multi-tool (MT) aficionados. (yes, there is such an animal) The compound leverage means only half as much gripping force from the hand is needed for an equal amount of gripping force at the pliers head. Put another way, a typical out of shape woman could grip something harder than a typical fit man. A fit man could easily grip something hard enough to bend the fine-tipped pliers head. Be sensible with how much force you apply to that fine tip; remember that you have compound leverage at your disposal.The inclusion of a V-cutter is a great idea. I do with they would make the razor blades inside it replaceable, instead of having to replace the entire V-cutter.Speaking of that, SOG is the only MT manufacturer that makes their tool set interchangeable without voiding the warranty. So if you find you'd rather have a scissors after all, you can just order a set from SOG and swap them out. Or if you break a tool, you can just replace it.I'm not convinced the Phillips will work well for #2 heads. It's too fine and probably not strong enough, with that thin shank. (it's only half as thick as the #1 head) However, if you need it for #1 screws, like are typically found on battery doors for kids' toys, it'll be perfect.The chisel grind they sharpened the main part of the blade with stinks. They should've gone the extra step and given it a double-bevel job, like Gerber does on their combo blades. As mentioned in the previous review, whittling by a right-handed user is not doable. You can fix it by just re-sharpening the plain edged part of the blade with a coarse stone on the side that it's not sharpened with. However, for everything else, the design works fine: opening packaging, cutting rope and boxes, etc.This can be flicked open, balisong-style with one hand, and so it is the only viable alternative to Gerber's slide out head design. The whole level of fit & finish is well above Gerber's, up there with Victorinox.The tools inside the handles clump together when pulling them out. This is a byproduct of having them be interchangeable without little dividing washers falling out all over the place. Just be careful when separating the tool from the sharp blade next to it.These are just my first impressions, compared to other MTs I own by Victorinox, Leatherman, and Gerber. I'll update it later when it gets some mileage on it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E5V2DQKI0ZPO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003SZ4UFU#wasThisHelpful","R3E5V2DQKI0ZPO","A31PDR78F1MNDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31PDR78F1MNDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"+ Blunt nose pliers are rugged and useful. Better than the needlenose pliers on the competition for work in the trades.+ File is great. No diamond coated, ultra-fine side, but coarse and fine is all that is needed, really.+ Wharncliffe blade is great: thick and rugged along most of its spine, but with a sharp tip for precision work.+ One-handed pliers deployment is great. SOG advertises one-handed opening pliers, but they're not, really, compared to this. SOGs need some breaking-in to truly be one-handed, and even  then, one has to separate the handles a bit with the fingertips before it can be butterflied open.+ Locks are great, and double as a comfortable place to put one's thumb when using the internal tools+ Best pliers grip ergonomics in the business. The competition's, that open butterfly style, are not at a comfortable angle to hold while working. They want to slip down in the hand, due to the V-shape. The only exception is Victorinox Spirit series, but that costs triple what this one does, and it's not as heavy-duty.- Tools are hard to pull out with the fingernail notches, at least initially. They probably needed to make them tight, so when they loosen up with wear, they won't fall out too easily- Two knife blades, no scissors or pull cutter. That's dumb. Make the blade a combo one (ground on both sides) and add a pull cutter or scissors where the serrated blade is now.- Finish-wise, it's a little rough around the edges. There's no need for all the sharp edges on the tip of the pliers, for example; they would just eventually cut through the sheath. The handle edges could also have been broken a little better. 5 minutes with a dremel and sanding drum or grinding wheel cleaned them up though.- Can opener on a rugged full-size multi-tool is kind of dumb too, especially when there's no saw. This is not a camper's tool, so skip the can opener and put something useful there instead, like a flat #1 Phillips to go with the 3D #2 Phillips.- Internal tools take a few seconds to get to, so this MT is best paired with a one-handed opening folding knife clipped to the pocket.- Wire cutter is completely useless. It kind of half shears, half cuts, but doesn't work well any ANY kind of wire, solid or stranded. I didn't even try coat hangers or bailing wire, after reading of that causing the carbide cutters to shatter.My advice to Gerber is to fit a combo blade and replace the serrated blade with a scissors. Then, go back to the original design with the wire cutters; just harden them a bit more, or use a super-hard steel, like Leatherman does with their replaceable cutter models.Conclusion: Currently the best multi-tool available for work in the trades.

But Micras and Squirts are not yet offered in bladeless versions.The flat phillips is suitable for #1 screws. You could grind it down and it would work for #2, but if that #2 is tight, you'll bend the tool.

Fishing wires and strings out of small gaps is one application.The file's pretty short; it will take a while to get much done with it, but that's kind of a design limitation.-2 stars for cheap construction, but they get one star back for being the first on the market to address TSA issues in a multi-tool of this size.

"It's such a simple thing, to glue the rubber to a table tennis paddle. But if it's not done right, there will be bubbles, it will come off, etc. This simple kit includes the glue (contact cement type) several foam applicators, (which look like big ear plugs) and a ""chip clip"" to hold onto the applicators and keep the cement off your hands.The way it works is that you apply a squiggly bead of the cement on your clean paddle. Then, smear it all around with the ear plug, which you'll hold sideways with the chip clip. Make a smooth coat. After removing the backing film from your new rubber, apply it the way way there. Wait for both parts to air dry for ~5-7 minutes, until you see it has dried a bit. At this point, when you stick it together, it will be a permanent bond. (or you'll screw it up trying to get it apart) So make sure you align the bottom of the rubber (with the molded printing) with the squared-off part of the handle that's glued on to the paddle. Then apply it, kind of rolling it down. Trim it off with a sharp X-Acto knife from the reverse side, using the paddle itself as a template. Repeat with the other side.Also invest in a rubber cleaning sponge. I use Windex or rubbing alcohol. It cleans the dust and skin oil off of the rubber after every day of play. This will extend the life of the rubber many times. I'm maybe a lower mid-level club player. Good enough to easily beat anyone who hasn't seriously learned some skills. For me, a set of rubber applied this way will last a couple years. For the pros, I think they change every week or so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37M5H56GE6MDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003A2LX9C#wasThisHelpful","R37M5H56GE6MDD","A31PDR78F1MNDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31PDR78F1MNDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of the great 3-layer Swiss Army knives. (SAKs)I've had the Victorinox Super Tinker, Climber, and Hiker before, and this one trumps them all. Why?It has a more durable scissors spring. The lever you see in the pic actuates a backspring for the scissors, instead of having a leaf spring, which will eventually break or get bent out of alignment.It has the self-locking large flat head screwdriver on the end of the bottle opener, carried over from Wenger. When you bear down on a flat head screw, it wedges in place, rather than folding up on you.Instead of a small blade, it has a nail file. The tip of it works in #0 and #1 Phillips screws and also as a light-duty prybar.Now that this is a Victorinox model instead of Wenger, it has the great Victorinox can opener.The Evo scales are quite comfortable in the hand.The corkscrew works great, not just on wine corks, but also for helping to untie knots.The 85mm length is more comfortable in a hip pocket than the 91mm Victorinoxes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9LMGF3HDQLOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNO2HUE#wasThisHelpful","R9LMGF3HDQLOZ","A31PDR78F1MNDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31PDR78F1MNDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Swiss Army knife (SAK) is my favorite, because it represents a great balance for the urban or suburban user.The 2 and 3-layer SAKs are more comfortable in the pocket, but often times, it means being caught without the right tool for the job.The 5+ layer SAKs have additional functionality, at the expense of not really being pocketable. (belt pouch or high tolerance to lots of weight in the pockets)BLADES: I use the small blade for my day-to-day utility tasks, and ""save"" the big blade back for occasional food duty or as a spare.CAN OPENER: Sometimes, I use the can opener for fun. It is surprisingly effective; an order of magnitude better than any other one out there. (except the ones that shamelessly copy this one) The small screwdriver tip sometimes comes in handy. On lesser SAKs, that tip is used for #2 Phillips, but we don't have to resort to such Rube Goldberg tactics here, do we?BOTTLE OPENER: This is the #2 most often used tool. It not only opens bottles, but the tip is useful on everyday flat-head screws and as a light-duty prying tool. The wire-stripping notch is questionable. For it to work well, one has to cut a notch around the wire's insulation with a knife blade first.SCISSORS: Probably the most often used tool on most SAKs, and it's no exception here. Don't abuse them by cutting wire or something, and they'll treat you well for years and years, on everything from thread to coupon-clipping to de-tagging that new shirt.INLINE PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER: This is one of the defining tools of the mighty Explorer. So often, a screw is recessed in a housing or right next to something else, and a Phillips as a back tool or the small tip of the can opener just won't get the job done. This one is wonderful. Maybe tied for #2 most-used tool, with the flat screwdriver/bottle opener. It has a stop half-way out too, to help break those stubborn screws loose. Don't let it slip though, and strip the driver tip!MAGNIFIER: Another defining Explorer feature. It is very strong, but doesn't have a big field of view. Note that the newer ones are molded from one piece of plastic, not gray with a separate lens, as is shown here.KEYRING: Not really a keyring, but a lanyard ring. I use it to hang the Explorer from my belt vertically in my hip pocket, which is a more comfortable way to carry it. Others like to tie fancy lanyards to dress it up, and still others carry the Explorer around their neck by this! Put a small lanyard on it, and it is great to pull the Explorer out of a belt pouch/sheath.HOOK: Keep your mind open, and you'll find a ton of uses for this.CORKSCREW: Works a treat on wine corks, but even if you're not a wine drinker, you can use it to help untie knots. Of course it is also the home for the mini screwdriver, which works great on watches and eyeglasses.PIN: Works in perfect harmony with the tweezers and magnifier to remove slivers of wood or metal from your clumsy hand.PEN: Great little pen. Pressurized and writes easily and smoothly.TOOTHPICK: Works great for its intended purpose. If you're wary of using it for your teeth, then use it to pick pocket lint from out of the knife's nooks and crannies.TWEEZERS: Surprisingly effective, but not strong enough to tweeze your monobrow.REAMER: A great multi-purpose tool. I use it to drill extra holes in my belt, so I can always have that perfect fit. (tighter AND looser, you in the back!) It is also a good general-purpose pointy thing. Use it when you need an extra light duty, but precision prying tool, and don't want to ruin your knife blade.********My previous favorite model was the Super Tinker, which is a little nicer for pocket carry. But the T-Phillips just doesn't cut muster sometimes. It's also not offered in a Plus version at this time, so you lose the pin, pin, and mini screwdriver. Oh, there's no corkscrew, due to the often-useless T-Phillips, so no home for the mini screwdriver anyway.Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm a collector of SAKs and multi-tools. I have probably 100 of them. But if I could only pick one, it would be this one.if I could pick two, it would be this and the Rambler.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BYRFMYTMIOXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007QCOYM#wasThisHelpful","R1BYRFMYTMIOXI","A31PDR78F1MNDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31PDR78F1MNDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This model is a little thinner than the Swisschamp, but I would argue it has a more useful tool set for the typical urban/suburban person. The Swisschamp is the one to take camping and fishing, but this is the one you'll use every day.The thing that sets this apart from SAKs that aren't in the Cybertool line-up is the Cybertool driver. It is long and thin enough to get to recess screws, which most Swiss army knife drivers aren't. That is a thick layer to add to one's Swiss army knife (SAK) but it packs 10 drivers! Medium flat head (small and large are on the can and bottle openers), 3 sizes of Torx, 2 metric nut driver sizes, one metric hex (allen) driver, and 3 sizes of Phillips. (#s 0, 1, and 2)As always Victorinox's scissors are great. Sharp and maybe the most often-used tool on any SAK.The pliers are another thick layer, but are perfect for when you need more than a tweezers, but you don't so much power you need to go get full size pliers of some type. The crimper and wire cutter are of questionable use; they would have to be very small crimp-on terminals and wires.The Cybertool models also have the Plus scales, which contain a pin and ballpoint pen, which are both very handy. The pin, combined with the tweezers is a perfect combo for removing slivers from one's hands.It's a bit too thick and heavy to pocket carry on a regular basis, but is great in a belt pouch, and as a bonus, it doesn't get full of pocket lint that way; the tools retain their snap for much longer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R290T79EYT8PXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001P14Y0#wasThisHelpful","R290T79EYT8PXA","A31PDR78F1MNDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31PDR78F1MNDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I would prefer to have an Apple iPad, as we have a Macbook Pro and two iPhones in the family already. I bought this because it seemed to be spec'd quite well for the price. The display is wonderful. The interface is OK, but not quite Apple-caliber. It locks up and crashes much more than an Apple though. Not enough that I want to give up on it, just don't buy this thinking it is going to do everything fluidly. For example, I tried to go to YouTube on the built-in web browser, and that was a flippin' disaster. It either crashed or locked up 100% of the time. I looked and saw they have a YouTube app; so I installed that, and it works great. Would I buy it again? I think so. Samsung and Apple devices are much higher in price, so high that I couldn't justify buying one and letting kids use it. Probably not myself either, as a laptop is still loads more capable and an iPhone is still loads more portable. But this is 1/3 the price of an equivalent iPad, which even though it is not as GOOD as an iPad, it is still a good buy. It is like comparing a well-equipped Camry Hybrid at $35k (iPad) to an entry level Kia Rios at $12k. They both get the job done, and the Camry (iPad) is certainly nicer, but nice enough that it is worth triple the price? I guess that depends on your budget. For me? This will do nicely.In addition to my 2 year old daughter playing Starfall, my 11 year old son plays Minecraft on it. This constitutes about 95% of the use it gets. It is great for reading in bed. No lights to keep on that will disturb my wife's sleep. I choose the white text on black background, as this draws the least power and also bombards the eyes with the least light. It was almost as pleasant as reading an e-ink Kindle in daylight.This device is also great for checking email.The most limiting factor at this time is the amount of apps available to its Kindle-proprietary operating system. For example, I would have loved to install WeChat and QQ Chat for my wife to chat with her Chinese friends. Those apps are easily available on Droid or iOS. I like the TapaTalk app for browsing internet fora, but it isn't yet available here. I'm sure Amazon will get them eventually. I think the result will be that it is not quite as ""open source"" as Droid, so it'll have fewer virus and malware issues, but also not iOS, so they can keep the price down.The colored plastic case provides a little bit of scratch and impact protection, and is more easy to hold than Apple's smooth and rounded aluminum.

"This is simply the best sounding speaker in this size and price class.The highs are crystal clear. Mids are good. Bass is great. I listen to a huge range of music, and every genre sounds great. Aqua's 'Barbie Girl' and Ace of Base's 'The Sign' are good representatives for how it handles deep, thumping bass. Consider that representative of hip-hop.The majority of my listening is 60s-70s folk and classical. Simon & Garfunkel, Neil Diamond, Jim Croce, etc for the 60s-70s. Bach, from pipe organ to orchestral suites, sounds awesome. Mozart operas too. When I auditioned this in Target with my own music, it was love at first hearing. It is often repeated in speaker reviews here that ""it would be fine for classical, but not for [some modern genre with thumping bass]. Nothing could be further from the truth. If you've ever heard a pipe organ in a 600 year old cathedral, you know what I'm talking about. When the low notes are keyed, one can feel it in the chest. When at a classical symphony, one can likewise feel the bass section in the chest, as well as really hear the lows. It's just that we get used to not hearing them, because of either inferior recordings or poor frequency response. (the older crowd who tend to listen to this music don't tend toward bassy sound systems, right?)Once in a while, I listen to the 80s and 90s Metallica and Ozzy Osbourne of my youth. That kind of music is not too demanding of a speaker, compared to classical; it has a much narrower frequency range. That just requires no distortion and ability to play loud. This speaker is not going to make your ears ring with hard rock and metal music like a bigger system will, but it will sound really good within its range, which is plenty loud enough to upset others in the same house.This SRS-X5 handles at all with grace.I bought this for portable use around my 850 sq. ft. apartment, mostly in the kitchen and bedroom. It is shallow enough to just sit on the windowsill, not taking up any counter space while I cook. The dual bass radiators in the back use the window as a reflector, and make the bass sound about 50% deeper than it does when sitting out in the open. I start up the tunes from my iPhone, then either put it back in my pocket or go back to the recipe I'm making on allrecipes dot com. Do you notice that cooking with music is much less like work, and much more like singing while doing some light work?Pressing the SOUND button engages a DSP circuit which simulates much better stereo separation than would seem possible, considering the full-range drivers are only a few inches apart. It really works; it makes the speakers sound about 2-3X as far apart as they really are.The speakerphone works great. MUCH better than using the speakerphone built into the iPhone. The USB charging works great too.COMPARED TO:Bose Soundlink Mini, same price, at the time of this writing. After comparing this to the Bose Soundlink Mini, there is no comparison. The Soundlink Mini has ""The Bose Lows"", which sound pretty muddy compared to those of this Sony. The lows also don't sound as deep. The highs are not as crisp or clear as this Sony. It DOES sound huge for its size, but it doesn't sound as good as the Sony, and it is deeper too, so not quite as good on a narrow surface like the aforementioned windowsill.Bose Soundlink III: ($100 more) - The SRS-X5 and Soundlink III are about the same size. The Bose is a smidge bigger in every dimension, as it has a larger battery pack. The finish treatment is a bit more interesting on the Bose; nicer to look at than the plain, minimalist Sony. The lows on the Soundlink III are equal to those of the -X5, but the highs on the Sony are much better, and with the SOUND mode, stereo separation is better on the Sony too. The Bose has better battery life and regular buttons, instead of the capacitively coupled ones on the Sony. Seems like it plays just a bit louder, esp. on battery power. But... it is 50% more money, so not even really in the same class.Jawbone Big Jambox: ($50 more) is not in the same class. It has the metal speaker grille which surrounds the unit, which will be prone to pick up dents on the corners. The bass is not as deep and the highs are not as clear either. The Big Jambox may be the original, but The Sony SRS-X5 easily trounces it.JBL Pulse: ($10 less) Not in the same league as the Sony, nor even the Big Jambox. Lows are totally absent, in comparison. All it really has going for it is the light show.JBL Charge: ($70 less) Not in the same league as the Sony. Sounds about like the Pulse, but without the fancy lighting. To be fair, this is in a lower class, and is priced commensurate to its class. A good value, but in this price range, the Sony SRS-X3 sounds better; same highs and a bit more bass.Sony SRS-X3: ($50 less) Sounds awesome for its size, on par with the Bose Soundlink Mini, at half the price. (though it doesn't have the cool extruded aluminum case as the Bose) It's kind of like the -X5, but without the subwoofer.TDK A34: ($50 less) Couldn't compare the sound, as I didn't audition it in person, but it is splash-proof and has replaceable batteries. About the same specs as the Sony, except that reviewers say the highs can be a bit lacking at times.Klipsch KMC 3: ($150) more. By all accounts, this one has outstanding sound, both highs and lows. It has triple the RMS power though, and is much bigger and 75% more expensive, so not really in this class. I was going to stretch to get this, but decided that if I can't put it on my windowsill easily, I may as well just use my old Sony boombox w/subwoofer and a cord. This has the advantage of using D batteries too. High-capacity rechargeable ones are available from Tenergy, though they are pretty dear. If you only will use it on battery power occasionally, just get alkalines and don't look back.I wish I could have auditioned the TDK A34 in person, as it has a great price, ($50 less than the -X5) and a bit more rugged construction. Replaceable, rechargeable NiMH battery pack is a nice feature, as the Sony's Li-Ion pack doesn't seem to be replaceable, but after reading several reviews that said the highs are lacking, I decided to give up some of the future-proofness of replaceable batteries for better sound. Maybe I will regret it several years from now when my -X5's internal battery dies, but for now, I'm super happy.That brings me to the last point: I deducted one full star for the non-replaceable battery issue. Maybe it was part of their design spec, (less things to rattle loose, without a battery door or screws) or maybe it is planned obsolescence, but either way, I don't like it. When I spend this much money on a quality product like this, I want to be able to use it for 20 years. I finally decided that by the time the battery on this dies, there will be completely different products available, and that $150 extra that I would have spent on the Klipsch KMC 3 can buy something new in the same class as this Sony.I'll post updates to this from time to time, so click that checkbox to be notified if you want to read them.***Update: Oct. 18, 2014****I just got back from my birthday part at my mom's house. I brought this little gem with me to show it off to the family, as this is what I'd bought with my gift card from Mom and my sister. Everyone was impressed with the sound. My brother, who listens to classic rock almost exclusively and who is also a guitarist in a garage band. My mom, who has a bachelor's degree in music, and who played flute and piano in weddings, privately taught flute and piano professionally, etc. She always complained that the bass in classical music is lacking, unless the sound system REALLY has good bass. She was impressed too. We listened to everything from AC/DC to Scott Joplin to Mozart. My bro even tried it out with a live Cream recording and Ozzy's 'Diary of a Madman.'Compared to my mom's sound system, which consist of a pair of Bose 301 speakers and a nice older Sony Receiver with Dynamic Bass Feedback (DBFB) and a single tray Yamaha CD player, it is not quite as room-filling or bassy. But it sounds as good or better than a 10 year old Sony boombox with powered subwoofer that is at least 5X as big.This is a thing I like about Sony: they make so many things so well. They're not always top of the class, but they usually make something that is NEAR the top. This X5 is one such device. The Sony X9 looks and reads really great, but I doubt it competes with the Klipsch KMC 3, which costs half as much. (350 vs 700) Their TVs are great, their phones are great, their boomboxes are great, their clock radios are great, their shortwave radios are/were great, their digital photo frames are great, etc.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R60J52F517OVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ICFZ6JU#wasThisHelpful","R60J52F517OVC","A31PDR78F1MNDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31PDR78F1MNDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First Impression and Suburban Range CheckGot the radios yesterday night.The face plates snap in; they're not held in with the small Torx screws. (this is a good thing, as not many of us will have tiny Torx screwdrivers at home) With a little prying and patience, they came right off. I quite like this. Now, the boy has the yellow one, wife has the orange one, and I've got the green one. If one of them gets busted up, we'll know who the guilty party is. (most likely the 10 year old boy!)The instruction sheet is well-done. I think it was originally written by a native English speaker, which is nice, for a change in the radio world!The menu layout is great; pretty intuitive for anyone even a little bit technical. It's going to take me a while to remember that iVOX is for use without the external mic headset and VOX is with the headset. They could have come up with a better convention to help differentiate between those two. Maybe they just wanted to get ""iVOX"" patented before Apple does...One feature that sold me on these instead of the Midlands is the battery options. The Midlands use AAAs and the Motorolas use AAs. AAs have triple the capacity of AAAs, for one thing. For another, we can either use a pack of series-connected, shrink-wrapped NiMH AAs that Motorola provides, our own AAs (I like Sanyo Eneloop), or Alkaline AAs. Lithium AAs could probably be used, and would be the idea choice for back-up radio use, as they have a 12 year shelf life, higher energy density, lighter weight, and better voltage stability under cold weather conditions. (compared to alkaline and NiMH)The physical construction is solid: Motorola always uses durable, thick plastics for their housings. These don't feel *quite* as solid as their $200 commercial talkies, but a notch above what one would expect in this price class.The power/volume knob has that nice well-damped feel to it, although I would like it to have more traction. It has just a few little rounded bumps for knurling; they could have done better here, I think.Another part of the design that should probably be reworked is that the PTT buttons should either have equal priority or the low power one should be the prominent one. As is, it is recessed under the high power one. The radio is programmed such that even of one presses the high power PTT button when on an FRS-only channel, it will STILL only transmit at 1/2 W.The flashlight is a brilliant addition. There's a smallish constant contact button on the right side of the radio for the flashlight, which is on the bottom of the radio. That light is bright enough to find your way outside at night, and maybe even OVERLY bright to use indoors at night. (it will hurt the night vision)Range check: In our suburban neighborhood, near to Chicago, there are lots of old trees and buildings. Under these conditions, on a clear night, we got 0.6 miles. The audio was fully intelligible, but ""snowy."" There were buildings between us. To get more range, I could change positions slightly (a small change in position can make a huge improvement, with a walkie-talkie) or try to get in more direct line of sight.Soon, I'll try VOX, iVOX, the headset and the belt clip and update this review.Can't wait to try it out in our Gurnee Mills mall here, which is laid out all on one floor, and shaped like a big 'Z.' I expect it'll work down one row, but once around the corner of the 'Z,' it'll drop out quickly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P6D8TDD5GKKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090UMDD8#wasThisHelpful","R3P6D8TDD5GKKR","A31PDR78F1MNDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31PDR78F1MNDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I quite like the watch.+ Light weight, like a plastic Casio, but doesn't stick to the wrist like one.+ Feels warmer on the wrist than steel+ At 39mm, it is considered ""midsize"" by today's standards. Great for guys with smaller wrists or ladies who prefer a bigger watch+ Bezel action is good, 60-click.+ Movement is silent. Some cheaper Seikos these days tick quite loudly.+ Lume is good. Not as good as what is used on the Swiss watches, but still visible in pitch darkness after the night+ Hands are long enough for the dial+ Bracelet links are solid Ti+ Bezel sits about 1mm proud of the crystal, which will protect it from some glancing blows that would tend to scratch the mineral crystal.- Not that well-spec'd for the price. For example, it should have a sapphire glass crystal at this price point, and solid end links for the bracelet- Bracelet pins back out a bit with wear. Not enough that it will fall apart, but enough that the wearer will notice- Diver's extension is near impossible to get loose. A tool is needed, and that will certainly scratch the braceletWould I buy it again? I guess that depends on how long the rechargeable battery lasts. If it lasts at least 10 years before needing replacement, I count it as a good deal. If not, I'd have to recommend looking at a non-rechargeable battery quartz watch with a scratch-proof sapphire glass crystal in the two hundred dollar range instead.The timing bezel is a very useful; kind of a low-tech, low resolution stopwatch.

"I live in an apartment where gas is included in the rent, but electric isn't. I have a gas stove, so when it was time to bring my electric kettle to work, I replaced it with an old-fashioned kettle.As another reviewer said, use it on the small diameter burner on your stove for best results, and maybe don't even turn it up all the way. If you do, the heat from the flames will whip around the side and super-heat the handle, making it so that you need a hot pad to grab it. Also, make sure it is centered on the burner, or even offset a little so that the handle is away from the heat.Lastly, I fill it only within 2"" of the top, so it doesn't boil over or sputter boiling water through the whistle hole.The whistling action is audible, but only from the next room; not from across the house.It takes about 20 minutes to boil a kettle of water; much slower than electric, but if you're having tea at home, what's the rush? It's kind of nice not having another electric appliance around. Electric appliances work so well, but we've already got an energy source in the form of natural gas; may as well use it sometimes, and cut down on the clutter.As I type this, I'm boiling a pot of water to make some organic tea from Amazon on this Saturday morning.

"The case is chrome-finished plastic. The bracelet is Casio's typical hair-puller that is found on their inexpensive watches. Wear it just a bit snug, and it's fine though. It's very easy to size; all you need is a small screwdriver.to me, it has the elegance of a simple analog dress watch AND the basic digital functionality I've started to take for granted from Casio. It looks sharp enough to wear to the office, is lightweight and not too big for small men's wrists. The stopwatch hasn't got split time or multiple finishes; just start, stop, and reset. The alarm is a simple daily one. The movement is quiet too! If one listens closely, one can hear the minutes hand tick to the next position every 20-30 seconds. It also has dual time, so that if one is traveling, one can read home time on the analog hands, and dual time on the main hands. If you wanted to track three time zones, one could even program the main digital clock for another time zone than the main analog, then the DT clock for another one altogether.The reviewer who said it takes a while to set the analog time is right. But I think Casio made the right call to make this a button instead of a crown with mechanics, ala AMW320. Having time-setting mechanics and a crown would make the watch bigger than it is.I'm really happy that Casio can still make a watch like this and offer it for such a fair price. It seems like the price has gone DOWN since the 80s, rather than up, even before accouning for 25 years' worth of inflation. Add to that the fact that they make them in black and white dials, with plain markers or arabic numerals. Wow.In short, it's a great value for a dress watch or even an all-around watch.

"RTFM = Read the flippin' manualThere are an inordinate amount of review by people who have the wrong expectations of this watch because they are too stupid to read the manual. They pull it out of the box, charge it for not enough time, in not enough light, then, when it dies on them, they get all indignant, write a bad review that ""it won't hold a charge"", return it, and write a slanderous review.Here's the deal, if you're going to charge it in indoor lighting, it takes dozens and dozens of hours to give it a full charge. Solar power from a small panel is simply not that fast. Put it on a windowsill and leave it in full sunlight for a couple of days, THEN buckle it on, and it'll be fine. Do you see the little sun icon on the display in the promotional photo? That means the watch is hungry. 'means the watch may die at any moment. Go ahead and feed it when it gets down to that point.Why? ^ Because this watch is truly batteryless. All other solar watches use a rechargeable battery that will eventually die. They can only handle so many charge cycles, that's just the nature of the beast. This watch uses a capacitor instead, which is made to charge and discharge hundreds of times. Motors use capacitors that are charged and discharged 60 times per SECOND, for example. The drawback on a low voltage DC design is that the capacity is lower due to space constraints, and therefore it needs recharging more often. But it may also last a lot longer; maybe 30+ years before that capacitor goes belly-up.If you're thinking of buying this watch and you want to be happy with it, here is the expectations you should have:a) Plan to leave it on a window sill in full sunlight for a couple days to get a full chargeb) Set the watch and wear itc) If you ever see that little sun icon, it means it's not getting enough charge in its everyday life to be maintained. This may happen, for example in wintertime in cold climates if you wear long sleeves and it is covered up most of the day. If you just make sure it gets light each day, it'll be fine. Roll up the sleeve a bit or just have a back-up watch, so you can leave this one at home on the window sill to recharged) The bracelet is inexpensive. It's made from folded steel links. If you're the kind of person who wears it a bit snug, so it doesn't slide back and forth on the wrist, or you've got a hairless wrist, it'll be fine. But if you wear it loose, plan to replace that bracelet right away with a quality leather or nylon strap. Or just buy the black plastic version of this watch, which comes on a comfortable resin band. At this price point, Casio can't afford to outfit it with a solid link bracelet.e) Button presses don't result in beeps, except when needed, for example when starting or stopping the stopwatch, when the alarms go off, etc. They don't beep when going mode to mode. (energy-saving measure)f ) It hasn't got a light of any kind; that is a huge power drain. If you often need to read the time from your watch in the dark, this could be an issue.The previous version of this watch, the A180, didn't have a countdown timer, nor multiple alarms. This one does. The timer is an ever-useful feature.The digits for the display are nice and dark; easy to read against the light gray background of the LCD. (liquid crystal display)There's no Adjust button, as I'd become used to from owning Casios for 30 years. The upper-left button is Select. Once I got used to it, it was fine, and I like how it is not recessed. Folks with really short fingernails never did like the recessed Adjust button, especially when it was required for everyday operations like resetting the stopwatch or timer.I consider this watch to be one for connoisseurs and collectors. Or people who wear short sleeves almost all the time and either have a hairless wrists or don't mind wearing it a big snug. For what it's worth, this watch would look smashing on a glossy, black lizard skin strap.Update, Nov. 26, 2014:After wearing this maybe a few weeks' worth of days, my skin has broken all the sharp edges on the bracelet, and now it rarely pulls an arm hair.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12LSTKYFB35I5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JVP2T4#wasThisHelpful","R12LSTKYFB35I5","A31PDR78F1MNDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31PDR78F1MNDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You may not be aware, but there are different options for manufacturers, when it comes to 3rd party safety certification of their products required. In the US, the big players are UL, (Underwriters Laboratories) ETL, (Edison Testing Laboratories) and CSA.

However, this makes them more expensive, and so as a way to cut costs, manufacturers more and more frequently choose ETL or CSA.

They have slightly better forward traction than the stock Talons, and better turning traction, despite being narrower and easier to steer.

"This is a dive watch. The dial color is a beautiful cobalt blue. The hands are the right length. The red-tipped seconds hand adds some interest to the dial without making it too gaudy. It is 40mm in diameter, so not too big for those of us with smaller wrists, but not tiny for the fatter guys either.Day/date is handy, as always.Bracelet is solid stainless steel, 22mm, non-tapered. Quite heavy, and balances the watch head nicely on the wrist. The end links, where the bracelet meets up with the watch head is folded steel, but it doesn't seem to pull hairs, in this case.The one big disppointment with this watch is that the serrations on the timing bezel are overly polished, which makes it QUITE hard to turn. If you're not going to use the timing bezel, it's no big deal. But I use mine all the time, so it is a big disappointment to me.Compared to something like a Seiko SKX007, this watch has a nicer profile for everyday wear. It slips under the sleeve cuffs much more easily, due to its lower profile timing bezel. But that same thing can also be a weakness as shown here. They either need to make the bezel serrations sharper, or loosen up the tension on the bezel. As-is, one has to grab it tightly with the side of the finger and a big section of thumb to turn it, and even then, one's grip slips on it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23RT8WYELXTCR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EWEQ3K#wasThisHelpful","R23RT8WYELXTCR","A31PDR78F1MNDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31PDR78F1MNDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is one of the few models to have a #1 Phillips, though it should be noted that its home is beneath the scissors, so it takes a few seconds to deploy. Both the #1 and #2 Phillips' are in-line too, (rather than T-handle on the back) so they can get into recesses most times.The file is quite sharp, as is the saw. In everyday suburban life, the file is more useful than the saw, but I have used the saw a few times to cut some plastic part down to size. It is thick and too heavy for pants pocket carry, so DO plan to buy a belt pouch along with the knife.It would be nice if Victorinox would give this model the heavy-duty locking flat screwdriver from the military models, instead of the medium duty one supplied on this and the rest of their line.The pliers should be thought of more as a heavy-duty tweezers; they can never be used for loosening a nut or something, but they're quite a lot stronger than the tweezers.The can opener works fine, as always with Victorinox, but I find myself using this implement more for the small screwdriver tip it has. I wish they'd just drop the can opener pretensions and give us a better mini-screwdriver. :)Can you see the little gray micro screwdriver next to the corkscrew in the picture? This is just the right size for eyeglasses and some screw bars on higher-end watch bracelets.In short, this is a good alternative to a Leatherman plier-based multi-tool for those who value easy access to a big tool set instead of a heavy-duty needlenose pliers. I use screwdrivers more than pliers these days, so I usually go with a Swiss army knife instead of a plier-based multi-tool.Last but not least, Victorinox quality is hard to beat. One side effect of that is that everything is really polished well, and on the screwdriver tips, this is not A Good Thing. They slip out of slots a bit easier than the ground Leatherman ones.None of those little nitpicks are enough for me to deduct a start from this fine multi-tool.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BWZ8JPWMM5NU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007QCP4G#wasThisHelpful","R2BWZ8JPWMM5NU","A31PDR78F1MNDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31PDR78F1MNDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This watch has been made for at least 30 years now. I went for the chrome A158W, instead of the plastic F91W, which is the same watch, internally.I suspected the bracelet would be a hair-puller, and I was right. As a watch collector, I expected that, and I put a Swiss Army strap on it; much better. I really wanted the dressy chrome look on the watch head, and I figured I could dress it back up again in the future with a glossy lizard strap.The feature set, you can read about on Casio-USA's website, so I won't go into that much.The key things to note from ownership and use are as follows:+ Simple. Everything's easy to use and set if you take 2 minutes with the manual. If you're familiar with Casios, you won't even need the manual.+ Very light and thin. There's no other watch that packs this level of features and legibility into such a light package. When I'm wearing this watch, I forget that it's on, sometimes.- Hair-puller bracelet. OK for Asians, not so good for the rest of us.- No countdown timer. I miss this useful feature, but in many cases, the alarm can be used instead.+ Loud beeper. It is not sealed up so tight for waterproofness (this one's only rated as splashproof) that it makes the alarm notably quieter.- LED sidelight is barely adequate. There's a similar model with ""Electro-Luminescence"" that is no-doubt better in this regard. I knew that going in, but I felt the big blue ""ELECTRO-LUMINESCENCE"" banner on the watch face kind of ruined the 80s look of it. (yeah, I'm an nerd)In the long run, I use this as my back-up watch. I leave it in my desk drawer at work for those days when I forget to wear a watch leaving the house in the morning. This is the perfect watch for that duty, as it will run at least 7 years on a battery, if the alarm and light aren't used much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JV6WT90ZBQY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GAYQJ0#wasThisHelpful","R3JV6WT90ZBQY4","A31PDR78F1MNDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31PDR78F1MNDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I married a Chinese woman and brought her over to the US. One thing missing from the kitchen for her was a rice cooker. I had an older Black & Decker steamer that cooks rice, but it takes 45 minutes to do so.This one does it in half the time, and also holds it warm when done. The included rice spoon is good, as is the manual. It can also be used for steaming things in the included basket, though we haven't tried that yet.It is true that the rice on the bottom ends up being just a bit more stuck-together than the rest of it, but many people, including Chinese, actually PREFER that rice from the bottom. I'm one of those people. If you DON'T like this, then you may want to consider the spendy Panasonic cooker with ""fuzzy logic"". This is just a fancy way of saying thermostat-controlled, as opposed to weight controlled like this one.One last thing is that this cooker is UL Listed. Most of the lower priced cookers are ETL. UL Listing is becoming increasingly harder to find, as UL Listing is the premium 3rd party safety certification; it is one area that some manufacturers decide to cut costs to bring down the overall price of the product. I don't know about you, but I don't want cost-cutting in electrical and fire safety in my home appliances.

"Posting now on this as a past purchase. I thought I would ""upgrade"" to a Pathfinder or Pro-Trek triple sensor model. Unfortunately, I found the barometer not to be useful for predicting weather, and I live in an area with very little elevation change.This watch skips the barometer/altimeter sensor, but retains the more useful compass and temperature sensor.Even if you don't use these two features at all, the watch is still a great value. The main display is very large and legible, and the sub-display shows the time of day even when you're in another mode. This is quite useful, when using the timer or stopwatch, for example. One can time one's activities and STILL see the time of day without having to switch modes.The backlight is not bright, but it doesn't really need to be, if you think about it. It lights up just the digits, but quite visibly in the dark.The buttons are big and easy-to-press, but the case is shaped so as to protect them from accidental actuation.The nylon band is extremely well executed. It is kind of stuff, but it is padded and sonically welded together. The holes for the buckle are melted through, so they won't stretch and cause the band to unravel. It is more comfortable than Casio's usual resin bands because nylon breathes with the wrist a bit better. Resin can be made to do this if shaped properly (and a lot of Casio bands are) but it doesn't take anything exotic on this. I'd like to see this band type on more Casios in the future.Over the last 30 years, I've had probably 30 digital Casios. Not because they need replacing, but because I'm always searching for that perfect feature set and comfort level. This one and the GD-350-1B are the top two so far. This one is thinner and has the compass, thermometer, and big display. The GD-350-1B has the Vibe Alarm and one-button access to the countdown timer from the home screen. (but is much thicker and twice the price)The one change I'd make to this watch would be to implement the thermometer sensor such that it can be use for instantaneous, on-the-wrist, temperature measurements. As it is now, I believe it uses the case back to stabilize readings, thus making it totally inaccurate unless it is taken off the wrist and left to sit somewhere for 20 minutes or so. As it is, it can still be useful, like for measuring different ambient temperatures in different places in the house. For example, in my apartment, I found that it can be 55 degrees in the bedrooms while it is 72 degrees near the thermostat. :-\","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6B5296VZV0KV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H07QQCC#wasThisHelpful","R6B5296VZV0KV","A31PDR78F1MNDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31PDR78F1MNDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was a little hesitant to pay so much (three eighty) for a quartz watch. But the combination of a reasonable size (38 mm case diameter w/o crown), solid titanium bracelet and case, and solar charging eventually won me over.The blue dial is just as pictured; a deep sea blue. Blue enough to look nice, but not at all flashy.The action of the timing bezel is nice; smooth and solid, but doesn't turn accidentally. The movement is very quiet. (Some cheaper quartz movements tick so loudly they can be heard across the room, and that is the sign of a cheap movement)The diving extension is not easy to use. Even after reading the instructions, I couldn't get it open after several minutes of trying.Also, at this price point, and as a Prospex series watch, it really SHOULD have a sapphire crystal.The issue with the diving extension is a non-issue for me, but the crystal may become an issue at some point, when I pick up some scratches. Seiko's Hardlex crystal is just hardened mineral crystal; steel, sand, and stones will scratch it. Not so with sapphire.I don't bang my watches around like I used to, but if I do scratch this, I'll just have the watchmaker replace it with a sapphire one.The bracelet is held together with pins and sleeves. It's quite easy to lose the little sleeves that make the pins fit snugly. If you DO lose them, the pins won't stay put afterwards. Be mindful of this, and you'll be OK. Screw pins would be better, and this isn't unreasonable to ask this of a watch in this price range.The titanium construction means that it feels as light as a plastic watch, but with the quality feel of a stainless steel one. It also feels warmer on the wrist than SS, and is hypo-allergenic. (Though I've never known anyone who is allergic to SS)All in all though, I love the watch.

"With the above two buggies, their shorter wheelbase makes it so that they wheely if one puts too much power into them. With the Glamis Uno, it has a longer wheelbase and a bit heavier chassis, so it keeps the front wheels on the ground.The stock tires are quite good. The rears have better traction than one would think to look at them. The foams are pretty firm, and the wheels are beadlock, though that isn't a good thing, in this case. They break loose from the wheels regularly. With a power driver and 3mm hex bit, it is a quick fix, but by hand, it is quite tedious. After a few times, I glued them onto the wheels, and all has been well since then.The Dynamite Fuze 4-pole, 3300 kv motor is quite impressive. Nice strong magnets and very torquey. Quite a lot nicer than Traxxas' Velineon 3500 motor.There are little details here and there that lets a person know it is German. For example, the battery hatch on the bottom is a snug fit. On the face of it, that seems good. But when one takes it off to change batteries, one has to clean out all the dirt and sand from every little corner, or one cannot get it back on. Reminds me of the stories my grandpa told me about why the German Lugers were retired; too tight a fit for the dirty battlefield.Another example is the rubber boots that are provided to keep the shock shafts working clean. They really work too, the suspension action stays smooth, even when the car is filthy. The motor screws go through two elongated holes, so when adjusting the gear mesh, it is quite easy to get it precisely right. There is a roll cage around the transmission, and and most of the car. But to get the gear cover off only requires taking out a few screws in that area, and one bar of the roll cage just swings out of the way. Very elegant!The battery bay will accept long narrow batteries the best. For example, the Traxxas 3S, 25C, 5000 mAh is a good fit. The SPC 2S, 8200 mAh pack is about a PERFECT fit. The hardcase battery packs, where the leads exit the top, but can be bent horizontal through a little groove also work, but it is a bit of a trick to get the leads exiting right out the side, like they need to be for this car.The rear wheels/tires are kind of a strange size to me. Bigger diameter than 1/10 buggy, smaller than 1/10 monster truck and smaller than typical 1/8 buggy. They use 14mm hexes. I have a set of 2.8 Pro-Line Trenchers on the rear now, and the ribbed originals on the front. Looks goofy, but has good traction on a rocky beach.The ESC is not quite as impressive as the motor. The fan has a high pitched whine, which is not a huge deal. it runs faster with 3S than 2S. The instructions talk about lights, to help program it, but I could see no lights. Legend has it that one can see lights somewhere if the room is dark enough. That's a bunch of hoo-ha, if you ask me. The ESC also causes the motor to ""beep"", but weakly. One cannot barely hear the louder pitch over the fan noise, and one canNOT hear the quieter one over the fan. So I unplugged the fan to program it.The rear shocks are not sprung stiffly enough, even with two of the thickest preload spacers on each side. I replaced the springs with Traxxas red ones with white stripes, and with one thick preload spacer on each side, those are about perfect. Stock, it squats quite a lot under accleration, and only rebounds halfway up its stroke.It does not take a hit like a Traxxas though. Not quite as durable overall. Not fragile either, but not shockingly durable. When you have a crash where you'd expect something to break, it will break. It takes the basic flips and cartwheels in the grass and send with grace, but hit something hard, and something breaks. That's not so bad, but if you order parts from Horizon, they rape you pretty good for shipping. Best if your local shop stocks Vaterra.Roll-over crashes at high speed will break the wing mount, forcing you to buy a whole new wing kit. I did that once, but wound up not mounting it. I'll just drive it without the wing, even if it doesn't look as tough. The roll cage protects everything else back there well enough.Speaking of parts, this shares most chassis, suspension, and driveline parts with the Glamis Fear, which is still in production at the time of this writing. So if you're looking at buying a new old stock one of these, and you don't mind the styling of the Fear, that might be the one to get. I see the profiteers here have raised the price by a hundred fifty bucks since it went out of production for the US. To me, for two fifty, it was a screaming deal. For three hundred, it is still a deal. For three fifty, it is fair, but not an obvious choice. Four over four hundred: no thanks, I'd rather have 4WD at that point, even if it means a more demanding power system. This 2WD platform is as fast on 3S as a 4WD 1/8 buggy is on 5S. As always, it requires more skill and throttle discipline to drive well, compared to 4WD.Overall, it's a great car. I would buy it again, but not at the four hundred thirty bucks they were getting for them when they were in full production. Three to three-fifty is about what it's worth. Better than a Bandit VXL for three forty, that's for sure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EXX2JOT56HMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B84486O#wasThisHelpful","R3EXX2JOT56HMP","A31PDR78F1MNDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31PDR78F1MNDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm surprised that an all-around company like Sony can do so many things so well. But they do. These sound as good as the more expensive Sennheisers they are replacing. The lead insulation isn't as tacky, so they don't get hung up on things like the Sennheisers did.I could deal with that alone, but I lost the rubber parts for specific fitting into the ear, and lost the spares too. It'd be hard and expensive to find replacements, so those are done, even though they work, audio-wise.Onto these. They come with a little rubber/plastic thing to wrap excess cord on, which is a nice touch. The inline volume control is kind of useless to me. It is just an attenuator. Why not just control the volume from the MP3 player/iPhone, and not have this unsightly tumor in the middle of the cord? I guess it could be handy when listening at your desk and the phone rings or something.The only thing I'd like to see different is for Sony to put it on their cord reel, like they have with their cheaper headphones. The one where you reel it in by cranking the wheel with one's thumb. Then, no tangle issues. The wrappy thing this comes with will have you twisting the leads as you wrap, rather than just pulling it straight on or off with no twisting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KDZYSCH66FT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RE3YU8#wasThisHelpful","R2KDZYSCH66FT","A31PDR78F1MNDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31PDR78F1MNDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LOVE this little gadget! We recently got two new laptops that are business models and lacked HDMI (boo). We knew the display port would be our hookup going forward and that we would need an adapter. Since we also needed DVI and VGA at times I started looking into some multi type adapters and hoped that one would work well (sometimes the more one thing does the less it does each thing successfully :)We've used this five or so times and each time it's been PERFECT - no issues, no jumping, no connection problems, a very very secure physical connection that can't come out with a bump or even a trip, and compatible with anything we have used. All connections have been perfect and we have tried each one a number of times, a few in use the entire day with some massive equipment.  The unit itself, while lightweight, feels nicely made and sturdy, and NOT a cheapo item that seems on the brink of a quick death with every use. Very impressed at the quality for an under $20 list price item! It's small enough to throw in the laptop bag and even tape down if you need for work etc.This is a great solution if you are like us and lack an HDMI, and/or have needs for these few connection types and want one unit to do everything. Can't recommend this enough, and at under $20 it's a steal - it performs like a $60 adapter would, which is very surprising as the market is flooded with a lot of low level computer accessories that fail.  Regardless of the fact that this was  test/review item, I can't recommend this enough - we will without a doubt purchase more of these if we need at any point down the line!Please note: Product received at no cost in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

"Not a bad protector at $7 or so, in this category they honestly are all very similar and are cheap enough to replace when you break them. Drops will at times break any glass so you can't fault one over another every time, but some do hold up a bit better than others even at the lower price point. This one is fine, but not the best of the many we have tried.The GOOD: Nice fit, as usual doesn't go to the edges due to the phone design, but it does cover the viewable area and I did not have trouble with bleeding or it not quite getting to the edge of the backlit part. You do have to be extra careful to get it just right, but with the little sticker things they include it isn't that hard. You get good at it after a while :) Smooth finish with no sharp edges, and held up well to a few falls so far.The BAD: I prefer the rounded bottom shape, this straight U shape is a little weird, but it's as minor issue (however I know there are some ultra picky phone accessory people out there like me :) It does have a slight bit of pulling at the edges, so the adhesion is maybe not as great as some others I have used. The photos with metal ""drilling"" into the surface is a little silly, all glass will help with impact but none are going to save phones from crazy pressure or crack from power tools etc :)Overall not a bad deal for $7 but there are some slightly better ones at the $10 and under mark, in my opinion.Please note: Received at no cost in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

"These are a steal at around $30-$35 (it looks like some size/color combinations are even less) as they are well made and should last a lot longer than many other flip flop style sandals. KC Reaction puts out nice quality shoes for this price range and these are no exception.The GOOD: Looks great - lots of sparkle and a fun design on top, with a solid and sleek shape and look on the sole and sides. They look good dressed up or down, and while the stones are somewhat large and there are a good amount of them, it really isn't TOO much - good for casual around town outfits also. Feel and look like a great construction and while they are not padded, they hug the foot nicely - for most people without foot issues or a need for a soft insole, they will work. They do have a slight bit of height but they are not bulky or clunky (unless you prefer a very thin slight look.)The BAD: Ended up not keeping them only for one reason (and was disappointed because really do love the look and quality.) - the strap is placed a little too far back on the shoe. This is the biggest problem with flip fop style shoes, and Ive found it tends to happen more the higher the price is, strangely. I happen to have small feet with shorter toes, so if you have long toes it would not be an issue but there is just a lot of space at the ends for me which looks and feels strange. I'm a 6.5, and the 6.5 fits great - just about to the back, not too wide or narrow, and comfy on the mid part but just a lot of space in the toe area. I do have a lot of other flip flops and FF sandals, and almost none have this problem (although Tory Burch sandals all seem to have this too - it's definitely not just this brand.)I can't speak to the comfort over a long time as I didn't keep these, but when trying them on and walking for a minute they felt fine, and did not rub (and I'm pretty sensitive to that.) Again this will depend on your foot shape/size the same as with the toe issue.If they had fit me right this would be a 5 star, especially at under $30","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H40I0VYZ6JLF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0051SP07E#wasThisHelpful","R3H40I0VYZ6JLF","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cute little kit - just the right size for those who need to sew a button / hem / hole here and there, but don't do much more than that so don't need a huge set. Good combination of things and they pack a lot into such a little pouch! I think 30 piece - all the colors you need, little tools etc, and just a very handy little kit. Great to travel with also and at this price can get a bunch.Nice that they included scissors as most little kits do not have them - we find tons of uses for them and they really come in handyThe only thing I would prefer (and this is really the case with all little kits) is 2 of the black spools and less of the random colors least used (yellow etc) - but that's how most kids at this price range come.Please note: Received at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

"While the set came with all the right parts (pads, stickers, dust thing) it unfortunately did not match the listing ""curved edge"" - it's flat like most of the others on the market. Was a bit disappointed as I have tried a lot of the flat ones and was interested in seeing how this was different.The good - solid shiny white, if you like the matching look and have a white phone it will look nice. Fuller cut, so if you want more width coverage this will work. Comes with the accessories, and cutouts are accurate.The bad - not curved, cracked while applying (first in about 20 I've put on, and I'm super careful) and the wider edge can actually be a minus since dust and junk gets underneath, and it's easier to start pulling up or catch on something.Overall not a bad protector at a normal price, and a bonus if you want the white - but isn't curved as seems to crack a bit more than othersPlease note: Received at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

"In fairness - this sleeve is very accurately described: ""Reversible design allows you to turn over the sleeve for use according to different occasions.Slim and lightweight to carry, smooth to slide the sleeve into your backpack, briefcase or other bag. Special designed flap keeps your precious device securely inside.""All of these things are true, and this is MEANT to be a thin lightweight layer - no bulk, no weight, and to protect from things like drips and scratches. It does all of this well and is a good fit for most 13 inch laptops (thought it won't be snug on them all, it fits well even with a bit of extra room)No, it does not give a huge thick layer of protection and wont prevent damage from rough handling, falls, crashes, etc etc. This would be ideal to use on a laptop that is regularly carried within another bag that has some padding, using the bag for more actual damage protection while using the sleeve to keep it covered when taking it out and moving it around, or when inside the bag pushed up against other stuffI prefer the zipper style as this is a little less easy to get in/out but it is secure and there is no zipper to break or get stuck, so that kind of evens it outNicely made for something that is $10 and looks/feels like it will hold up to regular use, no loose ends or weird stitching. The nature of the material will attract and hold on to lint and little pieces of ""stuff"" (see photo - this is after it was cleaned.) but it's not too bad, and many materials do this.

"Grabbed a box on sale w/ S&S and when these are combined it's a good deal - we prefer scented bags but I can definitely see how it would be too overpowering for some. It does depend on if you have a covered can or  not too - ours is covered and snapped on pretty tight, so you don't really smell any of the scent or garbage at all until it swings open, and then only for a second. Anyone sensitive to smells woudl want to skip these kinds of products.Nice and strong and has held up as well or better than the other top brands for us (although we dont have a long way to go as our chute is about 10 steps away) Check the size before ordering - these seem to be taller than standard but not extra extra tall so if you have a can on the larger or  taller size but want to use a 13 gallon bag it will likely not go all the way to the bottom.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R261GZHBKW44JV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JETTWCU#wasThisHelpful","R261GZHBKW44JV","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everyone we know that has switched from the softer type flexible protectors to glass has liked glass better - it will chip from time to time but are very cheap to replace and well worth the sleek clear look that doesn't wear, and the extra protection. This one has lasted longer so far than the previous ones we've had on and that's a good plus - some will crack/chip at the lightest fall.Shiny, crystal clear look - very accurate fit and not too short side to side like others can be - it covers all of the lit up area and is not overly difficult to position - just be very careful and go slow.As I always warn people - DON'T touch any part of the sticky part or you'll never get it clear again. Gently hold it on the edges or with the little stickers some kits come with, place the top part down first lined correctly, then do the bottom. I go from top to bottom kind of holding the top pressed on at the edge while i line up the bottom and drop it quickly when it's right. You CANT take it off easily and replace (stickiness isn't always as good, dirt gets under, so go slow and make sure the first time is the only time!)We always make sure we have a bunch of extras just in case we mess one up or it craksPlease note: Received at no cost for testing purposes.

"Scent is subjective, so it's not that helpful to say ""BEST"" or ""WORST"" scent ever - I think it's more helpful to describe it in general. I love Coconut and Lemon and obviously anyone who does too would like this - it's a gentle scent, mostly lemon, and does not smell chemical-y. Really nice combo and i appreciate the benefits ""Cruelty free, paraben free, polysorbate free, disodium EDTA free, gluten free, non-GMO verified, sodium laureth and lauryl sulfate free."" HUGE bonus points for all of that!It does not lather as much as normal soaps but that's a well worth it trade off. You do need a bit more prroduct as well but probably not as much as you think. I did not have any problems with residue (we just use it on our skin so can't comment on it as a shampoo.)The only down side is that the pump is too short and dispenses too little - it's not the easiest to use with a puff, and you pump like 15 times to get a good amount out (first world problems, I know.) This is easily fixable and not relevant to the acutal product, thoughOverall a nice smelling scent and a product that works very well as a body wash in our opinion.

"First - this is a LOT of scrub - we knew it was 16 ounces but still were suprised to see the amount and happy as it will last a good amount of time. Nice packaging and came secure and no granules in the box etc. Opening it for the first time we noticed a strong scent - menthol but in a good, fresh, softer way (if that makes sense.) I don't normally like a heavy menthol but this was actually nice and not overwhelming (but definitely strong!)TIP: Use a little bit in a hot sink with a towel over your head and it TOTALLY clears your nose when you're sick or just feel stuffed up.We got this mainly for us to use when we have tired and overworked feet (one of us is on them all day often.) Followed the directions and put a little extra in :) and it felt great, softened, relaxed - no it wont take away all your pain or fix more serious foot issues but for general relaxation and softening skin it's great. It does improved things like hard or cracked skin - follow up with a good peppermint foot lotion - and you will see improvement. Great for those like us who live in warm climates and live in flip flops half the time!Good price at under $12 - you got a lot for the money.

"This was the fourth dog shampoo we have tried and the only of the bunch that has a PUMP - huge bonus, especially when dealing with a dog that does not love the water or baths! The bottle is really nice - sleek/modern packaging and the pump is sturdy and works very well. Love the colors too.I will note (and one star taken off for this) that the ingredients are not ALL natural (as the title here says but the bottle does not)-- definitely some chemical-y sounding things in there, but I will say it's a solid step in the right direction. I don't mind things saying natural, but the ""all"" should go in this listing. Of course it's up to use to read labels and be diligent about choosing what works for your pets also. If you need 100% natural/organic etc this wouldn't be your best choice, but if your pet isnt sensitive or allergic to anything it would be more than fine. Did not seem to irrirate her eyes when the soapy water got in them which is nice.As far as the cleaning - it worked with a normal amount of product, not the double that we somestimes have to use with natural things. Points for that.  We both thought this one smelled good - not overpowering - and as usual with natural products, not that much lather (kind of used to it by now.) Got some gunky spots out and some caked on dirt around the paws, and overall did a solid job.At $11 and change for 16 oz in a nice looking pump bottle with some natural aspects - I feel it's a very good deal.

"BEST whole grain pasta brand by far! It's not easy getting everyone to eat this stuff but this is actually good. No, it won't taste like white pasta but you will either like it right away understanding that,, or get used to it quickly and at least not hate it. With some good spices and ingredients and maybe some protien it really is a good choice and healthy swittch to make. We have tried all of the brands and this one is our favorite by far for whole grain pasta.Price on here tends to be a big high, though there are sales/coupons from time to time.

"First thing  -we got this for $79 at another store, and feel this is what it is worth - not the $100+ that it's listed for here and other places. Once you are over $100, you can certainly get one of the more well known brands (Panasonic etc).At $79, it is a good deal. Microwaves tend to give out just before the warranty is up, and are really tough to service (heavy, big, not user serviceable) so it really is one area where it's worth it to spend more and get something a bit more dependable or with better warranty terms. In the end, we returned this after a month or so mainly because it was too hard coming from something a little larger and a more powerful (came from a 1.2 1200 watt one) Other than that we would probably have kept it. If you are on a budget and want something decent this would not be a bad choice.This would be best for light use for 1-2 people or a small family that does not count on this for too much.  It's large enough for a full plate but overall a slight bit smaller than what I would say the average microwave is. For us at least, it fit nicely in a corner, wasn't a bulky eyesore, but still had enough capacity for basic stuff / a normal sized plate. Power is maybe a bit under average which can be okay for some, but for others like us who are used to more power hard to adjust to. Not the unit's fault, but important to note if you are coming from something stronger or larger. Most standard options on this one but no frills or extras.It does look nice and sleek - combo of black and silver is nice without being a stainless overload. Love the handle - so much easier to open and then you don't get fingerprints everywhere (wooho!) Nice huge buttons for start/30/stop, and it's really easy to clean and wipes down well.3 cons - no rubber feet on the bottom - we fixed this by taping four small squares of grippy pads under the feet - the stuff you put under rugs. Without this, if you have a slippery surface the whole unit might move when you open the door. Also, when the door is open 70%-100% it does not stay open..it slowly swings back. If you open it partially it does stay, but most people do open it more than that. Also, it is a bit louder than average, not a huge deal but kind of ""sounds cheap"" if that makes sense - none of our other 'better"" brands sounded like this.All that being said, for a nice looking unit that has most functions you would want and a handle - $79 is a good deal. Some of the other stores offer a few years of warranty for $7 or so which allows for a very easy/quick replacement and lets you avoid the long, annoying, shlep of bringing this in or paying for shipping to the manufacturer - I would suggest getting that if you do buy this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S5LNBGNHJ7HB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TSK4ZK#wasThisHelpful","R1S5LNBGNHJ7HB","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great cable - exactly what we needed and did the job for a recent event. No issues with connection, fit or anything like that. It does feel slightly lightweight/plastic-y but that is pretty much the standard for items around this price point. Hopefiully it will continue to last and not fail prematurely - will update if it does. So far, so good though and it has worked well for all of our needs.

"I agree with many of the other reviewers - VERY soft, and appears to be constructed nicely for this price point -- if a little bit on the thin side - but it's just way too short in the front. I'm on the short side and nothing is ever short on me :) The front is going to be way too short for anyone with a chest larger than around a B cup, unless you are very short waisted and/or like the short look. It rode up way too much on me which is the first time that has ever happened and I own a number of shirts like this. The photo shows it hanging a lot longer than it does even taking into account different body types...Probably would be fine on someone very petite/thin/small bust and who orders a size up. Otherwise, the fit becomes a bit strange. While I like how soft it is, and at the $15 price point it's not a bad top - it just fits too weird on any other body types :(Please note: Received at no cost in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

"I paid $11 and change for this binder which I think is an absolute steal. I needed something for a speech and it had to have rings, pockets, and not be ugly. The padfolios didn't have rings and the regular binders looked horrible, so I was happy when I saw this. At this price range (under $25, seems to be a little over $20 right now.) this was a great choice!It's a navy denim-ish look texture (but is plastic) and is about as cute as a binder can get with this material and at this cost. Not sure how the other colors will look but dark always helps inexpensive items look a lot better so I would suggest going with the navy. (Neutral too so will blend in and go with any outfit :)It has the pockets and a card holder in front, and the binder rings are 1 inch. Great size and not too big - I had maybe 15 page protectors in it with 2 papers in each and a few pages of photo paper and there was more than enough room for lots more. It's a nice construcion and the rings worked perfectly, and it has a slight bit of weight but is still light enough to hold for a while if you're giving a speech or something. Feels better than a normal binder for sure.Only thing I would have preferred is if the elastic on the outside came off - it was hanging awkwardly during use but of course a non issue if you don't need to use it for presentations or speeches. On the other hand, it won't get lost since it's attached so that's good :) Probably not really a con for most people who get this but just wanted to mention it.I would definitely buy this again even at a higher price, though keep an eye out for sales as it does go down from time to time.

"Have been using this cable as a backup/extra/travel cable for about 2 months now and it's performed extremely well. Of course you always an an mfi cerfitied cable if you aren't buying Apple but even some certified ones can work terribly. At $8 this is a great deal and there is no reason to keep buying more Apple cables at full price!It has fit without any problem in our various cases - Speck, Otterbox and Spigen. The base on either end is very similar if not identical to the Apple ones so most people won't have problems using it with cases etc. There has not been any wear or tear near the lightning end yet which is the main issue with cables like these in general. Of course we don't use it every day so I can't speak to very high amount of use but I will update in another few months if any wear starts to happen. This is just inevitable with most cables so nothing new, but some do hold out much longer than others. Also, have not gotten any error messages about not being compatible and we have used it with 4 devices so far so that is a nice plus.Overall a solid certified replacement cable that is a steal at $8.00 - would higly recommend this one.Please note: Received at no cost in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

Do not taste weird like some others and appreciate the better ingredient list - definitely a step up from some of the similar products on the market.

"Usually love Speck cases and have had a number of them over the years - good mix between protection and a nice look - but this one falls short.As many others have said - the case does NOT flay flat. Not sure why but the 6 version is made with a little hump as mentioned and it spins around. Seems trivial but with a device we all use a lot of the day it can get annoying, plus it wears the case down in that area. I type a decent amount when it's laying flat so it's more noticeable to me (others who rarely lay it down like that may not care) and I had to return it.I did try the Candyshell grip which helps mask this (the case is the same, but the grips make it a little more even and grip the surface enough so no spinning, so it's mostly fixed.) Not the prettiest case but it's not bad and the grip is a great feature, it does help with texting when your hand is on the small side.I'd suggest going with the grip or something else if you lay it flat often, if you don't then this would be a great case for you as the rest of the case is a good one - nicely made, good cutouts, moderate protection and some good colors.The price if just under $20 for the black one is a good one though as the retail is $35 (imo a bit high) Warranty is solid for a year though.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19Y84S3Z43TB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNFOHAO#wasThisHelpful","R19Y84S3Z43TB7","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The good - its a cute bottle, modern and I like the clear/black combo - looks nice if you keep these kinds of things out.  Pump works well, and the product is nice smelling and not sticky or goopy like some others are. It's as pleasant texture and scent and really works well. It works great for everyday use and I've tried it with some heavier messes (after cooking, planting etc) and while it does take a little more product, it has gotten off everythinThe bad - it is overpriced at around $15 ish.

"While this Spigen case is defnitely is not massive/rugged or anything that will offer a huge amount of protection - its one layer of TPU will help prevent marks/scratches etc give a light level of protection. If this is what you need it's a great case.It is a somewhat thin (but not the thinnest around) slightly slick TPU, with a thin layer frame of plastic (a little flimsly in my opinion, but fits well and secure when installed.)  The back does have the ""industrial"" look as listed but the finish/feel is a little slippery overall.  Spigen consistently makes well thought out and well produced cases easpecially when it comes to the accuracy and finish of the cutouts and this is a good quality nicely made case - just keep in mind it's light protection and not for anyone clumsy or who is hard on their phones.It will work with screen protectors (suggest the tempered glass ones.) Also easy to take on and off so that is a plus.At the current price of $16 it's a little high but I know these usually go up and down and many of the Spigen similar ones are $10-$12 ish which is priced right. They do have great CS and warranty service so that is defnitely a plus over some other less known compaines.Please note: Received at no cost in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

"We have sheets that fit mattress/combo heights up to 18 inches, however ours is around 15 inches - meaning lots of loose fabric left over, especially after a few days of use. Which sometimes results in a shifting of the pad and a bit of an annoying task of moving and refitting everything every morning (first world problems, I know!) We have tried 3 sets of fasteners - each a little different, and happen to like all 3 but these are probably the easiest to get on and off as you switch sheets.Very easy to use and hold tight, but do not tear (so far) anything.Stretch but are nice and firm so you aren't doing all of this for nothing  -some tend to hold but very lightly, these are really secureHold up well over time, no fraying or breaking or holes or anythingMaybe a few dollars over the normal price for a set of 4, but the fact that they are sturdy and hold up over time makes it worth it :)Please note: Received at no cost in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

"First - very cute packaging, simple and modern label (little thing but always tend to prefer these since they sit out on our counter :) Bottle top is secure too which is not always the case with oils - some don't screw on tightly and others barely fit and two have even popped off.The scent is a combination of some great ones - (Peppermint, Rosemary, Lemon, Eucalyptus) and as for it's title claim to improve breathing and congestion, well I'm not sure it would actually monumentally change or fix some issues but if you have a cold or a little bit of stuffiness, these kinds of oils DO help to some degree. (Kind of like the idea of a vicks inhaler.) I use this with a nei pot and do feel a lot more clear and refreshed after both so that is combo that may help people too.I do prefer some of the softer and fruitier / floral scents like lavender, orange but this is definitely not bad or too medicinal, just not my favorite - but it's for a specific purpose and not really meant for ""decor"" as some of the other ones are...Overall a cute bottle/label and helps to some degree - use with a neti pot for maximum effectiveness!Please note: Received at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

"Very impressed with this padfolio - at only $15 it feels and looks like a much more expensive item!Very nicely made cover and stitching is tight and perfect. Even and feels like it will last even with daily use over a long period of time. Not at all flimsy, it has a nice layer of material on the outside which we LOVE - professional but modern and more fun than something plain or dull. Goes with all outfits too so that is a huge plus ;)This is a perfect size - you can fit a nice amount of stuff inside along with the included pad, but it's not thick or bulky. I would still call it slim but we do have a nice stack of papers in and it isn't bulging or overstuffed at all. The spine is tight and I'm sure once it gets broken in will accomoate more but it really is made so well that you don't have to worry about it wearing out anytime soonReally happy with this purchase, at $15 its a steal and great for both professional and personal use!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36GZAZF1HET8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X0X3EK2#wasThisHelpful","R36GZAZF1HET8A","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The good :  Nice combination between a good amount of prrotection but not being too bulky - it's thinner than Otterboxes for example, but thicker than most average ones that are just a flat layer. Corners have good protection, and the front top is covered left to right which does add to the protection of the screen. Cutouts are accurate and the fit is good - it is not going to move around at all.The bad: The inside is a hard plastic (with the design) and not tpu/softer material like I had expected - little dissapointing as that softness is what helps with drops. I do think for any rugged case there should be a layer of hard and a layer of soft though for maximum shock protection.Also, the screen protector popped out the first few days - you can kind of push it back on and then insert the phone but dissapointing that happened - the glue they use must not be strong enough.Overall not a bad case, but a few flaws that could be fixed pretty easiliy (tpu inner, stronger protector attachment to case)Please note: Received at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

"LOVE this candle! We try tons of soy candles all the time and were very pleasantly suprised that this made it to the top of the list!All soy is clean burning and just has a more fresh, natural feel - great benefits over regular ones. However, some soy ones can tend to be a bit bland and just not give you that amount of smell you want - noticeable but not overpowering (a bit more than just a hint.) This one (we have the Ocean one) REALLY does - you notice it in all our rooms bordering where it is, and when you're next to it it's strong but not too much or to the point where it hurts your eyes etc. If you prefer a more subtle scent just put it one room away. The ocean is a clean, natural, truly ocean-y scent and does NOT smell at all chemical laden or fake. We love things like clean linen, egyptian cotton and this is right up our alley - both love it.Cute little tin althogh it does get hot so it's not so easy to move if it's been on for a while. We put it on a little plate or use gloves. Burning time is great and it has not tunneled at all! Really a nice punch for a little candle.At just under $15 it is worth it - similar sized soy candles range from around $7 to $20 depending on brand etc and this really is at the upper level of this range. It can get expensive though if you have a larger home or use them a lot.  Would love a sampler pack where you could choose 3 or 4 scents and get a discount the more you get - hopefully the company is reading this and takes that into consideration :)Please note: Received at no cost in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

"This is a weighty, substantial grinder. It looks and feels much more expensive than it is! We were pleasantly suprised when it arrived and we took it out of the box - the gray is a great gunmetal like color with a nice smooth finish and looks great! Parts fit together perfectly and it feels good in your hand with a nice bit of weight but not overly heavy. This is definitely not a cheap unit.Movement/function is smooth and works well without much effort - easy to clean and easy to work with lots of whatever you need to grind. The only down side (and this might be more a personal preference depending on hand size) is that for us, the top is a little thing and smooth with not much of a grip. If it could be made a slight bit thicker and have grippy things on the outside or some kind of indented design, this would help with use and holding this part. Other than that though, zero complaints- really like the look and feel of this and it will definitely last with careful use and cleaning.Price of $15 right now is right on - better than most out there at this price range in our opinion.

"We were really unhappy with this set, unfortunately. Had to buy sight unseen and wish we would have chose something else :(The good: Priced well fora 3 piece kit, and do like the heart shape of the larger piece.The bad: Quality is TERRIBLE, and we got two kits. The smaller ones were totally different from each other! Some were very thin, others 4 times as thick, completely not matching - the weirdest thing ever. The main piece had marks, chips, scuffs, imperfections, didn't look clear / fresh like the photos, just looked almost old/dusty. Both sets were like this. There were 2 actual lines within the glass, not anything done during shipping either.We were able to hide the imperfections with the sand and cleaned them up as best we could, but it just wasn't as nice as I had hoped.

I've never seen glass in such bad shape - even buying a few pieces at your local discount store would be better, honestly!The lack of top was ok, we just filled it with about 2-3 inches left at the top and melted wax / poured it in.Hopefully this company will improve the quality of their glass as the shape is nice and price is good.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HO360TM5UJF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TFDQY0#wasThisHelpful","R1HO360TM5UJF7","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We both think $49 is a fair price for this hammock - it's a solid product, well made, looks nice and has a good weight capacity.Definitely need multiple people to put it up but that is common with many of these. The biggest plus of this is the 400lb weight capacity - we didn't test the limit really but it did feel EXTREMELY solid and well made, and with the right installation and no abuse we think this will do it's job well up to the max. It feels nicely made, stitching even and solid, and is pretty compact in it's pouch. Perfect for travel, beach, camping, anything really.

"While we did not end up keepting this (our magnet mount did not work - case too thick even for 2 magnets) it's a great case for those who don't mind bulk! They do note the weight that this will ad in the listing and their honesty is greatly appreciated - we knew what to expect but wanted to give it a try with some magents anyway, hoping the weight wouldn't be too much - sadly, it was.It's not a snap on easy case - you use the included tool and work with the little screws. However once in, it's not going anywhere. The case is LARGE and does add bulk and weight, but it feels and looks to be very high level / rugged protection - this is along the lines of the other rugged cases like Defender, etc. I would say it even has a bit more bulk and thickness and some metal parts which many of the others do not. Fit is good and with a little bit of work getting it on and off it adds a very good barrier between the elements and drops etc.If you want high level protection and don't mind the weight/size, this is a great alternative to some of the very expensive rugged cases out there.  $15 is a steal for these kinds of ""heavy duty"" cases and it honestly does feel along the same lines quality wise.

"Really happy with this case - and we have tried dozens!This one was for a family member who wanted something more than just a layer of tpu/silicone, but hates anything bulky and is pretty careful/not clumsy so didn't need any crazy rugged protection. This is NOT going to protect from water, lots of dirt/dust, or constant hard drops, but it does provide a nice, sturdy layer(s) of protection against minor/medium type drops and marks, scratches, some dust etc. It is a great compromise - not too thin, not too thick, gives a slight bit of heft but really would still be considered a smaller sized case.Nice to have a more matte finish than some of the glossy ones that show tons of marks immediately. Will update after a month or two to see how that is holding up, but I expect it will look a lot better than any shiny ones.The fit is great, accurate cut outs and snug but still easy to pop on and off to clean. It goes give a slight bit of a grip on the sides but I would say it's a little on the slick side, however not at all slippery. And again while it's not total protection from the elements as the openings aren't covered and there's the hole on the back, it protects from the average/everyday things - little bit of dust, water, gunk, light drops etc. Which is what most people need IMO.All in all a great product that gives a bit of protection without being huge or cumbersome.

"I received everything intact - I had read some reviews that noted some of the pieces were broken, but I did not have any problems with my set. Of course, inspect all items when you get them to make sure they are sturdy with no damage -if one is loose it would cause problems when trying to put on your bed.BIG TIP: YOU NEED TWO PEOPLE TO INSTALL! One to hold the bed up, one to attach. Without a second person you will be beyond frustrated and give up - trust me :)You do kind of have to eyeball where they each go, as far as how far in/out from the edge, but it's easy to redo if it's not right. Don't put too much material in each clip, but make sure it's enough to hold - again, easy to adjust. The clips seem pretty strong and none have pulled out on us yet. Note - it will not drastically change a horribly fitting sheet to a perfect fit, nor change a type of sheet to a different type - this is best for the general need of preventing slipping or making slightly high sheets a bit more fitted.We have a 14.5 height with our mattress, topper and pad - and our sheets fit up to 18 depth so we have some extra material as well as bit of slipping. For this purpose these work very well - make it a nicer fit, and help things from moving around about 75%. With a little bit of work on install and a helper it really is a good product and design - we are happy with them!Please note: Received at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

"After a few issues with our tires I decided to start using one of these little gadgets to try and check pressure regularly. This is really very handy and so far has been spot on - very easy to use, led easy to read/lcd, and as accurate as you are going to get with small hand held unit in this price range (which is really not any less than more expensive ones my more than a teeny bit.)BEST feature is that it glows - easy to use at any time and/or in spots where there is limited light. It's also pretty compact and light - easy to throw in the GC or a door or back seat pocket/holder and does not take up much space. Liek the orange so you don't lose it in the sea of black tools and equipment many of us have :)Also appreciate that it does not kill batteries due to the auto off feature - otherwise it could run through them quickly.Please note: Received at no cost in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

"This a cute little compact humidifier/diffuser that really looks like a tiny rice cooker :) It's simple and compact which is just what we wanted. This would be ideal in a kitchen, small bedroom or at a desk. It's a smaller unit so not overly powerful and doesn't hold a huge amount of water but for light use in smaller areas it's great. We use it more with a few drops of scented oil (vs just as a humidifier) as we like just a bit of scent now and then so it's ideal for just that too.Very simple unit with an easy to twist off top and a cord, you can use an adapter if you prefer a wall charge vs a usb charge (easier in some areas.) Cleans up really well and has had no problems working over the past month - steady stream, no clogging or malfunctions and again, really simple to use.Love the blue LED - modern/sleek looking and adds a very slight glow. BONUS: Great rubber bottom - love anything with this, it won't slide around and will grip on to a glass surface well. Nothing is more annoying when things like this and usb hubs etc start sliding all over the place!Priced at the high end of the reasonable range ($18) - however you are paying more for anything compact and with an LED. This isn't a cheap item at all, so worth a few extra bucks over some of the others. We travel with it too and it's light enough to not add weight or bulk to your bagPlease note: I received this at no cost in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

"As a few other people mentioned, the fit is kind of weird. If you are on the thin / lanky side they will work best (or if you like a straighter fit.) I would NOT call these relaxed - they aren't skinny jeans but the cut is just is more straight than expected.Quality is ok - mid/low level decent brand but nothing we would call ""best jeans ever."" Slightly on the thin side too.  At around $24 they are fairly priced, and won't fall apart like very cheap ones but they just don't seem very comfy/cozy or like they would wash well years down the line into a great pair of worn in jeans. (The only other Lee jeans we tried didn't) Again though, for $24 it's not a bad deal and you aren't really supposed to get years upon years out of $24 jeans IMO.Fit - again, not what you might expect for relaxed unless you're on the thin/lanky side. Bit too little room in the thigh area.Color and look is nice - the very dark wash is great, and they can be dressed up or down.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O9I240V6SKDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFQ3H6W#wasThisHelpful","R1O9I240V6SKDS","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 4th scent of oil we have tried (we are picky / sensitive to oils but love them!) We tend to go for the sweeter / more subtle ones like lavender, orange etc - citrus is always a fan as it evokes a ""clean"" feeling even when you have been lazy and your junk is piling up :) I had wanted to try lemon for a while and glad we got this big bottle!SCENT: It is STRONG - that's for sure. I'm not sure about the 3x, 4x, 5x and beyond but this 5x one is - WOAH. Not in a bad way, but something to be aware of. It kind of reminds me of those little round hard lemon candies....good, but - in your face! A little bit definitely goes a long way - which is good - but keep it away from your eyes as they will likely start to sting if you're too close.PRICE/VALUE: At $13 and change for a 4oz concentrated / glass bottle with dropper -it' fairly priced. Of course there are other factors like concentration and purity and brand, but generally this is right on the mark for this amount of a strong lemon oil. As I mentioned, a tiny bit goes a long way, so this will last anyone a very long time.USES: We mainly use this for our diffuser, and a teeny tiny bit on our dryer balls (so good!) but I will be adding it to some natural homemade cleaning solution soon which people rave about. I have put it in plain ice water with lemon wedges (and in tea with a bit of raw honey) and both were SO GOOD - a really quick and cheap way to make water/tea more interesting lol.  I actually did try baking with it once and it was subtle but good - and the scent was great!, although you can definitely use too much so use a TEENY TEENY BIT for this.  I did some research on the health benefits and came up with an amazing list, so will try to incorporate it into foods going forward...Helps lower cholesterolCleansing and purificationOral health and remedy for halitosis (bad breath)DigestionThirst quencherRemedy for abdominal colic painCough reliefCalms stomach and relieves nauseaPrevents malabsorptionImproves digestionNourishes the skinPromotes Weight lossNow of course, I'm not a Dr but if these things are even a LITTLE bit helped - yay! With all the junk out there I'd much rather use lemon oil in place of something else where possible. I also pulled up some common uses which hopefully can be helpful to someone:Laundry – If  you leave your laundry sitting in the washer too long, add a few drop and your clothes won’t get that nasty smell.Teeth Whitener – Mix lemon essential oil, baking soda and coconut oil and rub on your teeth for 2 minClean Hands – Just add a couple drops of lemon EO with your soap and get your clean hands back!Natural Disinfectant – 40 drops lemon oil and 20 drops tea tree oil to a 16-oz bottle with pure water (and a bit of white vinegar)Face-wash – You can make lemon oil with baking soda and honey for a natural acne free face wash.Wood and Silver Polish – A lemon oil-soaked cloth helps spruce up your tarnished silver and jewelry!  Use for wood cleaning alsoGoo-Be-Gone – Un-stick the sticky goo your kids leave behind with stickers and gum with lemon oil.Promotes Fat-Loss – Putting 2 drops of lemon oil in your water 3x daily can support metabolism and weight lossImproves Mood – Diffusing lemon essential oil in the air can lift mood and fight depressionImmune Support – Can support lymphatic drainage and help your overcome a cold fast, mix it with coconut oil and rub it on your neck.Again, if even a little improvement in these areas is achieved it's a great thing to include! I'm glad I looked into all this as I would have just used it for our diffuser and nothing else :) I will update this review with some results of other uses once I try them...Also: It comes with a plastic seal along the tip which is great as the tops of these glass bottles can come loose easily. Not all oils have this so I appreciate when it when they do.Please note: I received this at no cost in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

"GREAT socks! Look exactly like the photo - deep gray (great as they don't show much dirt ;) and hit just at the right spot at the ankle - not too low, not too high. Fit a mens size 10.5-11 perfectly and could go up or down a number of sizes. LOVE that they are not cotton, really great combo of poly spandex - holds up well, fits nice without being too tight, and wash great. They are medium/thin, so not ideal for heavy work or sports but for general use, walking, some light activity they are perfect.For washing - we use cold water and turn them inside out (do this with all socks.)Got a 6 pack on sale for around $15 which I feel is a steal - Reebok has consistently put out well made, nice looking socks at a low price point that last a lot longer than most similar brands in this range.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27CPCS3HXGB0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UC9CKA2#wasThisHelpful","R27CPCS3HXGB0G","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is ok - nothing amazing but certainly not terrible. First, I think it's 2.5 retinol + hylauraonic acid, not just 2.5 retinol as that would a LOT.! There are some great ingredients but some others that aren't ideal, and it can be drying - so not great for dry skin.It DID prevent breakouts for the month that I used it, and I think can have some slight benefits in terms of smoothness, pores, lines. BUT this (like most things) is not a miracle, and won't fix your skin issues or remove lines/change pore size (nothing can do that.) I'm surprised people are gushing that in 1-2 days things were noticeably different - aside from something like a peel or dermabrasion - most products are not going to show anything in 1-2 days. Also, most people use multiple items at once, so the results could be from the combination or from something else that is stronger. That being said, a retinol serum can certainly be a good thing to use a night and can help improve the appearance of things like pore size and light lines etc.It is a little on the thick side, but the pump is great and 2oz is a very nice size. Maybe slightly on the high side for price at $16 and change.I will stick with my other products, but if you need/want these particular ingredients and don't have dry skin, it may work for you.Please note: I received this at no cost in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

"The main benefits of glass over standard protectors (gummy types, wet application or the light plastic ones:No coming up at the edges or near the home buttonNo marks and dents and scratchesCrystal clear view - truly.Very resistant to dirt and general wearThe down side is that the glass does crack and chip somewhat frequently (all, not just this one) if you drop it, even lightly. Not every time, but you will be replacing them somewhat regularly depending on how clumsy you are :)TOUCH: Perfect - zero problems using the screen, buttons, everythingCUTOUTS: Perfect - with a little work you can line it up very accurately and everything fits exactly how it should. Yes, most are cut thinner due to the curved screen - the phone's fault, not the protectorsDURABILITY: Holds up to wear and looks great from day to day - until it cracks or chips which depends on use but does happen more than with other materials. However, while in use it looks great!At this cheap (around $4.50 each) you can afford a few backups - they all come with the standard wipes and stickers so you will have enough to go around. Just go slow when applying, do the top first and once that's lined up and dropped down at the edge, line up the bottom near the home button, then push to adhere.

"Wonderful little diffuser! This is our fifth one and I love it for a lot of reasons:1. The wood ""look"" is not overly fake or tacky like many others - yes, its not a solid hardwood and you won't really fool anyone that it is but it's surprisingly nice nevertheless. I'm someone who HATES ""looks"" like laminate fake wood floors etc and so to actually not mind this is saying a lot!2. It is nice and compact but not tiny. Fits in your bag to travel easily, perfect for a desk or a corner of a nightstand, but holds enough so that you won't run out every 20 minutes. Really a great size for smaller rooms, travel, desk areas etc.3. Lightweight, but - YAY - has a great gray rubber bottom to keep it's footing on your surface. This is lacking on so many products and ruins things for me - I can't stand stuff sliding everywhere. It seems like a little thing but it really does make a difference for a lot of stuff!4. SIMPLE! One cord, one top that comes off, simple to load, use, clean and store.5. LED's and light touch functions - modern and cool features that many others are lacking. All work great so far (1 month of consistent use)Priced well at just under $20 for the look, rubber bottom and features plus it feels like a more well made unit than some other diffusers at this price range. As always it is worth a few more bucks to get something that wont fail every other time and need to be replaced after a few months. I expect this will work for a good amount of time and will update if anything changes later. But overall - really cute, simple, well made unit!

"I was very surprised to read the reviews below regarding these sheets being scratchy - this was not our experience at all and we are picky :)  We have two sets of these, one is new and one a bit broken in, and both have been exceptionally soft and cozy from day one after a wash - so much so that I mentioned to dh how soft they were compared to all the other (equally priced and of equal brand/quality) sets. I wonder if something changed from 2013/2014 when this first came out - I know the material and makeup is the same but who knows, maybe they had been using some sub par stuff and improved it after complaints or something. I think I read something about the Home line being sold - not sure. . No, it's not the highest end set they offer (up to $4000 for one item - eek!) but retail price for the king set is $180 so it's not what I might call cheap either. We are very happy (although we did grab ours for around $70 on sale, so that might make us a little biased - not sure we would pay $200 after tax retail per set.)In any case, the sets we have we LOVE and feel great to both of us - soft, almost delicate feeling but they are not thin or cheap and wash up extremely well. I suggest washing in cold or at most warm/cold and washing only with some delicates or light clothes, and ALWAYS dry in a low heat. This will help keep the dark colors and texture softest.The colors and pattern are great - a nice plum which is a bit feminine but very dark and no flowers or anything girly, so men won't find it off putting :) It's a subtle neutral pattern which is more interesting than a solid but not loud or offensive, and a great compromise between a him/her if that's what you are looking for! I had a hard time finding something we would both like and this really fit the bill.The other pieces to this set are gorgeous - the ovals in warm plum for the shams, coverlet and the assorted pillows are all really nice, well made and luxurious. It's a beautiful set, truly. We don't have the duvet cover/shams as they were a little floral/girly for dh and we both really liked the all dark of the coverlet/sheets/ovals items.I've attached a close up of the sheet next to an ovals / warm plum textured sham.

"This is the last of 4 LAVO products I have tried over the past month. I've really liked them all - with the exception of price per size which I feel is a bit high, the products have all been great to use and have outperformed most drugstore product I've bought in the recent years.PRODUCT: Nice thick consistency - add a bit of water if it's too thick for you - however I like how it goes on :) It does not smell bad at all, and does not end up with a tight cracked mess like many do. It feels and smells like a good quality combination of ingredients - nothing irritated me and I did not have any redness.PRICE: The only con. Like some of the other Lavo products, as great as they are / this is -- I do feel it's a bit high for the size. This is not a top/high end product that can command $50-$150 and I feel the msrp of $70 is high. It's definitely better than most drugstore brands but I feel it's more of a $20 range, $30-$40 msrp at most. Which is good - don't get me wrong, but still not in the $50 and up category in my opinion.  Also, I don't know about saying ""this mask costs $80 with a spa treatment."" - you can't compare an actual facial to any product, totally different things lol. I know it's silly but I'm a stickler for accuracy lol.That all being said - this is a GOOD mask! My skin responds well, it does help with temporarily shrinking pores and with blackheads and the overall texture is improved. It is more gentle than some masks I have tried, similar to most of the mid range more natural ones, and really does utilize some great ingredients. I use it once a week switching between the Queen Helene which I love too - they are similar actually.Please note: I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

"Cute little kit! I've attached a few photos below - hope they help: )CASE: The case is nice and compact, protective with a red velvet-ish lining and a little piece of plastic that covers 1/2 to protect each side from rubbing/scraping against each other. It's a faux leather in white with a black zipper- nice colors. :) Probably room for a a few more thin tools too if you have some you need a pouch for.TOOLS:  The tools themselves are all pretty well made and do not feel chintzy - they are not pro or high end tools by any means but at this price they are pretty good! Sturdy and do not bend with normal pressure. The sizes and shapes vary enough that you will have more than you need (usually people use the lance and the smaller size rounds, but they are all pretty useful for different things!) They have stayed new looking - we wash them well each time of course - as has the case. Hopefully with repeated washing down the line they will stay well.A FEW CONS: The lance could be sharper,  the sewing around the case/inside is uneven and the lining inside is a little low quality - nothing huge if you are keeping it and it's reasonable for a $12 price range but this really is NOT suitable for a gift...Overall a great little kit at $12 - lots of tools, cute case, and everything does a good job.Please note: I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

"Advil is our life saver! This is a great deal - we always re buy the 200ct bottle, its not too big or small and the price is better than B&M stores. I find generic brands just don't seem to work as well - whether it's a real thing or placebo, who knows, but to us well worth a slight bit extra :) This bottle is a very secure child proof cap (some are flimsy, so figured it was worth mentioning.)All the expiration dates have been very far in advance - 2 + years - just make SURE you buy from Amazon direct - not a third party seller, which could be new old stock. I always check the dates when they come just to be sure but have never had a problem from Amazon stock - always very fresh new bottles.Liqui-Gels are a lot easier to get down - so perfect for anyone who has trouble swallowing pills or who just hates that chalky taste.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30EIC235Y40E4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARKQ3AO#wasThisHelpful","R30EIC235Y40E4","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This pad is ALMOST perfect! We have been using it for around 3 months now and will definitely be keeping it for as long as it will let us :) We are on pad number # so that is saying a lot lol. But we both really do like this one. Our setup is a 10 inch firm-ish simple memory foam matress as a base (on thick slats.) with a 3 inch 4lb good quality foam topper, then this pad.FIT: So our setup as described as above is 13 inches before the pad - I believe this one fits up to 18 inches or so, and we knew it would be a little large. It is not bad, but if you are less than around 15 or so inches height you will end up with some extra skirt material and the fit will be less snug. The length and width is pretty accurate (maybe a slight bit big but I'm pretty particular and I think it's still a good fit :) So I would say if you are around 14-17 inches thick that is ideal, but you can still use this for something a bit shorter with a few adjustments. We do have to tuck the skirt in and use some of those mattress sheet clips though. The skirt itself is NOT just like a sheet, but it is not that very snug tight elastic you sometimes see in photos of other ones. It is stretchy with some grip, but a very thin material, and while it does stretch, it is not tight or overly snug by any means. Part of this is the material, part of it is to allow for a higher mattress. I wish it was was tighter as that would help with slipping (see below) but it really is a lot better than many skirts that just droop and barely hold on.FEEL: Very soft, luxurious as much as you can get at this price range :) and it's held it's loft very well after all these months. It is cozy but you do not sink in - it kind of envelops you if that makes sense. We have a 4lb topper underneath and a firm mattress under that which provides support, so if your mattress is very soft obviously that would change things.  Hopefully it will maintain loft for a good amount of time, and age well. If course it is always better in the beginning - but I think even if it flattens a bit we will still like it. I do love the bamboo finish/texture, while it's not all 100% natural it is a nice compromise - some good stuff like bamboo mixed in, but without a $300 price tag. It does not get hot for either of us, which we are both happy about.ONLY CON - for us, is that it does slip around at night. Again, taller mattresses/topper heights will have less of a problem with this, and shorter ones more. We usually have to pull it back into place once daily or every other day - the clips do help somewhat.  We are looking into getting some kind of grippy later or cover to use over our topper and under this pad - kind of like what they use under carpets to keep them from slipping lol :) So - this is really the only con - not sure why all mp makers don't make a very grippy bottom for these...problem would be solved!We paid around $85 for a king and I think it is a great deal at that price. It absolutely feels and looks better than most of the standard/ average ones that are less, and is worth a premium - anything up to $100 or a little over really is a fair price. It is well worth the little extra cost considering it's your bed and your sleep at stake.We had a guest say over one week and her first comment was how comfortable the bed it! I think it was the combo of all the products together but I'm sure the pad had something to do with it!Attached a bunch of photos - I couldn't find a close up of the skit when I was shopping, so included a few and some of the bottom, side, etc.  Hope this helps!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5OOGMY78SCE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009GIRZEG#wasThisHelpful","R5OOGMY78SCE1","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just about perfect (for us at least!) Needed a quiet, solid unit with a good name for our medium/smallish sized bathroom. Looked at ones from $50 to $200 and ended up somewhere in the middle at this one for a bit over $100. We feel it is very fairly priced - have tried other lesser known brands before and been disappointed. This has been installed in our apt for around 4 months now and it has been working perfectly with zero issues so far.INSTALLATION: Meant to have attic/above ceiling acess but it CAN be done from below, which is how we did it. Depending on your room/space/ceiling and what you have before, it may range from somewhat easy to very difficult. We had nothing there- just a hole - so could assemble it outside and push it back up then secure. Not too bad, but we had just a wide open space to work with - and it did take some fenagling. We did need to cut our ceiling a few inches larger though.LOOK: Looks nice and sleek as the photos show - pretty standard for these, even though its a plastic cover it blends in pretty well. It is a true white, if anyone is wondering (some are a little off.)SOUND: It's quiet - that's for sure. Some people say they can't tell if it's on - maybe it depends on the connection or materials used or something but you can definitely tell ours is on, its just not loud at all. It has kind of grown on us, but I do wonder if it varies from zero to a little bit of sound from person to person. However, I am usually bothered by any noises and this really is so gentle it's nothing that would ever bother anyone (unless you do really need silence.)EFFICIENCY: We have a standard bathroom with tub and a 1 sink vanity, not tiny but not large - and this pulls steam away very well - nothing or only a slight bit on the mirrors if its a very long shower. It works extremely well - nothing more to say on that : )  I'm expecting it to run for many yeras with no problems - fingers crossed!Overall a great deal at $100 - good brand, nice looking and efficient unit that is very soft (or silent for some it seems) I will update this review in a few months and / or if there are any changes.I have attached a few photos of it installed (please excuse the unfinished ceiling lol :) Hope this helps!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DNSAVH89Z18S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TJAGPS#wasThisHelpful","R1DNSAVH89Z18S","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We switched from the nasa type thick glossy wet applied protectors to glass protectors about 6 weeks ago. Just tried this Nozza protector recently - most of these are very similar, but the Nozza has a very precise fit and came like most with the appropriate wipes and dust stickers.PRO:  Material does not come up at edges and get gunky. No marks or dents from use. Easier application. Glossy clean look.CON: Most drops face down will crack the glass. Better than it being the phone, but even relatively light drops that wouldn't have harmed the phone do ruin most glass protectors. So it looks GREAT while it's good, but does have to be replaced often.HUGE NOTE: DON'T touch any part of the sticky part or you'll never get it clear again.) Just hold it on the edges, place the top part down first lined correctly, then do the bottom part - its easy to get one side even and the other side slightly off if you try to do them at the same time.I will keep up with the glass ones, even having to replace them often - because they feel great to use, look good, very high gloss but a clear view, and do give another layer of protection that most others don't.ANOTHER TIP: Stock up on a few so you always have a spare!!!!!As long as you are not extremely clumsy or use your phone in high accident prone situations (construction etc.) you should be happy with these.Please note: Received at no cost for testing purposes. All my reviews are 100% honest and unbiased.

"These are just what we were looking for - neutral, silver/gray modern looking mats with a nice texture but not annoyingly small holes like our last ones that were IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEAN lol. This is a very cute set of 4 mats, a bit on the smaller side (perfect for us, but check measurements) and have a great modern, chic look -simple with a nice texture and the silver/gray is not too shiny or dull, just right.They have been really easy to clean - just a light wipe with a damp rag and they're like new again. Soft material but does hold up nicely, when you unroll them just roll them up back in the other direction for a minute and they will even out and end up totally flat. They roll up very thin and are really easy to store which is a bonus. I wouldn't put anything extremely hot on them, but we have had a decent amount of hot plates and pyrex dishes (a bit cooled from the oven first) and they have held up well to the moderate heat.They are priced slightly higher than some other sets but I feel they are above average quality and look so worth a few bucks more it in my opinion.Please note: I received a set at no cost in exchange for a fair, unbiased review - all my reviews/thoughts are 100% my own :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDPEED3MCCJ78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RXFLEIM#wasThisHelpful","RDPEED3MCCJ78","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: YOU MUST TAKE THE PROTECTIVE FILMS off BOTH sides...take your nail and pick along the camera hole at the edge until they come up - sometimes they can really be stuck on there.NOTE #2: The clear and lighter colors WILL DISCOLOR somewhat over time along the edges mostly (yellowing) due to mostly to the oils in your hands. This is the same with all products of this type - nothing to do with this brand. Keep your hands very clean and consistently rub down the case with rubbing alcohol and you will slow it a bit but it's inevitable. I like the smoke / darker colors for this reason but do use a clear one too and to be honest, they are cheap enough to replace 1-2 times a year if the yellowing bothers you...After getting and using these Spigen cases for ourselves we got this one for a friend who has the plus. His experience like ours was GREAT - really enjoying using this case after a number of months and a lot of handling.  For under $13 - Spigen cases by FAR are the best deal you will get, most others are just thin light cheap silicone and do not have this strength, accuracy in cutouts in durability.Even with that - this is a very solid case and as I mentioned the best quality you will get for this price range. There are TONS of flimsy cheap ones that scratch after 3 seconds, others that stretch out and dont offer more than a thin layer of protection. The Spigen cases always seem to go a few steps beyond that for the same or a tiny bit more money. It feels more substantial in your hand without being bulky at all, and that's a huge plus since the iphone 6 and 6 plus are really quite thin and slippery.The company is also very responsive and is good about honoring their warranty. DEFINITELY recommend Spigen cases - we will continue to buy them and give them as gifts etc since we enjoy them so much!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CDM3IIZY1NPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RDQVN96#wasThisHelpful","R1CDM3IIZY1NPC","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We returned this shirt - the fit was a little strange (didn't hang right for some reasons, the ends of the sleeves kind of went out, and the neck was a little high) The color was nice but it was just not so comfortable and didn't look right. Not a bad shirt if it fits you right and the colors work for you, certainly a great deal at $13 or so but I think there are better henleys around.

"DH loves these flip flops. At first he said they felt a bit stiff and not so comfy on the top of his foot but after they break in a bit (and you can actually sand down any rough spots with a magic eraser lol!) they are now great and the foam squishy foot bed is expecially comfortable. Really versatile - around the house, to the beach, even for a casual lunch -they are not like dollar store or ON ones that are a few bucks. Really nice look - we got the green with orange accents - and they go with everything. Very well made, sturdy rubber/good shape.They fit him a slight bit small, is normally a 10.5-11 and he has the 10, which fits right to the end - if you want a larger fit order a normal size and you should be okay.We got these for a great price - around $13.00 which seems to be on the very low end (now around $15-$30 depending on size and color.) Well worth it at $25 or below in our opinion and the company is good about warranty replacements for the first year if you need one. Definitely recommend these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28B3F607QU4IN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EFW38NK#wasThisHelpful","R28B3F607QU4IN","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have been buying the Wyoming cargo for years - probably 25 pairs at this point in 5 different colors! DH loves them and wears them almost every day to work. For $22 (sale) to around $28 (full price) these are a STEAL! They have all held up amazingly well in rough and tough environments with dirt, sand, liquid, oil, pulling/pushing/lots of movement and anything else.The black, dark brown, medium blue and camo ones are great neutrals that go with anything, and dark enough that it hides most stains pretty welll! The pockets are large but not overwhelming and placed very well - no weird bulges or anything :)Sizing is very accurate - a nice loose, relaxed fit and will hit a little longer for those under around 5'8 but the length is really ideal - long enough to have full coverage but not too long that it droops on shorter people! Of course this all depends on your height but 5'6-5'11 or so should really find the length to work. We wash these inside out and take them out slightly before they are totally dry and they have held up very well. Only one hole in one pair after a year of tons of use which is great - most brands in this price range would not last that longDefinitely recommend these - we will keep re buying as needed for sure!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WT1UUYD0IJ8V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFODE98#wasThisHelpful","R1WT1UUYD0IJ8V","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We bought a bottle of this for the summer since we're in a really warm climate with really high humidity - not the best weather for your skin! It definitely feels more ""treatment"" focused than some normal otc soaps - less of a strong scent, is not harsh but it did dry our skin out from time to time when we used a little more product than usual (but not a crazy amount.) Salicylic acid is not for everyone!  It is not organic or 100% pure/natural by any means - it does have a sudsing agent -- but it does include some helpful ingredients and omits some other fillers that don't do anything good.It is a bit thin and the bottle is on the small side for around $5 at 10 ounces, but these ingredients are generally a little more expensive so its still within the range of average pricing for ""treatment"" soaps. However because it's so thin it's easy to pour out too much when dispensing.  It will not clear up every single thing on all people's bodies but it definitely helps in many cases with any bumps/marks/rashes etc that can be helped by  SA. If that is the ingredient you need this is a good choice, but not strong enough to actually cure/fix anything moderate or severe.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1963FV05QMDCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BG4MI3Q#wasThisHelpful","R1963FV05QMDCD","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Extremely well made jeans, feels a lot more expensive than the $24.00 we paid! Nice rich dark color, slightly relaxed fit (but definitely not loose) and stitching is very even. The cut is extremely flattering and these can be dressed up or down for most occasions - the dark wash can be for day or night (we got the darkest blue which is ideal as it goes with everything and never looks to casual)I would say these run very slightly small but not enough to size up, unless you are in the middle of two sizes or really like a looser fit. The only note I would make is that we've gotten a number of the same style and for some reason they don't all fit exactly the same - strange but not unheard of with pants. Easy to replace/repurchase but just wanted to mention :) DKNY jeans have consistently been great and have lasted through tons of use and washings, so I expect this ones will do the same. A great tip is to wash darker jeans inside out so the color stays longer (and in cold water!)","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XMZ6JWBYN7MQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U83MCSC#wasThisHelpful","R2XMZ6JWBYN7MQ","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We had been looking to try a tea like this for a while after reading some other reviews and product listings.  While we both thought the taste was pleasant, we didn't love this overall and won't be buying going forward.First - it says 14 days, however, the two of us have been drinking it daily for the last 3 days and it's nearly done. It really has about a weeks worth of product maximum. This would be ok if it was listed as a 7 day / 1 week package. I noticed some other people saying the same thing so I know we aren't just using too much. At $25, one week is just not enough. If it was a full 2 weeks that would be priced right.We haven't had any negative affects or anything but this just does ZERO for both of us. Not really much else to say. We would have happily tried this for the second week but there isn't enough product....Of course everyone will react to anything ingested differently and all experiences will be different but this just fell flat for us - would probably not recommend for the reasons above, and might try something from a known brand or at least with a larger amount to allow use for the full 2 weeks.Please note: This product was received at a discount for testing purposes. This review is 100% honest and unbiased. Thanks :)UPDATE on August 18: A few people contacted me to let me know about an apparent ""down vote campaign"" this morning  - I came on and was amazed to see just overnight ELEVEN more down votes, as well as similar numbers additionally on many other 1 and 2 star reviews. That this happens is quite unfortunate and hopefully sellers will see this actually hurts them too, and is not constructive for anyone. Buyers count on people leaving very honest reviews, good or bad, and look to see how issues are handled as well.First, any criticism is a GREAT opportunity to do two things - first, improve the product - isn't that what we would all ultimately want? If you love and care about what you sell, this is a great thing! Very honest people telling you how to make things better! It's a wonderful chance to improve things and possibly even change some people's minds :)Second, these large numbers of votes makes it painfully obvious to old and potential customers what is going on - it is a huge deterrent. People want to be able to be honest, good or bad and not be fearful of this happening. To reply with a friendly note asking how things can be made better and maybe an email to reach out to is GREAT customer service and shows potential buyers you really stand behind the product- encouraging them to buy. Just tons of down votes and even some harsh comments really gives out the wrong impression, sadly.I know not all people who leave low marks do it nicely, or even are helpful doing it. Certainly 3 words or an angry sentence is absolutely not helpful. But the people who take a lot of time and effort to test and report honestly and clearly/fairly/thoroughly are helpful in lots of ways, and the point of sales/review items/reviews is to bring honesty to not only buyers but the sellers too. I have absolutely updated and improved ratings before when great sellers took the time to listen and work on things. I'm saddened this is not happening here, but hopefully this post will maybe help for others to see it from our end.As always, all sellers are welcome to reach out to me anytime.

"These are good generic cartridges - they are NOT the same as OEM and not trying to be, but just be aware of this before you think you are getting the same thing. Generics have a high failure rate and you never really know if you're going to get great ones or end up with ink everywhere.We have had pretty good luck with generics over the past 6 years or so  -only had one fail, one leak, and a few issues with streaking etc that required some extra cleaning and reseating etc. There are so many complaints online though that I think we have been pretty lucky considering. These are so cheap though that even if you get a few lemons and some issues arise it really is not that big of a deal to toss them. I'd have a set on hand as extras all the time and be VERY careful when handling them.  Some extra clean cycles can usually help printing issues with colors/lines etc.At a little over $12 these are a good deal - we have had no issues with them and even with some problems as reported in other reviews, the cost is so low you can get some extras as backup.Please note: Product received at a discount for testing purposes.

"LOVE this scrub! I am a huge scrub person - have tried just about all of them on the market from drugstore brand to $80 luxury ones and everything in between. I do use a scrub approximately every other day, with a gentle ""touch"" - very important to let the scrub do the work and not rub too hard with your fingers. I prefer using them in the shower since they seem to be more effective on very wet, warm skin.TIP - try these on your elbows/knees, they really do work! Start with a small amount, mix with warm water and don't scrub too hard :)This is a very nice looking jar - looks more luxurious and expensive than it is which is always nice! Great packaging and colors.The grain is very small which I prefer and does not damage your skin - some of the larger grains are just too rough and can irritate or damage skin and possibly make thing worse. This is a soft and gentle scrub but still very effective. The most improvement has been with the texture and pore size appearance and these two things improved even a bit really makes a big difference in how it feels, looks and especially how makeup goes on. I'd suggest at least 3 time a week with this one, but really can use it daily if you are gentle and don't use too much. It also helps your products applied after absorb better so it's great to use at night then with a serum or night cream/treatment afterwards. I'd stay away from using hard medications or ingredients immediately after though.It is priced slightly higher than some similar items in this category, while it is definitely better than most drugstore brands ($8-$20 ish) I think the price point might be more reasonable at the $20 mark give or take. Also, I have to mention that the photo used on Amazon showing the before/after is CLEARLY Photoshopped - you are not going to remove all spots, marks ,wrinkles etc with this - hopefully they will remove this as it's just shady to do - the product is great and doesn't need that kind of bs.Please note: A jar was received at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. All thoughts are my own, always! :)  I would likely buy this product if the price was around $15 or so.All in all a really effective product that looks great on your counter and improves many skin issues with consistent use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12AZC6EY6QQX8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6TSCHE#wasThisHelpful","R12AZC6EY6QQX8","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The most adorable dog shirt we have seen in a while! LOVE this one, obviously a great message but the colors and logo are large, solid, of a great quality and seem like they will wash great down the line. For $12 it is a steal, it fit wonderfully and did not shrink much at all the first time we washed it.

"LOVE THESE SOCKS? Hold up amazingly well but have a nice softness to them, I would say they are medium to thick but not overly huge or bulky. They wash up great and hold their shape and quality (washing inside out is ideal.) DH puts them through the ringer and they really have done a great job in keeping him comfortable and cool. Our first set lasted about 2 years which is amazing with the use he puts them through. You may need 1/2 a size larger in your shoes depending on your fit and type of shoe (I do with mine, DH does not.)Price at around $12-$14 a pair is COMPLETELY WORTH IT. You get what you pay for, remember! You will not be replacing these every few months and wont deal with gross cotton anymore - blisters, smell and holes no more!

"I have had 3 or 4 smaller/thin portable charges since I prefer not adding weight to my purse - and I like being able to keep it in a little zippered small pocket. However, the power was just not enough for trips or long term frequent use or for when we have both / more than a few devices to charge. In comes this POWERHOUSE of a powerbank - at 15600mah! While we received this one at no cost in exchange for this review, all of our comments are 100% honest and our genuine feelings. :)LOOK:FEEL"" This is a BIG unit. It is a little heavy, but not out of control. It is a nice sleek black and white and is as good looking as a powerbank could possibly be :).  It is very well made, you can feel it the minute you open the box. This will not be failing or needing repair any time soon - and that is a great thing since these get used a ton.FUNCTION: This model provides around 6 full charges of an iphone 5s or 6, depending on phone obviously but regardless it's a very good amount of power. Really, 2-3+ full charges is more than enough for most people and even multiple people using it but for longer trips, or in situations where more people are using just one unit, it can really handle it. Using this is smooth and seamless, inputs are solid, no wiggling or delay or anything at all. My generic as well as branded cables all work with this perfectly.QUALITY: Its extremely well made - sturdy/strong and would likely withstand some bumping around / drops etc. It really is rugged and will last - great if you are sick of the smaller or ""cute"" ones working for a month then breaking .WEIGHT: Only down side is the weight - i'ts definitely not light- but with something of this power this is pretty much what you're going to get . It's a trade off but one that is worth it for many including us. I wouldn't suggest it for your every day purse, but in a duffle or suitcase, or in the car, or similar it's fine. Using this for larger needs and having a mini one in your purse or jacket/bag would be ideal.Overall a VERY powerful, solidly made product that is going to last and hold up to constant use. Responsive company as well - they really stand by their products which is an added bonus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AT3VJ5M3J3O7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q2EEMU2#wasThisHelpful","R3AT3VJ5M3J3O7","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've been buying all kinds of insoles and orthotics for a few years now in both male/female versions and both really like most of them - we have different needs (me - soft/cushy/supportive, him - work/pain/stress/arch support) and like to try anything we can! Note - the company provided a complimentary pair for testing purposes - these thoughts are 100% our own :)These Othotics by Vive at first feel VERY hard - we were very hesitant when they came out of the package but I had also read that some types of foot pain and issues actually are helped by a harder surface insole. DH uses these mainly in a work environment and me for walking an hour at a time. While I need a softer and thicker sole for long walking, he really likes them for work - say they are a great combination of supportive and comfortable but not huge or annoying like many orthotics can be. He uses these for the arch support, which if you don't have a great fit you can feel but he managed to get it just right and has no issues with that.The price is within the normal range of orthotics, and much better than the normal ones you will buy in most stores. They company honors a 180 warranty which is great, and shows they stand behind their products.

"I recently began to try some different glass protectors for the first time with my 5S and now 6 - was happily pleased with the performance (used the wed grippy tacky ones applied ones before and liked them, but they constantly came off around the home button.)With the glass ones this problem is solved! No coming up at the edges or where your fingers are, and no dents. Be careful applying - you really can't rip it off and apply it again once it's been stuck (if you have to, DON'T touch any part of the sticky part or you'll never get it clear again.)The only slight annoyance is that this really does kind of bother me is the overall width - all thin glass protectors for the 6 can't go all the way to the edge because of the curved screen unless it is not fully stuck on and traps some dirt -- It goes JUST up to the end of the viewable area, and can at times cause bit of a rainbow effect. However after a while this has stuck on great, no bubbles or cracks, no dirt or gunk trapped along the edges and no little scratches.I suspect this will stay looking new longer than all of the other kinds including the premium ""Nasa"" material ones I used to use. Glass protectors are the way to go unless you need complete edge to edge coverage - then you need a totally different type for the 6 - or you need really, really strong protection (like an Otter or LP waterproof) As long as you are not extremely clumsy or use your phone in high accident prone situations (construction etc.) this will work well for you.For most average users that are careful and rarely drop or drop indoors only, this is definitely sufficient to offer a layer of protection. It's clear very glossy/smooth, but does not have any problems registering your touch. Please note that the company provided me with a complimentary item for testing and and honest review, and these thoughts are 100% my own. Hope this helps!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKIAI7FVM4DFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S4XP8BQ#wasThisHelpful","RKIAI7FVM4DFX","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just what we needed - very sturdy, thick but not huge caribener for tons of keys and some USB sticks. This is a nice looking matte black one, very strong and easy to use, smooth opening and closing and really holds everything securely. Looks a lot nicer IMO with the matte finish but of course that is just preference.Great price too at only $7 ish.

"LOVE this shirt! On a constant quest for casual, everyday, lightweight but not flimsy and easily ripped shirts. The shape is great, a bit full but not baggy or too masculine looking for females. Nice deep V but with full coverage still, and nice sleeves a little on the longer side for great coverage. The dark blue (Tri indigo) is a GORGEOUS, deep, saturated blue color with a nice slight vintage finish 'look' to it which makes it a little nicer than just a plain color. It is so soft and comfortable but still a substantial shirt (not one of those light light light fly away ones.)Grabbed this one for about $14 which is a steal, I think normal price is around $25. Will update this review after a few months of washing and wearing. Will be getting more in other colors for sure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JBRZD6UTMJA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008LU7IR4#wasThisHelpful","R1JBRZD6UTMJA8","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok - this is a KICK A - - flashlight! We have a number of LED flashlights both for home and work use and use them all pretty much daily, so have a good amount of long term experience with a number of similar products. This is my daily at home one (but would be great for work purposes as well, it just is a little larger so best for our desk drawer which is huge.)The main deal here is that this is STRONG - do not shine it near anyone's eyes, for sure! It is NOT a weak little lightweight piece, and is much more sturdy and well made even than it looks in the picture. It is a little larger than many of the ones we have tried and seen, and that's totally fine for me it may be an issue if you have limited space or want something very compact. Really though that's the ONLY possible con I can think about this piece. It's really, really powerful and sturdy, and you will not have to replace this anytime soon. As with most items / electronics especially, even though there are tons of these on the market at all price ranges, when you want to keep something a lont time and plan to use it frequently - do not to cheap - those fail, are weak, and don't hold up too much.Yes, the price is slightly higher than some, but you are getting an extremely well made, sturdy, strong product with many features (I won't cut and past here, you can see the list above in the seller description :) If you need something very simple for a few times a year , then you can get by with something lightweight and cheap. But most households will use a flashlight pretty frequently, and this is really a good choice - not tiny so you wont lose it, really powerful so can use it outside too (backyard, camping, trips) and for all the household needs (back of dark closets, when fixing things, power outages etc.) The list is endless and this one will not fail you.Love the attached hand strap and this does come with the rechargeable batteries, charger, nice black box and an extra battery + a little bonus :)The cree LED chip is great -good, solid brand. and the zoom lens is a must - you may not use it all the time but its very handy to have!Overall, this is a really great product. It is worth the price ($60) as it really is a professional level item.  It would be overkill if you just want a little light sometimes here and there inside, but for any needs more than that this would be ideal The company did send a sample unit for testing and this is our completely unbiased, honest review. We took a long time to use and test this to make sure we gave very genuine and accurate comments!A few photos below - hope these help.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YZYO1LJJAK5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RCATDJA#wasThisHelpful","R2YZYO1LJJAK5C","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our householf was excited to test a few natural products from Puracy (all of our reviews are 100% honest and unbiased :) Over the past 6 months or so, we've been slowly changing our products over to clean/natural/organic. Definitely important to realize that you do give up some strength with these kinds of products - they won't be as effective for all uses/products due to the lack of harsh chemicals, but this is a good thing overall and the benefits far outweigh most of the things you give up. Of course there are times you just need something STRONG, but for the most part it's not that hard changing over.LOOK/SMELL: Very clean and fresh - like the other products this was pleasing to us all, had no afterscent lingering (other than just clean!) NO gunky buildup or stickiness - felt very natural as opposed to some with lots of chemicals. Again, love the clear, white, green very natural colors used - the packaging is just what you want to make you feel that you're using something safe around your house.EFFICIENCY: Good - for light/medium cleaning it really work nicely, and you do not have to use a ton. BUT -  I'd suggest going over yourself twice if you are really filthy or say were at the beach, work, etc. It is slightly less strong by nature and that's ok, but just be aware that you may need to adjust a little bit if you are facing a lot of grime.PRICE: $12 per 16 ounce bottle. Fair / average for natural products, will seem a bit high when comparing to some other brands. I think $10 might be the sweet spot, but you are defnitely getting a nice quality product for the money.TIP: Always use with a puff to get the most out of body wash :)OVERALL: Really enjoy these products and this brand. They work and are nice to look at and smell. Fairly priced for what you get and the company stands behind everything they sell / are very communicative. While a little bit of tweaking might be necessary here and there, I would definitely recommend these and have really enjoyed using them!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EEMWVOIITLGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T54VIB2#wasThisHelpful","R1EEMWVOIITLGF","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We were excited to test a few natural home products from Puracy (reviews are 100% honest and unbiased, always! :) as we have been slowly changing all our products over to clean/natural/organic over the past half a year. It's important to realize that you do give up some strength with these kinds of products - they won't be as effective for all uses/products due to the lack of harsh chemicals, but this is a good thing overall and the benefits far outweigh most of the things you give up. Of course there are times you just need something STRONG, but for the most part it's not that hard changing over. This detergent has been used in our home for about 4 weeks, a few loads a week - here's our take:LOOK/SMELL: Very clean and fresh - both how it looks and smells in the bottle and how it smells on laundry. No afterscent lingering, just clean, fresh clothes. This is a HUGE plus! Love the clear, white, green very natural colors used - the packaging is just what you want to make you feel that you're using something safe around your house.EFFICIENCY: Everything is definitely clean and smells fresh, but some of the whites and brights weren't QUITE as white or bright as we are used to - again, a lot of this is just the nature of natural products and really not an issue with this product itself. Just be aware you are giving this up along with the chemicals. For very dirty or stained clothes I would go with an oxygen bleach, hydrogen peroxide/vinegar solution, tide pen, and other stronger products but for a finishing wash and your normal dirty things this does do a good job. Minor spots came out but it defnitely isn't a tought stain remover.I do feel you have to use a bit more of any natural product but it IS concentrated so don't feel you have to use amounts from years ago - you will be using too much! Stay within the guildelines of the directions or at most a BIT more, but don't go crazy. I usually put in an extra pump with this one. It may be a placebo thing though - lol. This is a big bottle, and the pump is great but make sure to keep it clean or it can get gunky. I think it was re designed last year and we haven't had any issues with ours.PRICE: $16 for 96 loads really is a fair price for a natural detergent. You are getting a lot safer and cleaner product than the typical ones filled wiht chemicals and fillers.TIP: Use with wool dryer balls for a very soft finish, and an overall very natural process without nasty dryer sheets or an extra bottle of softener.OVERALL: Really enjoy these produts and this brand. They work and are nice to look at and smell. Fairly priced and the company stands behind everything they sell / are very communicative. Definitely recommend this detergent for all households!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KZHQ6NDNUASM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGLIZSE#wasThisHelpful","R1KZHQ6NDNUASM","A188LM8DXC5D09","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A188LM8DXC5D09?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Uncollected David Rakoff by David Rakoff is a highly recommended collection of his writing.This volume includes the entire text of ""Love, Dishonor, Marry, Die, Cherish, Perish,"" early fiction, memoir pieces, travel writing, essays, and reflections on life as a gay man, as well as transcripts of his memorable appearances on public radio's Fresh Air and This American Life. Rakoff was best known for his wit and humor, both of which are captured in this collection.As in most collections not every piece will strike a chord with everyone, but most readers are going to find a genuine connection to more than one of the pieces. For example, in ""The Love that Dare Not Squeak Its Name,"" Rakoff discussion about E.B. White's Stuart Little as a gay icon will likely be a hit for most readers, as will Love, Dishonor, Marry, Die, Cherish, Perish, Rakoff's novel written in verse. Themes of family and friendship are a common thread, along with life as a gay man.Obviously not being a gay man limits some of my emotional connection to all of the stories, but Rakoff's wit is evident and all of the contents are well written and enjoyable. Those who recall interviews with Rakoff on public radio will likely appreciate the transcribed pieces immensely. This is a collection that fans will likely want.Contents include:My Sister of Perpetual Mercy; Sagrada Família; My First New York: Arrived: 1982; An Open Letter to My Sisters; Goodbye to All of You; A Former Smoker Cheers; Diary, 1998; What’s Up, Dike?; The Wizards of Id; [Laura Bush]: The New York Times, Op-Ed; The Love That Dare Not Squeak Its Name; David Rakoff: Essayist, Mountaineer, “Comic Saint,” Fresh Air Interview; Fu Fighters; Evergreen Safari; Northern Composure; A Basket Case in North Carolina; Traveler’s Tale: A New Yorker Is Born; Walk This Way; I Like My Dog.

"After Alice by Gregory Maguire is a recommended rewrite of Lewis Carroll’s Alice's Adventures in Wonderland from a different point of view.This adventure in Wonderland features Ada, a friend of Alice, and Lydia, Alice's sister. Ada is trying to find Alice when she falls down the rabbit hole herself and, following in Alice's footsteps, she encounters the same inhabitants of Wonderland and a few new ones. While Ada is meeting and conversing with all manner of strange  creatures, Lydia is dealing with her own issues, including Miss Armstrong, the governess looking for Ada, and Siam, a boy visiting her father with Charles Darwin.This tale is decidedly written for adults who remember the classic tale and who can appreciate the word play involved in Wonderland and in the formal 19th century language. The action alternates between the two main characters, Ada and Lydia, and the two settings. Normally I don't need to look up the meaning of any words as I read, but Maguire threw in more than a few surprises for me here with the vocabulary. This might put some readers off when it is combined with the formal language in which After Alice is written.The quality of the writing is quite good, but the actual story is slow to unfold, and, for me, flipping back and forth between the two characters and settings wasn't quite as successful as it could have been. I ended up not really caring very much about what was going on with either character and kept reading simply to see how it would compare to the original and to see when Alice would show up.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Harper Collins for review purposes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BYSFTGWP1H38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060548959#wasThisHelpful","R2BYSFTGWP1H38","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mendocino Fire by Elizabeth Tallent is a very highly recommended collection of ten short stories.The stories capture relationships and lives during times of transformation with clarity and insight into the complicated emotional landscape of all relationships. Tallent explores relationships between genders, with an emphasis on female relationships, as well as broken marriages. Many of the stories deal with creative people, writers, artists, or ecological/environmental activists. Several are set on university campuses or have a tie in to academia. Almost all of the stories involve exes, severed relationships, struggling relationships. The emotions run high as we hear the inner thoughts of the characters struggling to make sense of their lives, actions, obsessions, and circumstances. Tallent describes lives that are messy, with emotional fallout and struggles.All of these stories are extremely well written with exceptionally descriptive prose and phrasing. There are several passages I marked to take note of in my advanced reading copy. Tallent manages to capture the inner thoughts of her characters and their feelings with a clarity of emotion that is complete and realistic, but with a poetic grace and beauty of wording that often belies the raw emotions being expressed.I don't know if the page numbers will be similar, but the acuity and mental pictures drawn from some of her descriptions is astonishing. For example: ""Tamped down love means not only sublimated energy but also a ranting, pointless impatience: before long, she's sick of obsession's two-lane Nebraska highway."" (pg 79)Or: ""It can't be true that she can't see in. That she can't know the story. This is her life she's been shut out of!""(pg. 97) And on the next page ""Divorce is not linear. One morning there is peace of mind, the next there is wrath.""Contents include:The Wrong Son - a young man in a working-class California fishing community has a complicated, combative relationship with his fatherTabriza - a man wonders if a valuable rug he dug out of the trash is evil and wreaking havoc on his third marriageMystery Caller - a woman places calls to her first husband but doesn't actually talk to himEros 101 - an female professor is obsessed/in love with her female studentNobody You Know - recently divorced woman travels halfway across the country and meets her ex's new, young wifeThe Wilderness - musings of an English professorNever Come Back - parents have their son's pregnant girlfriend and subsequent grandchild continue to live with them after the girlfriend takes offMendocino Fire - a young eco-activist grows up in an unconventional mannerNarrator -  a young female writer falls for an older famous male writerBriar Switch - a woman's father is dying from lung cancer and she's has to drive through a blizzard to get to himDisclosure: I received an advanced reading copy of this book from Harper Collins and TLC for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R57IDQLWRFVTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062410342#wasThisHelpful","R57IDQLWRFVTU","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kraken Rising by Greig Beck is a very highly recommended action-packed military-adventure-terror-thriller. It kept my total attention from the beginning to the end.We know several things from the opening chapters: a sub has been attacked by some huge, mysterious creature; Alex Hunter, the Arcadian, is still alive and working for the US military; an emergency beacon signal is being picked up by bases on Antarctica; and Chinese operatives have tried to capture Joshua, Alex's son and Aimee, his mother. This should tell all you action/adventure junkies that Kraken Rising will be an adrenaline-packed-thrill-ride of a novel.In 2008 a top secret US prototype submarine goes missing off the coast of Antarctica in the Southern Sandwich trench. The area is also known as the Southern Sea's Devil's Triangle. Thinking it was lost in a deep trench, the USA is surprised when the emergency locator beacon is discovered to now be sending a signal - a signal located deep underneath Antarctica. But the race is on because the Chinese, who have been illegally mining for precious minerals nearby have also heard the emergency beacon and are determined to claim the missing sub. Several different groups of soldiers with some scientists mixed in, are on the hunt and the situation is quickly turning political and the potential for an exchange of military fire is increasing exponentially. Alex Hunter, the Arcadian, is a super soldier. An experimental treatment after he was mortally wounded in a previous assignment has left him with super-human powers/skills, but he also has a dark side. Alex is sent in to find the sub on his own, but at the same time a team of HAWCs is also on the mission. Adding to the tension is the fact that Joshua's mother, petrobiologist Aimee Weir, is also on the mission since she has had previous experience dealing with the terrifying creature they must all now face.You really don't have to read any of the previous books to enjoy this one. I could swear I've read the first book in this series, the book which presents the first assignment in Antarctica, but although I kept remembering facts as I read this book, I couldn't find a review of it. Now it does resemble some other books set in the same geographical area with similar scenarios, so perhaps I was thinking of one of those books. Setting all that aside, I was totally engrossed in the story from beginning to end. Even though I think I read the first book, I know I haven't read any of the adventures in-between the first and this, the sixth, but still I had no trouble following the story.If you like skirmishes between super-human combatants and military novels with an element of sheer terror as both sides face the unknown as well as each other, Kraken Rising should make you happy. It's all about the action. I mean, come on, there's a kraken. This is a perfect stuck-over-night-at-the-airport book.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Pan Macmillian for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G2AHJREU69PR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011MQQYCI#wasThisHelpful","R3G2AHJREU69PR","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Homefront by Scott James Magner is a recommended science fiction novel set in the 27th century.The novel will hook you right at the start with the discussion of the Transgenic virus as learned about in a Congressional inquiry.  Then the action jumps to the future after the Transgenic virus has already mutated individuals and we meet Commander Jantine and her infiltration force of soldiers, scientists, and engineers on a suicide mission. They are all exiles from Earth's outer colonies.  Although they know they may not survive their mission, they are  part of a plan to establish a new, secret colony on Earth. The mods or gennies (modified or genetically altered humans) have divided themselves up into a cast system based on how altered they are from an unmutated human, with Alphas being the highest. Jantine is a Beta.At the same time, in alternating passages, we meet Lieutenant Mira Harlan of the System Defense Force. She is on a dreadnought outside of Earth's orbit and part of a clandestine fleet with a secret mission. When Jantine's ship inadvertently crashes into the dreadnought, it sets into motion another secret plan based on cargo the ship is carrying. This secret mission is a result of a conflict on Earth. Circumstances result in Harlan joining forces with Jantine's group.The quality of the writing in Homefront is great, but sometimes the presentation of the narrative could have been better. After being pulled in with a compelling opening scene, I was left struggling a bit with following all the characters and their different points of view at the beginning. I couldn't help but wonder if it could have been alleviated with some more background information on them right at the start rather than leaving it all for the reader to piece together. Sometimes it's cool to just give us clues and hints with a big reveal later, but sometimes it helps to have a bit more information to sort characters out from the start.Those who appreciate military conflicts or engagements in their science fiction are going to enjoy the action and combat scenes. There is some philosophical pondering on what makes us human, as well as questions on how family should be defined. There is telepathy between characters that reads like dream sequences, which can be a plus or minus depending upon the reader's feelings. This is likely the first book in a new series, The Transgenic Wars, because the ending suggests a continuation of the story.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Resurrection House for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IKN6J7ILPDNI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1630230030#wasThisHelpful","R1IKN6J7ILPDNI","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reef Libre: Cuba-The Last, Best Reefs in the World by Robert Wintner highlights the pristine and ecologically healthy and stable coral reefs of Cuba and begs the question ""What will happen to them when tourism returns to Cuba?"" The beautiful hardcover coffee table book includes a DVD. It is highly recommended.The 400 still photos in the book are varied and cover the amazing aquatic life around the reef, as well as photos of life in the cities and villages on Cuba. Winter, known as Snorkel Bob, has written Reef Libre as a tribute to Cuba's pristine coral reefs and the incredible diversity they contain. Cuba's coral reefs have benefited from Cuba's isolation from tourism and the aquarium trade. They are an ecological wonder and the biodiversity is evident. Wintner makes his case in the text that we need to help Cuba keep their coral reef as a national treasure and protect it from being ruined simply for economic gain. That is a tough battle for a poverty stricken country.Reef Libre was not written as a travelogue, although it does serve that purpose with the wide variety of photos not of the reef and the marine life. It is organized in the following chapters:Reef Libre; Cayo Largo; Cuba Hoy; Jardines De La Reina; Tengo Dos; Night in Havana!; Political Reefs; Are You Now or Have You Ever Been...; The Older Man and The Sea; Finito, For Now; About the Cover; About the Author; Index. (As is my wont, I'm always thrilled to see an index.)The text in the book and the dialogue in the DVD are written/spoken in a conversational style, although the continuity is a bit disjointed at times. While the goal is to showcase what Cuba has done right, it is also a dire warning about what can happen if this ecological wonder is allowed to be destroyed for economic gain. Right now the aquarium trade is nonexistant there. It could devastate the ecology if it is allowed.While the book is very nice, you will want to watch the DVD, trust me on that fact. The YouTube video of Reef Libre will give you a small taste of the DVD. I watched the DVD with a young friend and he was entranced by the underwater scenes. He kept asking ""Is that real!"" The scenes are mesmerizing. All the marine life is labeled so you can see the name of the species of fish, etc. And did I mention the video is extraordinary? I will also admit right now that we were talking and oohing and awing over the photography so we missed much of the dialogue the first time through. And, I probably need to admit that we fast forwarded over the island scenes to get back to the underwater shots - except for the sea turtle beach on land - during the first viewing. (After viewing the DVD later, the dialogue is very similar to the text in the book and contains the same message and warning.)Disclosure: I received a copy of this book for review purposes.YouTube video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7Lm6h3lOe0","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA510ZQELQTSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1630760730#wasThisHelpful","RA510ZQELQTSQ","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Children of the Comet by Donald Moffit is a highly recommended science fiction story set six billion years in the future.This novel covers two different sets of human until they meet. The first group has been colonizing a tree growing on a comet in the The Oort Cloud and is now a primitive society who have adapted to life on their tree/comet. Torris is a young man who must climb the Great Tree on his dream/vision quest.The second set of humans is on a space ship colonizing the solar system after beings known as the First Ones forced the human race to leave the Milky Way. Humans have developed the Higgs boso drive, though, so they are able to travel near light speed. The ship Time's Beginning was launched from the USA and after seeding several colonies there are two factions that want to control the ship. One wants to go back to Earth's solar system and settle near it while the other wants to head for the end of the universe.The opening quote explains growing trees on comets:""How high can a tree on a comet grow? The answer is surprising. On any celestial body whose diameter is of the order of ten miles or less, the force of gravity is so weak that a tree can grow infinitely high. Ordinary wood is strong enough to lift its own weight to an arbitrary distance from the center of gravity. This means that from a comet of ten-mile diameter, trees can grow out for hundreds of miles, collecting the energy of sunlight from an area thousands of times as large as the area of the comet itself. Countless millions of comets are out there, amply supplied with water, carbon, and nitrogen - the basic constituents of living cells. They lack only two essential requirements for human settlement, namely warmth and air. And now biological engineering will come to our rescue. We shall learn how to grow trees on comets. - Freeman Dyson""I enjoyed Children of the Comet. Donald Moffit (1931- 2014) wrote two of my favorite science fiction novels and so I am predisposed to enjoy this, his final novel. While I can see that Children of the Comet needed some more work (and kept reminding me of Niven's The Integral Trees), I did find it an interesting premise and a satisfying story. The comet/tree civilization is far more intriguing than the spaceship crew and their politics so I did wish that more time was spent with them. There are also a few characters that are added in the middle of the book that should have been present right at the start, which is another clue that the novel was a work in progress.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Open Road Intergrated Media for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26PDMWUXF2LCI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VL0WCQ8#wasThisHelpful","R26PDMWUXF2LCI","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sexploitation by Cindy Pierce is a highly recommended look at how the current generation of young people is influenced by the porn culture surrounding them.  Teens, as well as much younger children, today have a vast amount of junk/porn grabbing for their attention via the internet and social media. The overriding problem is that in this hyper-connected age in which we live our children are often failing to establish a healthy, well-grounded view of sex and relationships.The book has the following chapters: 1. Inner Compass; 2. Umplugging; 3. Porn Culture: 4. Sexuality Education for Young Kids; 5. Sexuality Education for Older Kids and teens; 6. Worthy Girls; 7. Empowering Girls; 8. Worthy Boys; 9. Setting Boys Free; 10. A Hookup Culture Fueled by Alcohol; 11. Moving Beyond Hookups. This is followed by a conclusion, and much to my delight, references, and an index.Pierce points out that ""Unfortunately, the number and type of influences young people are managing in the digital age make it more challenging for them to listen to their inner compass. Many young people have a hard time making the distinction between what they value and what they think they should value, based on what they see online and in social media."" All of us are complicated, multidimensional beings with flaws. One of the problems is that the prevalence of social media as a way for kids to communicate with each other presents them with a bad venue for an accurate portrayal. Parents make a horrible mistake when they surrender to their kids obsession with screen time. It was pointed out that teens should think of what they ""put out online as a tattoo. It is that permanent."" Wise advice for everyone.Just look at how everyone, but especially teens, looks at their phone all the time now. If one person pulls out their phone, everyone does. It has become how kids (and increasingly adults) interact with each other instead of face to face. This is a mistake of vast proportions. Social media cannot capture subtle body language, irony, joking. Small things can be blown out of proportion. Inappropriate pictures or conversations can be started and shared. Pierce points out that she and her husband have a rule that computers and phones stay downstairs and out of the kids’ rooms. It is a practice that has been recommendation by their school and many other parents also employ it.Pierce notes that ""These days, kids are constantly being reminded to avoid bystander apathy. Parents, educators, and coaches talk to them about how they should stand up to bullying, hazing, homophobia, racism, and cruelty. But it’s unrealistic to expect most kids to immediately muster the strength and risk social rejection by calling peers out. They need practice speaking up on small issues (litter, disrespectful language, meanness, intimidation) in material; order to develop the courage to stand up when the stakes are higher (sexual assault, hazing, DUI)."" Isn't that the truth!While porn is often found, and easily accessible, online, it is also in advertisements, music videos, and video games. the prevalence of pornographic images has desensitized us as a society. ""Porn can be an obstacle that prevents kids from developing healthy ideas about sex for a number of reasons: while porn objectifies both men and women, most of what is viewed degrades women, reinforces role expectations, desensitizes the viewer to violent sexual behavior, creates expectations about how bodies appear and respond, and skews overall sexual expectations. Rather than trying to stop the porn industry, my aim is to material; inspire parents to have open conversations with their kids about porn.""Pierce covers information vital for parents to open up the discussion about sexuality with girls and boys. She does a nice job of discussing ways to keep communication open and how to approach the first ""talk,"" which should be followed by many more as children grow and mature. She shares lots of research findings as well as personal stories and anecdotes while getting a vital message across.While, as the parent of adult children, I didn't quite agree with every single thing Pierce shared, she did present some startling facts and plenty of good, practical information. This book is easy to read and well organized so the chapters flow nicely and logically from one topic to the next. It does not present any morale-based ideas or religious views that some families would also consider a vital part of any life-training talks. I'd highly recommend it.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Bibliomotion for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL13Q6UJTRUDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629560898#wasThisHelpful","RL13Q6UJTRUDT","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here Comes the Dreamer by Carole Giangrande is a very highly recommended, poignant, heartbreaking novella.The story unfolds through three different narrators. First, house painter and artist Alastair Luce, who is married to the mercurial and abusive Nora, worries about his beloved daughter, Grace, and Nora's treatment of her. We know from the opening that Nora will leave him, in fact that she already had in every way but officially even before the incident. The incident is a tragic accident, that taints Alastair's life and makes it one full of sorrow, depression, disappointments, and regret, but also, after a season, one of quiet acceptance and forgiveness.Claire is a teenage neighbor and friend to Grace who accepts a ride from Alastair and is present when the accident takes place. She has a crush on him as a teen, but is also friends with Grace, and recognizes the artistic talent Grace inherited from her father. Claire keeps in touch with Alastair and, later Grace. Claire is the witness to the disintegrating family and the one voice that gives the tragedy clarity and shape. She also has blame unfairly cast in her direction simply because she was present at the accident. We are witnesses to the dysfunctional dynamics in Claire's family too, but it is clear that she was better able to endure it and her parents were never abusive or dismissive.The final narrator is Grace, who has inherited her father's love of color and knows he loves her. At the same time she knows her abusive mother never loved or tried to understand her. Grace is an adult in her section, successful in her societal fringe environment and role. However, she has never come to terms with her mother's rejection and abuse of her and still blames Claire, the one consistent friend she's had, for her father's accident.. She has become adept at wounding people who care with her words to keep them at a distance.The writing is incredible - Giangrande's ability to capture emotions in a descriptive way is phenomenal. She also does an excellent job developing her characters through their own words as well as the viewpoints of others. Alastair's voice is melancholy, resigned to his place, forgiving. Claire's voice is a clarion call to pay attention and not judge too harshly, but look at the circumstances, the facts, the truth. She is asking for some empathy and understanding. Grace's voice is full of pain, blame, and self-preservation, with a tint of mental illness just under the surface - or is it artistic genius? An excellent book that will make you think.Here are three quotes I noted as an example of the writing:""Trouble came to Alastair Luce like a nasty slap of a wave at high tide, one wave after another. He'd been happy at times, but happiness was a breaker and it crashed and broke on the hard rock of the unexpected. Sorrow was no different."" opening""Times were good and one neighbour bought a Chrysler with vast, gull-like fins. Soon there were more in the neighbourhood, as if the first one had laid eggs and hatched a flock."" (pg. 7)""For some reasons unknown to me, Betty-Ann [Claire's sister] was frantic to build a home of human timber, to disassemble her family limb from limb as if we were there to warm her, nothing more.""

"Saturn Run by John Sandford, and Ctein is a recommended political thriller in a sci-fi setting.It is 2066 and a spaceship is detected by Saturn. Obviously, there are many government meetings and President Amanda Santeros wants to send a mission there to investigate, and, hopefully, capture the technology. In a plan to keep the Chinese from knowing, only a few members of the mission are really told where they are going and why - in the ship named the Richard M. Nixon. The Chinese discover the real reason for the US launch and they plan their own, competing mission to Saturn.Despite an exciting premise and the fact that I enjoy science fiction, I really found it a challenge to get into this novel. There is plenty of technical science for those of us who like some science with our science fiction, but in this case it felt more like information dumps rather than science included in the fictional story. That combined with the abundance of international intrigue and espionage and characters I didn't really care for.  I'm not disappointed that I read it, but it did seem to be bogged down in details with little plot advancement. The three stars are because it is well written, but it suffered in comparison to the next sci-fi book I read which had a much more satisfying plot and better characters.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Penguin for review purposes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA4CHGMSJDHK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00USMCJX6#wasThisHelpful","RA4CHGMSJDHK","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everything She Forgot by Lisa Ballantyne is a highly recommended character study of love and redemption set in two time periods.In 2013 Margaret Holloway is driving home on icy, snowy roads when she finds herself in a huge multi-car pile-up. Margaret is stuck in her car and unable to get out. When she smells gas and realizes her car is on fire, Margaret is sure she is going to die. Then, out of nowhere, a man comes and tries to help her escape. He hurts his hand when breaking her window, but manages to get her out of the car. Then he seemingly disappears in the melee surrounding the huge accident.After the accident, Margaret finds herself unable to concentrate. She is having flashbacks to the crash and strangely remembering things from her childhood that she thought she had forgotten, or repressed. She also finds herself drawn to find and sit in the hospital at the bedside of the man who saved her. She learns his name is Maxwell Brown and that he's had no other visitors.Alternating chapters are set in 1982. Big George McLaughlin was born into a family of gangsters but he just wants to get back together with his first girlfriend and help raise his daughter, Molly, away from his family. When he meets Molly, now age 7, on her way to school, he ends up unwittingly abducting her. We also learn of George's childhood. While the two are on the run and bonding, a strange reporter named Angus Campbell is trying to figure out who abducted Molly and make a name for himself.The present day story is told through Margaret's point of view, while the story set in 1985 is told through multiple points of view, although mainly through George and Angus.I was looking forward to reading Everything She Forgot after reading The Guilty One and I wasn't disappointed. Although it is being described as a mystery, it is really more of a character study. While there is a mystery, much of it will be easily discerned early on by most readers. There are several surprises, though, that you won't figure out beforehand. What will compel you to keep reading is the quality of the writing, the answers to a few nagging questions, and the emotional connection you will feel for Margaret and George.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of HarperCollins for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22ERDZQVJ28ER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SG1ELOG#wasThisHelpful","R22ERDZQVJ28ER","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Atlas of Cursed Places: A Travel Guide to Dangerous and Frightful Destinations by Olivier Le Carrer is a compelling, engaging volume that shares the history and insight into 40 different cursed locations across the world.Le Carrer points out in the introduction that not all places are cursed in the same way. Obviously, the first meaning is close to the original meaning of the word and based on the mystical, paranormal, or supernatural. The second group of cursed places is based on natural reasons that make the area blighted and present a danger. The third category consists of places that have been rendered inhabitable by human activity. All of the 40 cursed places discussed are organized into 8 different regions. This attractive and entertaining atlas includes vintage maps and illustrations.Much to my surprise and chagrin, one of the cursed places is relatively near where I currently live and is reputed to be the gateway to hell.The contents include:At The Heart of Old EuropeChateau De Montsegur - Satan's SynagogueRocca-Sparviera - The Phantom VillageNuremberg - The Sinister Reverberation of Marching BootsBetween the Mediterranean World and Southern AfricaThe Tophet of Carthage - Children Burned for the GodsOumaradi - Shipwrecked by SandsPoveglia - The Island of DeathCharybdis and Scylla - A High-Risk CruiseKasanka National Park - The Invasion of the BatsValley of the Kings - The Curse of AtenGaza - A Territory AdriftBeirut - Destruction and ConstructionMoriah and Golgotha - Spiritual NightmaresKibera - An Uncharted CesspoolFrom the Barents Sea to the Indian OceanZapadnaya Litsa - The Antechamber of HellGulf of Aden - Hunting Ground of PiratesGur-Emir - The Malevolent MausoleumThilafushi - The Toxic LagoonAround the Bay of BengalJharia - Underground InfernoJatinga - A Plague of BirdsSunda Strait - The Monster of KrakatoaBetween the Orient and OceaniaHoutman Abrolhos - Massacre of the ShipwreckedAokigahara - The Suicide ForestCape York - In the Land of the Killer CrocodilesTakuu - An Atoll Living on Borrowed TimeNauru - Blighted by PhosphateAmerica From Coast to CoastMavericks: The Big Wave - A Cold-Blooded MonsterNevada Triangle - A Danger in the SkyStull, Kansas - The Forbidden CemeteryTonina - The Mystery of the MayasAdams, Tennessee - The Bell Witch Lives OnPine Barrens - The Devil's OffspringAmityville - the Devil's LairAmong the Islands of the New WorldCite Soleil - All the Misfortune on EarthCape Horn - Sailor's NightmareBermuda Triangle - Empire of EnigmasSable Island - A Ship Trap in the AtlanticBeneath the Atlantic BreezeCumbre Vieja - Birthplace of the TsunamiEilean Mor - Lighthouse MysteryYeun Ellez - The Marsh of the DamnedTiffauges - Castle of a KillerDisclosure: My digital edition was courtesy of Black Dog & Leventhal for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C40BLVVFC34W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631910000#wasThisHelpful","R1C40BLVVFC34W","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pretty Girls by Karin Slaughter is a very highly recommended thriller. This nail-biter is tense, gritty, and very disturbing. Oh, and just when you think you know what is going to happen, trust me, you don't.In 1991 nineteen year old Julia Carroll vanished and her disappearance changed the dynamics of her surviving family members. Sam, her father and a veterinarian, writes journal entries addressing his missing daughter and the lengths he takes to search for her. Helen, her mother and a librarian, divorces Sam, and starts drinking. Her two sisters, Claire and Lydia, have been estranged for years and still miss their older sister.Claire is married to Atlanta architect and millionaire Paul Scott. Because of Paul's influence and connections, Claire has gotten off with a light punishment for an incident on the tennis court. When the couple meets for a night out after her ankle bracelet is removed, the couple is robbed and Paul is fatally stabbed. Then, right after the funeral, Claire returns home to a yard full of police because her home was broken into. Then, while trying to find the computer files Paul's partner needs for a meeting, Claire stumbles onto some horrific videos. And then some meticulous files that Paul has kept.Lydia Delgado was the bad girl years ago, when Julia was live, and her life continued to spiral downward until she was going to have her child and had to clean up her act. Now clean and sober, she is the single mother to a teenage daughter, Dee, and in a relationship with Rick, her neighbor, mechanic, and also now clean, sober and law-abiding. Before she had Dee, Paul, Claire's husband tried to rape her. Claire chose to believe Paul, which caused the estrangement.The two meet again when current circumstances have sent Claire to try and find her remaining sister. She now believes that Lydia may have been telling the truth. The two still share a bond between them, but don't totally trust each other. They are also forced to face some very chilling, horrific facts that may lead them to finding the answer to the question of what happened to Julia, as well as other missing girls.Slaughter alternates each chapter between the sister's point of view and Sam's journal entries. She keeps the pace very steady and the tension ratchets up with each new piece of information. I thought I had the plot all figured out just before the half way point in this novel. I was totally wrong. Suddenly I was left  with my mouth hanging open and my heart racing. Then the novel really took off and the tension was intense.The writing is excellent and the characters are all well developed. There are a few details that you will likely have to stretch you incredulity over, but I thought it was easy to accept the information as fact and get on with the story. This novel is not for the meek. It is at times gruesome, horrific, maddening, and disturbing. There is language. But it is also a very, very good thriller that will keep you up late at nights reading - with the lights on and the windows and doors all locked.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of HarperCollins for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UOIRGN4EXIML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062429051#wasThisHelpful","R2UOIRGN4EXIML","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Years in the making, this set represents a monumental endeavor and fitting tribute to Primo Levy.

In doing so, they will discover a writer they may not have known, one whom Italo Calvino called among 'the most important and gifted writers of our time.'""

"The Heart Goes Last by Margaret Atwood is very highly recommended, brilliant surrealistic dystopian novel which will likely be banned somewhere in the future for any number of hot topics it contains. I can't help but think that the release was purposefully planned to be during this week, banned book week.Charmaine and Stan are a young couple who have lost their jobs and their house. They are lucky they have a car to live in and escape from those who aren't so fortunate and might have larceny or worse on their minds. Charmaine is working as a bartender to make a little money for the two. When Charlene sees an ad by Positron for Consilience, a city with jobs and security, she and Stan decide to check it out. The deal is it is a closed system and you sign up for life.The set up for  Consilience/Positron is based on a contained population/workforce that shares prison/town duties. ""Medium-size towns with large penitentiaries could maintain themselves, and the people inside such towns could live in middle-class comfort. And if every citizen were either a guard or a prisoner, the result would be full employment: half would be prisoners, the other half would be engaged in the business of tending the prisoners in some way or other. Or tending those who tended them. And since it was unrealistic to expect certified criminality from 50 percent of the population, the fair thing would be for everyone to take turns: one month in, one month out. Think of the savings, with every dwelling serving two sets of residents! It was time-share taken to its logical conclusion. Hence the twin town of Consilience/Positron.""There is no homelessness, everyone is employed, and the profits go to keeping the system running and everyone happy. Charmaine and Stan are satisfied, for a while, but soon they seem to be feeling some discontent with their carefully planned lives, especially when they become obsessed with the couple who live in their house on alternate months. Their separate sexual involvement with this couple sets them up as pawns to be involved in a complex scheme.Atwood's writing is astute, exceptional, and clever. The story is innovative and absurd. Above all else, The Heart Goes Last is entertaining, even as it incorporates and questions many societal controversies in the plot. And I am talking about the kind of controversies that keep talk shows on the air and set blogs burning. There is adult language and sex, which seems to bother many, but perceptive readers are going to see the social commentary underneath the farce-like situations and satire.My review copy was courtesy of Knopf Doubleday for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OFFWI6AY4REW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385540353#wasThisHelpful","R2OFFWI6AY4REW","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not on Fire, but Burning by Greg Hrbek is a highly recommended genre twisting novel. It is part sci-fi, part thriller, part speculative dystopia and opens with a bang that should capture every reader's attention.Skylar, a 20 year old college student, is babysitting when the incident happens. When she looks out of the picture window she sees a bright metallic object hit the Golden Gate Bridge. A mushroom cloud forms above San Francisco and radioactive fallout is everywhere. Skylar starts walking to try and get out and to her parents where she knows her beloved little brother, Dorian, is safe. No one knows what the object was, but some say the words ""Air Arabia"" could be seen on the object.Years later Dorian is 12 and knows two things: he misses his sister and hates all Muslims. He is having dreams about a sister that seemingly never existed. She is not in photos. His parents say she didn't exist. Dorian knows she did because his dreams/visions about her are so real. He also dreams about killing Muslims.In this future America, the country is divided into territories and all Muslims have been interned in the Dakotas, where the former inhabitants have been relocated. When the neighbor, a veteran from Gulf War III adopts Karim, a Muslim orphan from the internment camps and brings him to the neighborhood, introducing him to the neighborhood boys, trouble is bound to happen. Racial slurs slip out and prejudices are revealed, on both sides. Fear and grievances continue to multiply and build up between the Arab and Americans. Is the hatred and fear the two groups hold for each other real or the result of prejudices or incomplete information?In Not on Fire, but Burning Hrbek has penned a well-written, thoughtful novel with a social conscious. The prose and insight into the psyche of each character is carefully crafted as each of them struggle with societal expectations, their own emotions, and the reality. The result is a multilayered novel that transcends genre. The one drawback for me is the switch between first and third person in the narrative. I found it disconcerting and this threw me off kilter for a good portion of the book. Since I had an advanced reading copy the transitions may be better noted or delineated in the final version.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Melville House for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DZHKIW9GVS89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612194532#wasThisHelpful","R3DZHKIW9GVS89","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Leaving Montana by Thomas Whaley is a highly recommended novel about an adult child who survived a highly dysfunctional childhood.Benjamin Sean Quinn is a forty year old man who, from all outward appearances, has a perfect life. He and his partner of 14 years have 2 daughters. They live in a well-appointed home in a prestigious neighborhood. But Ben is ""as angry as hell. Angry to the core."" In Leaving Montana he has chosen to confront once and for all the messiness that was his childhood and the hidden secrets it holds in an attempt to rid his life of the anger.Ben tells the story of his childhood with battling parents Carmella and Sean while going on his current day trip to Montana. His parents are always referred to by their surnames, never an affectionate mom and dad.  Most certainly we know that his childhood is the root of his anger, but there are more secrets to be uncovered. The story of his parents' marriage is heart breaking, but so is the anger that Ben has held on to for far too long. Ben is an arrogant man, but freely admits his flaws and is able to laugh at them.This is a well written novel written in first person about dysfunctional, embattled families and secrets. The big secret here was one I suspected almost immediately, but the enjoyment was in the journey.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Sakura Publishing for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BDRTDYKDB5JF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MCB1HPM#wasThisHelpful","R1BDRTDYKDB5JF","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It has shortened many lives, probably my own, but is a life of rice cakes really life, or just passing time?"" Bragg is a master at telling stories and I was totally entranced through every one (except, begging your forgiveness, the football stories.)In the introduction Bragg write: ""I hope you enjoy these stories, but more than that I hope you see value in the people whose lives are pressed between these pages. I have been told, a thousand times or more by kind people, that it can be like looking in a mirror, looking at people, places, and things that are more than familiar, and at feelings that seem lifted from their own hope chests, sock drawers, recipe books, and family secrets. Maybe that is what writers mean, when they talk about a sense of place.""He really does succeed in creating a sense of place and describing his southern journey with humor, charm, and reflection. Bragg also notes in the introduction: ""It suits me, here. My people tell their stories of vast red fields and bitter turnip greens and harsh white whiskey like they are rocking in some invisible chair, smooth and easy even in the terrible parts, because the past has already done its worst. The joys of this Southern life, we polish like old silver. We are good at stories. We hoard them, like an old woman in a room full of boxes, but now and then we pull out our best, and spread them out like dinner on the ground. We talk of the bad year the cotton didn’t open, and the day my cousin Wanda was Washed in the Blood. We cherish the past. We buff our beloved ancestors till they are smooth of sin, and give our scoundrels a hard shake, though sometimes we cannot remember exactly which is who.""How can you not appreciate the flow of descriptive phrases there and hear the Southern accents gently visiting and sharing the many stories collected over a lifetime. There were so many descriptions I took note of or laughed at, or agreed with the sentiment. How about driving on a long road trip ""with two states behind me and a thousand miles to go, scanning a radio thick with yammering bullies whose mamas did not love them enough."" I am putting everyone on notice. I am going to use that turn of phrase, ""yammering bullies whose mamas did not love them enough.""And I am in the Amen section concerning allowing kids to play in a good mud hole. ""The children start school now in August. They say it has to do with air-conditioning, but I know sadism when I see it. I think a bunch of people who were not allowed to stomp in a mud hole when they were young - who were never allowed to hold translucent tadpoles in their hands and watch their hearts move - decided to make sure that no child would ever have the necessary time to contemplate a grand mud hole ever again."" My own children did not have the good red dirt, but they did have mud holes over several years and states they could lay claim to. As for my childhood, my mother was also known for her use of bleach.While laughing I also completely understood the sentiment when Bragg commented that ""I knew, the day I saw my first pair of skinny jeans on a man, that I no longer have any place in this world, and should probably just go live by myself in a hole in the ground."" ""But there is no designer on this planet who has ever fashioned a garment with me in mind... and the camo rack at the Walmart does not count.""As a final note Bragg contemplates Southern literature: ""Scholars have long debated the defining element of great Southern literature. Is it a sense of place? Fealty to lost causes? A struggle to transcend the boundaries of class and race? No. According to the experts, it’s all about a mule. And not just any old mule - only the dead ones count. Ask the experts.""Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Oxmoor House for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17TGEB2AETW66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0848746392#wasThisHelpful","R17TGEB2AETW66","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Her Final Breath by Robert Dugoni is a very highly recommended police procedural. Homicide detective Tracy Crosswhite, who we were first introduced to in My Sister's Grave, is back with the Seattle Police Department's Violent Crime Squad and on a new investigation.When a dancer at a strip club is found strangled in a motel room, the case bears an uncanny resemblance to a previous murder of a dancer. In the previous case, Tracy's boss, Captain Johnny Nolasco, relegated it to the cold case files after only a month in an attempt to make Tracy look bad. The ongoing public outcry did nothing to help public relations. Tracy is even left a noose, which could be a message about the case or it may mean she is a personal target for someone.Now, after this second girl turns up dead, it is clear that a serial killer is on the loose. It appears he is targeting strippers and leaving their bodies in cheap motel rooms. He has been nicknamed ""The Cowboy"" because of his sadistic bondage method using rope. He hogties his victims with a noose around their necks, resulting in the victims eventually strangling themselves.Tracy is leading the task force to find the killer. Even as her team is following leads and trying to find the killer before another victim is chosen, her boss, Nolasco, is still out to see her fail. Tracy realizes that these new murders resemble one from 9 years earlier, one Nolasco and his partner handled. The suspected killer was convicted and is still incarcerated, but Tracy pulls up the file and secretly has her boyfriend, lawyer Dan O’Leary, investigate the case.It always nice to see strong, well-written female leads and Tracy Crosswhite fits that description. Dugoni has done an excellent job with character development, bringing Tracy to life. Even more importantly, Dugoni has done an exceptional job in plot development too. Her Final Breath is a police procedural/mystery that kept me totally engaged from beginning to end and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. I'll be looking forward to the next Tracy Crosswhite novel.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Thomas & Mercer for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVC2CNGM11DMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEFTA80#wasThisHelpful","RVC2CNGM11DMG","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Waiting on God: What to Do When God Does Nothing is a highly recommended combination Bible Study on the life of Joseph with anecdotal personal insights and applications by Wayne Stiles.Sometimes God seems silent or absent in our lives and going to the Bible to study and consider the life of Joseph presents a perfect example of waiting on God for years. We can be confused as to why God hasn't answered our prayers, but God's answer often requires a more active role from us rather than just waiting for our circumstances to change. Stiles points out that God may be waiting for us to change - and our circumstances may even worsen while He patiently waits for us to make those changes. We need patience too. Patience is the art of waiting well.Hard times and difficulties are normal. God's people were never promised a trouble free life and Joseph's life is a perfect example to consider. God does make promises to believers, but there are lessons we may need to learn in the in-between time of waiting. God never said we wouldn't have troubles. In fact, we should expect trouble and difficulties (1 Thess. 3:3–4; 1 John 3:13; 1 Peter 4:12) as a normal part of our lives... along with waiting.Here Stiles goes through the life of Joseph and considers his life (as well as the lives of his family) in comparison to things and circumstances we might go through today. Stiles uses many personal examples to make the story more pertinent to lives today and help readers see how Joseph's story is applicable to their lives, their personal stories. This isn't really a devotional or a Bible study, per se, but a study of one story and how it can be interpreted to encourage, help, and challenge us in our Christian walk today.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Baker Books for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UBVD6668UN9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMSCMCS#wasThisHelpful","R2UBVD6668UN9E","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"X by Sue Grafton is a very highly recommended 24th book in the series featuring private investigator Kinsey Millhone. I've read almost all the books in the series with the exception of the ones published in the last couple of years. It was great to have my memory jump-started on why I originally liked the character of Kinsey Millhone so much. A large part of that enjoyment is due to accomplished writer Sue Grafton's ability to present a complex plot and bring it to such a satisfying conclusion. Even if this is your first introduction to the series and the characters, I think you are going to enjoy X.In a change of pace, the titular ""X"" stands alone. It could stand for several characters or words in this novel set in 1989 in Santa Teresa, CA. There is a drought and landlord Henry Pitts is busy trying to get their water consumption under control. Kinsey has met with a client, Hallie Bettancourt, who wanted her to find the contact information for Christian Satterfield. He's recently been released from prison. Hallie claims he is the son she gave up for adoption at age 15. Kinsey easily finds out the information only to discover, after she's passed it on, that Hallie is not a real person and she's paid for Kinsey's services with marked $100 bills.At the same time she is trying to help her friend Ruthie Wolinsky go through a box of paperwork/files of her late husband to find some files for the IRS. Pete Wolinsky was also a PI and was shot during a robbery a year ago. Kinsey is sure he was crooked, but she likes Ruthie, so she is trying to help her. While going through the files she discovers a false bottom in the box that contains an envelope addressed to someone else and in the files a sheet of paper written in code. Kinsey inevitably ends up trying to finish/solve the case the Pete was working on before his death, which becomes much more dangerous that she ever would have imagined.This makes it sound simple, but everything going on in Kinsey's life is always much more complex than the initial situation would suggest.Sue Grafton is an exceptional writer. Not only does she provide us with another complex plot and several cases to solve, she imbibes the character of Kinsey with wry humor and insight into human behavior. This is a win/win situation: great writing and plot. Now that I have been reminded about how good this series really is, I need to go back and get the (few) letters I missed in the alphabet series.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Penguin for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZH8FF846TN5N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY3ZKJA#wasThisHelpful","R2ZH8FF846TN5N","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thug Notes: A Street-Smart Guide to Classic Literature by Sparky Sweets, PhD is CliffsNotes and SparkNotes written in gangsta. With a wise-cracking street sensibility, it breaks down the plots and analyzes 16 literary classics. The titles analyzed include: Romeo and Juliet, To Kill a Mockingbird. Pride and Prejudice, The Great Gatsby, Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus, Invisible Man, Lord of the Flies, Moby Dick, A Raisin in the Sun. Hamlet, Fahrenheit 451, The Catcher in the Rye, Crime and Punishment, Things Fall Apart, The Color Purple, and The Scarlet Letter. There is also a Bibliography.What you need to know is that Thug Notes began as a humorous online series presented by Sparky Sweets, PhD, and Wisecrack. Sparky Sweets, PhD, is comedian, writer, and actor Greg Edwards. The videos of this series have been used in classrooms to try to make classic literature accessible, which lead to this written guide. The guide does a good job breaking the selections down to the essential basics. He begins by introducing characters, and then does a walk-through analysis of the plot. Included are important themes, symbolism, and passages. But keep in mind all of this is written in ""thug"" or street language.I, personally, struggled with reading the actual guide because of the language and phonetic spelling used in the conversational gangsta-street-talk-style. I think I can follow the videos easier than the written guide. (Some of my struggle also involved a technical issue with how the review copy interfaced with the eReader program I use on my tablet.)While I think Thug Notes has its place and could be beneficial, I'm having a hard time rating this one. I think the videos are far easier to follow than the written guide.

"The Murderer's Daughter by Jonathan Kellerman is a recommended stand-alone thriller.Grace Blades is an intelligent, very independent woman who works as a psychologist specializing in treating victims of trauma. She is highly recommended in referrals because of her devotion to and great empathy for her patients. Much of Grace's success is due to her horrific childhood. She was a neglected child living in an abusive environment. After witnessing her parents murder/suicide at age 5, she spent several years in the foster care system. She had a secure home, finally, at age 11. Her background helps her understand and treat her patients.Now Grace is a consummate professional and devoted to her patients by day, but engages in secretive, risky, dangerous behavior in her free time. She has it down to a science how to initiate a one-night-stand, or really just a quick hook-up to get what she wants from a man with no commitment.When Grace's latest patient turns out to be the man she gave a fake name during to the escapades of the night before, both are shocked. Her new patient gave her a fake name the previous night too. After an uncomfortable brief meeting, Grace learns that the man came to see her because of a paper she had written years ago on under the burden of being related to a murderer, or living with evil. He quickly leaves her office and later turns up dead.Grace tries to figure out who this man really was, since he seems to have given her yet another alias for his office visit. He said he was from San Antonio, TX and came just to see her, but that also seems to be untrue. And now someone might be following Grace, but she needs to figure out why by herself so her secret duplicitous activities aren't exposed.The Murderer's Daughter is very well written. I wouldn't expect anything less from Kellerman, who has successfully penned his Alex Delaware series for years. Here, however, there is a plethora of background information on Grace in chapters that alternate with the present day.  I was heartbroken and very sympathetic with young Grace and her situation. I didn't so much care for adult Grace and her reckless, foolish behavior, so I had a difficult time sympathizing with her. If she is as intelligent as she is purported to be, she should be smart enough to figure out a safer way to engage in her reckless sexual behavior. Hooking-up with random strangers is stupid.What the novel felt like, in the end, was the first book for a new series in which all the character's background information was presented. The thriller felt like it was added in between the character development chapters.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Random House for review purposes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NZZGMSJIV5TW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345545311#wasThisHelpful","R2NZZGMSJIV5TW","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Oregon Trail by Rinker Buck is a very highly recommended account of two brothers traveling along the Oregon Trail today.Author Rinker Buck, his brother Nick and Nick's “incurably filthy” Jack Russell terrier named Olive Oyl traveled over 2000 miles for four months along a route that was the Oregon Trail. They went from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Baker City, Oregon, through six present-day states, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho, and Oregon, in a covered wagon pulled by three mules named Jake, Beck, and Bute. In the fifteen years before the Civil War 400,000 pioneers used the trail to emigrate west. The last documented crossing was in 1909, so this trip was a historical reenactment or at least a taste of what happened during the great exodus west.All it took to spark Rinker Buck's decision to travel the trail was learning from Duane Durst, an administrator from the Kansas Historical Society, that the 2100 mile length of the trail has been ""meticulously charted and marked, with long, undeveloped spaces now preserved as a National Historic Trail. Except for two bad stretches of suburban sprawl around Scottsbluff, Nebraska, and Boise, Idaho, most of the rest of the trail is still accessible along remote farm and ranch roads in the West."" Rink decided he had to travel the trail, and do it in as authentic a manner as possible.If a travelogue of his adventures on the Oregon Trail today wasn't enough, Buck also includes a plethora of additional information on a wide variety of topics related to the trip. We learn a great deal about mules, wagons, the pioneers, cholera, marking the trail, plants along the way, burials along the trail, and the Mormon experience, to name a handful of topics. Buck also talks about a trip his family made in 1958. At that time his father decided to take his family on a month long ""See America Slowly"" vacation. They traveled in a covered wagon from central New Jersey across the Delaware River to south central Pennsylvania on a month long trip.On the back of the wagon for this childhood trip his father had a sign made that said: ""We’re Sorry For The Delay—But We Want The Children To SEE AMERICA SLOWLY New Vernon, New Jersey to Valley Forge, Lancaster, Gettysburg, Penna."" For their new trip Nick had taken the board to a sign painter in Maine for the similar messaging he considered appropriate for our trip. Painted on the back of the original sign was the new one: ""We Are Sorry For The Delay, But We Want To SEE AMERICA SLOWLY St. Joseph, Ft. Kearny, Scott’s Bluff, South Pass, Farewell Bend.""Buck is a perfect writer for this harrowing adventure. As he writes, ""Only a delusional jackass, or someone seriously off his medications, would pull off the road at the Hollenberg Ranch one fine summer afternoon and concoct such a preposterous scheme. But you can’t save an addictive dreamer from himself, and that jackass happens to be me."" He's a great story teller and includes a lot of self-deprecating humor along with all the additional support information. Even while letting us in on the mishaps and failures of the present trip, he includes references to past experiences and stories from his childhood, and manages to tie the two experiences together.After spending my early years in Nebraska, I learned about the history of the Oregon Trail every year of elementary school. It was fascinating to read this account of the trail today and the hazards crossing it. The year Rinker and Nick undertook this adventure was also a very wet year, with lots of rain, thunderstorms, and flooding, so it was not an easy year to travel the trail. I had to laugh at the fact that: ""The brisk and incessant prairie winds of Kansas and Nebraska were one of the most persistent obstacles to travel that the pioneers complained about in their journals."" I thoroughly enjoyed this book!Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Simon & Schuster for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MWWIQ2RGLHWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P434GOO#wasThisHelpful","R2MWWIQ2RGLHWS","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Browsings: A Year of Reading, Collecting, and Living with Books by Michael Dirda is a very highly recommended bookish book and perfect for bibliophiles.If you need more of an explanation, it is a collection of fifty essays that Dirda wrote between February 2012 and February 2013 for the American Scholar. These are not heavy, scholarly essays, although they do contain a wealth of information, but they are for the most part personal reflections written in a conversational style.In the introduction Dirda writes: ""Please bear in mind that these are light essays, meant to be entertaining. They aren’t jokey precisely, but they do have jokes in them. And lots of allusions and quotations, as well as the occasional pun. Now and again, I go off on rants, sometimes I make up lists, at other times I describe my misadventures at literary conventions and conferences."" He continues ""I’ve retained the name Browsings as the title of this collection, even though it is something of a misnomer. Rather than chronicling “the adventures of a soul among the masterpieces,” I quickly gravitated to talking digressively, and I hope amusingly, about bookishness itself. These are, in fact, very much personal pieces, the meandering reflections of a literary sybarite.""For those of us who are fellow bibliophiles, not only are these essays entertaining and engaging, they also will provide you with a list of things you simply must read someday. Keep a preferred writing implement handy so you can make lists on your preferred type of paper/notebook. This is especially true if you enjoy discovering early, classic science fiction or adventure tales. Dirda has a wealth of information and knowledge that he shares in these essays. Some extoll the wonder of discovery when a perfect, longed for edition of a book is found by chance in a used book store, a feeling many of us can appreciate. Dirda, for all his unpretentiousness about his knowledge, accomplishments, and literary acquaintances, will impress most book lovers. Some of these essays filled me longing and a desire to sit down and just listen to him talk. And maybe get a peek at his basement. And book shelves. And then listen some more.Not all of the essays are about books. There is one about pets. There are several essays that are best described as rants. These include a trip to a Colorado state park that was undergoing road construction, enduring repeated week long power outages by Pepco (Potomac Electric Power Company), life in Washington DC area, and American culture. Most of the essays, even if they touch on other subjects, have some tie-in to literature.In the afterword Dirda notes all the other writing he did during this time. It's impressive. Dirda is the weekly book columnist for the Washington Post and received the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for distinguished criticism.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Pegasus for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FQ5341XTV11J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1605988448#wasThisHelpful","R2FQ5341XTV11J","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The New Sorrows of Young W. by Ulrich Plenzdorf is a recommended satirical novel that was originally published in 1972 in Germany. This re-released edition is translated from the German by Romy Fursland.Edgar Wibeau, a 17 year old drop out, is found dead, electrocuted, inside a condemned building in Berlin with just a tape recorder and a battered copy of Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther. Edgar had previously sent tapes discussing his life to his friend Willi Linder. His father, hoping to find an explanation for his son's death, now listens to the tapes and retraces Edgar's travels, from Mittenberg to Berlin, since he left home.  The voice of Edgar's spirit interjects comments and explanations along the way as his father visits Charlie, the kindergarten teacher Edgar loved, and Addi, Edgar's last employer.The New Sorrows of Young W. is a parody of and follows The Sufferings of Young Werther. Goethe's work is often quoted along the way, creating a work of intertextuality between the two. Along with Young Wether, Plenzdorf also includes tie-ins to Salinger's Holden Caulfield, the standard for teen arrogance and angst. The result is a funny, absurd, and tragic coming of age story set in East Germany.Having never read Goethe's original but well acquainted with Salinger, I found this novel amusing and entertaining. The whole part on blue jeans, how they should be worn and who can wear them was pretty funny, even as it served as a symbolic representation of communism in East Germany. While the novel is dated, it was interesting and insightful. It might be more entertaining if I had been a teenage boy.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Pushkin Press for review purposes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TQAE40D6RPQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0881338915#wasThisHelpful","R3TQAE40D6RPQQ","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Days of Awe by Lauren Fox is a very highly recommended novel about loss and change. What Lauren Fox presents us with is a year in a woman's life; a year of loss when her world and family is changing dramatically.Isabel Applebaum Moore and Josie Abrams met as teachers at Rhodes Avenue Middle School and quickly became best friends. Izzy even introduced Josie to her childhood friend, Mark, and he and Josie married. But now Josie has died in a car crash, leaving a hole in Izzy's life. She is understandably full of grief, but on top of this, her world begins falling apart. Izzy's marriage to Chris becomes full of stress and Chris moves out, into his own apartment. Their 11 year old daughter Hannah, who is also mourning Josie, must now deal with her parent's separation. Added to this is the fact that Izzy's mother who lives nearby, has had a stroke and Izzy can see that she is aging.Izzy's overwhelming sadness as she grieves the loss of her friend is understandable, but soon it becomes clear that she is grieving for much more than this one unexpected death and her changing family. She is grieving for the past that her mother, a Holocaust survivor, never talks about except in hints. She is grieving for the lost children of all the miscarriages she has had. She is angry at Mark for seemingly moving on way-too-quickly to a new relationship with a woman who is the antithesis of Josie. She is struggling with her previously adoring daughter suddenly turning into a teen with an attitude and insomnia.Izzy has been a dutiful daughter, wife, mother, and best friend. These relationships have defined who she is for years. Now Izzy must come to terms with who she really is, as well as some secrets about Josie that she been unable to face.In Izzy, Fox has created an amazing finely layered character. She can be darkly funny, acerbic, and quick witted. She feels things deeply, passionately, but not always openly. When she does comment, she has a unique voice and an individual perspective on everything.  Her struggles are universal. Her relationships are all in transition. She is seeking atonement, undertaking an introspective look at her life during this year. (The title is a nod to the Jewish Days of Awe.) I totally understood much of what she was experiencing and the depth of emotion that Fox manages to convey is very true to life.The writing in Days of Awe is exquisite, literary, and it perfectly depicts an incredible character whose whole life is in transition. This book had me staying up way too late to finish it, the sign of a compelling story combined with great writing. I had one quibble with it: the ending was way too pat for the rest of the book. Many people liked it though, so this feeling is personal - and based on personal experience. I won't say more, but it did knock it down a star for me, until I decided I liked everything else about Days of Awe way too much to go that low.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Knopf Doubleday for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FO4K3TWPJJII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RKO3TK2#wasThisHelpful","R3FO4K3TWPJJII","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Woman with a Secret by Sophie Hannah is a highly recommended police procedural.In this latest case featuring British police officers DC Simon Waterhouse and his wife, DS Charlie Zailer, there has been a murder of a well-known columnist on Elmhirst Road in Spilling. Damon Blundy may have been well known, but he was also controversial and combative. He was killed in a way that seemed to be sending a symbolic message, but what could the message mean? And then there are the actual words painted on the wall saying, ""He is no less dead."" The list of enemies should be extensive, but the investigation takes notice of one car, being driven by Nicki Clements, a woman in her early forties who makes a U-turn to avoid where the police are stopping every car up ahead.Nicki, who is trying to run an errand to her children's school, sees a cop she wants to avoid seeing again at all costs. The big question is why? What secret is Nicki trying to hide? Because Nicki's erratic behavior is captured on CCTV she is called in for questioning. Clearly, when Nicki is answering questions, she is also trying to cover up something. She has a secret, but does it have anything to do with Blundy's murder?As part of Nicki's secrets and lies are clear to the reader, the question is how or if they are related to the case. We do know Nicki has been going online and is conducting an affair, at this point just through email, with ""Gavin"" after previously having another affair with someone she met online.Parts of this story are told through Nicki, her email correspondence with Gavin, the police investigation, and Blundy's columns. It opens with a personal ad placed on a dating site that invites speculation, but is also deceptive. And that deception, the lies and secrets, are what makes up a great deal of this novel and keeps you guessing what is real and what isn't.Hannah does an excellent job capturing the present world where we are all online, social media abounds, CCTV surveillance is common, and there are plenty of columnists that revel in being nasty and/or combative as they name names and throw accusations. It seems that everyone is striving to be more connected. She does an excellent job depicting this world where we are either trying to stand out more and set ourselves apart from the pack or we are conducting a secret life online.The real treat to this well written novel is Simon and Charlie. Their complex relationship, interaction, and thought processes as they work together are what kept me reading.Nicki is an unreliable narrator as well as an unlikeable character. In fact there are many unlikeable characters in this novel. So many nasty people, with the exception of Simon and Charlie, could leave you with no one to cheer for or at least hope it works out for them. On the up side, though, it also provides plenty of suspects and clues to follow in order to figure out who done it and why.Disclosure: I received an advanced reading copy of this book from the publisher and TLC for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23V25HH0HJ330/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062388266#wasThisHelpful","R23V25HH0HJ330","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Casualties by Nick Holdstock is a unique, very highly recommended novel about change.A major disaster is heading toward the Comely Bank neighborhood of Edinburgh, Scotland. It is referenced obliquely, as if it is common knowledge, because our narrator in The Casualties is telling us about the disaster from the vantage point of sixty years in the future. What he wants to talk about are some of the inhabitants of the neighborhood and tells us their stories. He is looking back and talking about the past, in 2016 and 2017, right before the apocalypse happens and everything changes.The narrator tells us right away that Samuel Clark, who lives in Comely Bank and runs a charity used book store, is a murderer. Sam likes to collect bits of lives that have been left in the books donated to his shop, things like old letters, photos, airline ticket stubs. He also likes to hear the stories of the people around him. Holdstock introduces us, through Sam, to the denizens Sam is curious about, and those who are obsessed with him. The exceptional people we meet are: Alasdair, the might-be-crazy man who lives under the bridge; Caitlyn, who works in the charity clothes shop next to the bookstore and has a face that develops cracks; Mr. Asham runs a store and longs to belong to the community; Mrs. Maclean taught for over forth years and longs to die; Rita and Sean are two drunks who always hang out together at the park; Toby is an extremely obese young man who craves food constantly so he must be supervised all the time; Sinead is a nymphomaniac who watches Toby but longs for Sam; Trudy is a Filipino prostitute.It is a narrative with finely drawn characters that are well developed, remarkable, and interesting.Holdstock presents his story from a unique viewpoint, which sets this pre-apocalypse story apart in a category all on its own. Even while introducing us to these characters and leading us up to the murder Sam is supposed to commit, Holdstock also drops small, vague references to the disaster that will be happening, a disaster that makes all the drama he is telling us about seem inconsequential. But that is the beauty of this novel. The narrator has a point of view from far in the future, a time years after the impending disaster and all the subsequent societal developments about which he hints. He's talking about the past many years ago. The happenings in the Edinburgh neighborhood are trivial in comparison to the bigger picture. We really don't know what the disaster is until we are far along in the story and even then he does not talk about that. He talks about this neighborhood just before the disaster.And this choice is brilliant.Holdstock creates a tension right away because we know something much bigger is coming but his narrator chooses to focus in on Sam and this odd, damaged group of people in this particular little neighborhood. He wants to tell us a story. It is akin to hearing about now what people were doing before boarding the Titanic, or just before the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, or the devastating Tsunami of 2004. A disaster much bigger than any little drama is coming, but the narrator needs to tell us this story, the story about what was happening just before the disaster to these people.The ending might not suit everyone, but I could appreciate it in the context of the whole novel. This one was a nice surprise.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Thomas Dunne for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GO0K2ALE4WK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250059518#wasThisHelpful","R2GO0K2ALE4WK5","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Man-Eater: The Life and Legend of an American Cannibal by Harold Schechter is a highly recommended nonfiction narrative about Alfred (Alferd) G. Packer, a prospector who was accused of cannibalism.Six miners went into the mountainsto hunt for precious gold;It was the middle of the winter,the weather was dreadful cold.Six miners went into the mountains,they had nor food nor shack—Six miners went into the mountains,But only one came back. ""The Lost Miners""(or the Ballad of Alferd Packer; nineteenth century)In 1873 Packer and a group of five other men set off through the high mountains of Colorado to seek their fortune in gold or silver. It was winter, a brutal time to be traveling through the mountains, and the men were lost and starving. Packer was the only man to make it out alive. Though he changed his story several times, it was widely believed that he killed the others and ate them in order to survive. Packer claimed, at one point, that the men were killed by another member of the group, Shannon Wilson Bell, who Packer in turned shot before Bell killed him. Then he did eat the flesh of his deceased companions to ward off starvation. It was also believed that he may have killed the other men to rob them; he did admittedly take money from the dead men.Schechter covers Packer's two trials, along with a plethora of historical information to place the legendary crime story in context. He includes Polly Pry's efforts on Packer's behalf, and the cultural impact of Packer's story. For example, a cafeteria at the University of Colorado Boulder is named after Packer,  several films and a musical based on the story have been made, and songs have been written about it. Schechter also discusses James Starr's efforts in to use modern forensic science techniques to resolve the questions surrounding Packer's case.This is one of those books that is simply interesting to read. If you enjoy nonfiction about the late 1800s, prospectors, cases of cannibalism in US history, and sensational historical figures, this may be a good choice for you. Written in 50 short, well organized chapters, the book includes chapter notes and a bibliography.(The spelling of the name Alfred as “Alferd” is because Packer didn’t know how to spell his name when younger and used the alternate misspelling.)Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Little A for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34BU8EPE6900L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477829563#wasThisHelpful","R34BU8EPE6900L","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We Believe the Children: A Moral Panic in the 1980s by Richard Beck is a highly recommended examination of the panic over alleged horrific abuse by day care workers in the 1980's. Beck is primarily focusing on the history of the allegations, why it may have happened, and several other topics related to the discussion rather than presenting new information about this time in history. I vividly recall all the outrage and panic coverage over these cases in the 1980s when the McMartin Preschool became a whispered household word and accusations of satanic ritual abuse was seemingly everywhere.""[I]n California, New Jersey, New York, Michigan, Massachusetts, Florida, Tennessee, Texas, Ohio, and elsewhere, day care workers were arrested, charged, tried, and convicted of committing horrible sexual crimes against the children they cared for. These crimes, social workers and prosecutors said, had gone undetected for years, and they consisted of a brutality and sadism that defied all imagining. The dangers of babysitting services and day care centers became a national news media fixation. Of the many hundreds of people who were investigated in connection with day care and ritual abuse cases around the country, some 190 were formally charged with crimes, leading to more than 80 convictions.""I also recall some of the more sensational and less than stellar media coverage surrounding the outbreak (Geraldo Rivera) as well as coverage on 20/20 and 60 minutes. For all the accusations, outrage, and charges, though, no evidence was found for many of the claims.  The McMartin case, one of the longest and most expensive trials in history, resulted in no convictions.Beck, an editor at n+1, a New York-based literary magazine, examines how social workers, therapists and police officers helped induce children to tell elaborate stories about abuse that never took place. The methods used by these professionals and investigators encouraged children to lie and tell those investigating what they wanted to hear. The whole atmosphere at the time was akin to a witch hunt, and Beck does make the comparison to the Salem Witch trials, with the difference being the accused witches were later given an apology.There is a lot of extraneous information included in this presentation of the facts, including multiple personality disorder and recovered memory therapy along with anti-pornography efforts and Christian concerns about the family. Some of this extra information, while interesting, could have been reduced or eliminated. Becks ultimate theory as to why he thinks the societal hysteria took place is interesting, although I'm not sure I totally agree with his conclusions.This is well written and well researched look at the fear that created a cultural disaster. Beck includes plenty of documentation to support the research in his presentation. My advanced reading copy included the footnotes and the final book will have an index.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of PublicAffairs for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JNS95XVM3A17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1610392876#wasThisHelpful","R1JNS95XVM3A17","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Night Sister by Jennifer McMahon is a very highly recommended novel that combines suspense and fantasy as it explores the bonds between sisters and the downfall of keeping secrets. McMahon is swiftly becoming one of my go-to authors for the combination of consistently great writing with a compelling narrative. She delivers on both counts here.The Night Sister opens with a horrific murder. It appears the Amy Slater has killed her family and then herself at her home. They were living in her family's house by the dilapidated buildings of what was once her family's business, the Tower Motel, in the sleepy town of London, Vermont. The only survivor is her daughter Lou, who was found hiding out on the roof of the house.Margot calls her older sister Piper to tell her of the tragic news and Piper flies back to Vermont to be with her sister. A photo was found with a cryptic note on it referring to the 29th room. The only problem is that the Tower Motel only had 28 rooms. But Piper and Margot were childhood friends of Amy and the three played together until they had a falling out in the summer of 1989. They know a secret they aren't sharing. Jason, who is currently on the police force in London and married to Margot, knew all three girls at that time. He knows they are hiding something, but he has secrets of his own.The story is presented in three time periods, which are clearly indicated: 2013, 1955 or 1961, and 1989. The chapters are narrated through the voice of several different characters: Amy at the very beginning, then the story unfolds through Jason and Piper in 1989 and 2013, and Rose (Amy's mother) in the early years. Interspersed in the early years are letters Silvie, Rose's older sister, has written to Alfred Hitchcock.While you know that the three girls discovered a terrible secret that ruined their friendship in the summer of 1989, you don't find out what the secret is until the end. McMahon grabs your attention at the beginning with the murders, and then settles in to tell her story, slowly revealing clues that aren't fully explained until the end. (Fans of Hitchcock movies may be able to spot several tie-ins to his films.) The Night Sister is a good, creepy book that held my attention from beginning to end.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Knopf Doubleday for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EKR7VS0ZW1HO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R04IQ4G#wasThisHelpful","R3EKR7VS0ZW1HO","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Marriage of Opposites by Alice Hoffman is a highly recommended novel of historical fiction about the mother of painter Camille Pissarro.Rachel Manzana Pomié grew up on the tropical island of St. Thomas in the early 1800s. Her father is a merchant on the island and her family was part of the Jewish community who settled there for religious freedom under the protection of Denmark. Her family brought an apple tree with them to the tropics because it is the basis for their name, but, although the apple tree lived, it never flourished. The family also survived, but did not flourish on the island. While her father taught her to read and doted on her, her mother is harsh and does not want a daughter. Her mother favors a nephew she adopted as a baby.Rachel knows her mother's harsh tongue and manner, but she is decidedly an unconventional girl who just happened to live in a time not well suited for her strength of character, societal rule breaking, and love of reading. The family maid is a source of great comfort and support and her daughter, Jestine, is Rachel's life-long friend. Rachel longs to go to Paris, but the nephew is sent instead. Rachel is then married off to Isaac Petit, a widower over twice her age,  to save the family business from financial ruin. Isaac has three children and Rachel quickly adds 3 more children to the family.When Isaac suddenly dies, as a woman Rachel is left with nothing. Her husband inherited her father's business interests and now his nephew will inherit it all. Rachel is 29, caring for 6 children and about to give birth to a seventh. When the nephew, Frédérick, who is 22, arrives, it begins a love affair of the heart and a marriage that breaks Jewish laws and causes them to be outcasts in society. From their marriage Jacobo Camille Pissarro is born.Hoffman's expressive writing style, rich in descriptions, folklore, and historical fact, is well suited for this novel. She manages to capture life on St. Thomas in the 1800's and brings Rachel to life, showing her formative years, island superstitions, struggles, and determination. There is some magic realism thrown into the story.  While closely following the historical facts, Hoffman embellished and added some characters for depth.The Marriage of Opposites will appeal to those who enjoy historical fiction - especially historical fiction that is well well-written, carefully researched, closely follows historical facts, and realistically and accurately portrays the historical time, place, and setting.  While it does move a tad bit slow at times, The Marriage of Opposites brings a small part of history to life.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Simon & Schuster for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KLRIKU0TSK0E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451693591#wasThisHelpful","R2KLRIKU0TSK0E","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Spirals in Time: The Secret Life and Curious Afterlife of Seashells by Helen Scales is a very highly recommended, fascinating nonfiction book about conchology, and, honestly, who doesn't appreciate seashells? (Just a quick glance through my home makes it clearly evident that I do.) ""Members of the phylum Mollusca are among the most ancient animals on the planet. Their shells provide homes for other animals, and across the ages, people have used shells not only as trinkets but also as a form of money, and as powerful symbols of sex and death, prestige and war.""Spirals in Time is not only interesting and entertaining, it is also a thoroughly engaging look at the history, biology and the scientists (and mathematicians) who study seashells, primarily mollusks. The information is presented through stories and personal experience. As author Helen Scales writes in her introduction: ""This book is made up of my choice of shell stories, ones that together paint a picture of a remarkable company of animals along with some of the more offbeat, forgotten and little-known tales of how those shells have made their way into the human world.""Scales is a wonderful story teller. Her sound science and knowledge of the subject matter combined with the ability to present the information in an entertaining and engaging manner made Spirals in Time an utterly delightful and accessible book. She has some great stories to tell that just happen to pass along a bountiful amount of information.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Bloomsbury USA for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZEE0099LHYFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SJ90AN6#wasThisHelpful","R1ZEE0099LHYFV","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Sunrise by Victoria Hislop is a highly recommended novel about three families during the 1974 Cypriot coup d’état.Opening in the Summer of 1972, The Sunrise is set in Famagusta, Cyprus’s most glamorous Mediterranean island vacation destination. Aphroditi and Savvas Papacostas currently own the Paradise Beach, a small hotel, but are building a new luxury highrise with a nightclub, The Sunrise. Markos Georgiou is hired as the manager of the night club and soon The Sunrise is the place to go to see and be seen by European's elite.Underlying the tranquility of the city, though, ethnic tension is mounting between the Greeks and the Turks. Violence erupts in 1974 when Greece’s coup d’état provokes a Turkish attack on  Famagusta. Forty-thousand families ended up fleeing Famagusta, leaving it deserted. The Papacostas flee to a refugee camps, while two other families, the Özkans and the Georgious, remain in the decimated city. The tension between the two families is great as one is Turkish Cypriot, while the other is Greek Cypriot. The two families take refuge in the hotel, The Sunrise. The families battle illness, hunger, fear, and their own prejudices while struggling to stay alive and protect those they love.Even today Varosha, the southern tourist section of the Cypriot city of Famagusta, is still empty, a ghost town, barricaded by barbwire, since the coup d’état. ""Glitz! Glamour! Civil war! Abandonment! That sums up Varosha, a once-ritzy beachfront resort district popular with Elizabeth Taylor and international jet-setters in the Cypriot city of Famagusta. Following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, it was deserted by 15,000 residents, enclosed with barbed wire and left to rot.""(Modern Day Ghost Towns http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/eco-tourism/photos/7-modern-day-ghost-towns/varosha-northern-cyprus)With all of Greeks economic struggles in the news recently, this is a timely historical novel. While the story is fiction, it is based upon real events. Hislop is a good writer. You can tell that she has done her research to keep the story firmly placed in the specific time in history. Clearly, what is the most interesting to Hislop is the history. Her characters are presented so she can cover the history. While this isn't necessarily bad, if you are interested in history, the characters are really secondary to the bigger story, the complicated political atmosphere, the invasion, devastating aftermath and struggle for survival. To be honest, the story does start out a bit slow so you have to give it a chance. Once it's 1974 and the the Özkans and the Georgious are left trying to survive in the city, the story begins to become more engaging.Disclosure: I received an advanced reading copy of this book from HarperCollins for TLC review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R223CK3GO5EZLY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062396099#wasThisHelpful","R223CK3GO5EZLY","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All This Life by Joshua Mohr is exceptionally thoughtful, and a very highly recommended novel about our current information super highway. In All This Life Mohr takes our over exposed, interconnected lives, a tragic event, and ties together seven very different people.The novel opens with an unnamed man pondering: ""There’s one gigantic cause that no one talks about and it’s the foundation of my equation, my E = mc despaired: Human sadness is what’s heating up the earth. We are so somber, Albert, our lives are squared by despair and thus we all emit such a sad heat that our planet will torch unless we get it under control.""Then we are introduced to Paul and Jake, his son. They are driving over the Golden Gate Bridge when Jake sees a marching band. Jake likes ""capturing real human life, snatching seconds away from those who don’t suspect an audience."" As he films them with his phone, he captures a horrific event that leaves most of the band dead. After Jake posts his video of the event on youtube, the only video that captured the whole event from start to finish, it goes viral.Noah, a man who lost his sister that day on the bridge has seen Jake's film online and can't believe someone would post that. He is in a world of pain and grief over his loss.In Traurig, a small town in Nevada about an hour from Reno, Sara has just learned that her boyfriend has posted a sex tape of them online. Her cell phone is vibrating and text messages are flying. She's lost her job and it seems everyone knows about her indiscreet as the video goes viral. She turns to Rodney, an old friend who struggles to speak after an accident, and they leave together to find Rodney's mom, Kathleen (Kat), a caricaturist who lives in San Francisco. Kat left after his accident and hasn't contacted him since. She's sober now, though, and wants to reach out.Sara ponders, ""If there was a customer service center that regulated the whole information super highway she would have dialed it immediately. But it’s the wild west. Utter anarchy. No one’s really in charge, so long as you’re not trying to coerce a kid into bed or buying weapons."" This is, of course, why these two videos exist online. Social media amplifies the interconnectedness of these lives. Sara watches Jake's video and he watches the one with her in it.All these flawed and wounded characters will end up converging in a startling and dramatic conclusion. If all this makes it seem that Mohr's novel is very somber and gloomy, it isn't. There are moments of humor and there is a sense of hope at the end.The focus on social media and how it is used and defines people today is clearly demonstrated by Paul and Jake.Paul, who has to ""basically police his co workers, or they’ll fiddle around on Facebook all day"" is concerned for his son and for the whole generation because of the way they publicize everything - ""these technologies that make it seem like a good idea to share shrapnel from your life, meaningless slivers of each day."" He ""examines the dangerous intersection of reality and the imaginary, where coding and technology seek to highlight and augment our already flawed human connections.""Jake, though, espouses the view of his generation. He didn’t do anything wrong when posting the video of the band. ""This is what people do. This is how the world works. This is why we’re smarter now: We share everything with everyone, have access to each sight and sound. We are informed and connected! If they stop living in the past, they’d plug into this broadcasting consciousness, synapses firing all over the globe."" ""Content is Jake’s purpose. It is everybody’s purpose. And each single frame uploaded is a public service.""After finishing All This Life, I put everything Joshua Mohr has written on my wish list. The writing was exceptional. The development of the characters, even when working with so many, is incredible. The underlying message is timely. With all our connections, have we lost sight of the value of the personal, face to face, connections? Do we propose that our social media connections are truly personal connections? Is social media truly reflecting our reality, our lives? Do we need to share everything? Is content really our purpose?Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Soft Skull Press for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZOCWC727VYI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQ5GGP0#wasThisHelpful","R1ZOCWC727VYI4","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One Boy Missing by Stephen Orr is a highly recommended police procedural set in Australia.Detective Inspector Bart Moy is tired and close to being washed out as a detective. He has returned to the small agricultural town of Guilderton, New South Wales, to help care for his aging father and also to try and recover from the loss of his son, Charlie. When a butcher reports that he saw a man stash a young boy into the trunk (boot) of his car, Bart is looking at the case as a possible abduction, but the case becomes difficult since no one seems to be missing a child.When a 9 year old boy is found and identified as the child thrown into the trunk, Bart tries to make a connection with him and get him to speak, but winning the trust of this boy is hard to do and it takes a long time to just get him to admit his first name. While trying to solve this case, and another, Bart is experiencing flashbacks and dreams about his own son. Bart's father, George, is a real curmudgeon and seems to be becoming much more difficult to handle.While this is  a well-paced literary police procedural, it is also a character study of the men and their personal relationships while dealing with life's changes - especially between fathers and sons. The dialogue between characters is very well done. Bart along with almost every character in this book is suffering or keeping a secret and struggling with trying to find a way to heal or a direction to take. While solving the case is an impetus for action, the bigger resolution the characters need is an emotional healing.Orr does an exceptional job keeping the interest high in his characters while the case is slowly being investigated. The pacing is good, but it is slow until a point toward the end of the book where an event happens that set my heart pounding. It also marks an important change in the relationship between the characters.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Text Publishing Company for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REBAJ8J5B5M0Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FW0OI60#wasThisHelpful","REBAJ8J5B5M0Q","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alive by Scott Sigler is a very highly recommended first book in a new YA trilogy.When she wakes up because something is biting her on the back of her neck all she knows is that it's her 12th birthday and it isn't right. Slowly it becomes clear that she is not in her bed at home, trying to catch a few more minutes of sleep. She is in some kind of box, or coffin, and it is pitch black. Her arms and legs are restrained. She has to struggle to stop whatever is biting her, escape and get out. When she does get out, she sees she is in a room with other coffins and she's wearing too tight clothes. Her coffin is marked M. Savage, which she guesses is her name, Em. When Em hears shouts coming from inside one of the other coffins, she manages to get another girl out, Springate. Together they get more children out, boys and girls.Today is the 12th birthday for all of them - but they don't look 12. They look older, stronger, maybe 18 or older. How did they suddenly get these adult bodies? Together these children must find food and water while trying to figure out where they are and what has happened to the adults. With bones, skeletons, and the gruesome evidence that some kind of battle took place in the past that resulted in a great loss of life, what could possibly have happened to the adults? And where are they? And why can't they easily remember things they should know?Em is chosen as the leader of their small group and they set off to try and find food, water and help. Her small group encounters another group of children/adults and the two groups join together to seek their common goals: sustenance, information, and answers.I've enjoyed Sigler's books in the past and was anxious to see what he did with a YA book. Sigler has already proven he's an excellent writer, and that is the case in Alive too. The horror/terror found in his other novels is certainly present. This time there is no strong language, but there are plenty of horrific sights and certainly terror. Sigler writes Alive using short sentences and in a first person narrative, which made sense to me on several levels. These are children waking up in adult bodies and they have found themselves in uncertain circumstances. It makes sense that thoughts and sentences are abbreviated as they puzzle their way through this unknown habitat. I also appreciate the immediacy of the first person tense because it helps create tension.The best recommendation, though, is that I'm anxious to read book two and find out what happens to this group next. I've avoided reading and reviewing a lot of the YA fiction out there because I know there are plenty of reviewers who enjoy YA. Anything Scott Sigler writes is worth making an exception for because I know several things are true: he will present a well-paced and carefully plotted novel with some twists and surprises, and the characters in his novels will also be well-development and show growth.

"The Festival of Insignificance by Milan Kundera is a recommended, short novel about five friends and the inconsequentiality of life.Alain, Ramon, D'Ardelo, Charles, and Caliban are friends living in Paris. While Alain obsesses over the exposed navels of young women as the new erotic/seductive zone, Ramon is strolling through the park and meets D'Ardelo who lies about having cancer and then says he wants to plan a party, using Charles to plan it and Caliban to help. There is also much discussion of Stalin.The tile of the novel really describes it and will tell you if it is a good selection for you. It really is a novel about nothing. The book is very short, more of a novella, has no story, and very little character development. After I first read it, I had to pause before writing a review. Honestly, I didn't like the characters, and didn't see a point to the novel. The Washington Post review noted that to the unsympathetic, ""The Festival of Insignificance will come across as simply inconsequential and pretentious."" But then I went back to the title and pondered Kundera's thoughts some more.Ramon tells us that, ""Insignificance is the essence of existence."" Moreover, Ramon insists that insignificance will set a person free, require no presence of mind, no vigilance. So we have it established that Kundera is giving us permission to just experience his novel for what it is without looking for an overriding theme or great point. It must also be noted that The Festival of Insignificance is also humorous and celebrates the absurd at times. There are keen bits of startling insight embedded within the musing and antics of these men, such as the theory about ""observation posts standing each on a different point in history, from which people talk together unable to understand one another."" The discussion becomes in reality two monologues. It is a novel about irrelevance, detachment, insignificance, and, yes, it is a memorial, a festival, to insignificance.Disclosure: I received an advanced reading copy of this book from the publisher for review purposes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIEKAZZT7NKDQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062356895#wasThisHelpful","RIEKAZZT7NKDQ","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Life and Death of Sophie Stark by Anna North is a highly recommended novel that exposes the truth behind the artist.Acclaimed filmmaker Sophie Stark is an enigma, even to those who know her best. This haunting novel tells us about the life of Sophie through the voices of six different individuals who knew her best. Each chapter is the voice of one of these six individuals, while not a word is heard directly from Sophie. What we gather and learn about her character is all filtered through the experiences of others.The six voices include: Allison, Robbie (Sophie's brother), Jacob, Daniel, George, and Benjamin Martin. Allison was romantically involved with Sophie and the story of her family became Sophie's movie Marianne. Robbie is ever protective of Sophie and in college helps her with her first movie, Daniel, a documentary of her obsession with college basketball player. Sophie makes a video for musician Jacob and they get married briefly. She betrays him when the story of his mother becomes her next movie, Woods. Daniel was the college basketball star in her first movie. George is a successful screenwriter who Sophie uses for his contacts and makes the movie Isabella. Benjamin Martin is the film critic whose reviews of Sophie's films are included between each chapter.It is clear that Sophie is an enigma even to those who know her best. We know that Sophie has always been a loner and found it difficult to connect with other people. She was born as Emily Buckley, but changed her name. She unapologetically uses people and their lives to further her art. Does she really feel love or care for anyone besides herself and her vision? She is driven and focused. Her vision for a film and her creative process supersedes all personal relationships. Clearly she is talented, but what cost does she extract from those around her while working on her films? Is the final creation of art enough to excuse personal betrayal? Must a great artist always be tortured?North's writing is excellent which helps make The Life and Death of Sophie Stark an engrossing literary story puzzle. The individual stories each add some essential pieces to the puzzle and work together to make a more complete picture of who is Sophie Stark. They don't explain everything. This is a puzzle with missing pieces. What North leaves us with, after these stories from those who knew her, is that the legacy Sophie Stark has left behind is her films that, presumably, might fill in some of the missing holes and help explain her life.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of the Penguin Publishing Group for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K1OT3JUK3NS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399173390#wasThisHelpful","R2K1OT3JUK3NS2","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the Burning Edge by Kyle Dickman is a highly recommended, in depth look at the 20 Granite Mountain Hotshots of Prescott, AZ., and the Yarnell, AZ., wildfire that claimed 19 of their lives.Dickman, a former hotshot, spent five years fighting wildfires in California. His insider's knowledge and viewpoint give us information about the group and how they train and interact. While providing the information on a brief history of wildfire firefighting teams,  and how a hotshot team trains and works fighting wildfires, he focuses mainly on the Granite Mountain Hotshots. He then gives us a well-researched inside glimpse at each of the members of the team. Dickman carefully covers each member of the crew and even includes their last text messages sent to loved ones.The wildfire in Yarnell was sparked by a lightning bolt and quickly turned into an inferno that eventually devoured more than eight thousand acres in northern Arizona. Anyone who has ever seen a wildfire take off will understand the terror and unpredictability of a wildfire. Those of us who have done so, have also watched and applauded the dedicated crews coming in to fight those fires. While the actual firefighting portion of the book may seem scant, On the Burning Edge is a memorable and heartbreaking account of the men who fought the fire.I remember vividly when living in the west seeing a lightning strike hit a nearby mountain and then almost immediately seeing smoke arise from the mountain. It is a horrifying feeling to watch a fire take off and know your family could be in the path of a wildfire. Furthermore, these fires seemed to be a yearly occurrence. So many people across the USA depend on the hotshots and crews of dedicated firefighters from across the West to come in and fight the fires. (A shout out to those flying helicopters and dumping flame retardant on the fires too.)Dickman does a good job presenting the information and telling the story of the tragic event. It is also a story of warning and caution. With the increased population and well publicized  decrease in the water supply in the West, there are certainly going to be an increase of fires that threaten populated areas and more young men will be in harm’s way fighting the fires.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Random House for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UHCQIALD76FT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553392123#wasThisHelpful","R2UHCQIALD76FT","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Forgotten Room by Lincoln Child is a highly recommended thriller.Yale professor Jeremy Logan is an enigmalogist or an investigator who specializes in analyzing phenomena that have no obvious explanation. He has been asked by Gregory Olafson, the director, to come to the Lux to discreetly investigate what could have led to the erratic behavior and horrific suicide by one of their distinguished doctors, Willard Strachey. The Lux is a think tank located in Dark Gables, a seaside mansion in Newport, R.I. Ten years earlier Jeremy was asked to leave the Lux based on questions about his research.Once he arrives, Jeremy discovers that the doctor wasn't the only one behaving erratically. He thinks that Strachey's behavior may be related to his oversight of the renovation of an unused wing of the mansion. While investigating, Jeremy discovers a secret room in that wing. The secret room contains equipment from a project that doesn't seem to have any documentation on it. It seems to be from something that may have been called Project Sin that was conducted in the 1930's.Jeremy has keen insight into people and as he interviews the residents you will wonder if the cause of the problem is related to the paranormal or if it can be explained by science. It is clear that whatever has caused the problem is still ongoing and Jeremy may be in danger himself if he can't figure it out soon.The writing is excellent, as usual, and Child will grab your attention and hold it to the end. The chapters are short and quick, which made this an excellent book to read in quick bursts here and there as time permitted during the day. I found myself reading it pretty quickly as the mystery and plot were compelling and Jeremy is a likeable character.Jeremy also appeared in The Third Gate and Deep Storm, but this is a stand-alone novel that can be enjoyed without reading about any of his previous investigations.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Knopf Doubleday for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WGFJSITCE84G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PCYVE#wasThisHelpful","R2WGFJSITCE84G","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Benjamin Mandelbaum, a man in his mid-forties, has just been kicked out of his house by his wife Judy after she suspects he has had another affair. After two previous affairs, this suspected third marks the end of their marriage. Ben takes his dog and moves back home to live with his father, Leonard, in Wintonbury, a suburb of Hartford, Connecticut. Leonard, 84, has started dating again, much to Ben's surprise.Ben claims to miss his family, but once he discovers that an old high school crush, Audrey, has moved back to town and is now living just up the street with her busy lawyer husband, Andrew, and troubled teenage daughter, Emily, that point seems to escape him. Ben and Audrey start having an affair almost immediately after meeting. But there is a whole lot more trouble brewing behind the scenes and everyone seems to have secrets they are keeping and information they are withholding.The quality of the writing is excellent. Pope manages to give each character tells their own story in their unique voice, explaining their unhappiness and revealing shocking secrets. Adultery looms so large in the plot of this dark drama featuring a plethora of dysfunctional lives in two families that it was overwhelming for me. I wanted the adults to snap out of it and start looking at the consequences of their actions. Pope does manage to infuse a little humor while presenting us with this collection of very flawed people.

"Hyacinth Girls by Lauren Frankel is a highly recommended, powerful novel about bullying.""Do you know your children?""That is the question Rebecca, the guardian of 13 year old Callie,  wants the parents of other teens to ask themselves. She has a billboard made that features Callie's face and the pointed question erected in hopes that someone will take notice. But to tell us the story of what has happened, Rebecca goes back six months to an incident where Callie was accused of bullying another student, Robyn. Callie denies the accusations and Rebecca rallies to her side, defending her.As she relates the story behind the billboard, Rebecca also reminisces about the past. She has been a part of Callie's life since her birth. She was best friends with Callie's mother, Joyce, and took over as her guardian when Joyce died. Rebecca and Joyce called themselves the ""hyacinth girls"" and were inseparable for a time. Rebecca does her best to understand what Callie is experiencing while at the same time she is recalling past betrayals in her friendship with Joyce. But Rebecca doesn't really understand at all what Callie is going through or what role she has played in the drama unfolding.The narrative is separated into separate sections where the story is told first from Rebecca's point of view and then Callie's point of view. The story gets much better and acquires some depth once we can read Callie's thoughts. It's not that Rebecca's character is awful, but she seems rather simple and naive. Once Callie's voice is given, at over half way through, the narrative takes on more depth. Included throughout all sections are short numbered installments detailing the history of Callie's interaction through messages and texts with Robyn, the girl she was accused of bullying.While the writing is quite good and the story timely, I've lowered my rating one star simply because of the length of the first section told in Rebecca's voice. The true reality of what is going on doesn't come to life until you start to read Callie's story. As most people know, teens keep secrets and you will likely suspect that there are secrets, but won't quite understand the whole story until later, even the story of Callie's childhood and her parents. This is a novel that deserves some attention. Mean girls have always existed and nothing seems to change that equation.

"The Mercy of the Sky: The Story of a Tornado by Holly Bailey is a very highly recommended account of the two tornadoes that hit Moore and El Reno, Oklahoma in May of 2013. Most of the book focuses on the May 20, 2013 tornado that hit Moore, Oklahoma, a suburb south of Oklahoma City. Bailey's narrative reads like a nail-biting thriller; even though you know the outcome, the tension is palatable as the storm approaches. This tornado was a massive mile-wide twister with winds in excess of 200 miles per hour that hit during the day, and destroyed two schools. Twenty-five people were killed, seven of which were third graders at the Plaza Towers Elementary School who had their school collapse on top of them. This tornado was one known as ""a 'grinder' as it took its time chewing neighborhoods into tiny bits.""The El Reno tornado hit just eleven days after this, on May 31. This tornado was at least 2.6 miles wide and is the largest tornado on record. Both of these monsters were EF5 tornadoes on the Enhanced Fujita scale.Bailey, a reporter, does an excellent job chronicling the story, and the history of storm forecasting in Oklahoma, through several key individuals, including: Gary England, the renowned and trusted weatherman at CBS affiliate KWTV, Mike Morgan and Damon Lane his rivals; Amy Simpson, the head principal at Plaza Towers Elementary in Moore; Steve Eddy, city manager of Moore; Rick Smith, of the National Weather Service in Norman; Howard Bluestein, a well-known meteorology professor at OU; and several others.As a native Oklahoman, Bailey was compelled to tell what happened in Moore. She understands that most of us who live in tornado alley follow the weather very closely and those in Oklahoma, perhaps, the most. She ""knew I wanted to tell the longer story of what had happened here. As a native, I knew how people felt about the weather, how they loved it and feared it all at the same time. I wanted to know what it was like being in the path of a tornado that seemed bigger than life itself as it bore down on the city from the west. I knew I had to chronicle the story of those who survived one of the worst tornadoes in historyÂ  - and those who didnât make it.""I vividly recall both of these tornadoes. As a resident in several different communities all located in tornado alley over the years, I, too, have my first memory of a night of storms, flooding, and tornadoes that hooked me on meteorology for life. This interest often has me watching weather radar for different areas of the country, including this massive storm system. More importantly the Moore tornado of 2013 has changed the way the local elementary school where I work conducts our tornado drills, including where we go and the position of the students. I'm certain that this tornado must have changed the way tornado drills are conducted and the locations where students must go for other school districts too.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Penguin for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PVACE6QHN113/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=052542749X#wasThisHelpful","R1PVACE6QHN113","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Far End of Happy by Kathryn Craft is a very highly recommended novel about a suicide standoff and a woman trying to come up with the inner strength to make it through the horrific day.As she is mentally preparing herself for the day, Ronnie (Veronica) Farnham contemplates, ""How many months had it been since she'd been able to relax in her own home?""  Today her husband, Jeff, is supposed to move out of their farmhouse in Bartlesville, located in rural eastern Pennsylvania. Their marriage has been struggling for years, but with Jeff's increased drinking and out -of-control spending, which has led to huge credit card debt, Ronnie knows it is time to leave and try to make a future for her and her two boys.A day that is already guaranteed to be stressful turns into a nightmare when a drunken Jeff pulls his car up to the front of the house. He has had way-to-much to drink, has a hose hanging from his exhaust pipe, a shotgun in the front seat, and is threatening to commit suicide. Ronnie and the boys manage to get the car keys and call 911, but when a crazed Jeff chases them into the house they are afraid. The police arrive but Jeff has taken off, holing up in the office of their farm store, New Hope Farms, with his gun.The police manage to get Ronnie and the boys out of the house and off the farm. Ronnie's mother, Beverly, and Jeff's mother, Janet, meet them at the local firefighter's hall while the police have the road to the farm and the area locked down and under surveillance. The 12 hour standoff has begun. Ronnie manages to get the boys to a friend's house for the day, but she is stuck waiting, with her mother and mother-in-law. The story is told through Ronnie, Beverly, and Janet. Ronnie discovers that there are more family secrets than she thought, as the truth is slowly revealed during the tension packed standoff. We also learn more about the families and the history of each character as each woman reflects on her life.Even as I felt the tension ratchet up during the twelve hour standoff, I also could see the personal reflection from each character as they wondered if they had a role in the day's tragic events. Could the marriage have been saved? Did any one action push Jeff over the edge? At the same time secrets are revealed that might have been helpful if they were made known, if risk factors were discussed. There are a wide range of emotions and questions that would plague anyone in this situation. Craft also realistically includes the ever-present media and their following of the ""story.""I was totally engrossed in this well written, engaging story from start to finish and only learned afterwards that it was based on a personal experience by Kathryn Craft. That would explain her uncanny ability to capture the genuine, raw emotions of each character and honestly confront the effects depression, alcoholism, and suicide can have on a family.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Sourcebooks via Netgalley for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4YE7O4Q5XOJ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=149260495X#wasThisHelpful","R4YE7O4Q5XOJ4","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Dorito Effect by Mark Schatzker is a very highly recommended, well researched account that addresses the cause of the health crisis today as being a direct result of what we have done to our food.In an effort to increase size, and production, we have taken the natural flavor out of food. Our bodies naturally crave flavors that the current food isn't providing so we eat more trying to fill the flavor void we're missing. Focusing on mainly chicken and tomatoes, Schatsker does an excellent job tracing how the change in our food happened and the results. There is a complex relationship between flavor and nutrition in food and we have diluted the flavor to increase size and production. Chicken today doesn't taste anything like the chicken of the past. Tomatoes today are mostly water. ""The rise in obesity is the predictable result of the rise in manufactured deliciousness. Everything we add to food just makes us want it more."" Schatzker points out that the big food companies have ""created the snack equivalent of crystal meth and gotten us all hooked."" Not only is more and more manufactured flavor being added to things, the availability of the food with enhanced flavors is more available.""The Dorito Effect, very simply, is what happens when food gets blander and flavor technology gets better. This book is about how and why that took place. It's also about the consequences, which include obesity and metabolic disturbance along with a cultural love-hate obsession with food. This book argues that we need to begin understanding food through the same lens by which it is experienced: how it tastes. The food crisis we're spending so much time and money on might be better thought of as a large-scale flavor disorder. Our problem isn't calories and what our bodies do with them. Our problem is that we want to eat the wrong food. The longer we ignore flavor, the longer we are bound to be victims of it. This book is also about the solution. The Dorito Effect can be reversed. That's already happening on small farms and in pioneering science labs.""Schatzker notes the words to look for on your food that indicate the presence of chemicals that fool your nose and chemicals that fool your tongue. ""The following words indicate the presence of chemicals that fool your nose: natural flavor(s) natural flavoring(s) artificial flavor(s) flavoring, flavor. The following words indicate the presence of chemicals that fool your tongue: monosodium glutamate MSG disodium guanlyate disodium inosinate torula yeast yeast extract hydrolyzed protein autolyzed yeast saccharin (Sweet Twin, Sweet N Low, Necta Sweet) aspartame (NutraSweet, Equal, Sugar Twin) acesulfame potassium (Ace-K, Sunett, Sweet One) sucralose (Splenda) neotame (Newtame) advantame stevia.""I have been talking about this book the whole time to anyone who will listen. Schatzker does and exceptional job presenting the information and scientific research in an entertaining, accessible, and informative manner. In The Dorito Effect he divides the book into three parts: He tells us what the Dorito effect is, the importance of flavor, and the cure for the Dorito effect.

"Jack of Spades by Joyce Carol Oates is a very highly recommended psychological thriller that also pays homage to Stephen King.Andrew J. Rush is a mainstream mystery writer who has published 28 books and was even dubbed ""the gentleman's Stephen King"" in one review. Andrew is successful, pompous, and egotistical, but likes to think of himself (and he likes to think of himself a lot) as a humble, mild mannered family man. He has been happily married for years and has three grown children. However, unknown to everyone, he is also writing decidedly different novels under the pseudonym Jack of Spades. His Jack of Spades novels are violent, dark, and disturbing. He has a secret room in his house where he keeps these novels. He even writes them on a different desk in his study.When Andrew is accused of plagiarism by a local woman his carefully separated, murderous Jack of Spades alter ego begins to push to the forefront. C. W. Haider is a local woman who claims he physically stole his novels from her. She is very litigious. He's not the first author she has sued for the same thing, including Stephen King and John Updike. At the same time Andrew's adult daughter finds one of his Jack of Spades novels in his study and decides to read it. She thinks this ""friend"" of her father who writes the horrible books is stealing ideas/events from their family's lives. And his wife may be having an affair.As these events collide and suspicions begin to plague Andrew, his carefully ordered and compartmentalized mind begins to crack. His alter ego, the vicious Jack of Spades, begins to push to the forefront and he wants revenge. What we get is a mind disassociating with itself and see an author's slow slide into madness.The writing is brilliant in this novel. Narrated in the first person, Andrew Rush is really the only character in the novel, and we get to know him very, very well. Oates has also made this novel a tribute to Stephen King, who becomes a minor character in the novel through Andrew's thoughts. This is a short novel so it moves quite quickly. There are a few surprises too, so be prepared.Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Mysterious Press for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IOCC2F9CM8VO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PSSGPVW#wasThisHelpful","R1IOCC2F9CM8VO","A2IF83HCHVSRW2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF83HCHVSRW2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Wright Brothers by David McCullough is a masterful, brilliantly written, extensively researched biography of Wilbur and Orville Wright. It is very highly recommended and will be the definitive biography on the Wright Brothers. Through use of the Wright Papers, McCullough does an excellent job chronicling their story and bringing the brothers to life through their diaries, notebooks, scrapbooks and personal correspondence in this biography.Together, the Wright brothers from Dayton, Ohio had the determination and the focus to begin the age of flight. Wilbur was the introvert, a genius, and the abstract thinker while Orville was the extrovert and the mechanical genius. While the brothers did not have extensive formal education, their home was filled with books and they both had curious, inquisitive minds. They also had the persistence and grit needed to decode what they were seeing in the flight if birds and how that would help them create their first flyer. Their father, Bishop Milton Wright and sister Katharine also helped as they could and provided support when needed.All of the trials at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina over several years that eventually resulted in the first successful sustained flight on December 17, 1903 are faithfully recounted. It was quite frustrating to see the American government dismiss the Wright brothers and their invention; while the Smithsonian wasted 70,000 thousand dollars trying to achieve what the brothers had already figured out. It really wasn't until the French embraced them that Americans started to take note.McCullough includes numerous photos and excerpts from newspapers and letters throughout the book that are credited.

"I do have significant redness, and I do see some improvement when I have this on my face - it's not perfect, but I'd have to wear enough makeup to frost a cake to get those kinds of result.

I even tried pulling off the tiniest bit from one piece and sucking on that and it still stuck to my teeth and I was uncomfortable trying more.Don't let that stop you though, everyone else in the office loved them and they were devoured in mere days.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG7VWFHYFN68R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZANRDEI#wasThisHelpful","RG7VWFHYFN68R","A2F540P3L6P5CL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F540P3L6P5CL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Edit 10/15. The product I originally reviewed below was for the sliced in gravy product, but I was recently offered via Vine a case of the Chunky Loaf. This is a style I'd seen in the store, but the chunky in the title threw me off - I do not like big chunks in gravy that kitty ends up only lapping at the gravy with chunks too big for her, so I'd always passed this by. I was surprised to get this home and open a can and it's really a pate style, all very soft and mushy and I didn't get any chunky at all. But that's good, because she likes pate style. One surprising difference with this pate over other brands I've tried is that this that after being in the fridge overnight, the product was much softer and pliable than other pate brands I've used - a HUGE plus for me.I have two cats, but only Miss fussy tummy gets the wet stuff (that's all she'll eat), the other gets Hills Metabolic for weight control. With the wet food, she'll only eat pate and/or minced styles, the stuff with the larger chunks all she'll manage is lapping up the gravy and leaving the meat behind, so I was cautious about this being ""sliced"" and she wouldn't eat it. No worries, this sliced food is just a wee bit larger than Nutro's minced varieties. Miss fussy tummy loves this stuff, and the gravy is a nice plus since she doesn't care to drink water. It's also easier to dish up than the pate styles - no smooshing needed :)I have been purchasing the Nutro minced styles by the case on Amazon, but those are always one flavor per case, so this is a nice option to have three flavors in one case, and the packaging was good so that the cans didn't bump around and get bent up in transit. NOTE: these cans are the small size (3 oz), and  not the larger ones and for some the price on these might be a bit dear, but YMMV how much a happy kitty tummy is worth. And it's worth shopping around, some sellers charge quite a bit more for the same canned product, even on Amazon. I was surprised at the difference until I was at the big box pet store and bought twelve minced variety to get my discount. Color me surprised when my twelve can purchase was $19 and a case of 24 on Amazon was around $25 and change. Plus I don't have to go to the store and wait in line at the cash register.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A5WY2UJGVH52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WEIQ0AU#wasThisHelpful","R3A5WY2UJGVH52","A2F540P3L6P5CL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F540P3L6P5CL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've never tried any of Burt's Bees skin care, so I was looking forward to giving one of them a trial, but I am terribly disappointed. This moisturizer is terribly thick, I had to pump a whole bunch of times (like 50) just to get anything coming out of the pump dispenser - not a good thing.

"I don't have a whole lot of lap tops in my world, so this is more of a non-techie review - I only have the Acer Aspire V5-122P-0863 11.6-Inch Touchscreen Laptop (Chill Silver) I got from Amazon Vine in 2013. Wow, what a difference. The speed is lightning fast, I'm not a gamer nor do I spend all day watching videos, but the web pages I have visited load quickly and never get buggy (I swear, this is faster than my desktop with Windows 7). The navigation pad is very easy, and nice and large. The screen display is excellent quality, and just perfect for pulling up the live kitten cam and watching the kittens play :)The initial battery charge took about an hour, and it held a charge for I think at least four hours when I had it in constant use - again, I'm not playing games - but when I turned on the music it seemed not to last quite as long. Still, much longer battery life than the Acer Aspire I have been using. One funny thing about the power cord, and the only reason I'm knocking off a star at this time is the 'box' on the charging cord gets very hot at times. Not all the time, sometimes not at all; but it did get very, very warm the first time I took it out of the box to charge. I haven't contacted the manufacturer yet, and it hasn't seemed that warm since then (again - not all the time), but I don't let it plug in long and I don't walk off for hours leaving it unattended.As for the keyboard? I am an old school typist in the days of IBM Selectrics, and smaller keyboards on tablets and the Acer Aspire I have just don't cut it for me. I don't like to hunt and peck, yet I don't always want to see at the desktop so I can type fast on a real keyboard. This keyboard is a win, and there's an option to turn off the track pad while typing so one doesn't keep hitting it. F6 I believe is the right button.Sound - awesome, even better with a good set of headphones. I notice quite a difference between this and the Acer Aspire I own - with that I can have it full tilt whilst watching the Kitten Cam and hear all the kitty action (Google The Critter Room Live Stream to get the link), with the Aspire I'd need to have earphones to hear well. Awesome.This laptop is very slim and not too heavy, so nice and portable. The only caveats I'd give are 1) the black coloring: like another reviewer mentioned, fingerprints show up everywhere the instant you touch it, and might be a deal-breaker for the more fussy minded peeps. 2) unless I'm really missing the boat, this is not a touch screen. If it is a touch screen, would someone tell me how to turn it on?","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LEQMKZDXJZHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WR286FU#wasThisHelpful","R1LEQMKZDXJZHE","A2F540P3L6P5CL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F540P3L6P5CL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this lamp a lot, although I would not recommend it for your nightstand - the long wand of the light fixture just didn't sit well against a raised bed like mine is (pillow top, plus a gel pad and LOTS of pillows). It would have been crashing all the time. That said, I did rearrange things by my reading spot in the living room (getting rid of a cumbersome pole lamp), and it's just perfect. I love the softer light, plus the options to go brighter or less bright. If I read the instructions correctly, the bulb cannot be replaced, so I hope it lasts a long, long time.My only minor quibble is the USB charging port is fairly useless (at least to me). I plugged in both my Fire HD and HDX and neither took a charge. My Blu smartphone did take a charge, but it took quite a bit longer than it usually takes to fully charge. The world will not fall apart if I'm unable to use the charging port, but I wouldn't purchase this just for that purpose.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REYVXDYZMF1QX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UV41MAC#wasThisHelpful","REYVXDYZMF1QX","A2F540P3L6P5CL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F540P3L6P5CL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love soft, cuddly blankets (as do the kitties), and I had one that was at the end of its life span, so I was thrilled to get a chance at a new one. The purple is very vibrant, but there are some other color schemes listed on the product page. The blanket came inside a zip bag, and then tied up with some lovely ribbons to hold it together, so would make a great presentation that way for a gift. The white/purple pattern is on the one side, with a solid bright purple on the flip side. And can I just say how incredibly soft this is. I have another lap size blanket I picked up at the pet store, that was designed for kitties (but we share), and I thought that was super soft, but that's nothing compared to how soft this blanket it.

Love the clean/white options as well as the three different speeds.This is an excellent product, as always, and nice clean teeth so I get brownie points from the dental hygienist.

"While there was quite a bit more assembly required than I expected, it was still fairly easy once I put the pieces together per the very well done instructions - bonus points for the part labeling in the instructions AND on the packages of the parts. Huge bonus points. The only problems I incurred after that were some of the curvy pieces were a bit hard to fit as they were supposed to and took a bit of muscle power - don't hand it off to your 90 year old grandmother and leave it for her to deal with. I also ended up with some parts popping out of place until I put more muscle into snapping them as tight as I could.The end result is a really cute little condo, and I do like that the cushion has Velcro to keep it in its place. The bottom of the 'inside room' doesn't have any padding, so I put an old small blanket in there for extra kitty comfort.All is good, and the girls showed some interest Friday when it first came home, but after that there hasn't been much interest in checking it out further, but it has been terribly hot and they pretty much stay with their favorite, known spots.

"I'm feeling lazy today, so I'll let part of the blurb do the recapping and then I'll leave my thoughts on the reading experience.From Spain to England to the Caribbean, follow the fortunes of Armando, restless wanderer with an uncertain heritage: Gabriella, whose beauty hides the secret of her birth; Paloma, child of a Spanish grandee and an Indian wise--woman; and Will, master-musician who flees the Inquisition because of his Jewish blood.Appalled by the cruelty of their countrymen, they seek to help the native peoples of the new lands, organizing the resistance to the Conquistadors in the land that will be called Florida.Jewel of the Sea is the second in a trilogy based on the Spanish explorations and exploitations of the new world. I don't know what prompted me to pick up the second book prior to reading the first, but I did, and it did stand up on its own fairly well; I had a few times where it felt like I was the last one to come to the party and missed the introductions, but I caught on quickly enough.After reading the description quoted above, I had expectations of a story centered in Florida, and was quite surprised that so much time was spent by all the main characters in the England of Henry Tudor and his early years married to Katherine (Catherine in this book) of Aragon. I was even more surprised at how Henry and Catherine were portrayed in this book and I would warn historical purists this might be a bit off-putting. ---->>>slight spoiler Color me really surprised when Paloma, who had been captured as a slave by the Spanish was given as a sex-slave gift to Henry on the occasion of his wedding to Catherine and the 'gift' was given at court with Henry's queen present .That might be a bit off-putting to some readers, YMMV.Finally, about two-thirds of the way through the book the *cough* action *cough* switches to the West Indies, where are hero Armando builds himself a large working sugar plantation and 'refinery' (a wee bit early for all that, isn't it?). There's also some involvement with the local tribes and their battles with the Spanish invaders and whatnot.*yawn*So, this started off well with a dashing hero and beautiful heroine and the first third was fairly well paced and interesting, the last of it was just boring-boring-boring and I admit to skimming quite a lot.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PB0ACDUL2I7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812521609#wasThisHelpful","R1PB0ACDUL2I7X","A2F540P3L6P5CL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F540P3L6P5CL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Burma, Victorian era. The year is not named, but it's after the US Civil War.The girl: Lysistrata Herriot and her father arrive in Rangoon where he's accepted a doctoring position at the local hospital. There is some scandal of sorts that led Lysistrata (what a name!) and her father to leave family and Boston behind with little money in their pocketbooks or clothes on their backs. Our heroine has a mind of her own, and doesn't follow society's strictest guidelines; she takes a while to shed her plain exterior and shine in the local, restrictive British community. But when she does, oh does she shine and catches all the young males in her web.The guy: Richard Harley is a mix of east and west, and from the wrong side of the blanket to boot. British society only tolerates him for his pirate privateering skills at bringing needed goods (like medicines for the hospital) to Rangoon. Handsome, wealthy, dangerous and oh-so connected to the darker side of Rangoon.Well, I won't spoil, but things happen and our hero is framed for murder and high-tails it out of town to his palace in northern Burma; but he's got to save our heroine from a sticky wicket first and then there's no easy way to get her back to her father, besides the fact he believes she's the cause of his current difficulties and wants a bit of revenge.""She owed him a very large debt - which he would take out of her beautiful, bitchy hide.""Well, fasten your seatbelts for a wild, bumpy ride through the Burmese jungle. Elephants, a tiger, rickety bridges over deep ravines that don't always hold up a person's weight. Snakes, monkeys and other primates, bugs, sore backsides, death defying shoot outs (or the occasional poison dart) with the resident baddies. And once they get to this magical palace you'd think everything is safe and secure for the eventual jungle loving you know is going to happen, 'cause we've got a 'housekeeper' that hates our heroine on site and there's a crazy woman in the west wing of the tower, and gosh knows what all else happens but it does. Oh, and three women in the harem section...Wow, this was an unputdownable solid four star read for me until the final 150 or so pages when everything stops for some investigating and a long, dull trial to finally resolve things.

"This bit of the blurb pretty much sums up the basic storyline better than I could, so I'll use it instead of rehashing it. ""In the darkest hours of her life, disgraced heiress Philadelphia Hunt is approached by a handsome stranger, a Brazilian jewel-miner named Eduardo Tavares. He makes an outrageous proposition—disguise herself and join him in a devious con to swindle America’s upper crust out of their riches. Philadelphia is desperate, and intrigued, by both this enchanting stranger and his promises of her return to high society.""As you'll see from the book listing at GR, this is the third in a series called The Masqueraders, but as I understand it from reviews, each book stands alone, it's just the masquerade theme that ties them together, so you're safe to pick them up in any order.""In her place would be Mademoiselle Felise de Ronsard, aristocratic French orphan and heir to a lost fortune.""This was such a fun blend of romance and mystery as our pair take on New York society and try to pull off their little flim-flam scheme (loved 'Ahkbar'!). Loved the older, bored widow who took 'Felise' under her wing. Loved the chemistry between the two, the slow build up of sexual tension and sheltered Philadelphia's introduction to the sensual side of herself. Well done. "" She was no longer Miss Philadelphia Hunt, the young socialite who wore lovely gowns and garlands of violets in her hair. She was only a young woman dancing beneath the stars in her slippers and nightgown, and she had never been more beautiful in his eyes.""Oh, that guitar playing outside her window...*fans self*Oh but, there's the little problem of a vendetta against her now dead father and Philadelphia's reaction when she discovers who is behind it all, plus a deliciously nasty villain to come between them just when you think everything's going to come up roses...All in all a very good read and one that was hard to put down. The sex might be a bit much for those who prefer it behind closed doors, but I felt it was more tastefully done than you see in some of these older romances, and these two did steam up the pages. My only quibble is at the end a certain villain made an odd turn in character that I didn't quite understand, but that's splitting hairs. One of the more enjoyable Kindle freebies I've picked up over the years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WSP5GAOP5VEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GWLICO2#wasThisHelpful","R1WSP5GAOP5VEU","A2F540P3L6P5CL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F540P3L6P5CL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Peopled with characters with terribly silly names like Lord Uppingwood and Lady Killerby.

"""Miss Pritchard is a frivolous piece of fluff held together by rigid convention and a lunatic devotion to etiquette.""The first part of the book description pretty much sums up the basic storyline, so I'll be lazy today and quote from that:""With fiery hair and a spirit to match, Eulalie Pritchard defies her father and flees London to marry Sir Percival Sterling -- a man she hardly knows. Then Lalie reaches Para, Brazil -- only to discover that Sir Percival's luxurious rubber plantation is another 3,000 treacherous miles down the dangerous Amazon. And dashing March Addison, the one man who can guarantee her safe passage, is as dangerous and unpredictable as the river itself.I do love a good jungle love storyline, and they're very hard to find - my favorite is still Shadow Play, but this book comes in at a very close second. I have to admit at first the heroine annoyed me to no end, and thisclose to being labeled TSTL, but she really came into her own in the second half when stuff really started flying and the baddies were everywhere.

"""Blood glistened in the lamplight against the red and gold of the Turkey rug. It had pooled on the floor besides a drinks trolley.""This is going to a very short review, since to do otherwise would give away too much of the story. As the book opens, a powerful (and quite nasty) duke is found dead, and the Rannoch's governess is suspect #1, so Malcolm and Suzanne are in the thick of things, despite his 'retirement' from the spy business. Needless to say, just about everyone has a good motive for wanting to see the duke dead, even our hero and heroine. The plot twists and turns and twists and turns and there's plenty of unexpected surprises along the way.I loved this, only a couple of very minor quibbles. I think the word 'quite' is used a wee bit too frequently (YMMV), and I'll wait for a ruling from the Peerage Purists, but I think a duchess is addressed as your grace and not duchess? I also got a giggle over a small typo towards the end. When Grant first began this series with another publisher the pair were called Charles and Melanie Fraser. Lol, but there was only Malcolm and David in the room and all of a sudden there was a mention of Charles. Oops. Still a great read and a clever mystery. I'm ready for the next book, and I hope we get more of Laura and O'Roarke.If you've read all the way through the series up to The Berkeley Square Affair, you know there's been a hitch in the Rannoch's supposedly happy marriage, but for those who have not read at least through Imperial Scandal and plan to read these soon, I would recommend staying away from the book blurbs for this recent book - there be spoilers.

"I am a second floor condo dweller, and not being fond of my neighbors or the yellow jackets, I don't use the balcony much. But - I have an old plastic chair and footstool that's been catching grime outside for years, so I thought they'd be a good test for this. I would have included pictures, but the chair, etc. were so disgusting I'm too embarrassed, but that was quite some buildup. I sprayed them down (have used almost the entire bottle), and I'm seeing a lot of dirt melting away, but not all of it. I've had to do some scrubbing, and to get them white as they were when new, it's going to take more product and elbow room then I have energy for; they're heading out to the trash bin shortly.So, a good product to get a head start and cut back on the elbow grease, but not the miracle cure the promo seems to promise.

"And I wished I'd looked much closer at the product weight and dimension prior to requesting this from Vine, I had dithered back and forth for half a day whether to request this or not. Being a condo dweller, a high-end music system isn't the best idea if one wants to get along with one's neighbors, but then again my older stereo had died some years ago and since there was still one left I decided to live life on the edge and go for it. Color me surprised when it landed (delivered to the office) and the guys were trying to tell me how big it was - the box it came in was so heavy it was labeled for a two or three person lift. The speakers are H.U.G.E., and the operating unit is fairly good sized as well, and something to take into consideration depending on the size of your home and whether you have someone to get it up the stairs - I'm going to have to pay someone to get it up to my second floor condo - can't even lift one of those speakers on my own.That said, if you're seriously into music, have plenty of room in your home and don't have to worry about ticking off the neighbors, this is an awesome piece of equipment with a lot of bells and whistles (many of them way beyond my limited skills, i.e. the virtual football button). Oh well, easy to set up and plug in the speakers and connect to my phone and/or pop in a CD and we were up and running until we figured out how the bells and whistles worked. The light feature has several color/themed displays (or turned off as is my preference) they flash on the operating unit (they still called receivers like the old skool stereos?), and on the speakers - but not in time to the music being played. There are DJ buttons for funky sound effects, for those who like funky sound effects, and other buttons to change the quality of the music (like bass, etc.). It also has two USB ports. The instructions say it can also be chained up with other music systems for maximum music during an event like a wedding or other party.Since I haven't had a 'real' stereo for some years since the last one bit the dust, this technology is a bit new to me, but fun to explore, and the lads at the office have been helping me with it (boy, are they drooling), and thankfully I have a patient boss who hasn't frowned when we've tried the higher volumes (and boy, is the sound quality all kinds of awesome). Overall, an outstanding system and one I would recommend for those who like to party loudly with their music. If you're looking for something to use to play quiet background music, I'm sure there are better and less expensive options out there. As for someone doing a stint as DJ for parties and other venues? Like I said, the sound was awesome to my ears, but there's also the hefty weight of those speakers to take into consideration. Perhaps the younger set wouldn't mind lugging them around from venue to venue, but that is something to take into consideration whether this product is a good fit or not and worth the hefty price tag. It is not a good fit for my tiny condo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RXBDONJRKHZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWQMSAY#wasThisHelpful","R3RXBDONJRKHZX","A2F540P3L6P5CL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F540P3L6P5CL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We peeps in accounting are staple snobs, they need to be neat, clean (no sharp edges for tearing of skin) and preferably effortless. We also do a wide variety of stapling tasks, from 2-4 pages up to 60+ pages (that's what the decades old Swingline heavy duty is for). Most of our larger reports are in the 30-40 page range, and this stapler is a perfect fit. A box of staples came in the box, and they're the shorter staples than what we have in the HD Swingline. Piece of cake to load them up and get stapling, and the only stapling tasks this hasn't been up to are the larger jobs that need a larger staple - and also a larger opening (mouth) to accommodate the stapling task. I.e. the Rapesco has an opening of about 1/2"" (if there's a way to adjust the height, I haven't figured it out yet, and can't find it in the instructions) vs. the old Swingline that's about 1 1/2"".This stapler also does very nicely on smaller reports (say 5-10 pages) and finishes cleanly without any excess staple sticking out for hurt hands like would happen with the Swingline. We've been test driving this for about a week, with excellent results, the only time it has *failed* is when we've experimented with a staple job too large for this staple and/or the staples that came along with it.Happy camper and happy stapler snob here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MGLHJGU129RP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D7IMP4Q#wasThisHelpful","R2MGLHJGU129RP","A2F540P3L6P5CL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F540P3L6P5CL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I didn't notice any lag or impact on the response to the iPad in any way. The arm which holds the iPad slides easily for quick adjustments and everything is so smooth.The only drawback from the case is that it feels a bit chinsey. I know that helps keep it light weight and portable, but it almost feels hollow and therefore didn't feel as ""nice"" as I was expecting based on the look.Overall this is a great case and one that I'll be using quite often!(I received this case in exchange for an honest and unbiased review)","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I761HUNVZSOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HMO6A6#wasThisHelpful","R3I761HUNVZSOA","A1H4OOUVRTZYNS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4OOUVRTZYNS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"HOW IT LOOKS- The gray is a gorgeous, darker neutral color that works with so many decors. The piping around the edges isn't white - it's soft gray, which is awesome because that's subtle and tasteful.- It doesn't look cheap, but it also doesn't look particularly nice either. It's a middle of the road couch as an accent, but definitely not something to base your room around unless you're on a budget.HOW IT FEELS- The fabric is soft, but not plush with ridges like a soft cordoroy.- Firm seat cushions.- Softer back cushions.- Nice deep seating.ASSEMBLY- My husband and I put this together in less than 10 minutes.- There was minimal damage on one of the parts that you can't see, so we didn't worry about it.- Nothing is screwed in, so no tools are needed.OVERALLI am so in love with the color and aesthetic of this couch that I don't care if it looks a little less nice than our other furniture. We included it in our living room as additional seating and due to the neutral design and color, it fits right in! A firmer couch is definitely something I'm excited about as I know they will soften over time.If you're looking for a starter couch or an addition for your space, this is a great option! It doesn't look high end, but the color and design helps it blend well into just about any space.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VPAP5B1Z9VDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ULIE3T0#wasThisHelpful","R1VPAP5B1Z9VDM","A1H4OOUVRTZYNS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4OOUVRTZYNS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book has SO MUCH hype attached to it and it absolutely, positively, lived up to every single ounce of it. There's class struggles and magic and coming of age and diversity and minor swoons and just EVERYTHING you want in an epic fantasy!Basically, Kelsier is set to overthrow the oppressive Lord Ruler and he pulls together a rag tag crew of Allomancers (magic using folk) to get it done. Chiefly of those is Vin, a teenage girl who is an incredibly powerful Allomancer and has no idea. So they spend time training and plotting and infiltrating before everything comes to a head and it's wild and crazy and spectacular.What I loved most about Vin was her coming of age. She starts off as a girl who stays in the shadows to stay alive. As a thief, she's easy bait so she tries to blend as much as possible. She trusts no one. Eventually, through the gang and through Kelsier as a father figure, she slowly starts trusting others and believing in herself while still keeping this sense of ""I can't possibly be special"" which makes her so very endearing.The cast is diverse, multi-faceted, flawed and absolutely relatable. Their conversations draw you in and give you a sense of what it's like to BE in that world and to FEEL their struggle and to WANT them so desperately to win against the very, very unlikely odds.While it does take some time to get going and gain momentum, Mistborn takes all of the elements we love in epic fantasy and centers it around a ""job"" with a gang of underground criminals that creates one of the most unique and unputdownable plots I've ever read, ever.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5RXKOG0M8VP7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002GYI9C4#wasThisHelpful","R5RXKOG0M8VP7","A1H4OOUVRTZYNS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4OOUVRTZYNS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I did one ""sweep"" of my arm in our living room (large with high ceilings) and it was almost too much. The scent is a crisp, clean smell that obviously smells like air freshener, but not in an unpleasant way.This is the canister I keep in my daughter's room by her changing table now!

Here's an overview of the latest Portable Trimmer from Cricut!- The handle is a little bigger than other paper trimmers I've used, which makes it easier to hold on to and slide easily.- I tested this trimmer on cardstock and paper of different weights and textures and I was very happy with the clean cuts it provided every time.- The more measuring marks, the better! I don't want to have to mark my paper every time I want to make a cut.- Blade storage within the trimmer is GENIUS.- Swing-out arm makes cutting 12x12 pages (and bigger) so easy.- More lines = easier measuring = more exact cuts.

"I currently have 6 of these Cricut StandardGrip Adhesive Cutting Mats in my rotation and they are my absolute favorite. Let me tell you why!- The border on the edges is just perfect for being able to line up your paper easily on the mat.- The adhesive on the mat easily allows you to re-position your paper and other materials before and after you cut.- I can easily cut vinyl, cardstock, paper, and loads of other materials with the same detail and precision thanks to the grip with this mat.- With repeated use, the mat loses some stickiness. To get that back, all I have to do is scrape off all the residual fibers/dust, wash it with soapy water, and let it air dry and then the adhesive service is back. THAT IS IT. It's amazing!- The mat bends without cracking or breaking, even after repeated use.These are compatible with various Cricut machines and can be used with other electronic cutting machines as well.

"It pains me to give this only 2 stars! But trust me, I do have my reasons.First, this is the second book in a trilogy. I read and LOVED the first book (The Winner's Curse) and so I should have been really excited about book 2! I even refreshed my memory by reading recaps of book 1 to remember where we left off.Usually when I start a book in the series beyond the first one, I fall back in step with the characters and writing within 5-10 pages. I remember why I enjoyed the previous book(s) and am swept away into that world all over again! I did not have that experience with The Winner's Crime.I just could not get that spark of excitement I had for the first book! I think a big part of the lack of interest for me was due to the plot being focused so heavily on the star-crossed and distanced lovers of Kestrel and Arin. In The Winner's Curse - we get to KNOW Kestrel and KNOW the struggles and KNOW the politics before the romance blooms, which is great. With The Winner's Crime, we're steeped in longing romance for a very long time and the plot just kind of spins it's wheels, until closer to the end in which things happen to set up for book 3.I'm sure The Winner's Kiss (book 3) will weave together the star-crossed lovers and the plot in a more cohesive way, but I'm not sure that my interest will sustain until then.Bear in mind that I am WAY in the minority here! Most of my book friends LOVED the first and second book in this series and I admit that Kestrel is a smart, strong, brave heroine and I respect that immensely. The whole ""I miss him"" and ""I miss her"" thing just dragged me down to the point of total disinterest. But if you're all about Arin and Kestrel, then you'll probably be all about The Winner's Crime!","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYQPMW43KWUWT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374384703#wasThisHelpful","RYQPMW43KWUWT","A1H4OOUVRTZYNS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4OOUVRTZYNS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pros:- Very sleek. The brushed aluminum look is aesthetically gorgeous and the dark metal paired with the black keys is quite slick.- Responsive touch screen. I was very impressed with how responsive it is! I have an iPad (2nd generation) and this performs better than my iPad (which I thought was just fine)- 1 TB of storage. Which is a LOT of internal storage! There's also an option to build your own cloud, but I feel like that isn't really necessary with Dropbox and Google Drive and the other services available already.- Screen variability. The screen does NOT detatch, but it does flip backward and tent and remains firmly in place of wherever you leave it.- Processor and Graphics Card are great. The Intel i7 processor is the top of the line. When that's paired with this Intel HD Graphics 5500 card, it creates a tablet/laptop that can easily watch HD movies, and while it won't have the level of graphics more serious gamers are looking for, the rest of us will be happy.Cons:- Weight. It comes in at just under 5 lbs, which isn't too heavy, but definitely not as light as some other convertible laptop/touchscreen combinations out there.- Boot Time. I've had this computer about 2 days. When I timed the cold boot, it took 1:17 to get to the log in screen, and 25 seconds to get to the home screen after I logged in. Shut down took 7 seconds to go blank, but 27 seconds before the fans and computer were totally quiet.- Touch Pad. This is the most common complaint, and for good reason. I didn't notice any significant issues at first, but the longer you use it, the more you notice the sluggishness when scrolling (which is also opposite directionally from my Chromebook, which was weird to me).- Streaks. When my iPad is one, I can't see the streaks from my fingers from swiping. When this is on, I can see the swipes on the edges of the screen from when I used it as a tablet.Overall: This is an incredibly powerful 2 in 1 that I'm happy to have as part of my computer family. The dual functionality of tablet and laptop is ideal for couch computer usage - tablet for scrolling through my Feedly reader and chatting on Twitter, laptop for replying to emails and blogging.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20559W0V0EHB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TU7UAU4#wasThisHelpful","R20559W0V0EHB1","A1H4OOUVRTZYNS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4OOUVRTZYNS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first time I've used a whitening toothpaste, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I've used this product for about a week and after poking around other reviews a bit about other whitening toothpastes, here's what I can say:THE GOOD- No increased tooth sensitivity- It feels like my teeth and mouth are getting as clean as they were with standard toothpaste- The taste isn't terrible, but you can definitely tell the increased hydrogen peroxide with how it foams in your mouth.THE MEH- I've been using the product about a week, and I can't say the notice is that significant. I mean, no one has said anything about it but since I look at my teeth every day, I feel like they are a bit whiter than they were before.- I definitely did NOT notice a chance in 3 days. I've only started to notice a difference in the whiteness of my teeth in the past day or two.I'm intrigued enough to keep it going for the full tube and then will make my decision on whether or not to purchase more. If there isn't a significant change, I'll most likely switch back to the standard toothpaste that has a better flavor and doesn't have extra chemicals and what not.But if you're looking for a gentle whitening toothpaste that doesn't increase tooth sensitivity and won't make you gag - this is your brand!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ABVOE49JQ1OJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TDNIWBY#wasThisHelpful","R3ABVOE49JQ1OJ","A1H4OOUVRTZYNS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4OOUVRTZYNS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I am also a fan of dice based games as a light filler or casual party game too, so this was sure to be a win-win!The idea of the game is you roll dice, keep what you want to try and get city cards for VPs, and try not to roll too many ""nuclear"" symbols! There are some slight variations based on cards and certain die rolls, but that's the gist.

"I should start off by saying that we have the Thule Chariot and absolutely LOVE IT and so we were very excited to try out the Glide Sport Stroller by Thule. (You can see my review of the Chariot here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/review/RJXY01PTWSL57/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FGLRDVC)The Glide Sport Stroller has a fixed front wheel (which means it never ever rotates) which provides increased stability when you're moving quickly jogging or pulling it behind on a bicycle. However, if you're looking for a more casual non-active stroller, you'll probably be better off with the Chariot or other Thule stroller. But if you're looking for a stroller that has all of the features you want with loads of protection, safety, and is very lightweight - this is for you! It folds down for storing and transporting and the seat reclines to a near flat position for napping little ones.A couple other things that really impressed me with the Glide Sport Stroller was the weight of the stroller itself is only 22 lbs (that includes wheels and everything) but it holds up to 75 lbs! Also, my husband was able to put this stroller together in under 10 minutes. For real.The stroller is what you'd expect from Thule - lightweight, high quality, stable, aerodynamic and provides a smooth and comfortable ride for the kiddo. Thule also does crazy amounts of safety testing so their products exceed the safety standards that are set.

"My five-year-old likes to have his hair short and spiky. He also hates scissors and hair trimmers. Giving him a haircut in the past has been a chore and a half, but I love this Panasonic Trimmer. It is relatively light weight and pretty quiet. But the best thing about it is that there is one attachment that you add to the head, and all of the length adjustments take place with a dial.For my little guy, this is a godsend. I can make quick adjustments while I'm cutting, and he doesn't have time to get distracted and pitch a fit. He also can't insist that I use a particular attachment even when I know that it will not give him the look he wants.Because this unit is lightweight, I could remove the hair trimmer attachment and maneuver it easily around his ears and the back of his neck and get a great precision cut. He was still nervous, but not as nervous as he has been with previous trimmers.Another thing I love about this trimmer is that the way the trimmer attachment is shaped, it catches hair as I'm cutting. Sure, there's still some that goes on the floor, but most of it goes into the trimmer attachment. When I'm giving a trim of a few centimeters, I can rinse it all out when I'm done; when I'm cutting longer strands,I can just shake it off into the trash can.Washing the trimmer was quick and easy. There is an area on one side where the directions tell you to flush water through, and an opening on the other side allows the water flow to come out. Cleaning a hair trimmer has never been easier.I love this trimmer, and I love that it lets me give my little guy the look he wants without all the tears.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WLK0L5LRNMUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U3A1X0S#wasThisHelpful","R2WLK0L5LRNMUX","A19WEEGB05YAZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19WEEGB05YAZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"War of Two is an easily-accessible book, particularly good for those with an interest in Revolution-era American history, but not necessarily a extensive knowledge of all the details. Although the title and subtitle put the emphasis on the infamous duel between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton, it is more a dual biography (pun slightly intended) of the two Founding Fathers with some emphasis on the dispute that claimed the life of one and the political career of the other. John Sedgwick writes in a fluid style, never too dry, and does not favor either Burr or Hamilton over the other. (This seems particularly appropriate since he begins the book with a letter from Hamilton to his own ancestor, onetime Speaker of the House Theodore Sedgwick, whom he says was one of the few people able to maintain friendly ties to both Burr and Hamilton in the final days of their feud.)Though War of Two doesn't seem like it would contain too much new information for serious history buffs, it is a compelling read for those who don't know much about either Hamilton or Burr aside from the duel, but want to know more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IUQV0LERJ56K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592408524#wasThisHelpful","R2IUQV0LERJ56K","A19WEEGB05YAZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19WEEGB05YAZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's good on its own and really good with a few dashes of Louisiana hot sauce. It does have both high fructose corn syrup and MSG in it. While I can do without either, I don't generally go out of my way to avoid them either. If I could get the same flavor without these two ingredients, I might even drink a tomato cocktail more often.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DP8AGEJWA2A1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5RFMEG#wasThisHelpful","R3DP8AGEJWA2A1","A19WEEGB05YAZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19WEEGB05YAZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really wanted to like this book, as the premise is so very promising. Unfortunately, it was difficult to immerse myself in it because the writing is just so heavy-handed. The sentence structure is such that I spent more time parsing sentences than anything else. The characters, too, aren't especially likable. I felt sorry for the narrator, but I couldn't quite empathize with her. She is the youngest child, both spoiled and neglected by her parents, and left out by her three older sisters.In laying out the story, Haydu tries to keep too much under wraps for too long. That attempt to build suspense bothered me more than it intrigued me, especially once I realized that the book would be so depressing.I'm not of the mind that young adult fiction always has to have a happy ending, but the magical aspects of the book led me to expect more fun and less darkness. This book didn't deliver.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R320O12OUESUV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062352717#wasThisHelpful","R320O12OUESUV5","A19WEEGB05YAZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19WEEGB05YAZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"David Kirk's second book about Musashi Miyamoto isn't quite as compelling as the first, Child of Vengeance, but it comes close and is still a must-read for aficionados of historical fiction or feudal Japan. Following the Battle of Sekigahara (the final scene of Child of Vengeance), Musashi has become increasingly disillusioned with the samurai code, in particular ritual suicide, sepukku. Embarking on a (foolhardy) crusade of violence and marked for death by the Yoshioka school, he encounters characters (mostly of Kirk's creation) from whom he forms, directly and indirectly, a more developed philosophy of rebellion against ""The Way."" Of the supporting cast, the foreign-born Yoshioka adept Akiyama, the blind immigrant Ameku, and Goemon, the northerner appointed as the Tokogawa's governor of Kyoto, are the most important and best-developed (and not only because they each have a unique reason to see Kyoto culture as outsiders).Musashi's feud with the Yoshioka takes up most of the book. While altered slightly from most historical accounts of the same events (which don't always cast Musashi in a light modern readers would find sympathetic), it is a plausible series of events. The various successive members of the Yoshioka family to head the school have unique characters and different takes on Musashi, but all are constricted by their devotion to The Way of bushido.The book ends with many questions still unaddressed, but foremost among them is when we can expect another book from Kirk about Musashi, who is still in his early 20s at this point. The real Musashi continued to build his legend for decades, and I hope to get at least one or two more books dramatizing his ""future"" adventures.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R164WDN8Y69FDB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385536658#wasThisHelpful","R164WDN8Y69FDB","A19WEEGB05YAZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19WEEGB05YAZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always wondered if Bose speakers would live up to the hype, and, simply put, they do. The sound produced by this small, one-piece system far outperforms any stereo equipment I've ever owned. The setup is simple, another advantage over a system involving multiple devices and cords.Although incredibly easy to use, the range of options is extensive, allowing most features to be customized to one's personal preference. As an alarm clock (of sorts), this flexibility gives this another advantage. Also, the built-in radio seems to get FAR better FM reception than any other radio (we live in an area where reception is usually spotty, but haven't heard any static on the Music System IV from stations that otherwise are difficult to listen to).The lack of bluetooth is a minor inconvenience, though easily overshadowed by the sound quality and ease of use. Some might think that the choice of a CD player over bluetooth is a drawback; however, for those who listen to CDs, this isn't an issue.Definitely recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPZK4TDAMDRD8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IH6MBO#wasThisHelpful","RPZK4TDAMDRD8","A19WEEGB05YAZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19WEEGB05YAZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like this oven mitt and hot pad set, but my husband thinks it's just okay. The mitt is sized well so that it fits on either hand and can accommodate a large or small hand. It's relatively thick--enough to prevent you from getting burnt, even on cast iron, but not so thick as to make it inflexible.The hot pad is much thinner than the oven mitt. It is not as resistant to heat, which is why my husband is not a huge fan of the set. He would prefer two oven mitts to remove hot and heavy items from the oven. I'm fine with just folding the pad in half, as using it opened on hot dutch oven is a little iffy if you have to go further than from oven to stove.In the end, it's a matter of preference. Both of these are good items. If I were to order again, I would prefer two mitts or two hot pads, just because they fit our usage better. Both of these, individually, are great products, though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCCZT1EQRV0ZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5IVKCG#wasThisHelpful","RCCZT1EQRV0ZC","A19WEEGB05YAZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19WEEGB05YAZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love to cook, and I love to share what I cook. Unfortunately, time and space have often limited what I'm able to bring to church events or work potlucks because there are only so many outlets for crockpots and, I always debate whether I make something in advance and reheat it or whether I wake up at the crack of dawn to make something fresh. In either case, transportation then becomes an issue. And that's what makes this 3 Quart Vacuum Crock Food Jar one of my favorite products in recent history.This is really a simple double insulated jar--a pretty big one, at that. It's only about a half inch thick, but that's quite enough to keep your food hot (or cold) without you feeling it on the outside. And more, without you spilling it. The lid sits flat on top, and there are four locking points that snap on and create a seal. I love my new ability to take large amounts of soups or saucy foods with me on the go, as I can totally trust the seal on this device. That being said, if you put hot liquids/sauces into this, you need to use extreme caution when opening it. Between the heat and the 4-locks, when you close it, you will basically create vacuum pressure, which in turn makes the lid difficult to get off later. This can be dangerous with thinner liquids, and I'm still working on trying to figure out the most effective way to get the lid off hot food without causing splash.I also rather like the simple look. I'm glad that there wasn't an attempt to pretty this up--it's simple and functional, and that's its appeal. It did come with two very large stickers across the circumference. These gave me a bit of pause because I have a Thermos pump pot that I love which came with similar stickers that simply cannot be removed without leaving ugly traces behind. The stickers on this Stanley jar came off easily in two single pieces, with nary a trace of adhesive residue left on the jar.I'm quite looking forward to the next potluck just so I can break this bad boy out and show it to people.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JVSN3HII9HQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPISUJQ#wasThisHelpful","R2JVSN3HII9HQ1","A19WEEGB05YAZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19WEEGB05YAZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those games where the players make all the difference. With the right group, it can be tons of fun; with the wrong group--or too small a group--it can be tedious and uninspiring.

The game isn't super complicated, but it's not one that you can just break out and start, either. And that's another drawback for me, as in our extended family, we can't always agree on how rules should be interpreted (even when there's an obvious way) because of the depth of competition.As a group game, this can be rather entertaining; in fact, I think the more people who play, the more entertaining the game gets.

Unfortunately, there isn't a setting to allow you to get both at once, but I don't t think the water pressure would hold up to that.

"Babies have a natural curiosity and want to expore the work around them.

One is a soft plastic flower like thing that will be perfect for when she starts teething and needsnsomething to chew on. The other is a bitterly. The body is a sof plastic, while the wings are fabric which makes a crinkly sound when squeezed. The size is just right for her to be able to hold a wing in each hand. The length of the attachments is just enough for her to reach them (with some help), but not long enough to pose any hazards.The seat is easy to assemble and folds flat when not in use. This makes it easy to store or take with you. The fabric seat cover can be removed to be washed, and then attached toys are interchangeable as the plastic rings are like the ones found on similar baby seats, playmats, etc.The back of the seat comes about halfway up baby's head, providing complete support of her neck. By the time her head will come up higher, she will not need the additional neck support. The seat is designed so that her back and legs are fully supported by fabric. She won't ever feel like she's dangling.This needs to sit directly on the ground, not non a table or other chair.

"I love the Tresemme Perfectly (un)Done line of styling products. Like the other products in the line, this gelee spreads easily through my hair and requires minimum fuss when styling. I can put it in my hair and just let my natural curls take over. A quick few minutes with a diffuser sets my hair without making it crunchy.The one thing I don't care for with this product is that it's a bit stickier feeling than the (un)Done spray.

"We seem to have an endless number of cords behind the t.v.--for the set itself, for the cable, the blu-ray player, the soundbar, three gaming systems,  a computer tower, a router. In order to get all the cords powered up, we use two heavy duty power strips that also have their own cords which connect to the electrical outlet. It's a bit of a mess, but we thought this power outlet would help tidy it up.Unfortunately, this surge protector actually takes up both outlets, limiting its usefulness. Yes, we go from two outlets to six, but we lose the ability to use another surge protector in the second outlet.

The LED lights are more decorative than functional simply because the size of this doesn't really allow you to use it in a way that would really require lighting.

"This tooth whitening product isn't difficult to use. You use one tube of paste to brush, spitnwithout rinsing, then use the second tube to polish your teeth. It's a pretty simple routine.I was worried about tooth sensitivity using this product, but it turns out that wasn't an issue at all. What is an issue is gum sensitivity and whitening. While brushing with the first tube of paste, it felt like my gums were getting polished as much as my teeth. Now, maybe it was me brushing too hard, even though it felt like I was brushing normally. I guess I could have been brushing harder and just not realized it.I would have given this product a second chance, but when I looked in then mirror after just one use, I didn't see any change in the color of my teeth. No problem....except that I saw a huge difference in my gums--the edges were all white. In fact, it looked like  I had just eaten a loafnof white bread and hadnit stuck to my teeth. Rinsing with water didn't clear this up. In fact, a full 24 hours later, my gums were still white and they were sensitive too.This product might be great for some people, but I'm going to have to spare my gums.

Bit when the huge tin arrived, I had to at least give them a try.These caramels are amazing. Unlike the Brach's caramel which are pretty much the only mass produced ones I'm familiar with, these were not dense and chewy. Instead, they are soft and very creamy. There is a subtle difference in the tastes of the caramel, caramel and vanilla, and caramel and butterscotch. They were all sweet, but not overly so.

"I'm not sure what it is about kids, but they love mechanical pencils. I think that goes double for my fourth-grader, who wasn't allowed to use them in her classroom last year. We purchased this set because her school suggested that pencils and erasers might be more useful and long-lasting (as well as healthier) than bringing in cupcakes for birthdays.I love the Cadoozle mechanical pencils because they feel almost like a standard pencil in your hand. They have a nice white eraser that erases cleanly and that fits the look of the pencil. I like that they don't have a clip on the side and they don't unscrew at the bottom. These things often present too much distraction to kids as they play with them in class.The awards pencils are primarily white, with the printed phrases  ""Good Job,!""

"We are in the process of changing all of the switch plates in our house because the homebuilders cheaped out and we've read online that some of the electrical issues we're experiencing may be the fault of poorly installed or cheap switches and plates. We'd already purchased several Leviton 5621-2W 20-Amp 120/277-Volt Decora Plus Rocker Single-Pole AC Quiet Switch, Whites as we move from room to room, so when this antimicrobial switch was offered to me, I thought it would be the perfect replacement for the garbage disposal switch.Installing this switch is as simple as installing any other electrical switch. As with anything electrical, read the directions and shut off the power supply to the house before beginning. I can't attest to just how effective the antimicrobial additive in these switches is, as I don't have a kit to run comparative tests. But I figure any additional protection is better than nothing.What I love most about this switch probably isn't the antimicrobial properties, but the look.

"My 9 year-old currently fits clothes sized between an 8 and a 10, but these pants were way too big for her to currently wear, even after adjusting the elastic in the waistband. The material is of decent quality and is and sewn well, but it's hard to get a proper gauge on the fit when both the waist and the length are so much larger than we expected. I usually buy a size up so that she can grow into her clothes and they'll get us through the school year. These might have to wait until next semester, if not next year.Part of the problem with the fit on these is probably because of the front pleat. It causes the pants to gather at her hips and waist and creates poofs of bunched fabric that are difficult to work around. It's just not very flattering.

"I'd read some work by Kerrigan Byrne when she was mostly publishing directly to e-book format. They were pretty decent, not great, but good enough to make me remember her name. So when I had the opportunity to check out this ""debut historical,"" I jumped at the chance. And I was not at all disappointed.***POSSIBLE SPOILER***(There is a potential plot spoiler in the next paragraph. Though I think that most readers will make this discovery almost immediately, or at least within the first few chapters, actual confirmation doesn't come until later in the book, so I include the alert as a precaution.)The story starts with two orphans--Farrah and Dougan. Theirs is an innocent friendship born of cruel circumstances, and they are torn apart while both are still too young to really have a romantic attachment to each other. It's years later when Farrah encounters the infamous Dorian Blackwell. Most readers will immediately recognize that Dorian is a reborn Dougan, though it takes Farrah a bit longer.****END SPOILER****Dorian is the ultimate troubled hero. He thinks of himself as soulless and unredeemable. But Farrah immediately starts to care for him. And, though she is innocent, she recognizes the strength of the sexual tension that runs between them. This tension and the ultimate fulfillment of their desires makes for some delicious reading. For all that he is not the typical hero, Dorian is a wonderfully attractive and likable one.Farrah is maybe slightly too good to be true, but I liked her nonetheless, especially because she is such a loyal character without being a doormat.In addition to the romance, there is some action and suspense written into the story as well. The secondary characters are well written, and I look forward to the next book in the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YH04XF9E4YRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250076056#wasThisHelpful","R1YH04XF9E4YRK","A19WEEGB05YAZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19WEEGB05YAZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And it also means that the seasoning is evenly distributed on every cracker.I'm not going to lie, if you don't like nori (dried seaweed), this will have no appeal. But if you do like it, you're in for a treat. These crackers are sweet with just a touch of spice,and they make a great snack. The bag says there are two servings inside.

"I really like the Cadoozles mechanical pencils that have the look and feel of a regular wooden pencil. In fact, we just ordered a rather large set of them for my daughter to pass out to the class for her birthday, and they were a hit with the kids. I figured she'd like these colored pencils well enough. But I wasn't prepared to love them myself.These are my new favorite colored pencils. I was planning to give them to my daughter, but I think she's going to have to wait until I order another set. Like Crayola Crayola Twistable Colored Pencils, 12 count (68-7408), these colored pencils have lead that  can be released or retracted to the length that you prefer when coloring or drawing. But I find the lead in these to feel smoother, and I think the colors are bolder. The triangular shape is also easier to grip. I guess I'm a ""hard"" colorer because I'm always breaking crayons, but the shape of these pencils allows me to color without putting a lot of pressure on them. And if I do push a bit too much with my fingers, it's okay becaue the plastic barrel doesn't break.I love the fact that the pencil barrels are the same color as the lead inside. it makes them easy and fun to use. For students, the traingular barrels also mean that they're easier to use and keep track of on sometimes overcrowded desks.

"This book started off with great potential, but by the end it devolved into something worthy of Jerry Springer. Jessie is the most beautiful woman in London (as the narrator frequently reminds us), but she had a difficult past which is hinted at for the first half of the novel before a revelation of the obvious is made. Daniel is a doctor and a vicar and a saint.They fall in lust at first sight. Then, with a bit of sloppy plot development, they are married. From there, the story is more about Jessie being freed from her past than it is about any romance between the two characters. In fact, while I enjoyed the chemistry and tension between the two when they were resisting each other (which was in about the blink of an eye), once they decide to marry, the story became a bit dull and rather predictable.I've enjoyed many books by Mary Jo Putney in the past, including several in the Lost Lords series.

"The product picture, at least on my computer screen, makes this look like a soft, muted peach color. But pay attention to the name--peach side babe--as a true indicator. This polish is actually a bright pinkish orange that reminds me of my childhood in the 80s. My 9-year-old loves the color, and I guess it is kind of rad on her. But the skin on my hands isn't quite as supple and firm as in my younger days, and I've got a medium skin tone, and this nail polish is sort of glaring on top of it.The polish glides on easily, but unevenly. You need to use two coats, but I wouldn't recommend more. The first coat I put on was clearly darker on some areas than others. I wasn't sure that just one more coat could smooth it out, but it eventually did.

"My husband hates to use dishcloths because he seems to think they take up too much space, and if you leave them sitting, they stink. I hate sponges because I think they're bacteria magnets and they stink. Paper towels would be a solution, except for the sheer numbers we'd have to use to get anything cleaned. They make those disposable Clorox Handi Wipes Multi-Use Reusable Cloths, 72 Cloths wipes, but they aren't very durable, and they are way too big. They also present a lot of waste.Washable and reusable, but also biodegradable over time, these Now Designs Swedith Dishcloths are a great solution. They are about the size of a standard washcloth, but they look like a stiff, thick paper until you dampen them. Then they have a more towel-like texture and can be used for wiping down tables and countertops, cleaning dishes, or other light work. They aren't good for scrubbing, but they are definitely sturdy enough to be used again and again before being washed and used again and again. After use, you can lay them flat or drape them over something and allow them to air dry. They will dry out and stiffen up until you rewet them.I really like these dishcloths for dishes, but I would prefer them slightly larger for table top cleaning.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A128Z2R9WZV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q6PI7Z8#wasThisHelpful","R2A128Z2R9WZV4","A19WEEGB05YAZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19WEEGB05YAZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We received two of these Stay-N-Play Balance Balls--one in lime, another in pink. Though all indications on the box would make you think they'd be exactly the same except for color, the pink ball is markedly smaller than the green one. This wasn't a big deal to us, as my youngest child wanted the green one anyway, but I don't know if it's a quality control issue or something that represents an inconsistency across all balls. Regardless, I make note of it, but it wasn't a big issue for us.My kids love these balls. They were a bit perplexed by the nubs that fall onto one side of the ball because, unlike what we expected from the product picture, those nubs cannot support the ball. My son calls the nubs cow butts, which tells you something about the look (he doesn't know what udders are). Still, the kids like these things. They use them to balance the ball (not quite successfully) on top of their heads, to swing the ball around (even though they're not supposed to), and to hold onto as they balance their bellies on the ball. And when they don't want to deal with the udders, they just put them on the underside and sit.As much as my kids like sitting and rolling on these balls, I think they enjoy the sound they make just as much. The material is a heavy rubber, much like the bouncy balls that are in big racks in toy stores. When you slap them, they make a sort of hollow sound that is fun for kids, if not a bit annoying to adults. We encourage them to drum these things in the hall closest to their room--it makes a good echo and isn't too close.These balanceballs are providing lots of play opportunities for the kids, and if they're promoting good posture at the same time, I'm going to continue to encourage their use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBGOTX9Z2RA1M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQIV96S#wasThisHelpful","RBGOTX9Z2RA1M","A19WEEGB05YAZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19WEEGB05YAZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The idea of putting coconut oil in individual packets works.  The coconut oil is in sold form allowing it to be used on the skin as well as using it for cooking. If you use it for cooking the packet allows exact measurements. Once heated the solid oil melts and can be used for cooking.I have never thought of coconut oil as anything other than something in which to cook food. I have used this on my dry hands and it does act as a moisturizer. I have put some on my lips when I went out in the sun and it moistened them and tasted great.I have used this mostly for cooking.  Each packet is  tablespoon. I like to use this when I am cooking eggs or vegetables or some items that does not need a lot of cooking oil. Rather than pour some liquid in a measuring cup this allows me to open the packet and get exactly ½ tablespoon of coconut oil.If you plan on cooking with a lot of coconut oil there are better options but if you use a little each time this is a great alternative.

"I am not a fan of these bars because of the taste and fat content. This is the first time I have tried a hemp bar.Taste is subjective. Some people commenting on these bars say that they like the taste.  I taste a slightly nutty flavor combined with a slightly bitter flavor. I don’t taste any apple or cinnamon.  These are more bland to me than anything else. I have not tried a hemp bar before so maybe I am not accustomed to the flavors. Others could taste something different I suppose.I am also concerned about the fat content.  The box says each bar contains 15 grams of fat of which 1.5 grams is saturated fat, 0 is trans fat, 10 grams is polyunsaturated fat and 2 grams is monounsaturated fat.  Of the 230 calories 140 are from fat. I know there are good and bad fats but for me this is a lot of fat.  I like low fat products so these are not bars I would get again.I give these three stars because of the taste and fat content.

"This is fascinating book where Christians from all denominations each share there understanding of a different question asked by Jesus in one of the four gospels. It was fascinating and thought provoking to read what many of the different Christians had to say. My only quibble is that I do think this book has a broad interpretation of the term “Christian leader.” I wish the title had called the Christians in this book notable Christians rather than “Christian leaders.”When I  think of Christian leaders I think of Christians who lead churches or nuns or priests who lead orders or Christian theologians whose works influence Christian thought or Christian academics at seminaries or theology schools.  The Christian leaders listed in this book include authors, actors, singers, clergy and academics. Roma Downey, Lecrae, Mark Burnett and Amy Grant are examples of artists who I would not consider Christian leaders. There are modern Christian authors listed who I would not consider Christian leaders because I don’t believe writing about Christian subjects makes a person a Christian leader.I did enjoy reading much of  what was in this book.  Roma Downey, Lecrae, Mark Burnett and Amy Grant all had interesting things to say.  Some people focused on personal stories to explain what Jesus had to say while other had a broader theological explanation. I found something interesting in what everyone had to say.The first question explored is “If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?” (Matthew 5:46-47.) The question is explored by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby. Archbishop Welby is my idea of a Christian leader. I found what he had to say thought provoking. Others like Gene Robinson a retired Episcopal Bishop, Cardinal Timothy Dolan the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York and Charles Chaput the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Philadelphia fall into what I would consider Christian leaders.Most of meditations in this book are three to four pages. All are worth reading. Some are insightful and thought provoking while others are just interesting and worthy of thinking about.I like the diversity of people in this book. Christian denominations seem to be well represented. As a Catholic I found it interesting reading what other Christians had to say knowing that Catholics were included in this book.I really like this  book. I like the diversity of those included in this book. I would not consider all of them Christian leaders but rather notable Christians.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE55S7O0707ZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1618930583#wasThisHelpful","RE55S7O0707ZS","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Sherpa lining along with the cotton material  makes this feel great when I put it on. The denim look makes this a great shirt when you are looking to go casual. It is important you read the size chart to make sure it fits. I usually get XL shirts but this was a bit small because I did not read the size chart.I have never tried a Sherpa lining before and I love it. It feels really soft. I will look to by other shirts with this lining.The denim is soft and looks as it does on the picture on the page. The buttons are simple but nice looking. This a great shirt to wear when you want a casual look.  Because of the lining and the look this is something I would wear in the cooler months.It held up well when I washed it. It is supposed to be washed in cold water and dried in the low cycle.It is important to check the size chart on this before ordering it. I usually wear XL casual shirts and sweat shirts.  The size chart for XL for this shirt lists the chest at 44.75 inches and the waist at 37 inches. I have not been a 37 inch waist for years and I usually assume XL will cover a much larger waist. Wrangler has a size chart listed so it is important to check it out before ordering. I ordered before reading it so while the shirt fits I can’t button it. It gives me a good reason to lose weight.I really like this shirt.

"It is nice to read works of faith by those who views would be deemed unconventional by some. How can you get any more unconventional then a pastor who is described on the back of her own book as a former stand-up comic who is tattooed, angry and profane. Interestingly, I found most of what she had to say to be in line with  mainstream Christian thought and found her humility to be saint like.One of reasons I picked up this book was because of the quote by  Fr. Richard Rohr, on this Amazon page, in which he says Pastor Nadia thinks like he does only she says what she is thinking so much better and with more humor, living examples, “and a conviction that will convict you!” I have read a few books by Fr. Rohr and I do see a similarity in that he and Pastor Nadia book seek and find holiness in people and incidents that are often overlooked and ignored by many clergy and many people.This book is broken into 19 chapters most of which are focused on incidents and people who are part of her congregation the “House For All Saints And Sinners.”  She discusses the Blessed Virgin Mary, Good Friday, the Easter Vigil and the Church Year. All these are almost Orthodox and while she puts her own unique spin on each story I found her views to be very much in line with main stream Christian thinking.She takes on serious subjects like the  killings at Sandy Hook Elementary School and how “church was never meant to be a place for escapism.” Church needs to be a place where the evil in this world is discussed. I can’t agree more.Pastor Nadia  admits how early in her tenure at her church she was taken aback by how many “socially awkward people”showed up at her church and how the church would never have a chance if these were the people who showed up. She eventually realized how important these people are and how we are all socially awkward and imperfect.I have been so frustrated at times at my parish (I am Catholic) while listening yet again to one more homily at Church about how we are all brothers and sisters in Christ while  there are people sitting alone and  hurting in the pews all around me. I want a priest to acknowledge that life is hard and people struggle and loneliness and pain are part of this world and there is a good chance there is someone in the pew near me who can use my help and maybe I should tell one of these people we are brothers and sisters in Christ and I want to help. I  have a funny feeling people at pastor Nadia’s church are more comfortable doing this than at my church.Pastor Nadia reminds us that we are all flawed, including her, yet we all can become accidental saints. I am glad I read this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32CKBB9N0B2FT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601427557#wasThisHelpful","R32CKBB9N0B2FT","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a well made game that is easy to play and at the same time harder than it looks. It is addicting.  My only issue is that you need an overhang or ceiling near the hook  to play the game so it is hard to find a spot to play outside and you need to be willing to screw an eye hook into a ceiling or overhang.The product itself is well made. The board and ring it is on are quality products. They look nice on a wall. This could stand alone as a hook on which a person could hang his or her keys or even a light jacket.  This comes with tape to attach the back board to a wall if you don’t want to use screws.The game itself is simple but addicting. It should be easy to get the ring on the hook but it is not. It is frustrating when someone else does and I can’t. When I play with friends the loser always wants to play one more game because it should be easy getting the ring on the hook.  Having a string attached to the ring makes sure you don’t lose the ring and can affect the direction of the ring based on how the ring is tossed.My one criticism of this is that in order to play an eye hook needs to be screwed into a ceiling or overhang near the back board and hook to play the game. A string is attached to the eye hook and the ring so when the ring is thrown at the hook the string is attached to it.The product description currently on this web page says this can be played indoors as well as outdoors. If the game is played outdoors you need to be near some sort of overhang or ceiling to screw in the eye hook. If the game is played indoors you need to be willing to screw the eye hook into a ceiling or overhang.I have plaster and tile ceilings in most of my house and I did not like the idea of screwing an eye hook into either. I wound up using this in my basement where I have wood beams. I think this game would also work if the string was attached to a person’s wrist so a ceiling or overhang was not necessary.This is a simple fun game. The back board and hook are well made and look nice. My one issue is having to screw an eye hook into a ceiling or overhang.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKNYQP1OUVEHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBIY348#wasThisHelpful","RKNYQP1OUVEHM","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is surprisingly light but it works well. It is strong and looks like it will last and most importantly is well designed.When I first saw this I was impressed with the design. It works well as a wheel chock or tongue dock. Once in place a wheel or trailer tongue will not move.Because it is light it is easy to move and can be stored anywhere. The orange color stands out. It is also easy to clean with soap and water but a hose will work fine at times.This is a simple product that works well. It will ensure that your trailer does not move.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N8Z1DON6N727/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LIHKA5Y#wasThisHelpful","R1N8Z1DON6N727","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This offers some of the best protection for a smart phone I have yet to see. It is a little bulky but it is worth it to protect what has become an essential part of many people’s lives.The OtterBox case is strong and offers a number of types of protection for your phone. . According to the description this is due to a  polycarbonate shell, a silicone slipcover and a built-in screen protector. You cane feel how strong the case is when holding it. The screen protector does a good job protecting the screen.The case fits well on my phone while allowing for easy access to it.  It also has a belt clip holster which is okay.This is a little bulky but it is worth it for the protection. It offers excellent protection for an HTC phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CEONQ7EHTKQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXRFBV4#wasThisHelpful","R2CEONQ7EHTKQU","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite having read a number of books about the Civil War this book introduced me to an aspect of Civil War diplomacy/spying of which I knew little about. It is an interesting read that should appeal to and Civil War or history buffs.The book explores the activities of Robert Bunch who was British Consul in Charleston, South Carolina beginning in 1853. While personally against slavery, as was the British government, Mr. Bunch let those around him believe he favored it allowing him access to key figures in the South leading up to and during the Civil War. Interestingly Bunch was viewed as friendly toward the South by the North when in fact he was against British involvement in the war.The book looks at the Southern leaders from the perspective of Bunch as well as British diplomatic relations with the United States during this time. The book suggests that the one of the key reasons Britain kept out of the war was its unwillingness to support slavery in the South in any form.While I have read about American and British diplomacy during the civil war I never knew about Mr. Bunch. I also never realized how strong a role Britain’s hatred of slavery played  in its refusal to help the South.This book is in part a history of the Civil War from a British perspective and in part a spy novel of sorts where a British Consul pretends to favor slavery and the South when he supports neither. History and Civil War Buffs should really enjoy this as well as anyone with an interest in the Civil War.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VJQZK7M49YAT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307887278#wasThisHelpful","R3VJQZK7M49YAT","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a simple toy that worked well for me for the most part. It reminded me of toys I had as a child.There are two factors that seem to influence how this works.  The first factor is how hard you pull the string. Pulling the string affects how high the disc will go and how long it will spin.  The other factor is how you hold the base.  The angle of the base will determine the direction of the disc and how well it climbs walls or fly.This comes with six flying modes. The first five were easy to do.  The three indoor modes Twister, WalllRiser and Rock’N Roof worked fine for me as long as I pulled the sting hard enough. As long as there is enough spin the disc will twirl on the ceiling, wall or floor.Two of the three outdoor modes were simple as well. All I needed to do to make Shocking Fight work was pull the sting hard and angle the base slightly. For Shuttle Flight all I needed to do was pull the string hard and hold the base straight.How hard the string is pulled will determine how far and how high the disc will travel. I can see younger children not having the strength to make the disc go as far as adults.I had a bit of trouble with Boomerang. It took a few tries to hold the base at the right angle for the disc to come back and while it came back it never came straight.  This might just take more practice.The disc is made of a soft plastic so it will not easily break.  The base is made of a hard plastic. This overall construction is okay.This reminds me of tops with strings that I had as a child as well as a plastic toy gun which had discs that came with it which when I pulled the trigger of the  gun would fly in the air. This seems to have combined the best of both of these items. It is an entertaining toy to use at home or bring to a park.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XJ0HJRX2LVFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WOECWLA#wasThisHelpful","R2XJ0HJRX2LVFE","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This reads like a well crafted spy novel only it is true. Considering the ending I wish it was not.The book looks at how hard it was for the United States to develop spies in Russia in part because of doubts about their authenticity and the real threat of the KGB.  A Russian then offers intelligence to  the United States only to be doubted at first. He would then become one of the CIA’s biggest assets.The book looks at how Adolf Tolkachev approached the United States and why he wanted to spy on his own country. It looks at how he was vetted and how he passed information to the Americans. The book also looks at how this information helped the United States.This is a well documented book. It reads like a spy novel but it is written with an eye to detail and offers detailed support for what is written. This is fact that reads like fiction, which makes it an extremely enjoyable read.I am glad I got to read about  Adolf Tolkachev and all he did.  As the description about this book on Amazon explains, Mr. Tolkachev was eventually betrayed. I won’t go into details about how and what happened but it was the only thing about the book I wish were not true.This is a fascinating read. David Hoffman is an excellent writer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B3FU746UEZFQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385537603#wasThisHelpful","R3B3FU746UEZFQ","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This looks like someone used a tire design when making this case. I have seen better looking cases but this offers very good protection.The case/stand is made of a silicone skin which does a good job protecting a Nexus 9.  The information on the Amazon page seems to focus on the ruggedness of this product and the overall protection it offers. I agree that it offers above average protection.This goes on a Nexus 9 easily. The stand feature works fine. There is a screen protector that looks good as well. It does not limit the use of a Nexus 9 in any way.I have mixed feeling about the look of this. I would have no problem using this outside or if I had a job that required a lot of physical activity.

"This is a professional looking weekly planner. It has good writing space for a weekly planner and comes with two satin bookmarks.This looks nice. It has hardback textured paper bookbound back and front covers. The covers do not bend and will protect this planner.  When you open the front cover there are tabs for each month  making it easy to access each month. Two satin bookmarks also make it easy to mark pages with important dates. Each month starts with a calendar on two pages with1.65 x 1.65 blocks that allow for brief notes to be made. The next two pages have the first seven days of the week listed and a block for notes.  Each day is a  4 x 2.75 inch ruled block with ten lines.  Considering this is a weekly calendar there is good space to makes notes regarding meetings and deadlines.  I have a daily planner with a page devoted to each day which offers more space for each day  but it is bulkier and does not give me a sense of the week like this weekly planner does.There are 12 ruled pages at the end of the planner that can be used for notes and contacts. This also has holidays for the next four years and a list of time zones at the end of the planner.This is a very nice looking and a very functional weekly planner. It has a hard cover.

"These dishtowels absorb water well.  They dry reasonably well.  They hold up well when washed. This is a good simple dishtowel that works.I have a number of dishtowels because I am tired of spending money on paper towels. Dishtowels can be reused and absorb better than paper towels. Dishtowels can also brighten a kitchen.These are plain looking dishtowels that work.  They come in white, red, a darker blue and a lighter blue.  They have no designs on them.They are well made. I did not see any lose threads when I took then out of the package and I still do not see any after I put them in a washing machine and dryer. They are made in China and are well made.The care instructions say wash in cold water, tumble dry low and iron on low.  They did not shrink after I washed them or put them in my dryer. They were a little wrinkled but these are dishtowels so I don’t care.I use these when I am drying glasses and dishes and when I dry my hands afterward.

"I am very pleased with this phone.  It is large, has a good amount of memory, has a very good sound and a good camera.I measure the actually screen size at approximately 3 x 5 inches.  This is the largest screen I have ever had on a smart phone.The video quality is excellent. I have watched movies and television shows on the phone and been able to enjoy them thanks to the screen size and video quality. I have watched replays of parts of baseball games and horse races and found the picture quality excellent.The phone comes with an FM radio. I also listen to music from other sources.  The phone comes with an ear piece that I use when listening to the radio.  I have listened to music on the phone  without the earpiece and the sound quality is excellent considering it is coming from a phone.The sound quality when I am talking to people on the phone is good as well. I have no trouble hearing someone or being heard.The camera on this phone is good. It has many features including a flash. It has a main camera and a front camera. It has some nice features like a face beauty mode, normal mode, live photo mode and panorama mode. It has a video camera as well.Because of the listed 4 GB of internal memory and 512 RAM  I have been able to download a good number of apps. I have also been able to store a lot of photos.I enjoy using all the Google features.  Google has become very interactive. If I want to know the weather forecast, the score of a baseball game or the location of the nearest gas station all I do is verbally ask Google and get the answer. Google maps is great on this phone. I once was low on gas and asked the phone where the nearest gas station was and it mapped the route for me.The voice recognition feature makes it rare that I have to manually type anything on this phone but when I do I am able to do so with my large fingers with ease because of the size of the phone. I have used other smart phones where I often press the wrong letter because they as so small on the screen.The battery life for this phone is good.  The phone comes with a USB cable and charger that can be plugged into and wall outlet.When I am home or at places that have WIFI I use the WIFI feature. It works fine.Th phone does come with a screen protector that I have yet to be able to make bubble free. When I called BLU phone support I got no help and was told to go a phone store to see if they could help. I will see about buying a better screen protector when I have the chance.This is a great phone.

"This is an inexpensive way to brighten a window and at the same time offer a level of privacy from prying eyes as well as a level of protection from the sun. This is fairly easy to put on a window and looks really great.This comes with a very good set of instructions.  The instructions start of with what you will need when applying the widow film.  This includes a spray bottle, liquid soap, paper towels, window cleaner, measuring tape, a utility knife, a straight edge and a squeegee which is included.Installation is fairly easy. You need to cut the window film to fit the window you choose. You then  need to clean the window and apply soapy water. After putting the window film on the window you then apply soapy water again. Finally, you use the squeegee which is included to remove any air bubbles.I used this on the top part of a window facing west in my living room. I have blinds over the window but even with the blinds the sun can get pretty strong especially when it is setting.I did remove about a quarter of the window film in order for it to fit on the window.  That was the hardest part since I do not have a paper cutter and I wanted to make sure I cut the film evenly.The window film stuck to my window nicely. The squeegee removed the few air bubbles that were present.  The fact that this can be applied to a window without leaving any air bubbles amazes me.The design looks great. I always like stained glass windows and this has a stained glass look to it. It allows light in but takes away the harshness of the sun.I pull up blinds during the day so I can enjoy the window film. It offers a good level of privacy. It looks even better when  the sun sets.I plan on getting some other styles for other rooms. I have bathroom window and after calling Artscape I will be looking at an etched glass and an etched lace style of window film that should offer privacy and allow light into the bathroom.I like this Melange design. It was easy to install and looks great.  I really changes the look of a room for the better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AVWZRMNEUGON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UALS6QY#wasThisHelpful","R2AVWZRMNEUGON","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an honest book about the struggles of an Orthodox Jewish boy whose growing obsession with sex and eventually having a girlfriend does not mesh with his religious upbringing. This is a coming of age story that most men should be able to identify with in some form.There is a certain point where sex becomes an obsession for most teenage boys.  In the case of Eytan Bayme sex becomes a major obsession. I am not sure whether his obsession was furthered by his strict religious upbringing or whether it was just his nature but in either case that obsession is the focus of the book.There are funny parts of this book and sometimes sad parts of this book. It is embarrassingly honest at times. I think most men will identify with being Eytan’s age and being awkward and wanting to lose their virginity and become a man. I found the book interesting.

"This is a nice book of bible meditations. It is well formatted for the most part. My big issue is that I would not consider it a journal because there is not much space to write or journal.There are forty days of meditations in this book.  There are three or four readings from scripture followed by a meditation.The readings don’t seem to follow a set pattern. Some meditations  have and Old Testament reading followed by a reading from Psalms and two readings from the New Testament.  Other meditations start with a reading from Psalms, then have and Old Testament reading followed by a New Testament reading. Other meditations have two readings from Psalms and one from the Old Testament.  There are other patterns as well. This is okay but I like books of meditations that follow a set pattern.My big issue is that on the bottom of the book is written “A Scriptural Journal.” I think of a journal as a book where a person writes down his or her thoughts. For me a scriptural journal would have a blank page or two to write down a person’s thoughts about scripture. In many cases in this book there is approximately three inches of space after the meditation and this book is approximately the size of a paperback book.The book itself looks great.  The colors on the cover look great. The typeface is easy to read. Each page has a nice border.I had a hard time deciding how many stars to give this book. It is well designed and easy to read.  I would have liked the reading to follow more a of set pattern like an Old Testament reading followed by part of a Psalm and a New Testament reading. Yet that is a matter of personal taste. The meditations are fine. If it was called a devotional I would given it four stars.Yet for me a journal includes a good amount of space to write and this does not. I think others can see journal in the title and assume the same thing.

"This is a fascinating story about how music became digital and became a source for pirating.  The author is someone who was in college when digital music became available to those in the know. He admits to an obsession when it came to downloading bootlegged songs and wound up with almost 15,000 albums worth of music which took him an hour to queue up.  He was the perfect person to write this bookThe book looks at the history of digital music piracy. He starts with the development of MP3 technology and ends with a music industry which is still trying to define itself in the digital age.In a certain way I was at a disadvantage when I read this book. While I am aware of sites like Amazon and iTunes where you can purchase and download digital music and I do have an MP3 player I am still happy to listen to compact discs. I remember records and 8-track tapes and cassettes and compact discs. I like my compact discs.  I am not yet ready to embrace yet another revolution in music.  Someone who lives by digital music will understand parts of this book better than I do.Still, this is a fascinating story about the biggest change to the music industry has ever faced.

"This is a nice bible that should appeal to children and young adults.  It has a set of characters which appear throughout the bible giving insights along the way and icons which highlight certain topics or ideas. There is also a bible dictionary at the end as well as maps from National Geographic.The bible contains four icons which include a sailboat, umbrella, lighthouse and life preserver which bring attention to certain text. The sailboat icon brings attention to text that should help children grow stronger with God, the umbrella brings attention to text that should help children in difficult times, the lighthouse brings attention to text that develops  faith and the life preserver highlights text that  answers tough questions.In addition there are God’s Thoughts/ My Thoughts sections which relate scripture to a child’s life and asks questions for children to think about.  There is a Did You Know Section which explains aspects of the different books of the bible.  There is also a also Memory Points section which marks key passages to memorize.There are three children that appear throughout the bible and help the reader.  They are Asia, Kat and Edgar. There is a nice bible dictionary at the end as well as eight maps from National Geographic.The text a nice font size.

The bible does not include the Apocrypha / Deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament found in Catholic Christian and Orthodox Christian bibles and some Protestant Christian bibles as well.This is a very nice looking bible that should attract the attention of children, young adults and even adults. It is well designed and should interest younger readers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FAE49R9KS164/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609260813#wasThisHelpful","R2FAE49R9KS164","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a memoir of Fox News personality Gretchen Carlson.  It is an easy read that is interesting as is explores Carlson’s life path which brought her to Fox.As someone who has watched Carlson on Fox I liked the book. It paints her as a hardworking, talented woman who has managed to be a success not only as a Miss America Pageant winner but as an award winning reporter and television personality.Carlson worked hard to get to Fox. The book talks about her starting out at local television stations and working  her way up the ladder. She talks about covering a number of stories including 9/11. She is married and has two children so she talks about being a working woman and mother.It is easy to assume a Miss America Pageant winner would be handed a television job based on her looks.  This is far from the case. Carlson combined hard work and talent to get where she is.This is a light, enjoyable book.  It is a fun read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R359M4LCS1X2MB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525427457#wasThisHelpful","R359M4LCS1X2MB","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a quality grill cover with Velcro straps that is very well made. It will protect your grill from both bad and good weatherThe front of the cover  is made of a nice looking black fabric.  The back has a water resistant material that has a  bit of a rubbery smell at first but it goes away over time.The grill cover has three Velcro straps that will secure it to the grill during windy weather.  The bottom of the grill has an elastic at the bottom that also helps secure the cover in place.  The cover has vents that will reduce condensation and wind lofting.The stitching and workmanship on this grill cover is better than I expected.  I did not expect to find such quality work on a grill cover.This can be air dried if it gets wet. You can’t use soap or detergent if you want to clean this. Water works fine. It has a one year warranty.This will protect your grill from bad weather.

"These are refreshing wipes that are great not only for children but for adults with sensitive skin. I use these  myself because I have been having skin reactions to chemicals of any sort and have been trying to go chemical free for a bit. These make my skin feel great.The ingredients in this product include Aqua(Water), Glycerin ,Sorbitan Caprylate, Decyl Glucoside,Propanediol, Benzoic Acid,Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria)Flower Extract, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate and Sodium Citrate. The wipes feels cool on my skin. They have been especially nice in the hot weather.I have been using as many chemical free products as I can lately because of recent chemical sensitivity.  These have not caused any reaction in or on me and make my skin feel better.While these are eco friendly they should not be thrown in the toilet. The label says these need to be kept out of the reach of children. Also these should not come in contact with a person’s eyes. So while this is an eco friendly product there are precautions that need to be followed.These come in small containers that keep the wipes moist. I have had an opened pack for 10 days and the wipes are still moist.I really like these. They have been perfect for me in a time of need. I have other friends with bad chemical sensitivities and I have recommended they try these wipes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RNH8T28FFRSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGTUILK#wasThisHelpful","R2RNH8T28FFRSS","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a few rose bushes that have been around since I was a kid so I could not wait to try this. It seems to be keeping beetles, as well as other insects, away from them.This can be used on house plants and flowers as well. While it comes with warnings about what to do if it gets on skin or clothing, is inhaled, gets in someone’s eyes or is swallowed it can be used indoors so it seems a bit safer than some other insecticides.  The active ingredient listed on the Ortho website is 0.006% Acetamiprid which is an insecticide.This is keeping beetles and other insects off my roses. The labels lists the insects controlled and it is a very big list which is too big to list here but looks too include between 150 to 200 types insects.  This is not something that only kills eight or nine types of insects.This comes in a spray bottle. I used gloves when using this. If using outside the instructions say to stand  “up wind” while spraying. The spray comes out fine.

"This is both a travel book and a book about how certain Christians practice their faith in other countries.  Amanda Hudson who grew up in Alabama where her church was one of “five congregations within a 500-yard radius” comments both on the culture and faith practice of those she met on her journey’s to China, Honduras, Brazil, Wales and Tanzania.When I first saw the title of the book I was expecting an examination of the practices of different Christian denominations in different countries. The cover of the book includes “one woman’s journey to experience Christianity around the globe.” I assumed the  book would be looking at how Eastern Orthodox Christians practice their faith, how Roman Catholic Christians practice their faith and how the different Protestant Christian denominations practice their faith.  It is hard to get ""to experience Christianity around the globe"" when you limit yourself to five countries and exclude Eastern Europe or the Balkans or the Middle East where the Eastern Orthodox Christian Church has had such a strong influence or Western Europe (aside from Wales) where Christians fought each other during the Reformation.This is more of a travel book where the author visits and speaks to Christians whose faith is similar to hers  in five countries and compares that faith to other Christians like herself in the United States. The book seems to look at faith in the context of Evangelical Protestant Christianity.  This books works as such a book but I think the cover suggests a more global and comprehensive look at Christianity.During Amanda’s  travels she visits other Christians like herself and examines how their  practice of faith differs based on cultural influences. She also looks at the countries themselves which helps in understanding the differences between how Evangelical Christianity is practiced in Alabama in the United States as opposed to Tanzania.Amanda offers some  nice insights about the faith of the people she visits and the countries in which they live.  She comes across as very interested in her faith and the faith of those she meets.  As long as your not expecting a detailed look at different Christian denominations this books works okay.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16E0231TV6LWF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426793138#wasThisHelpful","R16E0231TV6LWF","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Rinker Buck and his brother got to live the dream of many a history buff and in doing so wrote a history/travel book that is very enjoyable to read.  In doing so he got the chance to learn about life, think back to times with his family and make the history and experiences of the Oregon Trail come alive.This could have been two books.  It could have been a history of the Oregon Trail.  I learned a lot about what the settlers who traveled on the Oregon Trail faced daily.  It could also been a travel  book talking about how two brothers learned a lot about the world and themselves while traveling the Oregon Trail  The author does an remarkable job of merging these two books into one and in doing so creating a work that I read in three sittings. I literally did not want to put this down.This book is a rare example of excellent writing combined with a fascinating story about a recreated journey from the past.  There have been a number of books written by people who have recreated journeys made by explorers in the past.  There are television shows where people live like people did in the past. Most of these fail because they get caught up in the “gimmick” of modern people living in the past.While the premise of this book is that two modern men take and old wagon and three mules on the Oregon Trail, the end result is so much more.  What makes this book different is the author is an exceptionally good writer who knows how to write about history as well his journey and I wound up caring both about the history and the journey.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JDXFLA6IA5K2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451659164#wasThisHelpful","R1JDXFLA6IA5K2","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a hard book to put down despite the suffering involved. The reason for this is Joseph Kim tells his tale in a simple straight forward manner which made me care about what happened to him. This is not a book with a political agenda but one where the only agenda seem to be telling what happened to him and his family.When Joseph was about 13 years old he was homeless because his father died in the great famine and his mother, after selling his sister as a “bride slave” in China, abandoned him because she was a “burden.” Homeless, Joseph went from begging to stealing to survive.He explains, “I became a different person when I became homeless. For one thing I was shocked to learn I was a better thief than I was a beggar.” He then explains how this happened naturally as if his body knew what to do when hunger reached a certain point. He says, “I don’t remember any moral debate about whether stealing was wrong.”Joseph is a good man driven to steal to survive in a world where death was all to common. He is much kinder to his mother than I would have been. I was happy when he found his way to freedom.I recently read and reviewed on Amazon another book called “A Thousand Miles To Freedom” written by  Eunsun Kim who escaped North Korea with her mother and sister. While both books have some similarities and both are recommended I found Joseph Kim’s book more informative about what life was like for the average North Korean before, during and after the great famine. His time homeless and stealing to survive and his time in a forced labor camp tells a lot about Joseph and the conditions people faced.This is an important book considering the lack of information about life in North Korea.  It is also an important record of what Joseph Kim, a good man, had to do to survive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TIBR8XG51BG0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544373170#wasThisHelpful","R3TIBR8XG51BG0","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an enjoyable read focusing on a section of New York City, the Upper East Side, and the people who live and work there.  I think it is even more enjoyable for people with a familiarity of the City and the people. I live near New York City and have walked along Park Avenue and  other part of the Upper East Side and have seen the wealthy one percent walking the same streets as me.  I even have eaten at a few a restaurants where the one percent eat as well. The 22 essays in this book bring that area and those people to life. It is a world I will never know but one that fascinates me.The author, Richard Kirshenbaum, is a major player in New York advertising.  He is also a writer and this book is a collection of essays written for the New Yorker and some new essays as well.The author shares the world of the one percent for those interested. Because of his success he is part of their world. The essays cover everything from grooming habits, to social climbing, to divorce, to dating for the one percent. Often times the one percent don’t look so good.One of my favorite essays titled “Never Mind The Nannies, Drivers Are The New Dads.”  It looks at how those who drive the wealthy are often required to spy on their employers children and perform parental roles, something nannies formerly did.The author explains how the New York Post ran a story explaining that the wealthy were passing off their classroom volunteer duties to nannies much to the dismay of their children’s schools and the other less wealthy moms who did not want to have to do their volunteer duties with nannies.  The author writes “ The story ricocheted around the Upper East Side, a neighborhood whose privileged parents stand accused of outsourcing every child-rearing task, from cooking to etiquette training.  He then states, “As someone who lives and raises kids there, I here to tell you the stories are pretty much true.”Richard Kirshenbaum is a part of the world of the wealthy one percent. He has no problem sharing his insights about that world with the rest of us. I really wonder what the wealthy people he writes about think about his essays.The essays are well written. I think they will appeal more to those who are familiar with New York City and the Upper East Side and who have at least seen the wealthy one percent out in their environment. I found them fun to read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y56UHGZDVTTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1504007328#wasThisHelpful","R1Y56UHGZDVTTF","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a part of American history I know little about.  The book focuses on five Cubans who allegedly committed espionage and murder and were convicted of these crimes. The author looks at the Cuban exile community in the United States as well as relations between Cuba and the United States.  This book is especially relevant with the recent move by President Obama  toward normalizing relations with Cuba and the opposition it has created.I was expecting a spy thriller type of historical fiction but found the book hard to follow at times.  The author did a lot of research and at times I got lost in all the names and places mentioned. The author does seem to have a bias in favor of Cuba and the Cuban five.I feel the book suffers from the fact that it was translated into English by two people. I found the flow of the book off at times and do think the fact that it was translated into English played a part in this.Despite all this the author does a great job in exploring a period of American history and politics with which I was not familiar. I have read about the rise of Castro, the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis. I have read about Cubans fleeing their country on rafts in an attempt to come to the United States. I am aware of a Cuban exile in community in Florida but I knew little about it until I read this book. This book has taught me much about this community which has a real voice in American politics.I am glad I read this book.  I learned about aspects of American History and current American politics about which I knew and know little. This book is especially relevant with the recent move toward normalizing relations with Cuba and the opposition it has created.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J3JYSR2J2GAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781688761#wasThisHelpful","R2J3JYSR2J2GAR","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rather than viewing nursing homes as places where old people go before they die the author has turned nursing homes into a place where elders  share their knowledge of life. He has taken the time to listen to people in a nursing home and let people know that there is a wealth of knowledge in those who reside in them.Like most self-help books the author stars with a premise and uses the insights and actions of people, in this case those in a nursing home, to prove his point. In the 28 chapters of the book the author looks at subjects like suffering, loss, acting in a crisis, religion, sexuality and the importance of acting in the present. The author concludes the book with 28 lessons learned.There is a lot in here to think about. Each chapter stands on its own.  Resilience, hope and refusing to be defined by your circumstances are themes that seemed to be present in many chapters but each chapter is different.The author includes a lot in each chapter.  This is not one of those self-help books which has a few simple themes repeated over and over. The author is willing to address a lot of different issues.The author puts a lot of thought into each chapter using relevant examples from people with whom he has worked in the West Caldwell Care Center. Even though he is a clinical psychologist the author has allowed himself to learn from his patients which gave me an even greater appreciation of the book and the author.This is one of the better self-help books I have read. It offers advice from our elders on a host of subjects written by a psychologist who took the time to listen and learn.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GVGJBNH1YGD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633880168#wasThisHelpful","R2GVGJBNH1YGD4","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Any book which gives a first person account of what it is like to live in North Korea would be interesting.  A book written by a woman who escapes from North Korea to China and eventually makes it to South Korea is a book that I could not put down and read in two days.The author comes across as someone who, with her mother and sister, only wanted a chance to have a life where malnutrition and hopelessness was not the norm. She did not leave North Korea because of political beliefs but because the country was suffering from famine and her father and grandparents had died because of the harsh conditions.I admire Eunsun Kim’s courage and the courage shown by her family. I admire the others she met who also did not give up and fled North Korea.  I admire the endless hope that lead Eunsun to make it so South Korea despite being sent to a North Korean labor camp, being treated badly in China  and fleeing into a Mongolian desert.The author explains what happens in a simple and genuine way.

"I enjoy military history and reading books about soldiers whose acts of bravery seem like things no humans should be able to do. There are a lot of books like these available and this is one that is well worth reading.The Vietnam War has gotten some recent attention with the anniversary of the fall of Saigon. While I was not even a teenager when the war ended I have always wanted to understand it better because it was a topic that was talked and at times argued about by everyone I knew.Legend is a true account of a team of 12 special forces soldiers who were inserted into neutral Cambodia to monitor North Vietnamese activity in 1968.  The team did not know that there was a nearby North Vietnamese base and the men were quickly surrounded.  Special Forces Staff Sergeant Roy Benavidez volunteered to help rescue the men only to be seriously wounded and belatedly awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions.While this book does place the battle in a historical context a good portion of the book is recreating what happened during the battle. The author does a good job recreating the battle and at the same time allowing the reader to get to know the Americans involved.Sergeant Benavidez is the hero of the book.  His recovery and the awards he received are covered in the book.  He finally received the Congressional Medal of Honor in 1981, in part because American troops were not supposed to have been in Cambodia in 1968. Interestingly the citation for valor for his Congressional Medal of Honor does not mention Cambodia, only that the men were inserted in a dense jungle area west of Loc Ninh, Vietnam.I smiled when I read  the citation for valor listing all that Sergeant Benavidez did to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. It was read by President Ronald Reagan which the book said was an honor since Presidents don't normally read them during the award ceremony.The book is well written and is an easy read. I read it in two nights. I am glad I read it. It is a must read for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MDJ80RBSHLZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804139512#wasThisHelpful","R3MDJ80RBSHLZ8","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am impressed with the power of this small wet/dry vacuum.  When I first saw it I was not expecting much because all I was getting was the top part of small wet/dry vac but after using it I like its power and size.I have used this to clean and dry carpet in my basement and the blower to help blow dust and pollen off screens around my air conditioner.  The suction for a unit of this size is impressive.  I was expecting much less considering the size but this wet/dry vac did a good job of sucking up water from my carpet as well as cleaning the dirt off my carpet.I also used  the blower feature to blow dust and pollen away from screens that are around my air conditioner. The dust had not been cleaned since I last used my air conditioner last fall.  This motor is strong and the blower did a good job dislodging the dust and pollen.I like the size of this as well. This is easy to carry around. I have a bad back so I need to be careful about carrying things.  I carried this wet/dry vac down a flight of stairs to my basement with ease. I then took this outside to clean my air conditioner screens without a problem. The size listed on this page of 13 x 10.5 x 14 inches seems about right.You do need to but a bucket for this.  The instructions tell you which ones to use with this. I bought one for a little over four dollars.

"This is a very thorough look at the the life of Silvio Berlusconi as well as the politics and history that allowed him to become prime minister. I read it because my ancestors came from Italy and I try to learn about Italy when I can.This book is very detailed. The author clearly knows his stuff. The book is 288 pages and includes end notes and a bibliography.If you want a thorough look examination of Berlusconi and Italian and European politics this is a good choice. An understanding of the existing system would likely add to your appreciation of this book.While my grandparents were from Italy, I am American and grew up on American politics. As a casual observer Italian politics and even less so of European politics I found myself getting a bit lost in a political system and way of thinking that I am not all that familiar. I don’t think this book was necessarily written with an American audience in mind.  This is not a criticism because the author should assume readers will have a certain knowledge base.The author’s background seems to be European. He is a London-born journalist who has lived in Italy and been a correspondent for The Independent, a British newspaper, for the past six years. He has written articles about Italy for The Wall Street Journal and  Variety.  He is uniquely qualified to write about Berlusconi.  I just think this may not translate so well for an American audience.I give this four stars because it is through, well written and has a good set of end notes and a bibliography. I do think being an American who is not very knowledgeable about Italian and European politics limited my enjoyment of this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E5BAT11SM4HC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1137280042#wasThisHelpful","R3E5BAT11SM4HC","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a double-sided turkey decoy that is easy to carry and easy to put in the ground.  I used it in some woods where wild turkeys are common and after about an hour a male turkey started approaching. Unfortunately I made some noise and scared away the turkey and and other turkeys in the area.This is fairly large. It seems the size of a ready-to-breed hen.This is something that is appropriate for either hunting or turkey watching. It is made of a cloth like material and is double-sided.  People can use it in their yards for decoration purposes but I am not sure how it will last. These seems to be made for short term uses rather than sticking it in a yard for the summer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X8NUUEDNFVSN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HMNCQAK#wasThisHelpful","R2X8NUUEDNFVSN","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the classic head & shoulders dandruff shampoo with a conditioner. It smells like the classic shampoo and is supposed to be gentler on my hair.I am happy so far. This is keeping my dandruff under control. I suffer from dry scalp and this seems to help my scalp feel less dry and itchy.  My hair looks good after I use this.Like with most head & shoulders a little of this product goes a long way. A 23.7 ounce bottle will last.As with most head & Shoulders this  uses Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%) to treat the dandruff. I am not sure which of the other ingredients is the conditioner.The directions on the bottle say that this product should be used twice a week but I use it daily.  I am pleased with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IIIG8NUF10D4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001F51RJW#wasThisHelpful","R1IIIG8NUF10D4","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like a lot of things about this case. It is well made, a good size and stores GoPro items well.The case is made of a hard material that does not move much when I press on it. If I drop the case with my camera and other accessories in it I am comfortable nothing would break.The case looks nice. It has a handle. There is also carabiner which is a D shaped metal hook inside. The zipper works fine. On the back of the case there is a label with two lines.There is precut hard foam inside the case that feels strong and adds additional protection to a GoPro camera and accessories.  The foam cannot be moved.  There is a “elastic web” which is a square with elastic strips on it that allow for small items like memory cards to be stored safely.  The square can be removed if something else need to be stored in that spot.  The “elastic web” is the only removable part of the case.The top part of the case that opens out when the case is unzipped and has a mesh pocket on it.  Items can be stored inside the mesh.This can easily fit a GoPro camera, telescopic pole, charger and memory card as well as any plugs or wires.  Most importantly it does a good job protecting these items. I have had a number of camera cases over the years and this one is very well made and looks good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S80SZPO6X210/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKYZQVA#wasThisHelpful","R2S80SZPO6X210","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a big pillow that is much firmer than my regular pillows.  It does conform to my head and neck but I personally find it a bit firm.This pillow is listed as queen size but it is a big queen size. After getting this pillow I purchased a pillow protector that is queen size and a pillowcase that is full/queen size. The pillow protector fits but it is very snug and the pillowcase is very snug as well. I had to flatten the pillow to get the pillowcase over the pillow. I tried putting an old full/queen size pillowcase over the pillow and it did not fit.My head and neck do sink into the pillow but only to a certain point. Once my head and neck stop sinking the material in this memory foam pillow seems a bit firm. My regular pillows are much softer. This pillow offers much better support for my head and neck because of this firmness. I can see people really liking the pillow or wanting something softer.The pillow has a smell when you first get it. It is described in the care and use information sheet that came with the pillow as a “new car smell.”  I would not call it a “new car smell” because I like that smell.  For me the smell is like the smell of a new carpet. It is not a bad smell but it is not a good one either. I have had the pillow for a few days and I don't notice the smell anymore.Overall this is a good pillow for a memory foam pillow. I have tried other such pillows at stores that were much firmer.  The pillow cover on this is nice. It seems like it is made to last. The key to liking this for me is whether a person likes memory foam pillows of any type which all seem to be on the firm side or whether he or she likes softer pillows.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L2PIB4S120LN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UJ9BFCY#wasThisHelpful","R3L2PIB4S120LN","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in a river valley and have sandy soil.  There are marshes near me as well and I am not far from the coast.  Some grass just won’t grow. I figured I would try this.I planted this two weeks ago in an area in my back yard and have seen growth.  I raked the area first, used a grass seed spreader and went over the area with a rake to make sure the seeds were covered with soil. I watered the lawn every day.  The grass is still young so a lot can happen but so far a good portion of the seeds have worked. Hopefully the grass will continue to grow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UCEYTD0PWW6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARYORQC#wasThisHelpful","R1UCEYTD0PWW6L","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well designed cookbook full of nice photographs of mouth watering food.  The recipes are at the moderate level of complexity.  I tried a few of the easier ones and the food was great.This broadened my concept of Mediterranean cooking.  I had previously associated Mediterranean cooking with Greece, Italy, Spain and Lebanon. These are the Mediterranean restaurants that I have tried where I live. This book broadened my view of Mediterranean cooking to include the Middle East, North Africa, Persia, and Turkey.The pictures in this book are nice. These are not as glossy as I have seen in some cookbooks. The type is easy to read.  There is no nutritional information such as calories or carbohydrates listed for the recipes.The book is 8.2 x 0.8 x 10.3 inches and 224 pages. I have bigger cookbooks but this is a good size since it does not take up too much counter space.The recipes vary in size and complexity. I cook a bit but I don’t have a lot of exotic foods or spices in my kitchen.  There were are some spices and foods in this cookbook that I don’t usually uses such as maldon salt, sheep casings, sumac, blood orange juice and fiddle head ferns but for the most part the ingredients are things I would associate with Mediterranean cooking. The more a person cooks this type of food the more common the spices will become.I tried a few simple recipes. I love the Sweet Potatoes with Tamarind and Tahini, Middle Eastern Sausage with Lemon & Pomegranate Molasses and the Smokey Egg Plant Dip with Charmoula.  These took some work but they tasted great. There are other recipes with many ingredients that seem like a challenge but I will try someday.This is a nice looking cookbook that made me aware of Mediterranean flavors that were new to me.  The recipes vary in complexity.  The few I have tried came out great.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZICQXTSXT7LO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1624140955#wasThisHelpful","R1ZICQXTSXT7LO","A2068BC3ZXAVJQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2068BC3ZXAVJQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are a great way to let a person know if bed bugs or other crawling insects are hanging around a bed.  I like this because these can be placed around my bed and since they are nontoxic I don’t have to worry about pesticides by my bed.These can be placed under a bed, between a mattress or on the side of a mattress. They can be placed anywhere bed bugs might be. Some of the sprays are toxic so if you are unsure if you have bed bugs this is a safe way to find out.So far I have not seen any bedbugs.

"These had the potential to be great earrings. The charms were large with two-sided detail. I expected them to be heavy, but they were light. The earrings were constructed on a standard fishhook with a jump ring followed by the feather charm, making the feathers mobile and flirty.My problems are these. First, the charms face to the side because of the jump ring, not to the front to frame my face. From the front, they appear as thin swinging lines. Next, the feathers have an obvious curve to them, so it is easy to see that one of them faces forward, while the other faces backward. This gives my earrings an uneven appearance.I am a jewelry designer for local stores in our mountain town, so I like to purchase inexpensive accessories to get new ideas and to see what is fashionable - Call it ""research"". This pair of earrings are just not up to my standards, but my POV could be out-of-date and you might prefer this look.

The sliding back strap allows the thong to self-correct for motion and not get overly-tight. The front triangle of black mesh is a sassy touch. This is my first experience with 100% crotchless panties, and I'm not displeased.The handcuffs are a beginner novelty item. The wrist pieces are made of stretchy black mesh (same as in the thong) and are held together by elastic (same as the garters). They slip on and off easy but are cute to complete the outfit.Not included in the package:* Thigh-highsSizing: I am 5'0"" and 145 lb.

"RFID is an under-appreciated method of identity theft. A person with a small device in hand or pocket can wander around a shopping mall or festival and gather the credit card information of hundreds of people passing within a small radius of him or her. This ""information"" can be sold on the international market, assuming the thief isn't after a quick dollar on-the-spot. Most credit card companies offer protection from unauthorized charges, but clearing up such problems takes time, causes stress, and cannot always be resolved to our satisfaction. In addition, criminals look for other electronic cards to hack for entry into secure buildings or secure areas of public buildings - schools, labs, government facilities, military compounds, etc. Some states even use electronic chips in their driver's license and state ID cards. Cloning a electronic identity card can be as easy as the write equipment and opportunity.I'm a rather-be-safe-than-sorry person, so I jumped at the chance to review this assortment of RFID-blocking card sleeves, even though I already had a wallet performing the same task. My cards are not always inside my RFID-blocking wallet after all; sometimes, they're in my iPhone wallet case or loose in my pocket (a bad habit when I'm in a hurry after the check-out line). The sleeves allow me to protect my cards wherever I put them...or forget I've put them. The designs are stylish, and the fit is snug without being difficult to withdraw my cards by aid of the small fingerprint-shaped cutouts. I'm even thinking about a way to turn one into a necklace with a lanyard. I don't have a passport, but my brother, a frequent visitor to Nicaragua, is pleased with the passport holder.My only concern with this product stems from the disclaimer that it does not protect ""older prox cards"". I attempted research on different types of prox cards, but I got lost in the tech-speak.

My man is often under cars or driving nails in hard-to-light spots, so I thought he'd like to try this lamp. He loved it: the adjustable elastic head band, the three light settings (bright white, cooler red, and flashing red), its light weight, and the fact that it came with batteries included. But I tried it too.Chapter #2: Now, you might ask, ""What does a blind person need with a headlamp?"" There are degrees of blind. I still see shadows, light/dark, and blobs of color. Imagine my surprise when the brightest setting of this headlamp turned our dark house into a place I could navigate visually! Walls glowed white, bracketing dim doorways. Obsticles jumped out at me, if they were light-colored. It reminded me of the effect black lights had on my vision back when I could see well. But I'm passing along the existance of this headlamp to my visually-impaired friends, because some of them will do more than find this headlamp quaint and fun to play with; they'll find it useful for everyday activities, such as lighting a book while they read.Epilogue: So, from the him and the her, this headlamp is comfortable, useful, and a good product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NB4GM8GWE034/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEKW3KC#wasThisHelpful","R1NB4GM8GWE034","A351A2418T54US","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A351A2418T54US?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very useful brush. The long 16.5"" handle detaches from the brush head with a firm tug, but it won't come off on its own. The bristles are soft enough not to scratch the skin but strong enough to clean. There is a loop of cord on the end of the handle away from the brush head to hang the brush up. The brush head has a strap on its back to go around a person's hand when he's using it alone without the long handle. A cotton drawstring travel pouch is included which will hold the brush head (not the handle). This brush has come in particularly useful in our small shower (the kind one person can hardly fit in) to reach one's back and one's feet.

"This is a 30-day supply of resveratrol, a compound known for its heart-healthy and anti-aging properties. I accepted this product from the manufacturer in exchange for my honest opinion, because I have blood pressure problems which promote my mini-strokes. According to the manufacturer, this brand's resveratrol caps contain differing amounts of grapeseed and Japanese knotweed to reach the recommended 1500mg daily dose of resveratrol (3x 500mg), depending on the growing season. PubMed has this to say about the resveratrol compound and heart health:""Resveratrol, initially used for cancer therapy, has shown beneficial effects against most degenerative and cardiovascular diseases from atherosclerosis,hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion, and heart failure to diabetes, obesity, and aging. The cardioprotective effects of resveratrol are associated withits preconditioning-like action potentiated by its adaptive response. During preconditioning, small doses of resveratrol can exert an adaptive stress response,forcing the expression of cardioprotective genes and proteins such as heat shock and antioxidant proteins. Similarly, resveratrol can induce autophagy,another form of stress adaptation for degrading damaged or long-lived proteins, as a first line of protection against oxidative stress. Resveratrol's interactionwith multiple molecular targets of diverse intracellular pathways (e.g., action on sirtuins and FoxOs through multiple transcription factors and proteintargets) intertwines with those of the autophagic pathway to give support in the modified redox environment after stem cell therapy, which leads to prolongedsurvival of cells. The successful application of resveratrol in therapy is based upon its hormetic action similar to any toxin: exerting beneficial effectsat lower doses and cytotoxic effects at higher doses. 2011 New York Academy of Sciences.""I am very glad to have a natural way to stabilize my blood pressure. I hope this supplement will allow me to wean myself off of my heart-health prescription medication (under my doctor's supervision). I am already able to be more active without my heart feeling like it's about to pound out of my chest.Note: other brands sell lower doses of this supplement and are highly rated for their results. Therefore, I'd recommend taking the first bottle of this brand's resveratrol 3x day as it says on the bottle to infuse the compound into your body, then decreasing to 1x day for heart maintenance (and to save money).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T42WK3DLD029/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010U7HXG6#wasThisHelpful","R3T42WK3DLD029","A351A2418T54US","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A351A2418T54US?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love leggings and have them in various colors, patterns, and fabrics. I pair them with tunics and skirts. Amazon makes it easy for me to find leggings for my petite/short height (5'0"").These are my first ""jeggings"". They differ from jeans in that the front zipper flap, metal button, and front pockets are just for show. Only the back pockets are usable. The stretchy material hugs my skin - ""form-fitting"" is what Mom would say. But these jeggings make me look thinner, not like I'm trying to wear clothes too small for me, like some leggings can do. these are a thick, warm legging with the look of a jean (seams and belt loops included). The style is amazing, and the quality is exactly what I expect from a name brand jean company. My favorite part is that they come on/off so easy!The Lee jeggings are sized like jeans are sized, in numbers, not in catagories. I Usually wear a size 10P or 12 regular in women, so I purchased the 10P (for the hip room and shorter length). When I took them out of their package, I thought the length was much too long, but the inseam sort of shortened/conformed to me when I put them on to be the perfect length (without ruching). The only problem was that I should have purchased the 8P; the waist and butt were too loose in the 10P (I've not had this problem with any other 10P before). I'll just consider that my weight has a bit of room to flux and/or the rear will be covered by a tunic most of the time. The stretchy fabric makes me look skinnier, which is why it's important that you know the sizing in petite runs large (even for the most curvy of us). Also note that the dark color in the photo on Amazon is more dark than the jeggings seem in-person.Update: The more I wear these jeggings, the more loose they become, getting very baggy in the rear and the waist sliding down. Other leggings don't have this problem. I will definitely go for a size down next time and be prepared to wear a belt.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I0USGU50RUKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OYN8LGY#wasThisHelpful","R2I0USGU50RUKX","A351A2418T54US","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A351A2418T54US?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"War Angel is an IR thriller (Black/Latino) with a plot worthy of Shakespeare for the modern era (if not poetic prose). Watch the background as three weird sisters (in the paranormal sense) try to orchestrate the lives of the rest of the cast of characters and exactly how and when skeletons will fall out of whose closet.Jahaira knows her father wouldn’t approve, but she loves Lenox anyway, but she never takes him home to meet her parents. Two years later, no one even believes Jahaira  has a boyfriend, and they’re fine with her fiction (except the other man who wants her). Meanwhile Jahaira believes she has the complete and correct picture of her family: who’s cheating on whom, why, and the extent of where the money comes from. Oh, how wrong she is!Lenox will do anything for his Jahaira, but he never thought he’d have to prove it. He never thought he’d see the things he’d see or do the things he’d do. Lucky for Lenox, he grew up on the streets. He knows one end of a gun from the other. But sometimes, you’re darned if you do, and you’re darned if you don’t.Plot holes in this story relating to Lenox’s blackmail left me taken aback. I wanted to knock him in the head and yell at him, “You idiot! Fingerprints!” But then I caught on. Forensics was a “possibility” of how this was going to blow up in his face, while the author developed other avenues as well. It made the end predictable, yet the journey worth the trip.Elements of War Angel were unlike other books I have read recently. I identified with that the female protagonist was curvy and large-busted (not a skinny-mini). I approved of the sex being real, not always perfect, not hearts and flowers for the romance novel crowd. The emotions in the relationship ran deep, yet so did the doubts, just as in true life. The lesson of things never being as they appear was driven home well by the plot (and that of telling the truth up-front).This is only the beginning: War Angel is the first in a series. It did not end in a cliffhanger, but the weird sisters, quite displeased, are left plotting in the final scene of this contemporary thriller with paranormal overtones.I met Keith Kareem Williams in a Facebook literature group and have been following his witty repartee and sharing his thought-provoking book excerpts for some time now – and all before I picked up a book of his to read. That may sound odd, but he presented his Facebook profile professionally, and I “collect” writer friends who aren’t advertising every day for me to buy their books. KKW’s posts have been always grammatically-correct and intelligent. Because I have a high ranking on Amazon as a reviewer, I messaged him politely if he needed any reviews of his books, and he offered me War Angel at no cost in exchange for my honest opinion. I appreciate this opportunity, and I hope my honesty about this book will help you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HE2KLGUHCNQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E6TWRNE#wasThisHelpful","R2HE2KLGUHCNQU","A351A2418T54US","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A351A2418T54US?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Call it a “snowflake” or call it a “flower.” Either way, this well-plated pendant and chain combination is full of sparkle and class. The pendant is a hair over an inch in diameter with fine detail and accented with both Marquise and round cubic zirconia. The sixteen-inch chain has a two-inch extender and an easy-open lobster clasp (even if the clasp is tiny). I am of the opinion that I can’t own enough chains, and this sturdy chain is of a short length I’ve been needing (That almost-choker length). My only issue is that the title and product description says ""platnum"" for the plating, while the options to click on for the coloring mention colors,which is confusing, and the resulting necklace/pendant is an odd color to match. However, the quality ""looks"" and ""wears"" so well that I don't mind if the pendant and chain are plated in whatever, either one. The manufacturer of this piece also makes a matching ring and earrings. As a jewelry designer myself, I love to see what other designers are up to. I am glad to have this in my jewelry collection, because it is elegant, well-made, sturdy, and can be applied to both winter (“snowflake”) and spring (flower”).

This unit is just a bit wider than a deck of cards, and the USB's are grouped together in a row along one of the sides, not along the larger flat top (where there appears to be a heat vent).

"Why I wanted it:I accepted this bandeau in exchange for my honest opinion, because I wanted to try it as breast support with spaghetti-string tank tops and sun dresses with crisscross straps or straps that tie behind my neck. I own traditional strapless bras in black and in white with underwires and rubber around the bottom to keep them from sliding due to movement or the weight of my breasts. I needed something in “nude,” because it seems like everything I purchase is made of thinner and thinner fabric or have arm holes which would show ordinary bras.Buy one size down:My bust size is in-between a 36C and 36D, depending on the bra. Going by the size chart, I chose the XL. That was a mistake. The nylon construction of this bandeau is very giving/loose. I was expecting something supportive, like the controlling fabric of a swimming suit, but this product is designed more for “comfort” than “support.” Pick a size down.Cup size for A/B, not C/D:The firm cup pads are breast-shaped, but the ones in the XL appear to be made for a B-cup. I took one out and put it in one of my C-cup bras and couldn’t stop laughing. No, Hoveox, that wasn’t going to work. Wearing it, I didn’t just have under-boobage (and aroundage?), but I looked like I had stuffed something down my shirt to be funny. And there was no support. My breasts were still angled down and wiggled when I moved. Give me “lift” people! I need lift!Overall construction:I should add here that there are side seams. The top and bottom bands of nylon and elastic weave are thicker, but no less comfortable than the rest of the bandeau. It looks well-made of quality fabric for the right-size person who needs coverage without support. For this review, I kept wearing the bandeau for the afternoon, and the fabric and alignment of the pads stayed in place and never shifted. I regret that I can’t use this bandeau, after admiring its texture and practical applications. If you wash this on cold and don’t put it in the dryer, it will keep its shape longer (I needed to be told things like that when I was young).Rating:I’m subtracting stars from this product because the size chart did not get in the ballpark of my size – not even close. The XL bandeau can’t support and lift the breasts of larger-busted women (and women of larger measurements have heavier boobs). I am not knocking the bandeau all the way down, because their fabric and workmanship on the bandeau appear to be better than similar products I’ve seen in local stores. Plus, had this fit, the bandeau would have been the most comfortably-textured bra ever!","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26E9QUUXNF5NM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJ08UC8#wasThisHelpful","R26E9QUUXNF5NM","A351A2418T54US","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A351A2418T54US?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING! That's key. These are NOT ""clip-ons."" They're LEAVERBACKS. I wear all types,, because I'm a jewelry designer myself, so it didn't bother me. But try to use them as clip-ons, and the snowflake/flower ornimentation angles down, not facing directly forward.The just-over-one-inch charm of the earring is a snowflake or flower, depending on your point-of-view or the time of year. It's quite detaild and features a variety of Marquise and round cubic zirconia. The charm is sturdy and is well-attached to the earring; it doesn't dangle loosely.If I had to choose my favorite style of earring, I'd say it is the sturdy leaverback. Leaverbacks mean no fitting on or losing tiny rubber earring backs. They are the closest thing to toddler-proof I've met. They just seem to fit more naturally in my ear so that I don't notice that they are there. So I'm glad these turned out not to be clip-ons, even though I was prepared for clip-ons.The ""rose gold"" plating looks a bit too coppery, but I like the tone well enough, and it doesn't turn my sensitive skin.I received this item in exchange for my honest opinion. My words are my own, and I'm honest, no matter how good or bad the item is. I hope my experience as a jewelry designer for our local mountain stores is of help to you in this purchasing decision.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ISAIRNI1R7Z1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VI07W1Q#wasThisHelpful","R2ISAIRNI1R7Z1","A351A2418T54US","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A351A2418T54US?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have tried Forskolin and Garcinia Cambogia. They seemed to work, but, when I stress-ate, it didn't seem like they were helping much at all. I even drink lots of water and eat my fruits and veges. I needed something that would help me not eat so much and would approach the other weightloss qualities of the products I have tried. I blame my fibromyalgia and my strokes, but really, it's a lot of depression and apathy about life.What is a raspberry ketone? It is the compound that makes red raspberries smell so good. It is the major ingredient inside these 60 hyper-strength pills. Just open the bottle and smell the fruitiness!But the manufacturer went further, which is why each pill contains 1200mg of goodness, unlike 500mg or less in other brands. There's mango and acai and green tea and resveritrol too! What a bouquet of tummy-tucking, fat-melting ingredients!Why should you take this supplement? It curbs appetite, energizes the body, is a detoxer, moves waste more quickly through the body, supports the immune system, and keeps fat from being absorbed.Did it work for me? Yes. I was very impressed by how much appetite I lost. The amount of stress-eating I have done recently is way down. I have more get-up-and-go in the morning, and it lasts far into the day without making me too jittery (I am relieved that I use a quality sleep aid at night.). Thankfully, the odor and taste of the pills are pleasing, not hard-to-stomach like many of their weightloss competitors. I can take raspberry ketones with confidence, because I know I'm doing something chemically safe and helpful for my health.Now that I have actual results from this product, I'm even more encouraged to use it (and to try to get off my butt and exercise)!I was provided this product in exchange for my honest opinion, and my words are always my own, no matter how great or how bad the product is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB27HMPZD01WB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XVO37S4#wasThisHelpful","RB27HMPZD01WB","A351A2418T54US","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A351A2418T54US?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s been 4 long years since Leah Carson’s husband tried to kill her.  Four years of surgeries, rehabilitation and trying to learn to live without fear.  Today, Leah is a practicing veterinarian finding pleasure and closeness with the animals she treats, yet these last couple of months have her on edge.  Missing keys, flat tires, mysterious flowers - annoying but they held more terrifying memories of how her dead husband used to taunt her.Deidre, Leah’s one close friend has been murdered and a detective agent, Alex Morgan from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is hot on the case.  The fact that Deidre had been stabbed twenty-three times, the same as what had happened to Leah was just too coincidental leading to wonder whether or not Leah’s husband was really dead.As usual Mary Burton who is a master of suspense and terror keeps that tradition going with  I’LL NEVER LET YOU GO.  Blending her masterful suspense with the Morgan’s of Nashville series also added in a lovely romantic bent as well.  Because of previous books on the Morgans, one is able to understand what has shaped Alex into the brilliant detective he is.  Just as Alex was fleshed out, Ms. Burton did a remarkable job of fleshing out Leah as well, making one understand her fears and a little bit of her OCD.However, what Ms. Burton does best is change the rules and totally twist around everything one thinks is going on!  I’LL NEVER LET YOU GO is one highly recommended read! Most importantly, be prepared to be surprised at the end.Marilyn Rondeau","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32I2FFY3SYPKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TE63O9K#wasThisHelpful","R32I2FFY3SYPKA","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4-1/2*  Lady Sara Emerson has come to London for help. Several years ago her cousin Meredith had been brutally murdered, now Sara is receiving letters from the killer who seems to be targeting her.  Sara has come to beg assistance from the man who was once Meredith’s fiancé, the Duke of Rossmoyne, Gabriel Ferguson.  After the death of Meredith, he had promised that her family could always come to him for assistance.  And that is exactly why Lady Sara to appealed to him.Rossmoyne (Ross) had never paid much attention to Meredith’s shy, retiring, blushing cousin before.  Having just returned from India, his once wild ways, had changed where he had grown and was at once  drawn to Lady Sara’s lovely intelligent eyes and very calm demeanor.  However, he had no intention of staying in London and wished to return to India as soon as he could, but the guilt he had felt over Meredith’s still unsolved murder, required him to do his best to find the murderer.There were many things that I enjoyed in THE RELUCTANT DUCHESS.  One of course was the lovely characterization of Lady Sara, and the bonhomie she was able to bring out of the dour Duke of Rossmoyne.  I loved the relationship that evolved from friendship to love between these two.  Both of these protagonists were so very well fleshed out that one couldn’t help but feel compassion and love for them both.  The pace itself was also a boon and the  pages just flew by filled with a small amount of lovely secondary characters to add depth and interest to the story.  Personally I loved the little urchin Thomas who played a small pivotal role that led to the ultimate revelation of the villain in this plot.Also the angst of Sara’s unwillingness to believe she was worthy of becoming a duchess was well done as Ross attempted to profess his love and assurance that he was not the same person he was years back.  All in all, I can highly recommend THE RELUCTANT DUCHESS as one very enjoyable read most will find highly entertaining.Marilyn Rondeau","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E0O2HL6A7D9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TNDP168#wasThisHelpful","R2E0O2HL6A7D9J","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have read an awful lot of Grace Burrowes books and each and every one of them has left me feeling good, DANIEL’S TRUE DESIRE, was something else entirely.  I simply didn’t want to see it end!  Daniel and Kirsten were absolutely the most special couple ever, and Daniel - there are no words for a hero like him!  No, he didn’t have a title, he had very little money, nothing at all to recommend him for an Earl’s daughter like Kirsten, but oh, he had heart, he had honor, a sense of humor, and an abundance of love and understanding.  Be still my heart!The story starts off with Daniel, a vicar, bereft and on his way to Kent and his new assignment as the vicar of the family seat of earls of Bellefonte in Haddondale.  His life has hit a new low.  His wife had run off to God knew where, and the child he had raised for the last five years, had been reunited with Daniel’s sister Lottie.  Missing young Danny, the child most thought was his son, was excruciating.Resigned to spinsterhood, Lady Kirsten Haddonfield welcomed the new vicar and urged him to stay at her family’s home while the vicarage went under some much needed repairs.  In a very short time, the handsome vicar had Kirsten rethinking her ideas about love and marriage, but secrets thought dead and buried, were about to overcome any happiness Daniel and Kirsten thought they had found.What really made this story resonate so deeply in my heart?  It wasn’t just the wonderful romance and love that evolved with Daniel and Kirsten, it had even more to do with their interactions with their ‘rotten boys’.  As a vicar, it often fell upon them to tutor the young boys in Latin, maths, history and so on.  The supposedly rotten boys was a nickname they used for the youngsters who had driven parents and sisters to the brink, and needed just a tad of training.However, with Ms. Burrowes wielding the pen, these boys received much more than just lessons in studies, they learned and grasped the principles of becoming loving young men with the steady and loving care from both Daniel and Kirsten.There is just so much more emotion, that DANIEL’S TRUE DESIRE encompassed in this story that I could go on and on.  However, I don’t want to take away the enjoyment you will experience as I did on reading it.  Highly, highly, recommended.Marilyn Rondeau","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZC8V7YKCSOIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0108GOL3C#wasThisHelpful","R1ZC8V7YKCSOIU","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Years ago, Lord Owen Renderwell, gained a title for a highly publicized rescue of a kidnapped duchess, but only few knew that Scotland Yard’s famous detective worked alongside London’s most infamous thief and his criminally brilliant daughter, Charlotte Walker.  Lottie was like no other woman Owen had ever met.  She mesmerized and challenged him on every belief he’d ever had and yet he wanted her, but at the end he’d lost her.Now a private detective tracking down a murdered, Owen has sought Lottie out.  No matter how they may deal with issues of the past, he will always be a man of law, and she a criminal.  Yet whenever Owen is near, and while Lottie tells herself it could never be – they both long for a future that could never be theirs.To me, this had a bit of a slow start, but I persevered and found that after a while, I understood where they were coming from and began trying to figure out who and why the murders were taking place.  Naturally, the reveal took time as to discovering just why Lottie detested Owen as much as she did and them both trying to uncover the mystery of  the clues left behind.  Of course there were a plethora of other little twists and turns in trying to discover who had been committing murders and leaving a trail of crumbs that led to Lottie’s door, but the bigger surprises came in at the end and they were surprising.The romance was slow to evolve, as the protagonists (especially Lottie) was quite stubborn and as it turned out, miss-guided in her opinions.  However, A TALENT FOR TRICKERY was a good read and well worth your time.Marilyn Rondeau","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PV4ZIEEVFUHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492620505#wasThisHelpful","R1PV4ZIEEVFUHZ","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love starting new series and when they are written by a favorite author it makes them even more delectable.  Lorraine Heath just happens to be one of my favorite auto-buy authors and FALLING INTO BED WITH A DUKE, the first book of her new series Hellions of Havisham, was a total delight!Miss Minerva Dodger was one very smart cookie and knew enough to choose spinsterhood over the many fortune-hungry suitors she’d encountered over her six unsuccessful seasons.  Lord, she had even written a book on how to spot and what to do when one with a sizable dowery was targeted by fortune-hungry suitors!  However, as much as Minerva was set to enjoy her spinsterhood, she wanted to experience one night of pleasure.  Minerva had heard of the very secret Nightingale Club, a notorious place where ladies could don a mask before choosing a lover.  If she could just screw up the courage to take that step, and actually she did!Masked and quite nervous Minerva recognized at once the sinfully handsome Duke of Ashebury and although rules stated the lady should be the one to approach the man, the Duke took one look at the long-legged vision in white and made a beeline to Minerva.  He was more than willing to satisfy the secretive ladies desires and escorted her to his room.  However, Minerva lost her bravado after sharing an intimate conversation and a more than heart stirring kiss.  Ashebury, ever the gentleman let her go, but reserved his expectations and desire to discover who she truly was.  Naturally, Ashebury discovered within days who the masked temptress was, and totally intrigued set out to capture her, but was it she who had captured him?Such a wonderful premise, and fabulous characters.  I loved the fact that Minerva was so very capable, a highly intelligent young woman who while not a beauty, had much more to offer Ashebury.  Ashebury, didn't realize at the time that her wit and intelligence was exactly what he needed most in a wife and partner, to help him put the ghosts of his past away.Bottom line:  An absolutely endearing and enjoyable story with wonderful characterizations and folks you want to come back to and discover how they get on.  Loved this story and looking for more in this new series.Marilyn Rondeau","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY1ASDHA00FDU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3DNJKI#wasThisHelpful","RY1ASDHA00FDU","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The very lovely Lorelei Sundun had never here of the mysterious Wherlock clan and their other worldly abilities.  However after a surprisingly handsome man appeared in her garden, quite nude asking her for help, then that same nude man disappear a moment later in front of her eyes she thought she was insane.  Quite possibly what she witnessed was impossible, but the fact remained that she was totally intrigued that she just might be falling in love with a ghost!  She must do something, but what?Caught by a madman intent on stealing Argus Wherlocke’s gift /talent to be used as weapons, Argus needed to alert and seek help from his family.  He didn’t plan to involve a duke’s lovely daughter in the struggle, but now the lovely Lorelei is his only hope for salvation.I have long been a follower of Ms. Howell’s Wherelocke series  and believe me it just gets better and better and the characters, she creates are immensely endearing and lovable.  I particularly loved Lorelei, her father the duke, his brood of children, and his butler!  What an incredibly loving family, including siblings, and cousins.  But that is not all, because Lorelei did get the word out to Argus’ family and they all came to rally round to help capture the madmen who thought to steal the Wherelocke’s gifts.  Naturally, each and every one of the Wherelocke’s had their own individual gifts and talents. Discovering some all over again, some new and some I’ve seen before in earlier volumes just added to the enjoyment of reading this series.The villain’s in IF HE’S DANGEROUS were particularly vile, which made for a lot of juicy adventures, thrills and chills, excitement, and ever lasting suspense.  Much of it ‘edge-of-the-seat’ suspense.  This is just simply one of my favorite series with fast paced adventures, quite sensual romances and just one of the best series of exciting adventures.Ashford MacNab, Narrator, takes the impeccable writing of Hannah Howell and makes it into a visible theater of images for the listener.

"Ms. Gracie’s heroine Abby was enormously lovable right from the get-go.  Abigail Chantry was a governess and had a good working relationship with her employers and her charges but when she heard her younger sister was in desperate straits, Abby would do anything to save her and two of her sister’s dearest friends from a fate worse than death, including death itself.  Hiding from being discovered by folks who would do them harm,  funds were at a perilous or nonexistent state.  Needing medication for her sister Abigail decided to break into an empty mansion in the hope of finding something to sell.  What Abby did find was Lady Beatrice Davenham, bedridden and neglected. Horrified at how Lady Beatrice’s servants were robbing their mistress blind, with Lady Beatrice’s affirmation Abby then fired them all - with Lady Beatrice’s blessing.  After that Lady Beatrice had these four young ladies become her “nieces” .Life was good until Lady Beatrice’s dashingly handsome and arrogant nephew, Max, Lord Davenham return from the Orient and discovers an impostor running his household.I have to say that I have always been a fan of Anne Gracie but what originally prompted me to pick up this audio was two things, one the gorgeous artwork of the cover, and second because I have always liked Ms. Gracie’s writing.  So WOW - I got DOUBLE the pleasure!!!  Add to that the superb narration by Allison Larkin and this Audible version was the best!Not only do you have a wonderful sensual romance going on between Max and Abby (once they figured it out) but Lady Beatrice was a darling; her other “nieces” were sweethearts; and Abby’s friends who had always looked out for her became their butler and footman!  It was a purely spectacular mix of great characters who interacted with each other in a wonderful tableau of danger, adventure and humorous antics.Naturally, there was also the danger of the fiends who were trying to find Abby’s sister and reel her back into the dangerous brothel she had escaped from.  Add to that the mystery of how and why her sister ended up there in the first place and you have one fully fleshed out tale, that will keep you listening to the very wee hours.This Audible version is highly recommended.Marilyn Rondeau","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3THQY4RBJO7Q2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425259250#wasThisHelpful","R3THQY4RBJO7Q2","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a massive talent in the paranormal romance genre, Kresley Cole is a must-buy for me and a mission to acquire every one of her Immortal After Dark books which just get better and better!  Sometimes we revisit characters from the past – especially some very cool and fun ones, as well as the bad guys.  Old characters are brought up to date to what’s going on in the present and some come in to aid the the perplexed!  And then we have Nix the all-knowing, inexplicable, scatter-brained sooth-sayer who is never wrong and an absolute hoot!The plot of UNTOUCHABLE features the fourth Wroth (vampire) brother who finds love, in an almost impossible situation for any man - human or vampire.  Murdoch is totally besotted with Daniela the Ice Maiden.  Unfortunately, to touch her will bring her unbearable pain and vice-a-versa.  So how to overcome this?  First of all is the element of trust which takes awhile for Murdoch to forge with Daniela and to keep her safe from those that were trying to kill her!Both stubborn - neither Murdoch or Daniela are able to accept their undeniable attraction to one another, nor that they are destined as mates.  They have the the all the adventures and excitement of Murdoch trying to keep her alive while they meet half-way - then clash and back off.  But then an amazing thing happens when Daniela accidentally bloods him and Murdoch will never be the same again, but then Daniela disappears and the  biggest adventure begins again.No spoilers here – but it will be up to you to see how north and south can come together to meet at the equator!Bottom line:  Just simply another fabulous entry in one of the more original paranormal genre’s out there.

"Lord almighty, even though I hope Ms. Ward doesn't ignore my favorite Blackdagger Brotherhood I am more than excited to follow along with THE BOURBON KINGS after this initial introduction of Book #1 which has whetted my appetite for more.What could be better than a filthy rich family – pillars of society and dysfunctional as all hell  – who are finding out that their own father has practically bankrupted the Easterly Estate and left most of them without their silver spoons!  Book one centers around Tulane “Lane” the prodigal son of the bourbon dynasty who seems to be left holding the ruin of his family’s legacy; a cheating and poisonous soon to be ex-wife; a totally dysfunctional sister whom he is trying to save from herself; and his oldest brother who was physically and mentally abused and almost killed by their father.The stage was set with one bright beam of light in Lizzie King, Easterly’s head gardener, who had made the mistake of falling in love with Lane, and just might be the one person who can save Lane in order to pull Easterly back from the precipice of total ruin.Alexander Cendese who performed this audible narration did a good job and loved his southern drawl, however, I would have liked a better interpretation of the female voices.BOTTOM LINE:  This was one extremely powerful and ensnaring beginning of what looks to be another phenomenal series from the talented pen of one of my favorite authors.  Ward has set the stage for another intoxicating series and I can’t wait to see who manages to stay alive and prospers once the dust settles and Book 2 comes out.

"At the suggestion of a friend of mine, I decided to give the critically acclaimed author Linda Fairstein atry and was extremely pleased to be able to find her very first debut novel in my preferred format - audio!The heroine, Alexandra Cooper is Manhattan’s top sex crimes prosecutor who wakes up one morning to learn some shocking news - the newspapers and news channels were discussing her brutal murder! Naturally, she was far from dead, but knew at once from the reports that the body found was not her but her friend Isabella Lascar, a Hollywood star whom Alex had allowed to stay at her Martha’s Vineyard home.  The question facing Alex now was Isabella targeted by a stalker; or was someone out to kill Alex and mistook Isabella for her?The characterization of Alex and her colleagues were wonderful as well as the background one is exposed to concerning the legal workings of a top ADA prosecutor.  I loved the dialogs between Alex and her wisecracking colleague Mike Chapman who is a hoot in some ways to disguise a brilliant investigative mind.  There are a plethora of twists and turns to keep the pace rapid and a good amount of interesting secondary characters which add a lot of depth to the mystery.Bottom line:  A terrific thriller and a most enjoyable way to discover a new author whose I hope to read a lot more from.Marilyn Rondeau","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UIEBXTPUCQLH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XL6TM0#wasThisHelpful","R1UIEBXTPUCQLH","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Introduced in Ms. Galen’s EARLS JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN, Gideon Harrow had spent his life in the dark alley’s of the London rookery known as St. Giles.  Thieving and cons were a way of life he wanted to rid himself of so he had planned one last heist to win his freedom and leave London far behind.  All was going rather well barely escaping his cronies out to kill him for his double cross, when he fell prey to an even bigger threat – into the hands of one of Society’s most untouchable cherished daughters – Lady Susanna Derring.Having been suffocated under the thumb of her domineering mother; and protective older brothers, Susanna wants out – she wants an adventure; and she wants to experience Vauxhall Gardens at any cost.  Blackmailing Gideon, she hides from him the velvet pouch that holds his ticket out of London. In order to get his property back he must take her to Vauxhall Gardens.  But as her adventure turns into a series of mis-adventures and a whole lot of danger would she have to pay such a high price and bank on the love of a reformed thief?*** In this second book of the  Covent Garden Cubs,  which by the way is completely stand-alone even if you hadn’t read the first book in this series, you will still experience the excitement, adventure and danger of life lived in London’s underbelly.  Gideon who played a part in the first book is fully fleshed out in this second book where we see his motivations and learn more of his background.Susannah who just happens to be the sister of  the Earl of Dane (who captured his wife in the first book of the series) has led a much more stringent upbringing which is fully exposed as to the how and why in the rather twisty surprise ending.  Naturally, it was a wonderful experience to watch Ms. Galen take the once very obedient young woman and turn her loose with Gideon as her guide and watch her grow in a woman of strength, purpose, and self esteem.Bottom line:  This was a wonderfully fast-paced adventure with witty humorous dialogs, outrageous double entendres; and a beautifully evolved sensual romance.  What could possibly be better than that?  Highly recommended.Marilyn Rondeau","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10WD4II2I4NC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W3WTUQI#wasThisHelpful","R10WD4II2I4NC9","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a total delight to read.  Actually, it was two novella’s turned into one complete beginning to the Windham Family series.  It sets the stage for a plethora of stories regarding the prolific progeny that Percival and Esther Windham’s marriage produced.  But what THE DUKE AND HIS DUCHESS did for me was to show two people who were not perfect but whose love and respect for one another through thick and thin; gossip; betrayals; family sickness was so strong and so enduring that it is a love story for the ages.Back from the Canadian and American wilderness, Percival (Percy) and his brother Anthony met Esther Himmelfarb at a house party where if gossips were correct their mother the Duchess of Windham had ordered her two younger sons to find themselves suitable brides.  With Percy, known as  something of a rake, he had noticed the girl without a title or dowry and was intrigued by her down to earth attitude and absence of the usual arsenal of feminine wiles of trapping a nobleman. Easy to talk to and lovely to boot Percy moved fast and their romance was brief and a whirlwind marriage followed.Part two was the marriage five years later with Esther and Percy producing four children in the nursery and the reality of living along with others in the ducal estate with an aging duke on the verge of senility and the heir apparent (Percy’s brother Peter) not well.  It was interesting that all was not sugar plums and fairy tales but Ms. Burrowes showed real life where the issues of not enough help would plague a mother (Esther) who was overloaded with the responsibility of four quick births, the exhaustion of nursing (they couldn’t afford a wet nurse), and keeping track of four rambunctious young boys.Ms. Burrowes not only writes the most wonderful love stories but she does this with reality as well as great emotion.  She shows where Esther is still in love with her handsome dashing soul mate, but truthfully is just plain exhausted.  She also portrays Percy as loving and caring to the point where he visits an ex-mistress to question her about his wife’s health.  Strange yes, but a proud man and very much in love with Esther that he would go to a source he knew Esther, should she find out, would be very upset.Bottom line:  Again Ms. Burrowes writes real and beautifully described romances with more than fluff and sex scenes.  Every Burrowes book I’ve read is a keeper and resonates in my heart and mind long after the last page is turned.  Simply a marvelous beginning to a fabulous series and family dynasty.Marilyn Rondeau","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IXN9QLW3M0A5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492626171#wasThisHelpful","R3IXN9QLW3M0A5","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another new author for me and if this is an example of how she writes and plots Ms. Maeve Greyson just may become a favorite.  What was not to love about MY HIGHLAND BRIDE?  First, not necessarily your run-of-the mill time traveler - Ms. Greyson’s heroines were time-runners  !  Quite unique where they not only could go back and forth but this group of time-runners also had some unique gifts - trust me as I will let you discover what they are for yourselves.Kenna Sinclair was presently quite happy in 2015 running the family’s boutique of herbs and perfumes, until she received a message from her grandmother [who is presently in Medieval Scotland in the 13th century]  telling Kenna it is time for her to join both her and her elder sister Jolie who is about to give birth to her 2nd child.  Kenna is really not ready to do this but duty calls and she would love to see her new niece or nephew.  The surprise in store for Kenna is that Mother Sinclair (Granny) has found Kenna’s fated husband.  Kenna is not thrilled until she touches his arm and electricity runs up her entire body.  Now that never happened before!Suffice it to say that there are many humorous moments, as Kenna (modern Miss) squares off with Colum Garrison (Medieval warrior).  In fact, Colum is frustrated that Kenna is the first lass who seems completely immune to his charms.  Kenna, who reads minds, saw at once that he had probably slept with every lass in the clan and decided she was not about to become another notch on his sword.  Actually it was quite tough seeming uninterested and frustrating because deep in her heart Kenna knows that she has met the only man she will ever love.  However, this romance was never going to be an easy accomplishment!Not all was coming up roses, and danger came in the form of one very mysterious and handsome Clan chief who decided that Kenna was the Lass HE intended to have.  This aspect was cleverly written and evoked humor, danger and an emotional pull that had me tearing up.Bottom line:  Excellent read and a series I plan to continue for this is right up my alley, with great romance and immense intrigue.  Loved it!Marilyn Rondeau","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R245AYA669BS3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QE1DM18#wasThisHelpful","R245AYA669BS3J","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WHAT TO DO WITH A DUKE is a delightfully charming book and one which to my mind was totally enchanting.  The fact that this is the first book in a new series – Spinster House Series – makes it even more delectable for me when I can start a great series right from the start.Daughter of the town cleric in the village of Loves Bridge, Miss Isabelle Catherine “Cat” Hutting was thrilled when she heard that the spinster who had occupied the Spinster House had eloped and the house was empty.  Notification went out to the Duke of Hart aka the Cursed Duke  who must come and formally endorse the next spinster to occupy the house.  Cat who needed peace and quiet to write her novel - away from the interruptions of a busy house and numerous siblings - knew that at the advanced age of 25 she was on the shelf; didn’t want to get married; and wanted to be the next spinster to occupy that wonderful quiet house.After being notified of the vacancy at the Spinster House, Marcus, the Duke of Hart hightailed it to Loves Bridge following the rules all Dukes of Hart must follow which were dictated 200 years before in order to select the next spinster to occupy the house.One problem Cat encountered was that the Cursed Duke was the most handsome man she had ever seen, and very impressive.  The same problem Marcus faced as he was just as attracted to Cat as she to him.  The bigger problem was the actual curse which stated that any Duke of Hart who married would never see his heir born and be dead within the next nine months of a valid pregnancy.With wit and writing that moved this story right along at a great pace, plus characters that leapt into your heart (especially the four year old twin brothers of Cat) this is one of those splendid reads that one doesn’t like to lay down until finished!  Excellent and highly recommended.Marilyn Rondeau","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN95R6QJA1U3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U7LIZ86#wasThisHelpful","RN95R6QJA1U3W","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Daniel Herbert had buried his grief in medical studies after the death of his childhood sweetheart whom he’d intended to marry.  Basically, he’d closed off his heart and was passionate only for his medical studies which of course made him an exceptional doctor whom most who knew him viewed as a saint.Unfortunately, when he learned that he’d inherited a title and estate from a distant relative, Daniel was less than overjoyed as the burden of wealth would interfere with his medical calling.  Reluctantly, he accepted his sister and brother-in-law’s guidance on how to get on in society. Daniel also thought it was time to find a wife.  A wife who was sensible, intelligent and could look after the estates so he could pursue his medical calling.  What he didn’t expect was to be overcome with passion by a woman described as the Black Widow.*** As usual, Ms. Putney engages you from the very first pages and with NOT ALWAYS A SAINT, she continues in kind.  Her hero Daniel is an amazing young man and one can see where most all would consider him a saint.  I fell in love – not only with Daniel but with Jessie aka the Black Widow and Ms. Putney’s wonderful dialogs and elegant prose. With glimpses into the lives of some of her past heroes and heroines it was like being invited to a wonderful family reunion.Daniel was wonderful, kind, caring, loving with no mysteries. Jessie on the other hand came with secrets galore, which made the story move at a rapid pace and made this reader continue reading into the wee hours to finish.  The passion and sensual scenes, all tastefully done, were beautifully rendered. When discoveries were made as investigations into Jessie’s past ghosts were unearthed and not all was joy, but Ms. Putney was able to give closure to many of the mysteries and nightmares Jessie had carried with her all her life.  Some joyful - some not and with a cliff-hanger in the offing would they finally have a happy ending?  You will have to read to discover!All in all, this was a most excellent read by one of the long-standing stars of this genre!  Brava Ms. Putney - you continue to entrance and entertain.Marilyn Rondeau","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW0TVDVO0V60P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1420127179#wasThisHelpful","RW0TVDVO0V60P","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Again a new author for me, and a story and writing that I thoroughly enjoyed.Miss Margaret Mayfield was an obedient child and daughter, never given her parents a moments worry as they molded her into a perfectly compliant young woman.  Timid, shy, with no real spunk or an original thought in her head.  Brainwashed as well by her parents who saw the world as black and white, right and wrong.  About to have their annual dinner party, Margaret was warned by her mother that Sir Justin Keighley had been invited as a manner of course, but for Margaret to steer clear of him at all costs as his opinions, and arrogance were rude beyond comprehension.  Forewarned, Margaret was on her guard.Sir Justin Keighley found Margaret to be everything he detested in a woman.  Shy, retiring, obedient to her parents (whom Justin detested) and ignorant of the real world around her!  When the party decided to go for a walk, Margaret planned to duck out of sight but unfortunately, Justin saw her and decided to tag along.  Before Margaret  realized it she imagined all kinds of horrors at the hands of such a rake and went into hysterics, falling, ripping her gown and that is how the rest of the guests found her with Justin attempting to help her to her feet.  Naturally, the parents insisted Justin marry the twit - he refused!And so it began…. and the story evolved into a delicious adventure where both Margaret and Justin had the chance to grow.  Margaret was still of the opinion that Justin was rude and beastly; Justin still thought Margaret a brainless twit but hearing she had run away, he felt honor bound to follow and bring her home.  Unfortunately, mishaps happen and the comedy of errors began but rather than give any more details, I will simply say - this is a must read and my opinion is that you will enjoy every morsel of this story as much as I did.  Reading A RADICAL ARRANGEMENT was a most enjoyable pleasure and I highly recommend this book!!!Marilyn Rondeau","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYIKBUIYSQ9B2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402276966#wasThisHelpful","RYIKBUIYSQ9B2","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One thing you will find whenever you pick up a book by Grace Burrowes - you are in for a rare treat! Not only is Ms. Burrowes one of the most refreshing and prolific authors to have arrived on the scene since her debut book THE HEIR in December of 2010, but she has amassed a legion of dedicated fans. Fans, like myself, who are ready and willing to devour anything she puts her name to be it historical, or contemporary genres!  Ms. Burrowes is just that good - grabbing you in the first chapter, or first page, and never letting you go until the end.Just as in TREMAINE’S TRUE LOVE, Ms. Burrowes gives us a very wealthy wool magnate, who truly loves his sheep prowling the world in search of new strains and improving the bloodlines of the sheep he loves, all while making more and more profits.  When he meets the somewhat reserved Lady Nita Haddonfield, he recognizes that she is more than just an attractive face.  But Nita, is to all intents and purposes content with her lot in life - not looking or expecting to marry and have to answer to a husband.  She has purpose, commitment, and a dedication far beyond that of most women - she is a healer and caters to the needy in spite of her family’s objections.  She could never expect a man to allow her the freedom and the chances she takes with herself to tend to her patients.However, Ms. Burrowes never gives you a one dimensional character, and Tremaine St. Michael, for all his wealth is cut from a different cloth.  Maybe brusque at times, but with a heart and feelings that rush across the pages straight into your heart - yes I adore this hero she created!  Not only do you have the most wonderful hero in Tremaine, but Nita is also one of the more giving and loving heroines I’ve come across lately and will hold a special place in my heart long after I turned the last page.Bottom line:  Kudo’s and blessings to Ms. Burrowes who continues to enrapture her legions of fans with every word she writes.  TREMAINE’S TRUE LOVE is not to be missed!!!Marilyn Rondeau","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39JTLPPFCJM25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFZ0D8A#wasThisHelpful","R39JTLPPFCJM25","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After police rescued Jenna Thompson a five year old from a closet she’d been held captive in for nine days, and with her family murdered by the same madman, her aunt whisked her away to live in Baltimore.  Twenty-five years later, Jenna, now a forensic artist, has returned to Nashville on a quest to find peace with herself after a particularly brutal case in Baltimore brought back memories of her own childhood ordeal which she would rather remain buried.Detective Rick Morgan, is on a new case where a child’s skeletal remains are found.  He learns of Jenna’s forensic artistic ability to recreate a face based upon a skull and enlists her help.  Jenna agrees realizing that though she lived through her horror another child hadn’t.  But worse than that, other women are dying, and the links between these new murders and Jenna’s past are coming to light and Rick is beginning to realize that Jenna may still be in more danger from a madman who appears to be looking to tie up loose ends.Mary Burton’s latest novel, BE AFRAID is one more reason that proves that if you are looking for complex, twisted, action-packed thrills and chills – rest assured - Ms. Burton should be your “go-to author”.  I have read several of her novels now and they just get better and better.  Burton has a knack for playing her cards close to the vest and I haven’t been able to guess her villains until she is ready to reveal them!  The complexity of Burton’s plotting is top-notch and her writing style is clean and fresh with no wasted words.Burton’s characters are all superbly drawn and fleshed out by the end of the novel. Any questions the reader might have about what one person has to do with another and what connections link them will be revealed.  All in all, BE AFRAID is just one more novel on an impressive list of like genres that place Ms. Burton at the top of her game!

"Awesome, awesome, awesome - the GRAY MAN series gives the BOURNE series a run for its money and if the producers in Hollywood haven’t picked up on what would be a fantastic series set to the big screen than they are simply not paying attention!In Book 4 of The Gray Man series, ex-CIA master assassin Court Gentry is still trying to stay out of light and into the shadows.  With so many entities out to kill him including the US Government, Court is having more and more difficulty remaining in the shadows.  On his last assignment of taking revenge on a former employer who betrayed him, a killer very much like Court has now set his sights on him.Russell Whitlock, code-named Dead Eye, is a graduate of the same secret Autonomous Asset Program that trained and controlled Court.  However, Dead Eye is going rogue in order to frame and terminate his ultimate target - Court Gentry and earn the distinction of being the one man who could take Court down.In another of Greaney’s fabulous additions to his Gray Man series, I can say one might need oxygen handy as the suspense is so tense I find myself holding my breath through this authors amazing detailed descriptions of the blow-by-blow action.  Greaney’s writing is astounding bringing you right along with the Gray Man’s adventures and heart-stopping suspense which he masterfully generates.Bottom line:  Mark Greaney’s Gray Man books are top notch and DEAD EYE  is just one more example of the best you may find in CIA black OPs thrillers!

"Some time ago, the widow Ursula Kern took control of her life and began the Kern Secretarial Agency providing reliable professional services to its wealthy clientele.  Anne Clifton, both friend and one of her finest employees has met an untimely end – and Ursula is unconvinced it was NOT from natural causes.Ursula’s latest employer Slater Roxton, archaeologist and adventurer, is not only upset that she is going to quit her position with him to start investigating Ms. Cliftons demise; but feels it is too dangerous if Ursula’s intuition of foul play is correct.  Instead, Slater intends to stay very close and volunteers to help Ursula with her investigation.  In the interim big sparks of attraction occur between Ursula and Slater, but Ursula’s independent nature and intent to go it alone put her life in danger.  In the end, would Slater be able to save Ursula for a future he now feels could be theirs?As usual, Ms. Quick has struck gold in this latest novel of intrigue in Victorian London.  Her plotting is superb, characterizations are impeccable and pacing of the action is fast and exciting.  Her heroine, Ursula Kern is a very admirable character - ahead of her time as an early entrepreneur who has not only helped herself to financial security but had also given many women the opportunity to gain their own independence as professionals.Likewise, I was fully intrigued with Slater Roxton.  The preface gives a wonderful look at Slater’s background and his adventures on a mystical island that if he weren’t a survivor could have entombed him;  but otherwise shaped him into the very interesting man he’d become.  Outside he presented what one would consider a mild scholarly individual, but underneath he was anything but!  With Ursula and Slater both stubborn and independent individuals who had been burnt by others, levels of trust were hard for each to accept or accommodate.Finally, the intrigue of following a minute amount of clues which ended up as one very big and deadly conspiracy was, as usual for Ms. Quick, amazingly complex and action packed.  GARDEN OF LIES was another brilliantly staged drama full of action, and surprises.  Bottom line: Most readers should be gratified with the thrills, chills, sensuality, and total excitement Ms. Quick brings to each and every novel.Marilyn Rondeau","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I4WUILEP0E7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399165150#wasThisHelpful","R1I4WUILEP0E7V","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It really thrills me when I get to start a series that starts out as wonderfully as this one.  I picked this up via Audible and spent a lot of my time just riding around to hear more.  Had I been reading this, I’m sure I would have never put POTENT PLEASURES down - except to heed natures call - and to get something to eat or drink!  Naturally as a fan of Eloisa James, this seems to happen each time I pick up one of her books - they’re just that good!About to make her debut to society, Charlotte Calverstill the youngest daughter  of a duke, was given leave to visit Julia, a school chum.  Her mama was busy completing arrangements for Charlotte’s come-out ball.  Charlottes friend Julia was a bit foolish and always falling in love and Charlotte was talked into attending a masquerade ball to keep Julia out of trouble.  Innocents that they were, neither realized it was a courtesans ball and the lemonade was spiked. Julia didn’t drink her tainted lemonade, Charlotte did.  So when a darkly handsome young man swept her into his arms Charlotte went willingly and after he relieved her - not against her wishes - of her virginity Charlotte realized she was ruined.Years later, when Charlotte and the rouge (Alex Foakes) meet again, the still devastatingly handsome Earl does not remember her, yet he is totally smitten and vows to wed her.  Charlotte finally knows who he is, and that he is primarily looking to find a mother for his young daughter so Charlotte  planned to lead him a merry chase.  However Charlotte couldn’t resist the same sizzle that affected him also affected her.However, while this sets the stage for the beginning of the tale it is by no means the end of the story.  I simply can’t give anymore away.  The marriage does take place, and the emotional upheavals, the joys, betrayals, and trust issues are all there, making for both joyous and heartbreaking scenes.  I found POTENT PLEASURES to be an emotional roller-coaster ride.  Charlotte was so precious, so very innocent even after she had been ruined.  Her mother the duchess was so very loving, and at times the dialogs between them were actually hilarious!  Just remember the term “floppy poppy” and you’ll understand what I mean.Alex Foakes, the Earl of Sheffield & Foakes, was a superb hero – a wonderful papa, to his orphaned year old daughter; a consummate lover; and a bit of jerk all at the same time!  Ms. James portrayal of the Charlotte and Alex was wonderfully complex and beautifully done.  Lessons learned here were how damaging gossip, twisted and turned could ruin lives and cost unnecessary damage.Bottom line:  Eloisa James continues to be tops on my list of authors for remarkable storytelling, her exuberant humor, sensual love making and emotions.  At times I would have liked to hit Alex over the head, for his stupidity; and his daughter Pippa will make your heart sing!  Excellent read!Marilyn Rondeau","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RER6M3QWFOLJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0440234565#wasThisHelpful","RER6M3QWFOLJD","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again, Ms. Burrowes has created another perfectly enjoyable and brilliantly written tome of THE DUKE’S DISASTER set in Regency England.  She has created Noah Winters,  a wonderful hero I simply fell in love with whose droll sense of humor was a refreshing change of pace for me.When Noah’s, choice of bride whom he’d been pursuing cried off and betrothed herself to another Noah had to revise his plans.  Not wanting to waste any more time, Noah decided that his chosen bride’s companion, Lady Thea Collins, who had been in attendance during his pursuit would be his next best choice as his duchess.  After all, Lady Thea seemed sensible and even attractive. Once her former employer married Thea would no longer be needed as a paid companion.  After all, rather than have to look for new employment, wouldn’t she be more than grateful to become his duchess and bear him an heir and a spare.Lady Thea, knew enough not to expect any kind of romantic gestures from the Duke and that he expected she would jump at the chance to become his duchess.  She certainly knew he was no romantic. It was his duty after all to continue his line with a proper heir.  Naturally, he expected she would be grateful for the offer, yet Thea didn't jump at his offer.  Thea had a confession to make but in Noah’s rush to have the marriage completed, she hadn’t the opportunity to bare her soul.As it turned out both the duke and his newly married duchess, never came clean with one another.  Lady Thea didn’t have the opportunity to tell Noah that she was no longer a virgin; and Noah had neglected to discuss with Thea the existence of two young daughters that resided in another wing of his massive home.With her usual intelligent and delectable prose, Ms. Burrowes has given her fans another example of why her writing has attracted such a legion of fans.  Not only is Burrowes writing impeccable but her characterizations and plotting is always brilliant.  I loved the story - both Noah and Lady Thea were perfect together and I loved their dialogs, especially during their morning breakfast’s in bed.  Their shared tea; and his ever present touchy-feely tendencies.  Noah’s two adorable young daughters were also a delight.Bottom Line:  Love, love, loved this story and especially the very surprise ending.

"My first experience with this author.  Her heroine, Cassandra Burton - a duchess and human - was totally unique when first introduced driving a cart through the cemetery to steal a fresh corpse!  But Cassandra’s interest was purely scientific.  Cassandra had a brilliant mind and wanted to be a doctor, but because of her sex, she would never be admitted to study with others.  So for the last ten years she studied on her own every medical text she could get her hands on. Now she needed human cadavers in order to further her studies so that she could heal people.However, this particular night she was caught – not by the police but by the Lord Vampire of London, a man she actually knew from society Don Rafael Villar and he was none too happy thinking she was a vampire hunter.  Why else would she be in the cemetery in the middle of the night?  Unfortunately, she saw his fangs and because he could not wipe her mind he brought her to his home.  As the story progressed Rafael had two options, kill Cassandra to keep her silent or change her into a vampire. But falling in love was not among them.What is very interesting in this authors take on the vampire paranormal genre. She presented Rafael as a damaged immortal; one whose face had been disfigured, and a left arm which had been damaged so badly that it was a useless appendage.  Naturally, as Cassandra was his prisoner and was falling in love she wanted to heal him.  But would she have the time and the skill because behind the scenes, a betrayal and revolution was brewing by another vampire who wanted to topple Rafael’s authority and take over as Lord of London.BITE AT FIRST SIGHT was an easy read, and flowed along at a good pace. I liked the way the author let some of the vampires have frailties, such as an addiction to drugs, and Rafael’s injuries. The plot was creative and original and the secondary characters added depth and interest to the story.

"3-1/2* Review - First of all this is a very long book, and the beginning I found to be very slow.  It starts out with the heroine, Emma Elliott being killed in an accident, and suddenly found in a very mist covered version of London.  Emma is approached by Father Eamon who does his best to explain to her that she is dead and she must accept that fact and come with him to the Sanctuary.  (All of this is then explained during their long walk).  In the Sanctuary, she even meets friends she’d known but had lost contact with over the years.Fr. Eamon explains to Emma that she is in-between planes; he is her guardian; and she has a quest she must complete to decide which way she could spend her future in (think good vs. bad).  What Fr.Eamon doesn’t explain to Emma, until much later in the book, is that she is a very special person who could definite the world in a big way.  While working to complete her task – after so many forays out of the Sanctuary to complete this mission Emma couldn't help but notice people  staring at her and some even frightened by her!  It takes some time though before she discovers the reason as to just how special she actually is.What was interesting was how she could cross the planes from being noticed in that misty plane to the present day where people could walk through and not see her.  As the book progresses she learns more things which only lead to more and more questions and Fr. Eamon didn’t seem too keen on giving Emma all the answers.The character of Emma was okay, but I never got that warm fuzzy feel I generally get with a lead character I really like.  It’s possible that the slower pace of this book was a bit of a turn off, and some of the relatively graphic descriptions of some of the monsters, and plague victims were really not to my taste.  Unfortunately, I found this tome very hard to get through.  The ending was very good, but let me just say I was happy to get through it.Bottom line:  Writing was very good, it just wasn’t my cuppa and the slowness and long length made it tough to finish.Marilyn Rondeau","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TB89MZ2G9PWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SEU9O3C#wasThisHelpful","R2TB89MZ2G9PWN","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the past, as 15 year old youths, Vander, the future Duke of Pindar and Emilia “Mia” Gwendolyn Carrington the daughter of Vander’s mother’s lover were thrown together at different functions.  Mia had developed a crush on Vander and had written a poem (not very good either) to him.  As it turned out Vander got a hold of it and he and his school chums read it and they had great fun spinning it in a decidedly boorish and disgusting translation.  Unfortunately, they did this in the library where Mia had been sitting hidden from sight as they totally tore into it.  Finally, having heard enough of their disgusting comments Mia came forth; told the boys off and told Vander she wouldn’t marry him if he were the last man on earth.Years later, Vander has become the Duke, and Mia has come into her own.  Mia has a dowery, but more importantly, she has a career as a writer of fabulous romance novels that is paying her very well.  However, ins spite of all that, Mia has come to the Duke of Vander’s home to ask him a great favor, she asked him to marry her.  Vander was aghast - not only was this out of the blue but he had no intention of marriage and certainly not to the daughter of the man who openly cock holed his father.  But Mia was desperate, she needed this marriage but not for her benefit.  She needed Vander to marry her in name only, for a year at most so she could obtain guardianship of her nephew, Charles Wallace.  And if took blackmailing Vander to accomplish it, so be it!Stubbornly, Vander never read the provisions which explained what Mia expected with their marriage but with his back against the wall - Vander counters with his own provisions stating he would spend only 4 nights a year with her and only if she begs for them! However shortly after the marriage, things changed and Vander decided he must work on seducing his own wife!What follows is another profoundly and brilliantly executed historical romance from the always exceptional pen of Ms. Eloisa James, who has personally given me so much pleasure from reading her marvelous Desperate Duchesses series.  Her brilliant dialogs give this story great humor and I loved Ms. James use of chapter intro’s using Mia’s notes of an author plotting her for her latest novel’s storyline.  Very cleaver and quite amusing!Bottom Line:  I’ve never been disappointed with Ms. James effervescent wit, fabulous plotting and wonderful storytelling.  A winner every time!Marilyn Rondeau","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZTYU3RZD3BOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062223917#wasThisHelpful","R2ZTYU3RZD3BOP","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ousted from his family home in France, Lord Philippe Lavay took to the high seas armed with charm as lethal as his sword and a bold determination to restore his family’s fortune and honor, no matter the cost.  Victory was within his reach until a brutal attack snatched it from his grasp and lands him in Pennyroyal Green to recuperate.For Elise Fountain, an afternoon of bliss brought a cascade of consequences where she was shunned by her family and ousted from a job she had loved.  Her fall from grace and down the social ladder led to a position no woman has been able to keep for very long;  housekeeper to a frighteningly formidable prince.  Fortunately, for Elise she sees past his battered body and into Philippe’s barricaded heart… and her simmering sensuality ignites his blood.  Now Philippe, who thought he could never love, and Elise who thought she would never trust again were in a quandary over a passion they could not deny.*** Once again Julie Anne Long has brought to life another romantic and beautifully scripted love story in her Pennyroyal Green Series that left me breathless.  Here was an old plot theme but under the masterful and creative pen of Ms. Long it was made exquisitely beautiful and fresh.  Long’s characterization of Elise who understood what even Philippe hadn’t figured out what he needed to be comfortable in his own home was perfection.  Elise and her charming young son were beautifully portrayed; but how Elise took the bull by the horns in turning around the slovenly and disrespectful household staff that had established themselves in Philippe’s manor house was brilliant!Simply everything about this story was rendered beautifully by the brilliance of Ms. Long’s wonderful writing and Philippe’s declaration of love to Elise simply brought great tears to my eyes.“I thought I needed everything I once had… I thought I owed it to my family to preserve it as it was. But the only thing that gave those places meaning was love. …. All the memories  I wish to keep were comprised of love.  And home is anywhere you are…”I don’t know about you but this was one of my more memorable reads.  I love when an author can move me so emotionally by words alone.  To me that is always worthy of my rating in the five star range!Bottom line:  Ms. Long’s Pennyroyal Green Series has been nothing short of awesome and IT STARTED WITH A SCANDAL is just one more reason that it has become such a favorite of mine!  Highly recommended.Marilyn Rondeau","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R127HFPLEDFOJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEYEZQ6#wasThisHelpful","R127HFPLEDFOJ1","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Julia, the Duchess of Colton has been patient enough and now it is time for action.  Eight years ago she was married to the Duke of Colton’s heir - not only was he two sheets to the wind, barely looked at her but left immediately after the service for parts unknown.  Gone from sight but tales of his escapades and the nickname of the Depraved Duke forced Julia to make a monumental decision.Julia was now in desperate straights and had to do something before she is out on the streets. Beginning with hiring London’s leading courtesan to learn her most intimate secrets; pretend to be a courtesan herself and travel to Venice to find her husband; and lastly seduce said husband, conceive an heir and secure her future.*** This is my very first example by newer author Joanna Shupe.  Personally I couldn’t be happier that this is the first book in what I surmise is going to be a fabulous new series entitled Wicked Deceptions.  Believe me it was not only a pleasure to discover this new author and her first book being so cleverly  creative and interesting that I cannot wait to continue on with her series.I loved the way Ms. Shupe fleshed out her characters with understandable motivation for the abhorrent way the Duke of Colton treated his wife.  Yes, it was terrible what he did, and how he just disappeared from Julia’s life never bothering to discover how she was getting on – especially knowing what a bitter and miserable mother and mean father he had left Julia with.  Colton had no excuse for being so arrogant and unforgiving of the innocent bride he left behind.  For that reason, I was cheering Julia aka Ms. Juliet Leighton her plans to seduce and get herself pregnant by her husband.Not to give to much more away, THE COURTESAN DUCHESS was a splendid read, with plenty of surprises, wonderfully touching sensuality,  and wonderful secondary characters some of which were so wonderful I can’t wait to read their stories; and some so miserable that they deserved everything they got in the end.Bottom line:  THE COURTESAN DUCHESS was a fully robust and engaging read I can highly recommend and hope to continue this series and following this author.Marilyn Rondeau","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RFKV80KUTKHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OEW5S0W#wasThisHelpful","R2RFKV80KUTKHY","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have come to love the gentle and beautiful stories that have evolved from the pen of Ms. Linda Hays-Gibbs and FROST FLOWER, the first book of her Frost Flower series promises to be as beautifully rendered as all of her other beautiful novels.This is the story of Lady Lina, the daughter of a Duke who thought his baby girl was perfection, however everything she did, how she looked, walked and talked must be perfect as well or she would be severely and horribly punished by her father. Because of how she had been trained from birth to act, she was isolated; shunned by her peers; and labeled an “Ice Princess”.Unfortunately, Lady Lina doesn't trust men, having been mistreated her entire life by the people who should have loved her – her parents. She decided it was because of all her flaws as she couldn’t speak without stuttering (so she didn’t speak in public); and didn’t smile because she thought her one crooked tooth was horrible.Lord Baltimore took one look at Lady Lina’s ethereal beauty and fell in love, but soon after because of the rumors of Lady Lina’s arrogance, he was led to believe they were true.  After all could the beautiful Lady Lina see in him, after stumbling in their waltz and knowing that at any time he could lose his leg.What follows is a superb story of two very broken individuals who began a slow road to friendship and understanding, almost to the point of a long awaited marriage proposal. But as always the road to happiness almost never runs smooth and a traitorous act of kidnapping and a loss of memory  could very possibly destroy both their chances at a happily-ever-after ending.Bottom Line:  Creative, emotional, and brilliant writing are just some of the things one can look forward to with Ms. Hays-Gibbs FROST FLOWER.  And as the first book in her new series I can only hope she continues along this same vein for a long time to come.Marilyn Rondeau","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RISR62KG626MC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5KD056#wasThisHelpful","RISR62KG626MC","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading this cute, quick and captivating read - I sincerely wish I had started with the first book in the Montgomery Brothers series.  The whole concept is so cute and unique using not a woman matchmaker but an older gentleman who is the ‘Uncle’ of the Montgomery boys.  The entire concept is really delightful with strings being pulled in the background as the author builds a very credible background with Selena Ainsley and James Montgomery’s history.  In this she paints the  motivations behind our two protagonists.  Once Selena and James had been deeply in love, planning to marry until an accident threw a wrench in their plans.  Now each held the other responsible for their 10 year alienation. Naturally no one could deny that Selena and James weren’t too proud and too stubborn to find one another to work things out!  Hence - Uncle William decided to step in and take things in hand.RETURN TO YOU by Samantha Chase is simply the best kind of entertainment to curl up and enjoy a sweet romance become viable again after a long and lonely existence both Selena and James had spent apart.  With a lot of hard work Selena had grown her event planning business into a very successful enterprise, which made her best friend Jen (recruited by Uncle William) able to coerce Samantha back home to help plan a Ten Year School Reunion, which was Step One in at least bring these two protagonists back in the same city.Toss in a nuisance stalker who was harassing Selena’s best friend Jen, and the fact that James just happened to be the chief police detective and let emotions get stirred up a bit after they lay eyes on one another – then just let nature take its course.Bottom line:  A delightful romance and I’m looking to backtrack and also put future books on my auto-buy list!  Great writing and great story - highly enjoyable.Marilyn Rondeau","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AWZUM3E14IHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ORXKTMU#wasThisHelpful","R1AWZUM3E14IHY","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve read many of M.J. Rose novels to date and I have much admired her prose and Gothic type stories.  Reading the description of THE WITCH OF PAINTED SORROWS, I knew that mixing a couple of my favorite genres, historical with a bit of paranormal, ghosts and witchery, I was full of anticipation.In 1890, Sandrine Salome is witness to a violent argument between her husband and father overhearing the gist of how her husband had been embezzling from her father’s bank and signing false documents in his name.  The shame of the scandal was too much for her father and the following day she discovered her father had killed himself.  Fearing her husband, and as soon as she could, Sandrine packed her bags and fled to her grandmother’s home in Paris, France, only to find that her grandmother had left the house Sandrine had grown up in for another house she was renting in Paris.What followed were secrets and lies where her grandmother did her best to keep Sandrine away from the infamous house where their ancestress the, famous courtesan La Lune once reigned.  Sneaking into the house which her grandmother said was being remodeled Sandrine met a young architect Julien Duplessi whom her grandmother had hired to turn the house and it’s valuable antiquities into a museum.  Sandrine seemed taken with Julien.  And the longer Sandrine stayed on the premises she felt more alive, powerful, sensual and welcomed.  As it turned out the house was haunted by La Lune, her evil ancestress and powerful witch who needed Sandrine as a host to control, find love and continue her passion of painting.As stories go, this was compelling and intriguing, but I just couldn’t get myself to truly like Sandrine the more she was overtaken by La Lune.  Her lies and deceit with her grandmother whose only sin was to try and protect her really turned me off.  Sandrine and her relationship with Julien was at first innocently romantic enough but as time when on it lost it’s appeal and was no longer romantic. [Probably wasn’t meant to be.]Unfortunately, I did not truly enjoy the story.  I struggled through the story but towards the end it became very rushed and abrupt where I had no sense of where it was going.  In my mind, it went completely off track leaving a lot of issues hanging.  Sandrine got involved with the occult in the underpinnings of Paris; gets practically buried alive, but is naturally saved. Her husband finds her grandmother in a mental institution who then gave him the address of Sandrine’s lover Julien.  The husband challenges Julien to a duel; then gets shot and killed.  There is another bit that follows but it would reveal too much.  Suffice it to say that other than the gorgeous cover, this was not a favorite and I’m afraid I can only give it a very low rating.Marilyn Rondeau","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MP77QNU87BPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147677806X#wasThisHelpful","R2MP77QNU87BPC","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The crash of a Dallas-bound jet not only changed the existence  of TV reporter Avery Daniels; but altered her entire life giving her a chance to make a comeback in her career.  At first it wasn’t something Avery had planned but as the days of recuperation and surgery continued where she could not speak to correct her mistaken identity, she learned of a plan to assassinate her supposed husband, a famous senatorial candidate Tate Rutledge.  Following her surgeries and recuperation  in the hospital, Carole as she was now being called, was torn between telling Tate the truth or trying to identify the killer.  One thing for sure - she knew the killer had to be a part of his immediate family.One might wonder, why Avery didn’t come clean as soon as she could speak but as the story evolved there were many reasons, why she couldn’t.  One, she was beginning to care for Tate, in spite of his private disgust of ‘Carole’; two, she was worried about Carole’s fragile child Amanda; and three she didn’t know who was plotting against Tate.  If she confessed, the killer would have to eliminate her.What more can be said of Sandra Brown that hasn’t already been said?  Her plotting, twists and turns, red herrings, deep characterizations and non-stop action rate this author at the top of the plateau of amazing suspense/thrillers.  To start a novel by Ms. Brown is to settle in for the long-haul to finish because she writes heart-stopping thrillers that keep a reader totally engrossed with her fast action stories.MIRROR IMAGE was one of those non-stop reads and seeing as how I listened to this on audio narrated by the always great Dick Hill, one can understand why I always took the long routes to listen longer in my car.  If I were to nit-pick just a bit it would be that his interpretation of one of the female characters tended to grate on my nerves – otherwise, I will state that Dick Hill is one of my favorite narrators and I will always gravitate to the audio books he records.Bottom line:  Sandra Brown’s  MIRROR IMAGE may be one of her older titles but her mastery of story-telling is exceptional.

"The only thing I can say about this latest volume in Christine Feehan’s Ghostwalker Series is that she dazzled me again, and I hope she never stops writing these stories!  Her story plotting of what a crazy, immoral and mad scientist puts human children through to create the ultimate soldier are simply amazing!  With VIPER GAME - not only has Feehan developed a new strain of DNA experimental children and their mother, but she has also introduced new characters from the Fontenot family, i.e. the eldest brother Wyatt and his team of  Ghostwalkers who have presented to my mind, a whole new slew of stories for the amazing talent of Ms. Feehan to develop.With VIPER GAME we are introduced to Pepper, who was programed and experimented on to be an assassin, albeit as it turned out a very reluctant assassin; so she was listed as a failure and scheduled to be disposed of.  However, before that happened she escaped along with Ginger, a small child, who as it turned out was actually her child, born from her egg and - yup - Wyatt Fontenot’s  sperm.  Just another planned experiment by the madman Dr. Whitley.Not only did Pepper have the ability to kill with venom secreted in her saliva, but the baby toddler Ginger, could kill with a bite from the venom secreted in her tiny fangs.  It was one thing to keep Pepper and Ginger safe from the soldiers searching for them, but then Pepper let Wyatt know that Ginger had two other sisters [triplet little vipers] - and naturally Wyatt and his team had to storm the prison they were kept to rescue them all!Bottom line:  Classic Ghostwalker adventure, hot and sizzling sex, and the most amazing characterizations that come from the creative mind of Christine Feehan!

"He was the son of one of the most notorious serial killers, and whether that had decided his career choice, homicide detective Thomas “Veck” DelVecchio, Jr. had grown up in the shadow of evil.  Today, he balances between good and evil as he tracks another vicious serial killer, and battles his subconscious to arrest, saving the state the bother of a long trial, or just kill the slime himself.  After tracking him down, Veck seemed to blackout then found his quarry mangled beneath his feet.  Veck was totally confused but did the right thing and called 911 – not sure whether he had ripped the man apart or not.Assigned to monitor Veck is Internal Affairs officer Sophia Reilly, who is fighting her professionalism with the fact that she finds Veck blindingly sensual.  While both fight a damaging professional attraction, another complication enters into the mix; Jim Heron, a mysterious stranger with another agenda that has Veck teetering on the edge of eternal damnation unless Heron can help him make the right decision.Once again, Ms. Ward has penned another delicious entry into her Fallen Angels series as angel Jim Heron fights for souls in a contest of good vs. evil.  So much is at stake and the action and story is fast and palatable keeping the reader/listener on the edge of their seat.  The good people, angels and humans are wonderful, and the evil forces are chilling and very sinister.  Ward is a master at this game and the plotting, writing, characterizations, and the twists and turns were as always amazingly good.Having a vast library of Audible tomes, I must also congratulate the narrator Eric Dove on a fabulous job of mastering all the voices involved and the pacing of the telling of this story.

"Surviving the Napoleonic Wars, Sir Benedict Harper for the last six years has struggled mightily to heal both body and soul.  Benedict retained his legs despite the doctors never expecting him to walk again, but he has struggled and in pain and perseverance has managed to surprise everyone.  After the yearly reunion of the Survivor’s Club the men and woman have left to return to their lives.  Benedict choose to visit his sister who was recuperating in the country, never realizing that in doing so, he would meet a beautiful woman who would give him purpose.Samantha McKay has dutifully cared years for her ailing husband, another mishap from the wars, until his lingering death.  For months she has been bound to her house by the oppressive presence of her prudish and spinster sister-in-law whose outlandish ideas of proper mourning are suffocating Samantha.Meeting Benedict who made a horrendous first impression actually turned out to be very fortuitous for Samantha, once he apologized and introduced his sister, Samantha’s neighbor to help bring some sunshine into Samantha’s closed off world.  While both Samantha and Benedict gave each other the benefit of doubt to one another, they formed an easy alliance and when Samantha was ordered to return to her miserable in-laws, she remembered a property that was left to her in the wilds of Scotland.What follows is the memorable journey Samantha and Benjamin took to her new home, and a journey of discovery for both Ben and Samantha as only Mary Balogh could have depicted with the most sensual and exquisitely sumptuous writing that offered an almost surreal quality to it.  Couple that with the amazing performance by esteemed narrator, Rosalyn Landor and you will find yourself totally suspended in time as the story unfolds in a most exquisite way.THE ESCAPE is totally worth the credit and the time to listen to this wonderful tale.Marilyn Rondeau","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36N0E40P2767T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KISW49Y#wasThisHelpful","R36N0E40P2767T","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all - I loved WICKED, MY LOVE - it had a great story, it was sensual and the dialogues were oftentimes outrageously funny!  For myself - I totally loved this and read it in one sitting!The protagonists began early in childhood with a very hateful relationship.  Thrown together because of their father’s great friendship and affection for another they were still from different stations in life. Randall a young Viscount was destined for politics.  Isabella was a manufacturers daughter. Wanting to impress her father Isabella had studied finance was enormously bright.  Having lost her mother at an early age Isabella was brought up by a devoted Mary Wollstonecroft feminist follower and oftentimes this precocious, and brainy 8 year old spouted out some very enlightening and humorous information to her childhood friend.  (As an example - how babies were conceived)Childhood aside our two protagonists grew up with each assuming their desires, his in politics and hers now running her father’s bank with Randall being a equal majority stock holder.  Naturally neither could stand one another and their dialogs were still snipes at one another, that is until a disaster of masterful proportions threatened both Isabella’s bank and Randall’s political career.What follows is a hilarious alliance of these two foes that ended up with each other finally looking beneath the surface of their love/hate relationship.  Nothing more can be said except, you won’t be sorry you picked up WICKED, MY LOVE by Ms. Ives.  It was simply Wickedly Good!Marilyn Rondeau","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YYGP66XDHWW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402283601#wasThisHelpful","R1YYGP66XDHWW8","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4-1/2*  MARRIED TO A PERFECT STRANGER was definitely not what I was expecting when I picked this up.  It didn’t follow the norm of the hero coming home from time away to discover a wife as a femme fatale.  No, it was much more subtle in the changes that both protagonists had made over the two years apart.After one month of marriage, Mary’s husband John set sail for China with the trade commisison.  With shy Mary left behind her family had sent her to care for an ailing and aged relative.  With no one else in authority, Mary had to learn to shoulder a huge responsibility for a household and grow a backbone.  In the meantime, her art skills which were an immense gift, came to the forefront where she herself was rather amazed at what she turned out.  It seemed that when she was capturing an image, Mary would not just capture the image of a person but would see beneath the surface and capture feelings and emotions.After John came home, now a man with purpose, he also noticed the changes in Mary – no longer the retired shy housewife but a woman who knew her own mind. Along with the change in his wife; a nasty coworker out to show John in the very worst light; and Mary’s gift of portraitures having a devastating effect on John’s hopes of advancement; along with a murderous plot to destroy foreign relations with China, and you have a very lovely and interesting read.Employing a delightful set of secondary characters to add depth and humor to the story, MARRIED TO A PERFECT STRANGER was a sweet, delicious morsel of writing.Marilyn Rondeau","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MHDBBDQ5N6WH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NH1UK0O#wasThisHelpful","R3MHDBBDQ5N6WH","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Got along with her foster son; was not too hard on the eyes; and let herself more or less fall in love.Mac was very supportive and when the new DSS agent came around to inspect Luis and Sid’s home she was aware that this social service agent was nothing but trouble.  Mac agreed, and when the DSS agent implied that the property would not be a suitable place for foster care, Mac was Johnny-on-the-spot with getting the property set to rights with the help of neighbors and his brothers.Ms. Burrowes goes on to indulge the reader in another court case where good people have to challenge the foster care system and endless rules that are often not in the best interest of the children.  It also serves to show where a lot of the endless jokes of bad lawyers come from and that not all lawyers, should be judged by the one’s that drop the ball.Bottom line:  Burrowes develops strong characters, complex plotting, subtle humor and believable scenarios, that are refreshing with an eloquent voice.

"In a continuation of the Renegade Royal Books,  Ms. Kelley has brought to the forefront Captain William Endicott, a royal spy and illegitimate son of the Duke of York.  Will’s father has summoned him to investigate rumors of a planned assassination plot to which he believes an old friend of Will’s may be associated with.  The suspect - Will’s childhood sweetheart and best friend from long ago, Evie Whitney.  Knowing her as he once did, Will thought it highly unlikely the shy reserved young girl he once held in high regard would be capable of anything so nefarious.  However, years have past and what he does find is that young love-struck Evie has grown up  and apparently doesn’t want anything to do with him!*** In Vanessa Kelley’s series of the illegitimate children of the Royal family, most have been located and William Endicott, always striving for any kind of recognition from his father has been sent on a mission he truly doesn’t want.  Evie Whitney had been the light at the end of a tunnel for many a year during their childhood, and unfortunately, Will knew that he had hurt her when he refused her advances and broke her heart.  Now she seems to have found a place and a new beau for herself and Will truly did not want to have to spy and lie to her in order to complete his mission, but for all that he also didn’t want her to be hurt if her beau was leading her into danger.As he and his cousin Alec (and spy partner) proceeded to investigate, Will was reminded of the past and how much he missed Evie who had grown into such a beautiful young woman.  The author used this vehicle to test both the protagonists.  Evie who was trying to maintain her devotion to Michael the man she was hoping to marry - all the while trying to stay away from Will who had a distinct impact on feelings she would rather smother than try to sort out.Author Kelley did a fine job of keeping the action moving rapidly and supplied a wonderful ensemble of secondary characters with helped to keep the attention and the mystery moving along as time began to run out in trying to stop any kind of assassination.Bottom line:  The romance was lovely; the many protagonists repartees were totally enjoyable and fit right in with the plot lines.  A lovely read and quite enjoyable.Marilyn Rondeau, for www.ck2skwipsandkritiques.com","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14EXN7XOPDZL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KM9O6OK#wasThisHelpful","R14EXN7XOPDZL9","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Emily is a sweetheart, happy and waiting for her husband, Sandy Portman to arrive after work.  He made a point to tell her he would be home after work so she happily prepared his favorite meal in anticipation.  Unfortunately, on his way home to meet Emily, Sandy was struck and killed in a tragic accident.  Before the funeral was even over she received the shocking news that her in-laws were making plans to evict her from her Upper West Side apartment in the famous Dakota building.  But nothing was more devastating than slowly uncovering the truth that she never knew Sandy at all, that her entire marriage with him was made up of lies.***  I originally picked up this audiobook at the suggestion and praise of a friend, who being a dog person like myself, thought I would find it a wonderful audiobook.  Naturally, the dog on the cover also helped me to make the selection.I didn’t know quite what I was expecting, but it was quite a journey that Emily took in discovering a lot about herself and the man she had been in love with. Suffice it to say that I found myself not liking Sandy Portman very much at first, although he did begin to grow on me after he began to understand himself after he was given a second chance at life.During her grieving, Emily found some comfort in the adoption of Einstein, a rather scruffy looking dog at the pound which Emily had been volunteering at.  Through the caring of Einstein, Emily could sob all her heartache out, and it almost seemed as if Einstein understood all that she was going through.  As it turned out, by taking Einstein out to the doggy park Emily meets a very handsome and gorgeous young man. A young man Emily tried her best to smother her budding interest in only to find that they were actually neighbors in the Dakota.Bottom line:  EMILY & EINSTEIN was a delightful story both emotional and touching, with several laugh out loud moments coming from Einstein.

"After the death of her father, Abby Mortimer thought that things would finally begin to fall into place and her long-time boyfriend, Edward would finally propose.  Instead of hearing ‘will you marry me?’ she heard, ‘I’ve found someone else’.  Devastated and heartbroken, Abby made a quick exit and flew to Majorca to stay with her sister Liv and brother-in-law Robert at their upscale hotel.Days later after the numbness had worn off, Liv asks Abby to help them out in the bar by singing with their pianist Rafa, a very suave and attractive Spaniard they had hired for the summer.  What started as simple attraction swiftly turned to passion.  Then Edward showed up hoping to apologize and win Abby back.***  THANK YOU FOR THE MUSIC turned into a real treat for me.  It had all the elements I enjoy including a smart rather independent heroine, and two suitors vying for her attention. Couple that with a very nicely fashioned ensemble of secondary characters giving the story depth of happiness and snakiness and you have a very real story ripe with all the inherent problems of true life.Abby, for all her smarts was at some point very naive when it came to men. She was no virgin, but let us say she was very gullible, but understandable as well when you factor in the big twist and reveal at the end.  Rafa was of course lovely and hunky in that tall, dark and handsome way.  And in spite of Abby’s short-sightedness - he was also smart, and a wonderful pianist.  The secondary characters really made the plot move with all the behind the scenes manipulations including the waitress Ellie wanting to be the wanna-be singing star; and the two music producers who were rather eccentric at best.The only complaint I have is that it ended too soon and felt a little cheated as to what the future would hold for Abby and Rafa.Bottom line:  Having the location set in Majorca (on my bucket list to visit) only made the story all that much better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBWOYSPP75IR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9G169G#wasThisHelpful","RBWOYSPP75IR3","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Plans had been made a long time ago where Mathilde Miller would one day marry Joshua Bowman, a long time family friend from Pennsylvania.  Years later since her family moved away from Pennsylvania, Mathilde loved her life cooking at her family’s inn on the Virginia frontier.  When her father hired Will McGlashen to run the blacksmith forge for him life changed. Mathilde’s life became a restless wave focusing solely on Will, the Scotsman with his lovely brogue sounding like a song in her heart and a balm to her now restless soul. Would the daughter of a Pennsylvania German, be able to find a life with and marry a hired man from Scotland who harbored a secret past?***  Not only was TEMPTING WILL McGLASHEN a very good story, but the mouth watering meals Mathilde was cooking had my saliva glands working overtime.  Which is not to say that this was any kind of cookbook but in my opinion it had a little bit of everything in it, making it a a very tempting morsel of literature.  First and foremost I love history, any type and the early days of the Virginia frontier and early America to me are fascinating.  Combining this with a sweet and lovely romance coupled with food served during those early days just made it ever so much more appealing.To me, Mathilde herself was a bit ahead of her time.  She knew she wouldn’t be content to go and be a farmers wife.  Mathilde loved cooking, working in her parents inn, or as it was referred to in the day, her parent’s ordinary, and meeting all the people passing through.  For her parents sake Mathilde tried to recapture some of the love and friendship she once had for Joshua, but over the years, they had both changed.  Couple that with Mathilde’s feeling towards Will McGlashen who was now prominently in the picture, she knew where her heart truly led.Very well written, author Liz Everly did a wonderful job of creating a great romance with plenty of issues that needed to be resolved concerning Will’s mysterious background, including a surprise twist that could make the relationship Mathilde and Will were building go careening off track.  But then I don’t reveal spoilers.  Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of TEMPTING WILL MCGLASHEN and I am sure you won’t be disappointed.

"Dominic Hunter is a relentless magistrate with a mission – a mission to track down the illegitimate children of England’s Royal Princes and help them get their due.  Unbeknownst to most though was the fact a portion of his search was also extremely personal for Dominic.After fourteen years not much had changed about Chloe Steele. She was still the most beautiful and the most stubborn woman, Dominic had ever met, and he was still madly in love with the young girl who had been his constant childhood companion.  Had Chloe not given in to her uncle who promised to protect her from scandal after finding herself pregnant at the age of 14, Dominic would have been the one to protect and give her a loving life.  Now that he had re-discovered her, he couldn’t let her slip away from him again.***  TALL, DARK AND ROYAL is a short novella, a little over 100 pages.  In spite of the short length, the author managed to explain a bit of the protagonists background so that even being read out of order, I knew exactly what was going on.  With a wonderful bit of a succinct explanation of Chloe and Hunter’s background, the reader was brought right up to the moment 14 years later when this story takes place.  With such an excellent overview of past history, I was completely invested in both the story and the moment.Chloe had suffered much after the back-stabbing manipulations of her uncle who laid such a guilt trip on her back and then manipulated her life by cutting her off from anyone from her past. A lesser person would have given up, but as china-like as she appeared, she had a spine of steel.  With the good luck of finding a position with a wealthy couple she assisted and took up their work of providing a safe haven for young girls like her who had gotten pregnant and had no where else to turn.  Chloe’s benefactors, left her their fortune and the pledge that she would continue their work.Even though Hunter had finally located Chloe his most important mission now was to convince her that they belonged together.  With the talented pen from author Vanessa Kelley Hunter was able to do just that and wrote some of the most emotional and sensual scenario’s that were part of the ammunition that Hunter needed to convince one very stubborn lady to give in to the inevitable.BOTTOM LINE:  Beautifully written and tastefully sensual - what more could one ask for?Marilyn Rondeau, for www.ck2skwipsandkritques.com","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ENOLGIK0IXSM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LGZ9JMI#wasThisHelpful","R3ENOLGIK0IXSM","A3B48AN8JID1JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B48AN8JID1JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CHRISTMAS AT THORNCLIFF TOWERS is short novella about Karina Petri, a gypsy witch who dearly misses her best friend and love Constantin.  Some years ago, when hunger had led her to try to steal food for the starving Gypsy camp she involved Constantin’s brother Viktor in her scheme.  As a result, the supposed werewolf master of Thorncliff caught Viktor and demanded he pay by working for him.  As a result, Constantin was finally able to have Viktor released and he would then pay off the debt owed by working the stables in his brothers place.  In order to save Constantin’s grandfather who was dying, Karina had to lure Constantin back to the camp in order to work a cure, but Constantin wanted nothing to do with her, blaming her for Viktor being caught and him having had to leave his home.***  It was a pleasure to read this short novella and I was able to complete it in a couple of hours.  Normally, I do not like novella’s because they are so short and my preference is to get totally involved in the characters lives and emotions. However, with that said, CHRISTMAS AT THORNCLIFF TOWERS, in spite of the short length, kept me captivated for the entire time.  Yes it was short but in that time, the author was able to bring forth and flesh out the main characters as well as their motivations.  Basically this story is about trying to do a good thing, and having it backfire in your face as Karina found out.  All in all it was not only very well written but the pace was quite remarkable.Bottom line:  For a quick and entertaining holiday read, CHRISTMAS AT THORNCLIFF TOWERS would be a perfect break to indulge yourself away from the hustle and bustle of the holidays.

"Bowen MacRieve of the Lykae clan was practically destroyed when his chosen mate was killed before they were ever wed.  He has been like a zombie for over 180 years blaming himself for her death and has searched high and low for the means to bring her back.  Bowen entered the Talisman’s Hie (similar to the Amazing Race)  with the intent to win the prize - a chance to go back in time to change events.During the race Bowen meets Mariketa the Awaited, she is young, mortal and more importantly has not come into her witch powers just yet.  For some reason, Mariketa awakens desires in Bowen he hasn’t felt in centuries and although the attraction is mutual, the fact remains - each has their own reasons to want to win the prize!  Let the games begin!***  If anyone has not read the series Immortals After Dark yet - you must begin immediately for you have no idea what you are missing.  Additionally, while each book stands alone, it is so much better if you begin right at the beginning with  A HUNGER LIKE NO OTHER.  This series has everything one would expect and want if a lover of Paranormal Romance as it contains demons, witches, valkyries, Lykae, and just about any other fae type creature one can think of.  And on top of that, they can really be funny as well!The adventures that Bowen and Mariketa go through both during the race and after when he realizes that he did her a grave injustice (after she stripped him of some of his powers) was super fast action and suspense.  Finally realizing that Mariketa is actually the mate Bowen has been waiting for all his long (1200 years) life, author Cole puts him through the grinder in order to beg, borrow and steal his way back into Mariketa’s good graces.  [The romance and sensuality and Bowen’s oft times blunt speaking is both funny and very sexy]Considering I listened to this via Audible, I must also applaud the fabulous narration by Robert Petkoff.  After listening to four of the books in this series, I can’t imagine how I would be able to enjoy it more if anyone but Robert were to narrate this.  His many voice changes considering the numerous amount of characters filling this book were nothing short of amazing!Bottom line: Each book in this series just gets better and better, and for those who have not had a listen yet, you have no idea what you’re missing!

"On a dare, Ross Thornbury, considered a rake by some authored THE RAKE’S HANDBOOK.  Since then he has been publicly condemned by the ladies of the ton, and privately revered by the gentlemen.  Unfortunately for Ross his notoriety is preventing him from gaining an important approval of his plans to make build a foundry on his land.  Word has gotten out and the good people surrounding his land are sure that his foundry is going to poison their water, and unleash black soot into the air they breathe and blackening the countryside.In particular, the most important consent he needs is to gain access to the river through the young widow Elinor Colton’s land.  However, the gossips have convinced her that she should stay far away from her rakish neighbor. As much as Elinor holds the memory of her beloved husband close at heart, she has discovered that her newest neighbor with his delectable grin somehow makes her feel happy again.***  In her debut author Sally Orr has penned a lovely romance THE RAKE’S HANDBOOK and FIELD GUIDE.  Using the hero’s book as a vehicle, she had our hero Ross, translate by words and actions each chapter to the young widow, who although she kept telling herself she really shouldn’t - actually enjoyed their repartee.  Ross was indeed a charmer, and widow or not, Elinor was delighted to be able to relax and enjoy his company.Adding to the lively mix is Elinor’s ward Berdi.  He is introduced as a young dandy with no direction other than trying to impress Beau Brumell with his latest originally designed cravat knot.  He is silly and funny, and a trial for Elinor who wants to see him basically grow up and have direction in his life, but in the meantime, he provides a lovely amount of chuckles.All in all this is a very light-hearted romantic tale, with no real suspense although we do run into a couple of skirmishes when a former candidate for Elinor’s affection finds her interest in Ross quite inconvenient for his plans to wed the wealthy widow.

"Attorney Rachel Wainwright is struggling to make a name for herself, and pro bono cases are a means to an end when starting off.  Because of her own past history, Rachel had agreed to take on and reopen a decades-old case, convinced that the accused murderer was, if not innocent of the brutal crimes he’d been found guilty of, deserved at the very least to have DNA testing done on the only piece of evidence that was used in his conviction.Opening up this 30 year old case, didn’t garner her any friends in the city. Number one because of the brutality involved, and two because the victim had been so beautiful and admired. However, Homicide detective Deke Morgan was not about to make it easy for her, mostly because it was his father who had cracked the case thirty years ago and made himself a hero in the town.***  As with most of Mary Burton’s Thrillers there should be a warning label that says - not for the faint of heart.  Burton doesn’t pull any punches in the telling of vicious crimes perpetrated on the victims - right down to the time they know they are going to die.  And with that said - she knows exactly how to draw a portrait of insane and psycho villains.  COVER YOUR EYES is no exception.Right from the very beginning the reader is thrust into the both the mind of the victim and the mind of the killer - and you will find yourself terrified.  The fact that Rachel was also opening up the old case, and the most recent victim seemed to have died from the same type of assault only made Rachel more determined than ever to get those DNA results.  Deke Morgan however, was just as determined to prove that his father made a justified and righteous arrest while putting the true murderer in jail.  But as bodies started piling up and Rachel was attacked with the same type of an object as the original murderer, perhaps there was something there that had been overlooked.All in all - COVER YOUR EYES is one fast action and superior thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.

"Hearing that his father had a debilitating accident , Richard Barrett, Lord Hartley was called home to take the reins of the estate only to discover that the family’s finances were in a bad way.  Bad investments, bad weather causing bad crops; there was but one remedy – find and marry an heiress. Unfortunately, he had all but proposed to another and she was about to descend upon the family estate with her parents in tow.As much as she loved her parents, Miss Sophie Goodnight certainly wasn’t keen on being bartered off just to gain a title for her father’s future grandchild.  As such Sophie did all in her power to sabotage all Lord Hartley’s attempts to woo her.  However, as much as neither was too keen on arranged marriages, there was something that was simmering between them.***  Mia Marlowe is a newer author for me and I must say I see a bright future for her if she can continue to churn out wonderful tomes such as A RAKE BY ANY OTHER NAME.  I thought her pacing, and plotting was excellent, specifically with the lovely twist that came at the end of this one, and I never saw it coming.Sophie was my kind of gal who spoke her mind.  Her parents were tradesmen - highly successful and very wealthy tradesmen, and although she had a dowery that could put most titled lords and ladies to shame, she didn’t want to be bartered like some animal.  Sophie wanted to be loved and wanted for herself.  Her attitude was that all titled folks were stuffy and she wanted no part of them and did her best to insult and chase Richard away.  In the beginning it worked but as Richard got to know more about her, he realized that not only was she lovely (when she cleaned up), but she was fun, exciting, and highly intelligent - someone he could relate to!If that were not enough, he soon found out a few other things that gave his life a whole new meaning!  And in the course of not giving any spoilers away - you will just have to read this marvelous book to discover what they are and be as surprised and delighted as I was!

"I just finished this book and can't wait to read the others in the series. My teenager (who reads college level and is in the 7th grade) saw this book and read it in one sitting. He really enjoyed it. He says it's fast-paced and full of good clues to solve a mystery. It has action and creative solutions to fixing the main character's problem. He says it was a good book for anyone to read.I think so too. It's a fun book. There is nothing super scary in this book other than a brief description of bear fighting. This book is about Spencer Plain who was sent to live at Bearhaven after his activist/bear rescuer dad was kidnapped by a rogue group. Spencer's parents have been involved with rescuing bears for years and things were getting kind of dire by the time Mr. Plain was kidnapped.The biggest surprise for Spencer was living among bears. They were able to talk so Spencer can understand them. They were actively involved with bear rescue and more.I found this book to be a well-written mystery caper. If your child is struggling with reading, this book would be a great start to getting him/her inspired to read. It has a great story line and a well-executed plot. I would definitely recommend this book to other children, even though my twins are older.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC2ZL7MN9DYG0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545813034#wasThisHelpful","RC2ZL7MN9DYG0","A1BI8PUEHA5CHW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BI8PUEHA5CHW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit that once my family saw the package on the banister in our house, they could not wait to try it out. I chose it so I can have something to wear while cleaning the house or do some writing. It looks like I will have to buy several pairs just so I can have my own. (When I do, I am tempted to put some hideous pink tape on the headset so I don't have to share!)My one son loves it. He figured how to hook the headset to my cell phone. (I have a Samsung Galaxy if anyone is interested.) He begrudgingly allowed me to test it out. He tried it on his tablet and it works like a charm. My other son finally got to try it out this morning and he loves it. In fact, they were almost late to their bus stop because they wanted to finish listening to ""The Eye of the Tiger"" by Survivor.I had originally intended for my husband to have this after I reviewed this. He finally got to test it out last night while cleaning out the basement and he is thrilled with it. He says that it allows him to listen to music without having to subject me to listening to his music. He is able to walk away from his phone and still be able to hear it in spite of being in the different parts of the basement. He says the music coming across is clear and crisp.I finally got to try it. I have a cochlear implant processor and I am always looking for headphones that will rest comfortably on my ears; to listen to music clearly without static and the ability to put the headphones away without too much trouble.This one does the trick for me. I was able to hear the music clearly and without static. I can wear it comfortably without it pinching my ears. It doesn't slide off my head. It is just a nice piece of equipment. Even better, it does not have to be tethered to my phone like my other headphone set is. I love the bluetooth capability. I love the fact that I can wear it around the house without having to miss out on the songs. My son said he was able to go down in the basement (my phone was upstairs in the kitchen) and be in the farthest part of the basement and still be able to hear the music clearly. He even went outside and was able to hear it. He didn't go that far, just out to the driveway and back.There are only 2 complaints we have and they are relatively minor. One is that, every time I get a notification from one of my apps on my phone, it beeps on the headset. That is easily fixed. The other thing is, it's rather pricey. But since it is Christmas time, this would definitely be a great gift to give to your music lover. It is that good.And no we did not test it out for gaming or for phone capability. We don't normally use headphones for gaming or for the phone, but I can see why it would be attractive to others.

"I have been looking for a gentle cleanser to wash my face with. This one does the trick. I will be honest. I have never heard of Vichy before and this product is really nice. It smells good (not too sweet) and clean. It lathers up nicely with just a little bit of gel. This 6.76 fl oz bottle is going to go a long ways since you don't need a lot of gel to lather up your face. I have sensitive skin and this one does not irritate it at all.It is a bit pricey for a facial cleanser, but when you look at how long it lasts, you're getting your money's worth.I love the fact that it is paraben free. It seems that just about everything has these chemicals in their products and it's hard to find something that doesn't have paraben in it. This helps a lot.I will definitely be on the outlook for more Vichy products. This is definitely going to be one of my favorite facial cleansers. It's better than Oil of Olay, which I have been using.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWFNOGWMP4XO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGWPFIS#wasThisHelpful","RWFNOGWMP4XO8","A1BI8PUEHA5CHW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BI8PUEHA5CHW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love these dish cloths. I have the white ones, so that is super handy to see if the dirt is coming off of the walls when I am cleaning it. I use the scouring cloth to wipe off the dirt left behind by the movers who didn't watch what they were doing while moving the previous owner's possessions out of our house. As a result, all of our white walls looked like someone went around with black crayons and left scuff marks. I tried to clean the area by the front entry way and it seems to do the trick. I am impressed. I've tried to clean it before and it didn't do the trick at all. With this cloth and a little bit of water, it worked.I also used it to clean the baseboards and it works like a charm, getting into the cracks where it's harder to clean. I also used the polishing cloth to clean my trash can, any of my stainless steel appliances and that works as well.I am in love with these cloths and the price isn't bad at all. I plan on buying more eventually, so I can stock up on them in different parts of the house.It makes cleaning up a breeze and these days, I am all about efficiency.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q47S6FPXA880/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVIFE44#wasThisHelpful","R3Q47S6FPXA880","A1BI8PUEHA5CHW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BI8PUEHA5CHW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love water. Plain water with lots of ice in my insulated tumbler. I drink about 60 oz of water a day along with my hot tea. I thought this Ocean Spray flavored water would be delicious as I love cranberries and I love raspberries. It would definitely add some flavor to my water intake for the day.Until I found out that it contains sweeteners. I cannot stand agave. It leaves an aftertaste in my mouth. Any sweeteners leave an after taste in my mouth, just like drinking diet pop with aspartame in it. I honestly wish I can drink these drinks with natural sweeteners in it so I can have something other than ice water and tea. It just doesn't agree with me.The flavors in this water is good. I cannot drink the entire 16 oz bottle. It's too much for me. I know that it sounds weird. It is weird.  I get too full from drinking it and adding ice to it just makes it watery and flat-tasting.The price for 12 pack is expensive, I think. That would be a deterrent for someone who wants to drink this flavored water and can't afford it. Hopefully, the price will come down so more people can enjoy it. I just wish I am one of them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZH7QBC9YTRFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NSC3B4O#wasThisHelpful","RZH7QBC9YTRFM","A1BI8PUEHA5CHW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BI8PUEHA5CHW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I chose this for my Galaxy S5 since my boys have misplaced my other armband. I have my phone in a slim otterbox case, so if I leave the case on, it is a super tight fit squeezing it into the armband. However, it is a perfect fit for the phone once I take off the otterbox.It is a large armband. It fits my husband's arm a lot better than mine. I am petite, so I have to wear a jacket so the armband will stay on. I am still figuring out how to adjust the armband width so I can wear it all year long, despite the temperatures.I like how you can still use your phone through the plastic covering. I didn't have any trouble getting to a texting app, but do have to slow down to type a message. However, I won't be texting while I am walking or running. It is just nice being able to have that ability if I need to.It is a stylish case and while the price might be offsetting for some people, this might be worth the splurge. It is a nice armband and definitely a lot lighter, more pliable than my other one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJRZH6DND3ZW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VDV5REO#wasThisHelpful","RJRZH6DND3ZW5","A1BI8PUEHA5CHW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BI8PUEHA5CHW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't think this book should be compared to ""Gone Girl"" at all. There isn't enough twists and turns in this novel to qualify as that. I also would not compare it to ""The Girl on the Train,"" either, though it is sort of similar in the same story-telling style. The characters all have a turn at sharing their stories. There is Jean, the wife, who stands by her man, Glen Taylor, who was accused of kidnapping a tiny 2 year old girl from the gardens of her house, while her mom was inside. The stories alternate between her, the stony-faced detective, Sparks, who is determined to find the missing toddler, Bella, and also the hard-nosed reporter, Kate, who refuses to give up on the chase for the lead story. There is even a chapter where the accused speaks for himself.All in all, it is quite a suspenseful story, but it had a very slow start. Maybe that was the author's intent, but I don't like to keep waiting for something to happen. I also don't like being able to predict the outcome of the story as well. It is a good story, don't get me wrong, but it just wasn't as suspenseful as I had hoped for. For someone who is new to the suspense thriller genre, this book is perfect for them as they haven't been exposed to many different writers' techniques and plot twists. As for the seasoned reader, this book falls just a teensy bit too flat for me.Having said that, I will be on the lookout for her next book as I am sure she will write more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23JR7TIOW9JFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101990260#wasThisHelpful","R23JR7TIOW9JFD","A1BI8PUEHA5CHW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BI8PUEHA5CHW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have just moved into our new house this past summer and this ornament is just perfect to commemorate a wonderful start to our new lives. It is made out of china but is absolutely gorgeous. It is not too heavy to put on the tree.I don't think I own any Lenox product, which is a flaw on my part. I have always loved their products especially their ornaments. They always seem to capture a lovely moment/sentiment and it lasts for years.I have the First Year in Our New Home ornament and it is just lovely in its simplicity. It is a design of a house with the saying Our First Year In Our New Home 2015. It is ivory looking with the words in red. It is cheerful and I cannot wait to put in my tree.

"My husband swears by the Otterbox and its products. I have always found them to be bulky. I don't want to carry a big box in my back pocket or in my jacket when I decide to go for a walk or a run. I love my Samsung Galaxy though and the flimsy cover I got is that, flimsy (though super cute). I decided to try this one out and love it. I love the pink. Now my 2 boys won't be seen carrying this one out in public (though it doesn't stop them from trying to play on my phone). I love the fact that I can insert a design in the back though mine didn't come with any inserts. I'll just have to be creative.My previous Otterbox cover is a bit thicker (not as thick as my husband's) and it was made out of rubber. I don't mind the rubber, but it does make turning on the phone a bit of a challenge or even to turn up the phone volume or ringer. I didn't care for that. They did not offer a lot of feminine colors at the shop I bought my phone from, so this is a plus. Not only that I can turn on the phone without having to squeeze it hard. That is a benefit for someone who might have sore hands.Over all, I really like this product. I think this series is an improvement on the Otterbox line. I like the ability to change my design at will, along with the assurance that my phone will be protected. It's not a bad price either. I will definitely look for this series again as I really do like it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DOR2E8WWFRDQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X53TFNC#wasThisHelpful","R1DOR2E8WWFRDQ","A1BI8PUEHA5CHW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BI8PUEHA5CHW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the loveliest tales I have read in a long time. I normally don't like reading what passes for ""Christian literature"" these days; not because of its contents, but because of its poorer language structure. This book is written well and obviously, well-edited.I have read a lot of books about the Holocaust, both fiction and nonfiction. This one doesn't really qualify as a Holocaust book because it didn't delve into the deeper issues that faced the countries at the time. It was the starting point for the novel, but it is a personal novel about 2 people who connected because of the war. Gretl Schmidt is a young girl who lost her mother and grandmother and her sister. Jakob is a Polish student working to liberate Poland from the Germans when he rescued her. He had found her in the woods after Gretl jumped off the train. His family took care of her till he read of an organization taking German kids to South Africa to people who wanted to adopt orphans.There are a historical facts woven into the story of Gretl and Jakob; their lives after the war went separate ways. The author, Irma Joubert is a teacher who turned to writing and it shows in this book. The stories of the two characters are interwoven in a seamless path as they grew up in different parts of the world only to be reunited years later. There are stories of how Poland became a communist country; there are stories of how the Catholic faith colors the lives of the people in Poland and how people in South Africa view the Catholic church through the personal viewpoints of varying characters. There are historical tidbits interwoven through the every day lives of the characters.It is also a love story. It is a lovely story. It is a story of faith as well. It is a book to curl up with on those dreary winter nights. It is a book to discuss over book clubs. It is just an inspiring international tale that ends well. It sounds so simplistic but it really isn't. It is a good story and I can see why it is a best seller in other parts of the world. I hope it becomes as successful here in the States as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFIC9028EVQ66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0529102374#wasThisHelpful","RFIC9028EVQ66","A1BI8PUEHA5CHW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BI8PUEHA5CHW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this 3 piece set. I love the ice cream scoop as it is sturdy and a bit heavy, but it scoops up ice cream quite nicely. I love the basin that this set comes with. I don't have to hunt for a bowl to put the scoop in (and worrying about the bowl making a mess on my counter as it's not deep enough for the ice cream scoop and I have melted ice cream leaving a stain). I love the insulated ice cream container. It really is perfect to take on a road trip and it stays cold for a long time.We love home made ice cream and frozen yogurt. We do have another one of these containers that a friend has left behind, so reviewers are right about having to have 2 of these containers to contain your home made ice cream. It is good for the store-bought ice cream as well.We got the kiwi color one and it's bright and you definitely cannot miss it while out and about. It is hard to open up the lid once it's frozen but we just set it in a hot water bath for a couple of minutes and that does soften up the ice cream as well as allowing us to open the lid.We like this and would recommend this for other people as well. It's a great addition to our ice cream making process.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11D9YOVHUPSSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QC71A40#wasThisHelpful","R11D9YOVHUPSSP","A1BI8PUEHA5CHW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BI8PUEHA5CHW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using it for about three days. I am not noticing a real difference in reducing my wrinkles (probably because I don't have that many ... just laugh lines), but my skin is softer. It feels good and the smell is not medicinal. It is rather lemony and to be honest, it is refreshing.I don't use a lot of it and I do put it directly on my skin and I just rub it in. It goes a long way and I put it on before I put my moisturizer on and two hours later, my skin is still feeling soft.The only reason why I am giving it a four star rating is that the price is a bit prohibitive. $71 is a lot of money to spend on anything and I will treasure this bottle for a long time since I cannot justify spending this kind of money for something this nice. If I was able to afford it, I would buy it and give it to my friends as it is such a lovely product.

"We like our bubbly in this house.We also like our wine. This is for champagne though, and it is a big distinction since I did try using it on a bottle of wine. It doesn't work for an ordinary bottle of wine, but it sure works on the champagne bottle. I don't have the strength to wrestle with the cork, but my husband does and he loves this. We will probably drink a little bit more champagne now that we have something that will make opening a bottle so much easier.And we love the sealer. We have several for bottles of wine, but none for champagne. It is a good tight fit and does seal up the champagne that is left over.

"This is such a fun toy I have tween boys and they love their Nerf gun collections, so when I saw that I could review this for Vine, I took the chance to do so.The only regret I have is that ... I never get to play with it. My boys have commandeered it for their collection and their dad has been using it too as well. They obviously don't care that it has girly colors on it. It is a Nerf gun. It works. And it shoots very far very fast. That is all they care about. They do wish there were more ammunition for it. So do I. They really don't care about reading the secret messages with the secret keeper case. That wouldn't be a reason why I'd buy this for my nieces. I'd buy this because it's fun, flashy and shoots very far. One of my sons did shoot me in the arm at close range and it did sting, so definitely heed the warnings not to shoot this in the face. That would be painful and might leave a nasty bruise.The price seems to be average for this sort of toy and it would be perfect if they added more darts when offering this for sale.

"This is a good blend of Gothic romance and fantasy. The setting isn't in a remote castle but it is set in a croft buried in the mountains of Wales, an ancient home that keeps secrets over the years. Artist Laura Matthews was looking for a new place to live while keeping her muse inspired by the natural beauty of the hills in Wales. There, Laura hopes to produce her best work yet and to maybe get pregnant with a baby that she and her husband, Dan, have wanted for years.Though the hills are remote, they are alive with secrets and there are people who live there with their own secrets. There is also a legend of Merlin walking these hills at one time. In fact, the other side of the story is about Megan, who is the nurse-maid of the local nobles' children, and the keeper of Merlin's heart. Megan's story intertwines with Laura's till its final conclusion, which is slightly predictable, but still fun to read.If you're looking for a romance to while away an afternoon of reading, this would be a good one to read. I have not read Paula Brackson's books before but she does have a flair for carrying you deeper into the story, silencing the cynic in you till you're just in the midst of the story and can't wait to see what happens next. Brackston has a way of keeping you involved with the characters till the last page has turned.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19R3KZHCR345L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250069688#wasThisHelpful","R19R3KZHCR345L","A1BI8PUEHA5CHW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BI8PUEHA5CHW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In our house, we adore Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. My husband tends to go for Snickers and that is our second favorite, but the boys and I adore Reese's. There is something magical about peanut butter and chocolate together.This bag is a huge bag of divine goodness. It'll last us for awhile since we don't eat chocolates every day, but yum! It is the miniature size, which I have always found to be perfection itself because sometimes, after a meal, you want something sweet but you don't want a big dessert or something rich, so this miniature size is perfect for those moments. Just enough to take away the cravings.I love to bake and I see on this page, there are recipes to try. I will definitely have to try the cheesecake recipe. That will make one of my sons happy to see since cheesecake is his favorite dessert.I have two concerns ith this yummy bag of treats is the price. It is quite a bit for bulk sized. I would pay the price for it if I am planning on giving most of it away (like at Easter time or maybe Christmas), but just to buy to have on hand for snacks or desserts, it might deter me a bit. That is a concern. The other concern is the shipping. My UPS person always leave my packages out in the bright sunlight (or rain or snow) and they generally don't even ring the doorbell to let me know that my packages have arrived. I do worry about the chocolates melting in the sunshine or get soggy in the rain. It was double-packaged though today, when I got the box. But I am not sure if the double packaging would help prevent it from melting.Other than those two concerns, this is still a delicious bag of yummies!

"I will admit to this. I have read all of Marie Bostwick's novels, even the ones that are no longer in print. I love her books. I have all of them. Her books are guaranteed to keep you in your comfy armchair and read till the last page has been turned. Her writing keeps getting better and better every time she churns out another book.This one is not one of her Cobbled Court books, which is to my surprise. I depend on the Cobbled Court series to get me through another busy season of raising two ornery kids, but this book is even better. It is about Lucy coming home to Nilson's Bay, WI, since her older sister, Alice, died unexpectedly. As part of Alice's will, Lucy has to live in the cottage that she has spent her entire adult life running away from for eight weeks before she can sell it and go back to Washington, D.C. where her boss just became the elected president of the US.Lucy reluctantly stays in Nilson's Bay for the required eight weeks to finish out her requirements before heading to the White House to resume the frantic pace of her harried life as an campaign manager. She meets up with the FOA girls, who happened to be Friends of Alice as the town dubbed them and with their help, she learns how to quilt. And along the way, she learns more about her sister, who left a gaping hole in folks' lives than Lucy has ever realized. She realized that she doesn't have the sole right to miss her sister as Alice has befriended everyone in Nilson's Bay, even her own lawyer, Peter, who also happened to be Lucy's high school crush.This is a lovely novel about a woman who was forced to take several steps back to step away from a busy and storied career to realize that life is more than just winning campaigns. It is also a great story of how a woman finds the small joys in life are actually the big things as well.I rely on Marie Bostwick to produce these gems of a novel and if I have to be really honest, this one is my favorite yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H1G1LUX7OL8V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617736554#wasThisHelpful","R1H1G1LUX7OL8V","A1BI8PUEHA5CHW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BI8PUEHA5CHW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It also has a bit of moisturizer in it as well, so my lips don't get chapped when wearing it.The price is right too at $6.39. It is small enough to put in your clutch or evening purse if going out and even in your jeans pockets. The color is rich and comes on smoothly as well.

"This author is funny. I picked up the book and was taken right in with his wry commentary about auditioning for American Idol. He wasn't there to sing as he will tell you upfront that he is not a good singer. He was just there to observe all the people auditioning and try to figure out how normally-sane looking people can lose their mind at the opportunity to be famous.His very first experiment was to try Gwyneth Paltrow's cleansing diet. With a dry wit, he shares his experiment with the cleansing and how it did work ... for those three weeks that he lost weight but it all came back on as soon as he finished the cleanse. He also noticed that instead of feeling enlightened, he felt crabby throughout the experiment.Along with his insights and commentary, he will intersect scientific studies to back up his claims or his observations. Some of these are down right disturbing as how much we depend on celebrities to have the answers for the weight loss, their careers and so on. Or even jump on the anti-vaccine bandwagon or the gluten-free diet (which I have always deplored before reading this book as an impossible solution for behavioral problems but people obviously believe a gluten-free diet can control their kids or themselves).There are so many insights in this book that I have already agreed with before reading it, so it can be redundant in a way. However, I wish more of my friends and family would read this and see that they are uprooting their lives based on some celebrity's say-so is not always the best way to go.  But that's just me.This is a great book to read and perhaps as a conversation fodder as well. There are quite a few scientific claims to back up what he is saying ... though if one has common sense, they wouldn't need to read this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSHO2WEEZZY1T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807057487#wasThisHelpful","RSHO2WEEZZY1T","A1BI8PUEHA5CHW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BI8PUEHA5CHW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely loved this book. I thought it was going to be a sweet but boring novel about love and loss, but not this one. This one took me into two different stories within the same house in different centuries and I just absolutely loved it. It was definitely the perfect antidote to the last rainy days I've been experiencing. With nothing to do but to read, this book fit the bill.The two stories are told wonderfully and were not lacking in details, so I never felt like one was dominating over the other. They also both coincided with each other.In 1984, the mansion was used as a make shift hospital for wounded Yankees. Charlotte Portsman was the wife of the owner of the plantation. She was a transplant from England and during the time of the war, she became enchanted by the Yankee captain, Will. But since she was married, there was nothing she could do about her attraction to him. She has a child named Ben who is the world to her.In the present day, there is Julia Presley, who is a mother of a missing boy and there is Eli Donovan with deep secrets of his own and his own son. Eli comes to Peach Orchard Inn due to a car trouble, and finds his story starting anew while working for Julia.These two stories of two different couples are about love, loss, forgiveness and grace. It is definitely one of the best reads I have read this year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TE8QPD4UFYFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=037377964X#wasThisHelpful","R1TE8QPD4UFYFX","A1BI8PUEHA5CHW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BI8PUEHA5CHW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am always looking for a good read to keep my two tweens interested in reading. I think this one is definitely one of them. It's a great tale, fast-paced and appealing to the younger generation who enjoy reading stories about surviving in the wild without adults around. One of my twins absolutely love this kind of story, so it will be interesting to see what he thinks of it.This book focuses on Urgle, a young boy who is charged with raising a younger brother, named Cubby. Urgle is part of a tribe called Ikkuma, a society of young boys who have been abandoned shortly after birth to live among boys and boys only. When they reach a certain number of years, they celebrate a ""Leaving Day,"" which means they then strike out on their own. No one knows how it is started and no one knows anything different than what they have always grown up with.Till one day, Cubby is kidnapped by a group of goblins and Urgle chases after him. He may be ""useless"" in his society, but he wasn't going to give up the fight for his brother. Two of his friends joined the chase with him into the big unknown.Then Urgle and his brothers are on a journey that expanded beyond their comprehension especially when an older brother, Blaze, joins in the story. One thing leads to another and then another, with mystical tales thrown in the midst and wild chases and confusion reigning throughout the rest of the book. I couldn't put it down.The only reason why I am giving this a five star is because it is confusing in spots, where I didn't feel like the tale was fleshed out more. It also left me with more questions than answers, which as a reader, find it frustrating. I am hoping that there will be a second book that will explain more of the myths in this novel as well as explore the relationships between the characters.This is a fast-paced novel and definitely a good read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S109203D19K7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385744455#wasThisHelpful","R3S109203D19K7","A1BI8PUEHA5CHW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BI8PUEHA5CHW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed a third bed shaker for our apartment since we had to get up early before my husband got off work. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on what we normally buy. This is a fantastic tool.I will say that the flashing light is not that bright. I didn't buy it for the light and to our disappointment, there is no socket in the back to plug in a lamp to wake us up. That is a major flaw in our book as we rely on our flashing lamps to wake us up as well as the bed shaker.However, the bed shaker is loud. My boys said that the volume of the buzzing is loud too but when you don't have your hearing aids on, it is rather muffled. What we do is put the bed shaker beneath our mattress and when the alarm goes off, it will wake you up and believe me, I have been woken up with a big start every single time the alarm goes off. It is rather nerve-wracking to wake up to. (That is the effect we're aiming for.)I would definitely buy this again. It is worth the price and the red glow at night does not keep us awake like the green glow does. It is actually soothing to fall asleep by.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12PPUSI6YA6CO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OOWZUK#wasThisHelpful","R12PPUSI6YA6CO","A1BI8PUEHA5CHW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BI8PUEHA5CHW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just absolutely adore this pinking shears. I had packed my other set already earlier this year while waiting to sell this house. I had to buy this one since someone wanted one of my bunny creations and I wish I had found this one sooner.It is so much easier to cut through material with this shears than with my older pair. It doesn't hurt my hand when I am finished. It curves perfectly with my hand and provides a solid grip as well as cushioning my hand. It cuts like butter going through fabric, even when I double the material to make two or three cuts. It is smaller than a lot of other pinking shears.This is my favorite tool in my sewing closet right now.

"I JUST got this today and it's going right into the boys' bathroom in the new house. It matches the color of the bathroom there and perfect for tween boys who really don't care about the style of the bathroom shower curtains, as long as no one can see them, that's all they need. I, on the other hand, like to decorate and keep the bathroom looking nice.The shower curtain is not plastic, which I really like. It is machine washable, which is another plus in my book. The shower curtain hooks may be plastic but they're of a stronger sort than what you'd find at the local grocery store, so another plus.I plan to fill the lotion dispenser with foaming soap since my boys don't care about lotion. It is a masculine enough color not to deter them from using soap. I do like the mosaic tile look. The soap dispenser is handy as well and the cup is great. However, there is one flaw that I am seeing in this whole setup, which is the lack of a toothbrush holder to match the cup, soap dish and lotion dispenser. If I could trade anything, it would be to get rid of the soap dish (we don't use bar soaps in our house) and replace it with the toothbrush holder. And yes, I would pay a little bit more to have the toothbrush holder in a matching pattern with this set.As it is, the price of $18.99 is a great bargain for this set. Some will say you get what you paid for, and while it is cheaper than buying each piece individually (and maybe not have the guarantee of having all the matched pieces available in one store), it is still a good bargain. I find this a great house-warming gift for those high school graduates soon moving out of their homes into a dorm room, or even into their first apartment.I wish someone had bought me a set like this years ago when I first started out. So, this is one of my favorite products to review from Vine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UQSXHJSWCAM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOFFCY#wasThisHelpful","R2UQSXHJSWCAM6","A1BI8PUEHA5CHW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BI8PUEHA5CHW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Such a captivating story. I really enjoyed reading this memoir as it is well-written, informative and filled with great insight on how to describe living with a hole in your head. She writes without self-pity, which I absolutely adore. And she writes in such a way that her diagnosis makes sense, though honestly, I cannot imagine not knowing the difference between 10 minutes and an hour, or my left from my right side. She navigates her life with grace and humor, though physically she may not be so graceful but emotionally, she is.This is a fast read. It is one of my favorite stories. I found it to be fascinating as she describes the few years after she had her diagnosis made. All of her life, Cole thought she was just different and odd. Her relationships with her family members were strained as she always had to have a lot of attention or someone had to be with her to go places otherwise she would be lost. Once the diagnosis was made, it just all made sense to her and her family. It wasn't an easy thing to accept but she made it work.In spite of her navigational issues (among others), Cole has managed to carve out a life of her own, and has managed to carve out a career as well. This book is well-written and captivating. I enjoyed it and hope she will write more books in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AW3B5SOM1218/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627791892#wasThisHelpful","R1AW3B5SOM1218","A1BI8PUEHA5CHW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BI8PUEHA5CHW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I truly wish I enjoyed this book, like so many reviewers here.I did manage to finish the book but learned absolutely nothing from it, other than people with money are so disconnected from the rest of the people struggling with cancer. I had a close friend who died from brain cancer and my father died from a brain-related dementia and I picked this book, hoping to feel that someone else shared insights to what it is like to watch someone die from a horrible disease.Memoirs are really my favorite category to read. I love them. This one, however, is poorly edited and poorly written. I don't know if she was just trying to make light of her situation but I ended up feeling that she and I have nothing in common. Well, honestly, I don't have a summer home and a five bedroom house, nor the money to buy my daughter a house or to hire two people to help me take care of my dad like she did. Or have friends with Black American Express cards to throw at a doctor that have been under investigation for ignoring the federal government guidelines in treating cancer. Throughout this book, I never really got the feeling that the author has come through to become a real person who is grieving her husband. She says the right things but the feelings never really shined through. Half of the book was written about her current husband and their subsequent reunion. She tries to put a positive spin on everything, even taking her daughters to Europe to recover from their dad's illness and death, only to have them mope all through Europe. I sure wish I was able to take my mom to Europe after my dad died but modern medicine is not cheap and all of her savings were spent on medical bills.I truly wish I like this book. I had high hopes for it. Then again, not everyone is alike when they come to a book and read it to apply to their lives, to find a common ground with someone who lost a loved one to cancer. This book can be appealing to a lot of people, but I just couldn't relate to the author. I wish I did.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J241TLV7AFIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=082530783X#wasThisHelpful","R3J241TLV7AFIW","A1BI8PUEHA5CHW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BI8PUEHA5CHW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this to try out through Vine. I picked this out for my husband who has been struggling with spinal pain and deep back aches. I thought after reading the reviews that it might work.I was wrong. This was too hard on his back, too awkward to roll around on and too small.He is not a big man, so the length of it should not have been a problem, but it is. It is the same size as my dog's chewy toy and that is not big at all. The pictures on this site is misleading.It is too hard and too awkward to use. It doesn't stay in place when you use it. The only way we could use it is if one of us is rolling it on his back for him. That does defeat the purpose of working out the kinks in your back yourself when no one is around.Fortunately, the price isn't too expensive so it'll be a good addition to the tools my husband already has. It is disappointing especially since we were hoping that it would work.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE1O763PVBYYZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LY9P6DC#wasThisHelpful","RE1O763PVBYYZ","A1BI8PUEHA5CHW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BI8PUEHA5CHW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love lipsticks and I am always on the look out for the perfect lip stick. I will admit that I often forget to reapply it throughout the day so having something that will keep the color on my lips all day is very appealing.This one fits the bill. I do have to reapply the gloss part throughout the day but that's because I really don't like dry lips. The color does not stay fresh for 24 hours like it says BUT I did have a tint left on my lips the next morning after I woke up. It needed reapplying then but it lasted through everything. What I like is that it does not leave a stain on your glassware after drinking a cup of water/wine/juice. It stays on your lips, not on the glass. It does stay on while you're eating and it does stay on when your husband kisses you.As far as I am concerned, this is my favorite lipstick. It is a bit pricier than what I normally pay for but I'll take it any day. I just love it. And even better, it does not have that weird scent like a lot of lipsticks or gloss have. It has a faint but very pleasant scent to it. It won't drive you crazy all day trying to hide that unpleasant scents that some lipsticks have. That is a bonus for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCIG5D5YIVKPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFCTF8Q#wasThisHelpful","RCIG5D5YIVKPX","A1BI8PUEHA5CHW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BI8PUEHA5CHW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The pocket for the Kindle is very well padded & I feel my Kindle is very secure & protected in it.  I've tried 4 or 5 different kinds of bags like this for my kindle, but NONE offer the protection like this one does!

The bulkiness isn't so bad, but I prefer a case that has a lid I can shut, without having to take the cover off the back of the Otterbox & put it on the front....Going to send that back.

"This was a hit with my little sheltie terrier mix, and perfect for the size of my backyard. It's not a launcher that will give you great distances, but I liked that I could with a minimal amount of practice control fairly well how far it went, keeping it from sailing out of the yard. My dog loves stick-shaped toys much more than balls so this was perfect for her. It's not particularly obvious how to use the launcher and I smacked myself pretty hard before checking the instructions, so be careful particularly with kids to make sure they know how to do it correctly. Replacement darts not very cheap, but at least they are available if you do break it, and be sure not to leave it around for your dog to chew on as the notch for launching it is exactly the type of thing most dogs would chew off first.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLKR0ADVQX1RY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WZ972YQ#wasThisHelpful","RLKR0ADVQX1RY","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a fan of Canon printers, and still use the MG6220 which I got a couple of years ago, the printer Amazon sent me to review was actually the white version of this printer, I guess to match Apple computers. It did work fine with my iMac, running the latest version of Mavericks, and I eventually did get AirPrint to work (the ipad and the printer have to be on the same wifi network, which I forgot to check, if you use multiple networks, be aware that the printer will most likely only be able to use the slower one). But I'm not impressed enough with this printer to replace my other one. I really dislike the paper drawer, which also cannot handle more than one paper size at a time, so be prepared to swap printer paper with photo paper if you use both. The printer cartridges are very hard to load if you are not in a well lit room, and the print quality just so-so. It does include double sided printing which is also a must for me, but just not one of Canon's better offerings.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28SHR44W1JTO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013C0ZCCU#wasThisHelpful","R28SHR44W1JTO0","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scharffen Berger is one of my favorite chocolates but I've generally only used it for my baking, when I want a really quality chocolate, I've used it in my chocolate chip cookies, chocolate cheesecakes, and making homemade chocolate truffles. This is my first experience with their chocolate bars intended for eating and I was not disappointed. The gift box is beautifully packaged with two bars of each flavor, arranged from low cacao content to high. I do prefer milk chocolates for eating myself, and the coconut and macadamia bar was indeed my favorite. I did still find the darker chocolate bars still very wonderful as well though, some of the best I've ever had in fact, the amount of fruit flavor and salt in these is perfectly balanced to complement the chocolate. I particularly liked the raspberry and almond bar. The bars are considerably thinner than their baking chocolates, making them very easy to break apart and eat. The price is comparable to most fine chocolate once you figure out the price per bar for 8 bars of this quality. I would caution about ordering this during warmer months as Amazon does not typically provide any temperature protection for chocolates in my experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y9EU10Z72OTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013QQ4WHQ#wasThisHelpful","R1Y9EU10Z72OTY","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This mat is similar to Silpats, which I use a lot for baking, they are a bit cheaper and the company touts them as being BPA-free, but be warned, there is relatively little safety testing of any kinds of plastics and if any harmful chemicals leech into the food, so BPA-free doesn't mean there isn't something else that might be harmful. So do take that into consideration, you may want to still use these sparingly just out of caution. I found these to be thinner than the Silpats and after one time through the oven, have a bit of warping to them, they flattened back down again after I ran my hand back over the sheet, but I've never seen this with my Silpats due to their thickness, so not sure how well these will hold up over time. They are unlikely to have as much insulation as well being thinner, which can be good or bad depending on what you are cooking. Also be aware that not all baked goods due well on silicon baking sheets, I do still bring out the parchment for some items that I cook that seem to need more ""grip"" to the surface to cook properly. Meringues for instance I don't ever do on silicon baking sheets. Overall, a good value for the price but not quite as good as my Silpats.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IQZP8NTMOL5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OT40NYQ#wasThisHelpful","R2IQZP8NTMOL5B","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this new CEB translation particularly for YA readers, it puts the Bible into language more in line with how people today speak without any real significant change to meaning as you get with some more radical translations like The Message. More staunchly conservative types and Bible literalists may disagree, but I'm definitely a fan. This bible is geared towards YA teenage readers and so includes articles and discussions particularly geared for that age group. It does a good job of encouraging without being condescending. I think most adults would enjoy much of what is in here as well, particularly the callout boxes that help explain some of the more difficult sections of the text as well as the maps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNMBQO1FST7O3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609261798#wasThisHelpful","RNMBQO1FST7O3","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We usually start kids off at a young age with something like the Children's Picture Bible or the Action Bible (manga) but when they want to move to a ""big kid's"" real Bible with written text, this is a perfect choice, the translation is done in easy to read modern English, without any significant change to the meaning such as you get with translations like The Message. This makes it much more approachable for kids, but this also includes Study Bible elements geared particularly to kids of grammar school age. There are 3 cartoon kids that lead the reader through the text and ask them questions to think about, etc. The text size is a tad small for the target audience, but then you don't want a really big heavy Bible, or thin easy to tear pages for kids either, so it's probably a good compromise. Overall, one of the best study Bibles I've seen for school age readers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJBPAABSGC00Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609261917#wasThisHelpful","RJBPAABSGC00Y","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was more a memoir of the author's struggles through losing her mom to cancer at 12, living with an alcoholic father, as well as the marital struggles that raising a disabled child brings. The relationship between the brothers is almost *too"" perfect, there's not a whole lot of nuances with that part of the story, it almost becomes overkill how much we hear about how much Connor loves Cayden and shows it in everything he does, but having a similar relationship between two brothers, one normal, the other autistic, in my own family, it's certainly something that I relate to and see very much the same kind of protectiveness and love between them. I think in children raised properly, it's the kind of natural response that an older, normal brother would have, so in the end I found Jenny's story the more interesting and compelling one here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27DJ2VSRQM3G4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1618931288#wasThisHelpful","R27DJ2VSRQM3G4","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice book for YAs that are dealing with bullying, I like that it's written by someone that experienced bullying themselves, as it's very affirming to hear from someone that came through it and came out the other side. While I never experienced the kind of bullying today's kids did, I did deal with some of it myself in school and not having anyone want to be friends, etc. so a lot of the messages ring very true. While the author does try to offer some practical advice to try and end the bullying I think most kids know it's not always that easy, that adults often powerless or unwilling to stop it, so it's definitely not going to be a solution for every kid being bullied, but it's a good start and hopefully some of the messages about being special and important will get through.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O20NAX9N87BZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545860539#wasThisHelpful","R2O20NAX9N87BZ","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an okay fryer, but be aware, it's very small, so really only suitable for one, maybe two people at most, and probably just best as a secondary fryer to something like Fry Daddy that can handle larger amounts and more types of foods, in the same amount of counter space, due to it not having a heating element on the bottom or needing a basket. Battered items do not work well in this style of fryer I found, they sink to the bottom so get stuck to the basket, and lose that area of the batter. This style of fryer works fine for things like french fries or chicken wings, cheese sticks, etc. that don't use a real wet batter. I also like that it has a temperature setting, something the Fry Daddy does not include. So this was ideal to do my french fries in, which I use different temp settings for par-frying and finishing, while doing my batter-fried strips in the Fry Daddy. I just wish I could find one perfect fryer that could do everything.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EGW5JME5IRUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015YUDZ8O#wasThisHelpful","R3EGW5JME5IRUC","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very cheaply made apron, I have some similar ""flirty"" aprons which are much better designed, although kind of a pain to wash with all the ruffles and fabric that generally needs ironing. This very simple design would be a quick ironing job, if even needed, but the fabric is so thin, it's not going to protect well against much more than flour dust. I do like this kind of tieable neck strap but the upper bodice part of the apron is poorly design and doesn't taper so is very unattractive. The biggest issue is that it does NOT have pockets as described, which is an essential feature for my kitchen. So if you want a very cheap apron that is a bit more ""cute"" than the average one, this might be okay. But for a functional apron for every day use, look elsewhere.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S8UULOP47RNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0054Y6S30#wasThisHelpful","R2S8UULOP47RNU","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used similar bands in the past when I have a flareup of the elbow tendinitis that has bothered me for years, and this type of ""support"" definitiely helps relieve the pain although you do want to be careful not to use them for too long as they can cause the tendon to shorten over time and you become reliant on having the support there. For short term use they can be very helpful. However I really didn't like this design at all. It may be fine if you are a thin, normal sized person, but I have a bit of extra weight and in order to get the band tight enough to do anything, I had to tighten it to a point that the velcro strap was digging into my arm. Velcro is very scratchy and bothers me to begin with so I wish I knew before I bought this that it was used for the strap, but for a brace that requires being very tight to work, it's even more of an issue. I definitely prefer the designs that include an air pillow to give you the pressure against the tendon with less requirement for having the band super-tight as well. Having used about 3 or 4 styles of this kind of support, this was by far my least favorite I've tried.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10PKYVKLH395Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FML7SW#wasThisHelpful","R10PKYVKLH395Q","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A year ago, Amazon offered me a copy of Office 365 for Mac, this year, I got the standalone Home and Student version to try. While usually I prefer paying once for software, it's hard to look at the pricing and not see the value in considering the cloud version. You not only get 1 TB of cloud storage, you get the full suite of products, at a price that gives you two years of access for less than the standalone software costs. Of course, Mac users still don't get ALL the software that PC users get, and until they do, I will not give ANY Office version more than 4 stars at best. While I wouldn't tend to use Access as much these days, Publisher is software that absolutely should be included in the Mac version when PC users get it. However, this review is for Home and Student which only includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. Note that Outlook is not included, something to be aware of if you are looking at purchasing this version, over the 365 Personal license which DOES include it. Of these, OneNote is the application I haven't used a whole lot, simply because I have so much in Evernote and haven't really had a need to look at migrating to OneNote. You can get OneNote as a standalone on the Mac Store for free, so it's worth looking at if you don't already use Evernote, but if you do want to use it, you almost certainly would want the 365 version so you have cloud storage for easy sharing of your notes across your desktop and mobile devices. Likewise a lot of the newer features in the other applications require cloud storage, such as sharing features. While you don't have to have a 365 license to use these, the only cloud services available are MS's OneDrive cloud service and Sharepoint. It's very annoying that they don't offer such popular cloud services like Dropbox but clearly they want to push users to get the 365 licenses instead which include the full 1TB of storage. If you don't need to keep a lot of docs on OneDrive though, the free account may work fine for you.Now if you are a current Office for Mac user, the question is whether there are suitable updates here to look at upgrading. If you are more than 1 or two versions behind, it's pretty much a given that you would want to update, the new ribbon (toolbar) is much more elegant and user friendly, proper keyboard shortcuts are available, the various Mac touch gestures are supported, etc. And there's tons of improvements in the  applications themselves. I particularly loved the new theme designer feature in Powerpoint which gives you not only many more slide designs, but makes it really easy to switch them to different color schemes. Slide transitions are now better supported across PC and Mac versions and there is an improved presenter view, and dedicated animations panel. The formula designer in Excel has been updated, and there is better support for the full range of functions that the PC version had. More chart designs are now available, and comments in Word can now be fully threaded conversations. Print to PDF is better in all the apps, as well. Overall, the features definitely are worth a look, but the lack of Outlook and high cost for just the 3 main programs (OneNote being free to download anyway) does make it a bit hard to recommend this version over a 365 license. If you don't need Outlook, don't have a need to upgrade your apps very often, don't plan to use cloud sharing much, and mainly just want copies of the applications for cross-platform support with PC users that send you files, this might be worth considering versus the 365 version, but you'll need to use it for more than 2 years before you see any savings. So I rather the upgrade as a solid 4 stars, but I'd give this specific version only 3 stars for the value that you are getting for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PAPN0683S40B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0148BYIPY#wasThisHelpful","R2PAPN0683S40B","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These premium chocolate arrive in a tastefully wrapped box, it oddly doesn't have a normal lid once you unwrap them, the outer sleeve from the packaging appearing to be the only thing you can use if you don't want to eat them all at one sitting, but I would be concerned about it keeping them fresh for very long. Not that they are likely to hang around for very long once opened! No temperature control packaging (ice packs) used in shipping them so do NOT order these any time of year that they are likely to encounter heat. They arrived safe and sound for me, and I dove right in. They include a small guide to some of the chocolates but not all, and they are definitely made from premium ingredients. The price is very similar to Godiva chocolates, and personally I do prefer Godiva over these. The chocolate itself is perhaps *slightly* better, but I prefer the variety of flavors you get with a typical Godiva ballotin box, which are more typical of American chocolates. This is definitely a matter of taste though, there are certainly plenty of people that would find these chocolate superior as they are definitely very good quality with some excellent hazelnut and smooth caramels in particular, a very European style of chocolates. I do also like the smaller pieces compared to Godiva chocolates, it lets you enjoy one or two pieces of chocolate and feel that you didn't consume very much in the way of calories! Not to mention being able to share them more easily.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IARMHTNE5MDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UAGKNQ#wasThisHelpful","R2IARMHTNE5MDX","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great way to save money on multiple lip shades, particularly if you generally use a brush to apply them anyway. As with most free brushes, the one included will work, but it's not great. It takes a fair number of applications to get good color on my lips and the staying power is pretty minimal, but it's a nice palette that lets me try out different colors before buying the ones I really like and will use a lot in a version that will last longer when I need it. There's no price on this currently but based on typical prices for Maybelline cosmetics I wouldn't expect it to be very expensive. Based on the quality and quantity included, I wouldn't expect to pay more than 10-15 for it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQO0K0OE9PVAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015SCOWEY#wasThisHelpful","RQO0K0OE9PVAY","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a decent steam iron, with digital temperature readings, it generates copious amounts of steam and had nice weight to it, so performs well for the most part. Most of my dislikes didn't really deal with how well it ironeed, but just little nits about features. Personally I prefer dials and being able to ""tweak "" my temperature setting versus the digital setting but it works well enough. I also like my iron with a retractable cord, versus this very heavy and thick cord that doesn't wrap particularly well for storage. My biggest complaint would be the water compartment which is very hard to read, being dark blue and needing to be read horizontal versus in a more typical vertical position. Most irons I have bought come with a little cup for easy filling of the compartment as well, which was not provided here. So overall, not my favorite iron, but a fairly good one for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CJTKJCCB6TZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5ILE2W#wasThisHelpful","R1CJTKJCCB6TZO","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We played this a couple times with a local board gaming group and we enjoyed the game mechanics for the most part. It is sort of a rock-paper-scissors card game but with strategic elements built into it, and the tag team game was a particular hit. We like that any one can win if they manage to score a pin at the right time, we were playing a tag team game and our team was totally getting thrashed but managed to score a pin and win just as we were almost unable to even play enough cards to get through a turn. That was kind of cool, but not everyone will like that element of luck. But paying attention to which cards the other players has the most of, what they've lost to you so far, etc. can allow you to better strategize your moves to have more chance to win. You definitely don't need to have any interest or knowledge of wrestling to enjoy this game although I expect fans will enjoy knowing the wrestlers and their associated moves. The numerous variations in how to play the game also gives this an excellent level of replayability. Overall, not sure it will be a favorite game but definitely one that we enjoyed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18QW6KM3N5OBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z0P2W3S#wasThisHelpful","R18QW6KM3N5OBU","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been building up my home tool set and was lacking some good crescent wrenches, so was pleased to get a set of these to review. Overall I find them good, but a tad heavy and bulky, particularly the two larger wrenches. They are definitely very solidly made, and in spite of the concerns about being made in China, the quality seems decent enough. But the heavier weight usually means compensating for somewhat lesser quality of steel with more bulk, and that seems to be the case here. So I would say these are adequate, but if you, like me, prefer tools that aren't super heavy, these might not be your best choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B07AHN9CDTJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GR4KJ4#wasThisHelpful","R1B07AHN9CDTJ5","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a long term PS user, primarily for photography and digital scrapbooking, but I also like to make digital art from my photographs as well, and this program looked to be well suited in particular for that purpose. I'm also not particularly fond of Adobe's move to cloud-based hosting of their software, preferring a program like this one that you just pay once for and own as long as you want. The main challenge in using software like Painter is that it's not particularly intuitive, particularly if you aren't already used to PS, but even PS users will be frustrated at the differences and trying to learn something new. With PS, you have massive amounts of online tutorials and help, as well as books, local and online classes, etc. Here, you're kind of own your own to learn it, and you don't even get a printed manual, having to deal with searching and scrolling through PDF manuals. The few online lessons I watched already have differences in where to find things in some cases, such as the brushes being organized a bit differently. It's definitely not a good choice for anyone that is not already well versed in using this kind of software or that doesn't like learning things mostly on their own, without books or other educational materials to help.Having said all that, if digital art is your medium, it's hard to ignore how powerful and well designed this software is for that task. Even if you just like to dabble in things like making photographs into art, you'll not be disappointed... if you can get past the learning curve. I particularly enjoyed using some of the auto painting features, which really show how well thought out Painter is. The attached photo took me only about 5 mins to do using their auto paint feature and appropriate tweaking. With PS you often have to pay for or design your own custom brushes, where you will find so much here already included. There's a bunch of addon brushes you can purchase for $30 a pop as well for things like hair, smoke, fire, etc.I still don't see this software being a replacement for me, there are just too many things I do in PS that are not well handled here, particularly all my photographic and scrapbook work. If you are a digital artist, and looking for a powerful and somewhat cheaper alternative to PS though, this may very well be worth a look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDEWWUAT7CMEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123C648Y#wasThisHelpful","RDEWWUAT7CMEG","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a long time agility trainer and instructor and I've gone through my share of flimsy at-home practice equipment but this set really takes the cake for being next to useless. The tunnel is so short as to be almost useless for training, it's barely as long as my little sheltie mix, and can't be curved into other shapes. Just search on Amazon for ""play tunnel"" to find a whole bunch of kid's play tunnels that are much longer and more flexible in terms of how they can be used, and cheaper as well. As for the other obstacles, they are made with very thin plastic tubing and are the most flimsy design I've ever seen. No way I would train a dog on these, besides the fact that they don't visually look like real agility equipment (something that is important if you do want to teach your dog the sport) they come apart far too easily making it a real possibility that the dog will not learn to avoid hitting the jump, or even hurting themselves by getting caught in it. Do yourself a favor and just make some obstacles out of PVC, it will cost no more than this kit and you'll have a far more appropriate set of obstacles to work on. Just go to the Instructables website and search on 'agility' to find all kind of do-it-yourself instructions for agility obstacles.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KTWTEUBLLANP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRBF4LU#wasThisHelpful","R2KTWTEUBLLANP","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've only used this dehydrator a few times but so far, fairly pleased with it. I have used one of the cheaper dehydrators with the stacking trays and always hated the noise, the difficulty in cleaning the trays (fruit leather is one of my favorite things to make and it always seems to spill on the trays, which do not fit in the sink or dishwasher), and lack of time controls so that I can let it run during the night and not over-dry my items. This dehydrator deals with all those issues, it came completely assembled, with all the metal trays/shelves already in place, along with a replacement shelf and filter. I didn't see any of the bowing issues other reviews have mentioned but will see if that occurs with use. I've tried doing some banana chips as well as some peaches I had canned in light syrup and loved the results, the banana chips turned out pretty much the way the ones in my other dehydrator did, and the peaches were nice and chewy, a great sweet treat alternative to something like candy. I wish I could do fruit leather in this model without having to buy a bunch of additional trays since it only comes with one and the usable space for each tray is much smaller than typical stacking models so you really need a bunch of them to do leather. So not sure this is the best choice if that is a common dry task you are looking to use it for. Also, the manual that comes with this model is absolutely TERRIBLE, it clearly was just translated (badly) from another language to English is is pretty incomprehensible. The controls are not particularly intuitive so trying to figure out how to use them is a bit frustrating and takes some trial and error. The times given in the recipe book for drying fruit seemed to be really off, I needed almost double the time for my banana chips... but given the poor instructions it's possible I was using a different drying setting. For such an expensive appliance, they could at least provide users with a decent manual on how to use it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39B2LCDUGRIM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YZG07SU#wasThisHelpful","R39B2LCDUGRIM3","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like most Invicta watches, this one is quite large and heavy, this is not for guys that want a fairly unobtrusive watch on their wrist, there are few watches you will find as big and obvious as this one. The design is very striking with an attractive color scheme, although marketed as an ""aviator"" watch it has more of an aquatic look to it. However, that's where most of the positives stopped for us. First the nylon band is VERY stiff and not very comfortable, compared to pretty much any other Invicta watch I've reviewed or bought. It's also fairly difficult to get into the metal strap holders. If you are always in a rush to get your watch on and out the door, this one is going to annoy you. I expect it might loosen up over time with use but who wants a watch that's uncomfortable when they first get it?? The ""Speed"" thing around the bezel seems to serve little purpose other than to make the watch unnecessarily bigger, I believe you are supposed to watch the second hand go around it while something is happening (like a car driving by) and use that to determine the speed it is going, but it's not particularly well explained or useful. I'd guess there are apps for smartphones that do the same thing much easier and better. Worst of all, the chronometer doesn't include the 1/10th second dial. I guess if you are an aviator you might not need this, but if I'm getting a watch with a chronometer, I want it to include all 3 dials. I also have always hated how Invicta gives you a guide to the watch that isn't specific to YOUR watch, you have to page through the manual trying to figure out which are the features your watch has and which are not. It's really annoying. I couldn't even find specific instructions for this type of chronograph, only for the 3-dial ones. Overall, not a watch I would particularly recommend over many of the other nice watches that Invicta offers, particularly at this price point.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CS3RNIZKB1D8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012WK31QK#wasThisHelpful","R2CS3RNIZKB1D8","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm very impressed with the quality of this cookbook, everything is well laid out, beautifully illustrated with photos, and contains a wide variety of recipes from very simple to ones I probably will never try (like octopus stews). I was concerned about trying a cookbook for a foreign cuisine since they often need a variety of exotic and hard-to-find ingredients but I was impressed with the selection of recipes here that don't use anything that I wouldn't already have at home, with maybe 1 or 2 extra things from the store. Sure, there are still recipes with some ingredients I might have trouble finding (like the aforementioned octopus, or some cakes that use a specific brand of international brand cookie) but overall the recipes are reasonably easy to make and use fairly standard pantry items. Just make sure you have white wine around, that seems to be a popular ingredient for a lot of these dishes! I also liked the pages with additional, more detailed information on preparation steps, again lavishly illustrated with photos for the steps, and having all the ingredients both with US measures as well as metric. If you like to weigh your dry ingredients like me, you always love to see a cookbook with the weights for everything included. The paper used for the book is nice and heavy weight with a glossy finish that should help make cleaning up any splatter in the kitchen fairly easy. The recipes vary in serving sizes with some feeding a large group, other suited for just two. I wish more were in the range of 4 or less, since more than that and I have to consider halving the portions, but anyone looking to cook for an entire family will be just fine. Since I was not familiar with Portuguese cooking prior to this, I can't comment on the authenticity of the recipes but the couple that I have tried so far turned out successful and fairly tasty as well. Overall, a really wonderful, quality cookbook that I know I will enjoy for years while getting to appreciate the flavors of Portugal as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VGQOLFWT8FAK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1624141943#wasThisHelpful","R1VGQOLFWT8FAK","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been trying to switch to drinking more water and so was happy to get this pitcher to review. I've used Brita products in the past, but this is the first pitcher I've had in awhile. It's pretty large, so make sure you have fridge space for it. The size is a bit problematic for me in terms of getting it under my faucet, I have to tilt it so it's not getting filled as well as a smaller one would. If you don't have a very deep sink keep that in mind while shopping for a filter pitcher size. The filter design does seem to be improved, without the flecks in the water that I've had before. The lid has a design such that it won't go on unless you have the filter properly seated fully. I haven't had any issues with the lid falling off as many reviewers in the past have mentioned, so am thinking Brita may have addressed this. The lid is still very thin plastic and fairly flimsy, so will have to see how it holds up over time. The electronic display is not every intuitive in how it works, if it's somehow keeping track of usage, I wouldn't be putting a lot of faith in it in terms of when to change filters. Easier for me is to just put a reminder on the fridge when I change it to know when to swap it out. Brita does make an app as well but seems just as easy to add a reminder on your smart phone when you change filters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF0SMPPKYZHSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAG8M5I#wasThisHelpful","RF0SMPPKYZHSP","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, Masterbuilt really needs to improve their quality control. I just got this smoker and had issues assembling it due to some parts not being properly aligned. One of the wheels in particular just simply would not align up properly to allow all the screws to be put in, I tried to bend it to the proper shape but the metal is far too think for me to manage without having a vise. Also, the lower right corner was damaged, even though it's well packed with styrofoam and an additional plastic protector on the corners... so was clearly damaged that way BEFORE packing.

"I've used a couple similar water fountains but always find them annoying hard to fill and to clean. This one is designed much more like the refillable water bowl I use currently so I thought I'd give it a try. Out of the box it's a breeze to set up, just fill the reservoir and plug it in. The water comes out in a small fountain in the center and circulates throughout. It's reasonably quiet and my cat definitely was intrigued and attracted to it immediately. Other circulating water dishes don't have an actual fountain in them, which is a definite plus of this design that many cats will love. Whether this will really result in an increase in drinking frequency I don't know, but he does seem to like it. I also have dogs and they were a bit taken aback by the fountain at first but got used to it quickly enough. The bowl is large enough to allow them to drink either from the side, or one of my dogs liked to drink right from the fountain. I do wish that the fountain could achieve a bit more height, it's very low, adjustable height would be even better, but you only have an on and off switch. The reservoir is also much smaller than I like having multiple pets. The advantage of this design is to keep the water fresh without having to refill it all the time but if it doesn't hold that much water to begin with, I'm not that much better off. I'll probably for that reason still keep my much larger refillable water bowl that has enough water for a couple days for the dogs, but the challenge of course is that if they like this bowl too I'll still end up having to refill it pretty frequently. I was also very annoyed to find that the box says it comes with 2 charcoal filters, but I could not find these in the packaging at all. It has the plain white filter which was already inserted for me, but no charcoal filters, so I dropped an extra star from this review for that omission. I'll have to see how hard it is to get those sent out and will update this review accordingly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SJ4IY2TU793X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014HAWD1W#wasThisHelpful","R1SJ4IY2TU793X","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've played and reviewed numerous traditional racing car toys, and all of them ultimately tend to disappoint. They take up a lot of space, are tedious to set up and often almost impossible to take apart. The game play is fun for about an hour at best and then they get tossed aside for more interesting racing games on the game console.This Anki racing game is a HUGE improvement, by combining a smartphone racing game with a live action racing toy. There's a lot of stuff to like here, particularly how easy the track is to take out and set up and then pack away again when you are done. It uses a magnet system to connect the tracks that works great, they just click right together, and it's very easy to change the configuration around. My iPhone had no trouble after downloading the app connecting to the cars and going through the racing tutorial. It's really cool how the cars just follow the track, and the ability to ""battle"" the other cars with weapons is a cool twist on normal race car games.A few caveats, It's definitely a pretty expensive game, particularly when you look at the prices of cars and additional track pieces. It's always fun to build additional track designs and expand a game but you can easily spend a few hundred dollars here to do that, so be sure to consider that as part of an initial purchase. There's still a lot you can do with just the basic starter set, though. Also the app definitely has the feel of a first run, there's no tournament play currently for instance, which would make the basic set far more playable with a group of people. Also you have to go through a scanning phase before EVERY game even if the track hasn't been changed. It's kind of annoying and seems like it should be able to remember that and just prompt you if the track was modified. Hopefully we will see them expand the capabilities and play options in time.Overall, this is a really awesome game, with some more improvements it could be even better. But it's certainly still worth a purchase for anyone that loves car racing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A1E9O6XJW5H9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V6951I0#wasThisHelpful","R3A1E9O6XJW5H9","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product was provided for me through the Amazon Vine system for free, but I try to take into consideration how I would feel about it were I a paying customer. And my overall impression is that yes, it's got some very nice features and vacuum packs like a champ. But is it THAT much better to pay so much more than the others cost? My first impression is that no, I would probably not be willing to pay so much more for it. First, the size is just massive. There's not going to be many people that have a place to put this on their counter and even finding storage elsewhere in a kitchen would be problematic. Compared to my current FoodSaver, it is a full 10 inches wider, and 5 inches deeper. But all that size only provides a paltry 4"" more of sealing space (from 11"" to 15""). Including something like storage for the accessory port cord inside the device is nice, but is it worth how much more room had to be added to the sealer? It's almost like they built this so big so it looks more impressive than it really is. I do however really like the stainless steel look of the thing. Too bad it has to spend most of the time hidden away in the garage, where that SS exterior pretty much goes to waste. I did really like the locking mechanism for the lid, as well as the handles, which considering the size and weight of this appliance, make it much easier to carry it in and out of the kitchen for use.One of the big features this sealer touts is being able to continue sealing for 100 times, but as other reviewers have mentioned, if you want to use the double seal, (and who wouldn't?!) it gives out pretty quickly and requires a very LONG 20 minute wait to seal again. It's pretty disappointing as this double sealing feature is really the best new feature on this. I personally have never had a major problem with my last FoodSaver not keeping up with the amount of meat I have to seal, while I am not a hunter, I do often buy large amounts of meat on sale, including large cuts like ribs, or whole chickens, etc. to fill up my chest freezer. At most I might have to wait once or twice for a short time for it to get back to work. So a 20 minute wait really isn't appreciated just to use the one really killer feature on this FoodSaver.The other thing I didn't care for is the way it seals and how much bag it wastes. It seems like every FoodSaver I buy, this becomes more of a problem, from the earlier ones that would seal very close of the edge of the bag, and then they wasted a couple inches, my last one about 3 inches, and this one which is more like 4 inches. I have to wonder if this is on purpose, after all the more bag wasted, the more money FoodSaver makes on bags, and particularly the less you can reuse them. The way you have to lock the lid onto the bag tends to not only make it take a longer time to activate the device (versus my current FoodSaver which you just insert the bag into and it begins sealing) but it means more bag wasted, and sometimes issues with the bag coming out as you close the lid, particularly if it is very full. You also will find you will need to put some kind of prop like a book under your bags to seal them due to how high the sealing surface is, to lessen the chance that closing the lid will move the bag out of position. I did feel that the vacuum is REALLY strong on this FoodSaver in comparison to my last one, and having a removable drain channel for cleaning is something every FoodSaver really should have.Overall, I really couldn't see paying so much for this FoodSaver over my much less expensive and more compact 11"" model, unless money really wasn't a concern. Reliability as well might make me see it more favorably, I would hope for the price that this would last many times what the cheaper models do, but only time will tell if that is the case. If the price makes you balk as well, along with the release of this new product, there are some additional styles of FoodSaver bags, including an 11"" roll that is pleated, allowing you to much more easily vacuum pack large cuts using 11"" bags. If you already have an 11"" model, you may want to check out these Foodsaver Expandable Vacuum Bag Rolls. It certainly is a much cheaper approach to sealing large cuts of meat than this very expensive, and very large FoodSaver.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28VRIE6HVSZD0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARW34TA#wasThisHelpful","R28VRIE6HVSZD0","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first Mega Bloks kit, but I have assembled a lot of Lego and K'Nex kits. What a cool vehicle this is! Certainly any serious Halo fan, or kids (or adults) that enjoy brick building will like this. The spring suspension in particular is a nice touch. I would say this kit is harder than a normal Lego kit for the same age group, due to the large numbers of different piece types. The figures in particular took me awhile to figure out as they didn't include step-by-step directions, so even though they are first in the directions, for inexperienced builders you may want to leave them for last. Otherwise, it's a great kit and an awesome 'Hog model.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XPIUQ2QSOJ2R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U26LILC#wasThisHelpful","R2XPIUQ2QSOJ2R","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many of us remember these Thermos bottles from childhood, as other reviewers have mentioned, this is not quite the same quality, but I find it only to be slightly less well made. The handle in particular is kind of clunky and tends to get stuck on one end when I try to pull it out or push it in. I use similar stainless steel sports bottles to keep my drinks in the car cool, particularly this time of year when it is so hot, but those are much smaller and don't even have enough room for a bottle of my favorite Sobe water with ice. This is ideal to bring along a whole day's worth of drinks to keep cool and refill my smaller sports bottle with.

"There is absolutely NO useful training information in this book at all. At best, it covers some different training methods and the importance of finding a good trainer, but that is information you can easily glean for yourself from many sources. In fact, go to the Wiki page on Dog Training and you will find almost the exact same run-down of types of training methods. It includes the Koeler method as a ""potential"" training method, which is very old-school punishment-based training and much of the text is written in a way that the average reader would have trouble understanding it. It also shows a photo of a collar that is a type that I would not use on 99% of puppies, and many other photos have little to do with the associated text. I could go on, but what it comes down to is that there's actually nothing that gives you information on HOW to actually train your dog to do anything. You can read this entire book in 5 minutes, and come out with pretty much nothing you wouldn't have known already and many things that would be best forgotten.Take a look at all those 5-star reviews on this e-book. Every one of them is the ONLY review that the person has posted, and many of them are so poorly written as to be incomprehensible (they read like something written in another language and put through Google Translate). This is typical for someone that pays for 5-star reviews to be posted on their book to try and get people to buy it (just look how many of them refer to 'puppy preparing', a term I've never heard used before for training). Please please don't waste your money on this. If you want some good information on how to train your dog, go grab yourself a copy of Pat Miller's Power of Positive Dog Training instead.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KTIBDVQWDYN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XFRF4A6#wasThisHelpful","R2KTIBDVQWDYN1","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wasn't as impressed with this book as other reviewers. Now, as a young girl, I read ANYTHING that had to do with horses, particularly the entire Black Stallion series, Misty of Chincoteague, and other such classics. While this is written for an even earlier reader than those, it still came off as very stilted and simplistic in its writing. It has some nice information on what kinds of things you might have to do at a horse ranch to care for the animals, and certainly young girls will love it regardless because of the ponies and dogs that the story is about as well as the lavish illustrations, but the story just really lacked much creativity and charm, IMO. I compare it for instance with another book I reviewed recently for the same age group, Battle Bugs, which even an adult could read and be charmed with the imagination and inventiveness of the story, while still managing to educate along the way. While that book was more geared towards boys, it was the kind of story I particularly loved as a young reader myself, why is it that books for girls are so often far less interesting, domestic even, while boys are off having grand adventures? Perhaps it was because I reviewed these two books so close together that I could not help but feel let down as a girl that this story had so little of that. Ultimately the story seemed to be mostly about the girls misbehaving and fighting a lot and then in the end getting their way. The protagonist is repeatedly not following instructions and putting herself in very real danger (not to mention the animals which keep getting loose, which in the real world often leads to severe consequences), and then the adults actually just give in and let her have her way at the end. We see a pony that is actually rearing up when being brushed (something that could cause a child very serious harm) and just a short time later in the story, she is actually being allowed to ride the pony. Not only is it unbelievably unrealistic, I think it sends a very bad message to young readers about the importance of following the rules, particularly around animals like horses and ponies that can seriously injure them, and that if they just keep nagging about what they want, the adults will just give in. Not the kind of lesson I would want for a young girl. I hope that future books in the series will take a bit of a different approach and teach some better lessons.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QNBRLFLRVRBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545797659#wasThisHelpful","R3QNBRLFLRVRBZ","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's not a whole lot of difference with Chromebooks in terms of the programs you get installed, it's kind of a relief in fact to not book up a computer and find it full of crap I need to remove! Chromebooks are particularly good for kids as a first laptop and will serve them well even through college. It does rely on having internet, don't expect to be able to do much with one of these away from a wifi signal. But that does mean as well being able to work on the cloud a lot which is how it gets away with a fairly minimal amount of onboard storage. It includes a 100gig Google Cloud account (free for the first 2 years), so you will have plenty of online storage for photos and documents. Don't expect to be able to do really serious MS Office work on it, unless you plan to subscribe to the MS Office Cloud as well though, Google's versions are fine for very basic docs but definitely will not work with more complicated Office needs.I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of the laptop, it's very fast, since it's running off Flash storage only. Display is decent, if not excellent, for the price. Instead of a row of F-function keys the keyboard has action keys for back, forward, mute, full screen, etc. The keyboard was reasonably spacious and the touchpad worked well. Really the only thing I noticed that I would have changed is some kind of small cutout on the front edge to make opening it a bit easier.

"I have a different Hoover carpet cleaner that is no longer working after a couple years of light use, so I will be curious to see if this works better. But first impressions, I'm not thrilled. First, the ""clip"" to hold the power cord is so thin, I could not get the cord into it no matter how hard I tried. I don't think even a hammer would get that cord in there. As for the ""commercial"" designation, it doesn't seem any more heavy-duty than my other cleaner, and the cleaning compartments in particular lightweight plastic with seams that look prone to easily break apart with use. Even though it costs quite a bit compared to similar cleaners, it is missing a lot of features my other Hoover had including a hose attachment for doing stairs and upholstery. And more annoying, this is one of those cleaners that doesn't mix the cleaning fluid itself, so you have to do a rinse by throwing out any remaining cleaning fluid so you can refill it with clean water. Although, that seems to be where my last machine broke down, so perhaps I should be glad it doesn't do that! But that was just so much more convenient and less wasteful... when it did work. Given all that, it did clean my floors pretty well, I just am not sure the price is worth what you get.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TY1CG5F9R1SP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006I9X4#wasThisHelpful","R3TY1CG5F9R1SP","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Yes, dry food is often a contributing factor, but there definitely seems to be a lot more people complaining with this food and particularly recent changes to the formula.

The paddle is very light, which is the type of paddle I prefer to play with so I was pleased with the performance of it, my Dad also tried it but found it too light for his liking, making it harder to control the spin he likes to put on the ball. The racket was very similar to cheaper STIGA models I've used so not sure I can recommend paying this much for this particular model.

"I was fairly disappointed in this book, while I am a Christian, I really was looking for a book with more help on starting friendships and cultivating them than just a lot of Biblical stories and lessons, much of which is just very general about relationships, do's and don't, things like forgiveness and being a good friend. Much of this is pretty common sense stuff, and it didn't have a whole lot for people like me that might find it difficult to start up friendships particularly with other women (who I personally often don't have a whole lot in common with). There are a fair number of topics as well which have no interest to me, being single and having no children, likewise topics about ""at the office"" had relatively little I could glean from them.

"This is not the easiest to read or most accessible book on this topic by any means, personally I enjoyed Matthew Vine's ""God and the Gay Christian"" more for a book fairly similar to this, but a lot easier to read. Still, I greatly appreciated the depth of scientific information in particular here, and the in depth discussion of the associated Scripture passages. It's not for the faint-of-heart or those looking for a quick read on this topic, which is primarily on how we can reconcile scripture with what we have learned about same-sex people and relationships from a scientific bend.I do shake my head at comments that this book ""won't convince anyone"" that has already taken up an opposing position. That's nothing unexpected, we know from confirmation bias that we are all very hard-wired not to accept arguments that go against our own strongly held positions, and IMO this is a perfect example of confirmation bias in action, where there is not a really obvious ""perfect truth"" on one side or the other. Rather than get into a long discussion of this and my own journey to what I believe, for me, ultimately I look at where the evil and harm that Jesus tells us we will see come from false prophets is, and there is no question in my heart where the truth lies, and that is with love.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF67U9LDD50O0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426798296#wasThisHelpful","RF67U9LDD50O0","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a bit disappointed in this book. Maybe I was expecting something other than what the intent was, but if you aren't a big surfing fan and already know who Clay is, but are looking for more of an exploration of growing up with Asperger's, this is probably not the best book to go to for that. I think for instance, of Temple Grandin's amazing books on living with Autism like ""Thinking in Pictures"". This book doesn't come close to that level of excellence, insight and widespread appeal. Describing this as ""co-authored"" by Clay as well seems a bit of a stretch as it was more based on interviews with him and family and friends, with a much more journalistic approach to the material than the personal insights and reflection you usually get in an autobiographical tone. Having felt for many years that I have Aspergers myself and still exploring what that means for me, and reconciling that with the social difficulties I had growing up, there was much I could relate to, but only very superficially, as there were equally as many things that were foreign to me and my experience. Ultimately, this really is just a biography of a surfing phenom who happens to be an Aspie, with some interesting insights in how those two interacted to make him who he was. And as a biography, I found it only somewhat interesting as surfing just isn't a sport I am particularly interested in. But as a book on what Aspergers is, what it's like to live with, and how differently it can manifest, it just wasn't as compelling or interesting as I had hoped for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NZXLBAZ39K6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544256212#wasThisHelpful","R1NZXLBAZ39K6C","ARXU3FESTWMJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARXU3FESTWMJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Uggh, this book just tries to be a bit too cute and funny for its own good. From the tone I felt like it was focused on teenage boys, and their level of juvenile humor. It's a topic that has been covered before, and better by others, although I did enjoy the closing chapter, talking about being an active participant in what we watch and ways to discuss it. Most of the rest I just tended to get a bit annoyed by, from the writing and over-the-top attempts at humor to the often lack of real depth of knowledge on the movies discussed, particularly those based on other media like books and comics. It's a bit silly for instance, to talk about being able to find Christian messages in the Lord of the Rings, written by well known Christian JRR Tolkien. If you aren't into zombie movies, you may find the amount of time spent on this genre a bit tiresome as well.

"I depend on solar lights for lighting the outside of the house but I also love them when the electricity goes out (which seems to happen far too often), and I use them to light up the entire inside of the house when this happens. They come in so handy and since I'm a recycler, I love recycling the light from our Great Central Sun. This particular design is great and allows one to hang it on the house/fence or to situate it snugly into the earth. At the moment I've got it just sitting on the ground and this works well also. It isn't a heavy unit but the winds don't blow it around and it seems happy among the shrubs.It's made well enough and has two brightness settings, high or low. I generally use the low as I don't want to blast the neighbors with unwanted light. We actually have rules in our neighborhood where lights are frowned upon because folks who moved here came here specifically to watch the night sky.Installation is a snap and you're up and ready to roll within minutes.

I love my BASS and I can assure you that these buds have that and more.I like to use the term, *surround sound stereo* for really good earbuds and that is certainly true of these. I always test headphones to Warren Zevon's music, especially his songs, Mohammed's Radio and Carmelita. Both these songs go through every chord and note and they'll come through one or both earbuds with perfect pitch. I'm extremely thrilled with both the sound and the comfort of these headphones. I could listen for days on end, and maybe I will. The audio quality is superb.The earbuds fit gently in the ear canal and stay put. I've been running around the neighborhood with these and haven't had any problems with them staying in place. I don't hear any echo from the cord, the color blue is lovely and they pair easily. A 80 mAh battery keeps them charged and it takes about 2 hours to fully charge. Music or talk time is about 7 hours and standby time is about 175 hours.They come nicely boxed with a USB charging cable, 4 silicone ear buds, 4 earhooks, a buckle and a user manual. If you haven't used bluetooth earbuds before, I think you'll easily understand the set up through the manual. As everyone knows, I'm a real fuss pot when it comes to my bluetooth headphones and I only want the best BASS there is. This is it folks, don't hesitate to purchase these for you or your friends.Product received for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7BMLH9K7E74W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016XQZ4KK#wasThisHelpful","R7BMLH9K7E74W","ABUE0ALHKWKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABUE0ALHKWKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little gadget is terrific....I know that some of us prefer this type of bluetooth device because there are no cords or attachments and if you're one of those folks, you'll really like this too. It fits very comfortably in the ear and the white ear piece rotates if you need to adjust it for comfort or to keep the mic end of the gadget closer to your mouth. It stays in position at all times unless you change it.Pairing with a bluetooth capable device is super easy, I paired it with my phone and my Kindle Fire just as quick as could be. The sound is quite good, it's not surround sound stereo, but it's clear, the music is good and I can hear people chatting with me just fine on the phone..It comes with a charger with which you insert the headphone into one end, and the other end plugs into a USB port for charging. It doesn't come with a charging cable but it does come with a good manual which is easily understandable. I think this is very well priced for an ear piece which works great and I will highly recommend it to others when they ask me ""what's that in your ear?""Get one, you'll love it ~Product received for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCYZN2R6YAP4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017H69UQE#wasThisHelpful","RCYZN2R6YAP4J","ABUE0ALHKWKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABUE0ALHKWKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The case itself is well sewn and it feels great in the hand. It has a soft magnetic closure so there's no snaps or buttons, it just gently closes together and will sometimes fall open. It charges up within a few hours and the charging light goes out when it's fully charged. It pairs easily with my techy devices and is ready to go in just seconds.The keyboard is very soft and it resembles a real keyboard and although I'm very light on my touch, I sometimes get MMMMMMMMMMM instead of just M. This can be a bit frustrating as other keyboards are not quite as touchy. There's another key which does not seem to work at all which makes this less than workable for me.It's good looking and a handy device when you need a keyboard but I believe it needs a bit more tweaking before this is ready for Prime Time.Product received for review purposes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PMG5ZHMFSRW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZH6YJ2#wasThisHelpful","R3PMG5ZHMFSRW7","ABUE0ALHKWKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABUE0ALHKWKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fun little gadget for safety while you're out riding your bike or just walking. It takes 2 AAA batteries and it easily attaches to your bike, I put mine on the back so it shines outward and everyone can see me. It has several modes and it's easy to see by anyone who is driving behind you on the road. It's not the brightest but it's bright enough and the red is clearly visible.I also use this attached to my backpack as I often walk early morning in the dark and even though I'm on a paved pathway, I'd still like everyone to know I'm there just in case. I love the diamond shape and am certainly fond of the design, just press either of the buttons on front for the effect you want. I would much prefer a USB charged device rather than batteries as this is the new technology and it's so much easier for us to charge our devices with electricity than the expense of batteries.Product received for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39H67TLAKX4LF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017EJRDAO#wasThisHelpful","R39H67TLAKX4LF","ABUE0ALHKWKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABUE0ALHKWKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used Viva Labs products for several years and have very good success with this company, and I'm always happy to try their new products. One of the best things about this particular probiotic is that they can be stored away from heat and light, and do not have to be refrigerated. This actually makes my life so much easier as I keep them on my desk and know to take them every morning when I see the bottle. Sometimes things get lost in the fridge and I much prefer those which do not need refrigeration.These probiotics have 25 billion CFU and come in small vegetarian capsules. They are easy to swallow, have no taste whatsoever and no distress to the system. The BioXtendTM technology helps the capsules to extend the release of the probiotics an additional 40 minutes so they don't breakdown too early in the process. In this way the strains colonize more efficiently and do a better job of balancing the system. I've had nothing but good results all around.I highly recommend these probiotics and suggest that everyone stay on a daily regime, as they do wonders for your system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLSGZCIIBPPD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFQS19K#wasThisHelpful","RLSGZCIIBPPD1","ABUE0ALHKWKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABUE0ALHKWKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These headphones are very attractive with a red cord and the metallic red strip around the actual ear piece. They also have magnets in the earbuds so they stick together around your neck when not in use. I love this attribute and all my favorite pairs of headphones have this. It should be mandatory for all headphones ! This pair has the button housing on the left instead of the right, I assume this is more workable for those who are left handed. I like the housing a great deal as it's a bit larger than most and there's no worries about pressing more than one button at a time. They seem very well built and pair immediately with my techy devices.Out of the box, I needed to put the smallest pair of extra ear tips on as the tips were much too big. After changing to smaller ear tips, I still couldn't get the earbuds far enough into my ear canals for good sound. They wouldn't stay put and the only good sound came from using my fingers to keep them pressed inside my ears. Clearly, this isn't going to work. Something about this design doesn't work with my ears.The sound is just basic but does sound great once the earphones are pressed into my ears. I know the sound is there, it just doesn't follow though. The buttons work well, I can listen to music and switch to different songs and chat on the phone. Talk time is 6 hours, music time, 4 hours and stand by time, 200 hours. It only takes a hour or so to fully charge, a red light will turn to blue when it's ready to roll.These would be a great pair of headphones if they would change the design of the earbuds to fully sit in the ear canal.Product received for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RFIY3FYND0OP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013DQXBUI#wasThisHelpful","R3RFIY3FYND0OP","ABUE0ALHKWKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABUE0ALHKWKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am absolutely in love with these tungsten wedding bands. This men's band is 8 mm wide and it's just the perfect width in my opinion, it's neither too wide nor too thin and it looks lovely on the finger. The side edges and the inside have that rose gold finish which is so eye catching, it gives a bit of sparkle to the ring when the sun hits it. Truly beautiful.The sizing is right on the money and the finish inside is very smooth so it slides on and off easily. It has a very subtle, manly look about it, it's not feminine at all but rather, looks very strong and no nonsense. It has a great weight to it and a slight dome effect to it which is quite attractive.This is a gorgeous piece of jewelry and I will highly recommend it to many. All of these NMH pieces are just  extraordinary.Product received for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YNV7R349I3C4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016BH2NSW#wasThisHelpful","R2YNV7R349I3C4","ABUE0ALHKWKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABUE0ALHKWKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I opened the package, I just said, ""WOW!""  This is a truly lovely wedding band and I'm very drawn to the rose gold, as it's striking against the black inside design. The black design reminds me of Roman walkways and I'm sure there's a specific name for this but it escapes me at present. The ring itself has a nice weight to it and the rose gold makes it sparkle against my skin. It's incredibly smooth on both the inside and the outside and very easy to slide on and off. The sizing is right on the money and the cost is reasonable enough.I will mention this ring to friends who aren't really into the legalities of marriage but who are committed to each other for better or worse. This would make a beautiful designer ring for those who don't need the price or the chaos of a big expensive wedding.Product provided for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LEPFRRX0IZIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016BH24YK#wasThisHelpful","R1LEPFRRX0IZIM","ABUE0ALHKWKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABUE0ALHKWKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the moment, I'm wearing this myself as it's just to small for my better half. I'd suggest going up one or two sizes for the proper fit. I love the way it feels on me, it's nice and snug and I'm wearing it under a couple layers to keep warm in the cold, winter temperatures. I walk dogs at 5:30 am and it's really cold out at this time, not to mention very dark..... This layer next to my body feels wonderful and it keeps the body heat inside where I need it. Under a shirt, it does indeed make me look more shapely.It's 80% nylon and 20% spandex, it's quite stretchy and it's ribbed at the bottom hem. On me it comes down over my hips and stays put almost like a girdle or shape-wear would do.....I'm actually using it in that way and it works well. It's stitched very well and has some puckered embellishments on the front for the abs.I think women would like this just as much as men.Product received for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N0MPRFNMCIXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0168LA19Y#wasThisHelpful","R2N0MPRFNMCIXO","ABUE0ALHKWKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABUE0ALHKWKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm using these TINY TRIM shears to cut the balls of fur which gather behind my dog's ears. They seem to get matted here every 3 or 4 months and need to be snipped out. With regular shears, my dog hears the cutting but with these, there is little noise and the reaction is *less fear.* Although I have never cut my dogs when cutting away an excess buildup of hair, it is still scary for them. Once I get going they completely relax but that first cut can be frightening.These are great shears and I highly recommend them to all. They have a ball tipped end so you can't harm anyone if they run into the end and a micro-serrated blades for gripping the fur you want to cut.

"This scar cream goes on nicely and absorbs fairly well. I've been using it on a couple of knee scars several times a day to see if there is any improvement. So far nothing to speak of but I'm assuming this will take a good month before I see visible results. The smell is sort of like a combination of chocolate and orange with a few other notes in there as well which I can't put my nose on. It's a thick consistency but feels nice going on.I've also been using this on my feet to soften up my scratchy heels and my feet have responded with a round resounding, YES !  I will continue to use it on the old footsies under my socks. The ingredients in this cream are also those which help with itchy and bug bites so this may also be found useful for summer time.

"This is an interesting new idea in humidifiers....it works by evaporation rather than a steam flow..I like this idea a great deal. Nothing gets saturated with water if it's near and the evaporation seems to go in all directions at once, helping to fill up the room..it's very clever !It's not a huge unit which makes me happy and will be purposefully useful for those who have limited space. It's easy to fill and if you wish to use the Vicks scent pads, you may but that's optional.

"These wireless bluetooth gadgets are great when they work well, but the majority of manufacturers haven't perfected this item yet. At least that holds true for this one. If it gets too confusing or the sound is worse than the sound from your phone, they really aren't worth the trouble. I'm afraid that's the difficulty with this one. I've been working with it for a few days now and just can't seem to get anything but a scratchy sound.I did not get any directions in the box so I relied on my own knowledge of bluetooth energy to set it up.

"Knee support and knee braces are big sellers these days. It seems like knee injuries come far more often than any other and I see this a great deal in my line of work. It can help tremendously to have a brace to help keep the knee in line while walking or doing minor exercise while healing the knee at the same time. Sometimes braces will actually alleviate the pain if they are worn correctly and that's why they're so popular.I walk dogs 8 miles a day, every day, and occasionally I'll get pulled in one direction and my knee goes in the other. The knee will get tweaked and it won't feel good. With a good adjustable brace like BraceUP, I find more comfort walking while it heals. I recommend this brace specifically for this purpose.This brace is very comfortable against the skin and can also be worn over clothes as it's highly adjustable. It has a nice neutral color and it's sewn very well. It's made of antimicrobial materials which prevents bacterial growth and it's breathable.

I was also shown bright happy colors, not dull, kill me now colors that are dark, lifeless and boring. We've got some serious FALSE ADVERTISING going on here and it needs to be reported.

That's all well and good but the product page should not start off saying SET OF 20pcs/10pcs, this is confusing and of course, that's what this vendor was after. Pulling the wool over our eyes doesn't sit well with anyone anymore. It gets you thrown off online shopping stores. (Let's hope you do)The carabiners themselves are small, but they work well.

"This cable mount management device is made of of steel, cold rolled, so it is quite sturdy and will probably last longer than I will. It comes in two pieces along with assembly nuts and bolts and it's all very easy to put together. It hangs vertically unless you decide you want to lay it on the floor and you basically interweave your cables through the web or put them all in together, you can be as creative as you wish with your cables.This cable mount does a great job of clearing up all that space which cables like to take up when they're given a mind of their own.

"Action movies do not have to be intricate for me to enjoy them.  On the contrary, they can be simplistic in nature, as long as the fighting is intense and fits into the storyline.  Such is the case with WOLF WARRIOR.  While the premise is basically a revenge story, the execution of the film is great, and the result is a top-notch action thriller.I’m quickly becoming a big fan of Wu Jing.  He is a very talented martial artist, but he’s also a good actor.  Much like Jet Li, I enjoy seeing Wu Jing in whatever role he is undertaking.  This film permits him to showcase his skills as both an action star and a versatile actor.WOLF WARRIOR is shot well and looks good onscreen.  The locations chosen for filming, however, look like they could be anywhere:  in the U.S., Asia, or even South America.  This isn’t a negative, yet I was hoping to see some of the majestic Chinese landscape in the background.The acting is very good for the most part, with the aforementioned Wu Jing in the lead.  His rival, Scott Adkins, does a great job with his role as well, but we don’t get to see much of him.  I would have liked more character development, but this again isn’t a major complaint…more of an observation.The story starts off a bit slow, but quickly picks up steam.  And when the action gets going, things get hairy very fast.  My sole complaint here is that there’s not many marital arts fight scenes.  The cover boasts ‘breathtaking martial arts’…and what we get to see is good, however I wanted more.  Most of the fighting is gunplay.Still WOLF WARRIOR is a lot of fun with frantic action and intense battles.  My absolute favorite scene is when Jing’s character Feng gives the Merc sniper what’s coming to him.  I almost cheered.

I’m not sure why I waited so long to watch it; my wife has been telling me about how great it is for years.  But I’m glad she convinced me to give it a shot.  It’s an excellent drama with a nice tinge of humor.After I had watched the primary show for a few months, I branched out and gave NCIS: LOS ANGELES a look.  It was ok, but not as good as the original.  Thus, when NCIS: NEW ORLEANS was announced, I didn’t have high expectations.  But, because I had given LA a chance, I knew I should check this one out too.  Surprisingly, NCIS: NEW ORLEANS turned out to be a nice addition to the now-trio of Investigative Service shows.  And while it’s still not as good as the original, the show is a lot of fun and definitely worth checking out.Actor Scott Bakula has been hit-or-miss with me over the years.  He’s done some really good stuff (such as the big screen adaptation of Clive Barker’s LORD OF ILLUSIONS and the Star Trek prequel STAR TREK: ENTERPRISE), but then he’s done some duds as well (I have to confess I didn’t like QUANTUM LEAP at all).  He’s at top form in this role, however, and it’s nice to see him back on TV again.NCIS: NEW ORLEANS looks good and appears to have a modest budget.  The production value looks high, and the show doesn’t skimp on the details.  The set locations are nice as well, as the show is actually filmed in New Orleans; I love seeing familiar spots I’ve visited personally in The Big Easy.The acting is great, with the afore mentioned Bakula heading up a talented cast.  Lucas Black plays Bakula’s right-hand-man, LaSalle.  I’ve enjoyed Black’s work since I first saw him in FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS over a decade ago.  And actress Zoe McLellan plays off of her male counterparts well as Brody.The storylines in NCIS: NEW ORLEANS are well done and fleshed out.  There’s plenty of tension, and the proverbial crap hits the fan from time to time, forcing the group into drastic actions.  But, the day always manages to be saved, and the world moves on.Which brings me to the slight negative aspect of the show:  it’s hard to switch gears from the formality Mark Harmon’s character, Gibbs, brings to the original NCIS, to Bakula’s laid back, easy-going style.  In many instances, NCIS: NEW ORLEANS doesn’t feel like a military-esque show, simply because it lacks the rigidity of discipline Gibbs instills in his team.  But this goes both ways; sure, it’s hard to adjust to the change…but it’s also a welcome one as well.  Sometimes Gibbs’ lack of flexibility gets downright annoying.NCIS: NEW ORLEANS is a win for me, and I recommend giving it a look.  The show has a lot of promise, and I suspect it will become more popular than it’s predecessor (NCIS: LOS ANGELES).  Fans of the original should enjoy it, while newcomers to the series will probably find it entertaining as well.  It is available now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FDUX7U28HT2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YSBFHMI#wasThisHelpful","R3FDUX7U28HT2H","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a review copy of this book in exchange for an honest reviewFirst off, I am offering the author of YEITSO, Scott M. Baker (no relation…as far as we know), a public apology.  He sent me this book months ago, but I am just now getting to the review.  Yes, yes…I know everybody is busy, but even so, I don’t usually make people wait this long.  So, Scott…sorry for dragging my feet on this one.I can also state that YEITSO was definitely worth the wait.  I’ve had the honor of reviewing four other titles from Baker’s bibliography, but this one is by far my favorite thus far.  With this book, Baker has put himself in the running as an alpha male in the wolf pack of independent horror authors.I love, love, LOVE creature-features, regardless of the media format in which they are presented.  I’m good with books, movies, cartoons, pictographs, pretty much anything.  And this one certainly delivers.YEITSO is written very well, with Baker’s trademark style of succinct, efficient storytelling.  This book seems to be the pinnacle of Baker’s writing abilities so far; his earlier works feel more raw, slightly unpolished…but this book showcases the maturity his writing style has attained.The characters in YEITSO are believable and well fleshed-out.  They are all damaged in some way, as are all human beings, which heightens the credibility of each and extends the realism.  I particularly like the main character, Andrews; he is the quintessential protagonist for a story like this, but he’s also a likable, down-to-earth guy.  He is obviously a caring father, which helps make him the perfect hero for me to read.The story in YEITSO is riveting and curious, a mystery rife with intrigue and horror.  I love the pacing of the book, as it reveals just what the reader needs to know in order to keep the suspense alive and the interest piqued.  Baker’s mastery of this aspect is one of the true joys of his writing.YEITSO is a major win for me, and I highly recommend it.  The book is an effective thriller, but it also has a nice dose of gore.  You can’t ask for much more out of a horror novel.  The book is available now in a variety of formats.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RGKTWRUX7U9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940250129#wasThisHelpful","R3RGKTWRUX7U9D","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewI absolutely love horror films that have kids in them.  Not teens, but kids, from the age 12 and down.  Why, you might ask?  Because this makes the terror and the tension in a horror movie even more palpable.  Maybe this stems from me being a parent…but when kids are involved, my anxiety level skyrockets.  For this reason, I knew I wanted to check out CUB the minute I saw its press release.  And I’m sure glad I gave it a look, too.  The film is a unique and impressive horror flick that deserves your attention.This is the first Flemish horror film, from what I understand…and it’s a heck of a debut.  The movie takes hold of you from the start and never lets go.  It is well made, and I will wager the horror community will be hearing much more of director Jonas Govaerts in the future.CUB is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The production team does a great job of capturing the desolate wilderness in which the events take place.  This feeling of isolation dramatically increases the suspense, as we (the audience) truly believe these scouts have nowhere to go.The acting is great, too.  I am particularly impressed with Maurice Luijten, who portrays the main character, Sam.  Luijten does an excellent job with this role, and I hope to see more of him in the future.The story in CUB is pretty straightforward, with the only vague aspect being the motive behind the killings.  But it’s the execution of the film that wins me over here.  Chocked full of mystery and intensity, this is one movie I will definitely revisit in the near future.CUB is a major win for me, and I suggest checking it out soon.  It is available now in a variety of formats, but try to give it a look on Blu-ray; you’ll appreciate the HD picture and sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RT4ZLNFTNX7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WKZO3LK#wasThisHelpful","R1RT4ZLNFTNX7Y","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a review copy of this book in exchange for an honest reviewI have been wondering for a while when technology would catch up to the written word...well, now it finally has.  ARBI AND THE FIRE BREATHING DRAGON is a breakthrough in children's literature, and I hope the idea catches on and spreads.  This augmented-reality method of storytelling will enthrall and delight readers of all ages.The concept behind this book is truly innovative.  It allows for a deeper immersion into the story, as it gives visuals to aid the imagination.  I found no flaws in the programming, nor in the story itself.  In short, this is a perfect medium for relaying information to children, both young and old.  I would love to see this used in the classroom.I highly recommend ARBI AND THE FIRE BREATHING DRAGON.  Give it a look with your children today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25TQ2ADCPGPYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1505266211#wasThisHelpful","R25TQ2ADCPGPYJ","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a review copy of this set in exchange for an honest reviewI simply cannot say enough good things about THE WALKING DEAD.  I have had the privilege to review each season as it has been released on DVD/Blu-ray, and each time I laud the show for what it is and what it represents.  But my reviews do not do the show justice.  It is that good.  I am in my forties, and I cannot think of another show in all my years of TV watching that has been this impressive.  Season 5 continues this tradition of excellence, and I am extremely proud to state it is my favorite season thus far.I think I’ve said this before, but one of the most impressive aspects about this show is how NO character is safe.  The writers have no qualms about killing anyone off, regardless of how major or minor their role in the storyline is.  Just knowing that your favorite character could die during any episode ratchets the tension up exponentially.As with each previous season, THE WALKING DEAD is shot well and looks like a movie.  The production value is way high, which allows for deeper immersion into each episode.  I daresay this is the best looking show on television.The acting is again superb, with Andrew Lincoln headlining an amazing cast.  The regulars (who have survived previous seasons) are once again present as well, including Norman Reedus as Daryl, Steven Yeun as Glenn, Lauren Cohan as Maggie, Chandler Riggs as Carl, Danai Gurira as Michonne, and Melissa McBride as Carol.  Newcomers to this season include Seth Gilliam, who portrays the downtrodden priest, Gabriel; Josh McDermitt, who plays scientist Dr. Eugene Porter; and Christian Serratos, who shines as Rosita Espinosa, Abraham’s girlfriend, just name a few.The special effects in season 5 of THE WALKING DEAD are once again stupendous.  They rival even the best movies that are being made today.  I particularly like how the zombies appear more and more decomposed as the show progresses.  This is a testament to the respect the production team gives the audience; they know we (as a whole) will expect rot to ensue as time passes.THE WALKING DEAD season 5 is another huge win for me, and I recommend it whole-heartedly.  If you have never watched the show, do yourself a favor and give it a look.  If you’re up-to-date on the television episodes, snatch this season 5 set up immediately to add to your collection.  The Blu-ray version has an excellent HD picture and sound, and some nice Special Features as well, including:* Featurettes, such as Inside the Walking Dead; The Making of The Walking Dead; The Making of Alexandria; Beth’s Journey; Bob’s Journey, etc.* Audio Commentaries* Deleted Scenesand more.

"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewSerial killers terrify and fascinate me.  Not to sound morbid, but the idea that a person could do something so heinous as to torture and kill another person is mystifying to me.  But at the same time, just knowing they exist is enough to make me lose sleep at night.  When children are thrown into the mix, specifically as targets of a particular killer, now THAT is enough to make me squeamish on many levels.  For this reason, I knew CHILD 44 was a must-see for me, and I loved it.  Epic on a monumental scale, this film is enthralling, from start to finish.I was concerned about the running time of the film, which clocks in at over two hours in length.  Many films that long tend to drag in the middle, thus making a boring movie experience.  Thankfully, my concerns were unfounded.  The run-time is perfect, and the movie keeps a nice, steady pace.The cinematography in CHILD 44 is beautiful, and the movie is shot with a sense of grace.  I would daresay it is artistic in some places.  This helps to enhance the movie experience and immerse the viewer in the film.The acting is excellent, with Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace portraying the leads.  I’ve been a fan of Hardy’s work for many years, while Rapace continues to impress me with her diverse acting ability.  I read reviews that complained about their Russian accents, but I think both do a top-notch job with them.  Likewise, Gary Oldman shines as a compliment to Hardy and Rapace.The story in CHILD 44 is engaging and intense.  Granted, it is lengthy, but it needs to be to help build the tension.  I particularly like the complexity of the subplots as they relate to the main storyline.  Just when you think a certain scene has nothing to do with the story, it comes full circle and you realize it is necessary to help build the plot.  The resolution at the end of the film is also satisfying and just; I will not reveal anything, but I will say I was happy with how things wound up.CHILD 44 is a major win for me, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good thriller.  The acting performances are phenomenal, the story is intense and intriguing, and the movie as a whole is gorgeous.  You just can’t ask for much more.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26ZDSRLACDMT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z710V6K#wasThisHelpful","R26ZDSRLACDMT2","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewALIEN and the films in its franchise are some of my favorite movies of all time.  They are intense and terrifying, with amazing special effects and the most horrific aliens I’ve ever seen.  The first film was so groundbreaking that hundreds of mimics were made, all set to ride on the coattails of the original’s success.  One such film, Luigi Cozzi’s CONTAMINATION, shamelessly flaunts itself as taking the premise of Ridley Scott’s masterpiece and peppering it with exploding guts galore.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, particularly when it comes to the projectile gut-splattering, however it is important to keep things in perspective when watching the film.  If you go into this film with the right mindset, you’re in for a guaranteed good time.I thought this film would be diehard science fiction horror, which is why I didn’t enjoy it to begin with.  But as the movie progressed, my mindset changed, and I started seeing it for what it is:  a schlocky, B-grade homage to Ridley Scott and his work.  And it is done this way on purpose.  Once I came to that realization, my viewpoint about the film changed, and I wound up having a blast.CONTAMINATION is 35 years old, and it shows.  The film is very dated, due in part to the clothing, hairstyles, and cars seen throughout.  This aspect does not detract from the film, however you will definitely be able to tell it is an aged picture.  Arrow once again delivers in the quality department, however, by providing a 2k restoration of the film from the original camera negative.  As a result, the picture looks very good and the sound is excellent.The acting is a different story.  I understand Italian cinema from that era tried desperately to imitate American works, but it sure seemed lacking when it came to the acting talent.  Nobody in this film gives a particularly great performance, and there’s quite a bit of overacting.  But surprisingly, this actually helps add to the film’s charm.  Weird, I know, but you just have to see it to understand.The special effects in CONTAMINATION are where this film shines.  They are very well done in most aspects for a film of this time period.  I say ‘most aspects’ because a few of the set pieces are reminiscent of an Ed Wood film, but most everything else is well done and looks tight.  I particularly like the exploding chest scenes; there’s plenty of carnage when these happen, and it looks excellent onscreen.CONTAMINATION won’t be for everyone, but it’s a win for me.  If you like schlocky B-movies, Italian cinema in general, or alien invasion flicks, this is one film you’ll want to check out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I7H9ZPW0BFV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TRUJ654#wasThisHelpful","R2I7H9ZPW0BFV7","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewWhen I hear the name ‘Joe Dante’, my mind immediately pulls up the movie poster for GREMLINS.  Then, for some reason, I start ticking down the list of other iconic titles from his filmography:  PIRANHA, THE HOWLING, INNERSPACE, etc.  Dante has been responsible for many films that helped define my youth, and I will go so far as to say he’s a genre icon in several regards.  As such, when I heard about BURYING THE EX, I knew I had to see it; Dante has a unique gift for combining horror and humor, and I love how he does it.  I’m glad the fine folks at RLJ Entertainment saw fit to grace me with a copy of the film because it is a fun jaunt into horror-comedy territory you won’t soon forget.Dante seems to transform himself every few years, and the results are always interesting.  He did straight-up horror early on, with THE HOWLING and PIRANHA…but then shifted gears into science fiction with INNERSPACE.  Later on, he did SMALL SOLDIERS, which was also a lot of fun.  I can’t wait to see where he goes next.BURYING THE EX is shot well and looks great from a production standpoint.  The film appears to offer a decent production budget, which is utilized well, and the results are evident onscreen.The acting is top-notch, with Anton Yelchin portraying the main character, Max.  I’ve enjoyed Yelchin in everything he’s done, from STAR TREK to ODD THOMAS.  Ashley Greene plays his possessive girlfriend, Evelyn, and she does a great job as well.  I had no trouble believing she was a psychotic mess.  Alexandra Daddario is Max’s dream girl, Olivia, and she shines in her portrayal.  Even the background characters are well done; of particular note is Oliver Cooper, who plays Max’s sex-crazed half-brother, Travis.  I loved his performance, and I hope to see him future projects.The storyline in BURYING THE EX is familiar, however Dante crams it full of dark humor and fun twists.  Although I knew going into the film it would be a recognized concept, I had faith Dante could deliver and make it entertaining.  And he certainly does not disappoint.  The movie is engrossing, comedic, and even romantic…with a nice dose of zombies and gore thrown into the mix.BURYING THE EX is a big win for me, and I highly recommend giving it a look.  This horror-comedy gem is one every fan of either genre should visit because it has a little bit of something for everyone.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA9SLH6F3I20X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WZNPT5Q#wasThisHelpful","RA9SLH6F3I20X","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a review copy of this book in exchange for an honest reviewWhen I first read the title of author David Bernstein’s latest offering, GOBLINS, I wondered if he had taken a foray into Dungeons & Dragons territory.  D&D is the first thing that pops into my head when I hear terms like ‘ogres’, ‘goblins’, and such.  But when I saw the cover of the book, I knew fantasy was not where it was headed.  I had questions, though:  Could goblins truly be terrifying?  Would they be hokey rather than scary?  Did Bernstein make a mistake with this book?  Thankfully, the doubts in my questions were unfounded.  With GOBLINS, Bernstein creates a new mold in which to cast his horrific creations.I will admit I did not like this book as much as some of Bernstein’s previous works, but it’s a nice feather in his cap regardless.GOBLINS is written well, in Bernstein’s signature style.  The story flows at a nice, even pace, and the exposition is not overly drawn out.  This aspect of his writing style is one of the major draws for me; he focuses more on the story and lets the reader paint a mental picture of the details.The characters are well thought out and believable.  Most could be folks right out of our own hometowns.  The goblins are vicious and horrific, demonic hellspawn that are nasty antagonists for the story.  I particularly like the goblins’ origin story.  I’m not sure if it is based on fact or if Bernstein made it up, but the story certainly makes the creatures more credible and thus, more terrifying.GOBLINS is good, old fashion horror fun.  It is gory, gruesome, and chocked full of horrifying scenarios.  The historical tie-in to a well-known mystery is also a nice addition.  I recommend giving GOBLINS a look, but don’t expect any wand-wielding wizards in this story…the only fantasy involved here is the one where the goblins dream of bathing on your blood…The book is available now in a variety of formats.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20ZO3G95DEP1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619230968#wasThisHelpful","R20ZO3G95DEP1D","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewI’ve been intrigued about the film THE DEAD LANDS for a long time.  I saw a trailer for it several months ago, and the raw savagery within it caught my eye immediately.  I figured if I could watch it, I’d be in for a real treat.  Sure enough, I was right.  THE DEAD LANDS is an epic masterpiece of old-world action and intense drama.Of course, the revenge story is nothing new to cinema.  There are thousands of titles in every genre that deal with the subject.  However, it is a concept that has been around since the dawn of man, and it always makes for great drama.THE DEAD LANDS is no exception.  The film is crammed full of tension and suspense.  It moves at a steady, even pace, and it never lags.  The production value of the film is high, and the cinematography captures the lush, New Zealand scenery with exquisite detail.  The movie is visually as entertaining as the storyline.The acting is excellent, however I confess I am not familiar with any of the cast.  James Rolleston does a phenomenal job as the lead, Hongi, while Te Kohe Tuhaka and Lawrence Makoare are superb as his supporting cast.The action and fight scenes are intense and well done.  I particularly like the unique weapons the characters use in battle.  The edged clubs in the film are based on actual Maori weapons, and they deliver devastating blows to opponents.  The results are lavishly reconstructed for the film, and we get to see them in stunning high-definition.I really enjoyed THE DEAD LAND, and I highly recommend it.  The film is part action, part historical drama, but it’s all fun.  Be warned, however:  it is subtitled, and there are no English dubovers.  But if you can look past that, the film offers an entertaining glimpse into another culture.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EZUL9BVPXAP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YIZWK8S#wasThisHelpful","R3EZUL9BVPXAP1","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewI am chagrined to confess I have never seen THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ALICE CREED, even though it’s been sitting on my shelf for months.  I’ve heard good things, though.  When I found out RECKLESS was a sort of foreign retelling of the same story, my curiosity got the best of me, and I decided to take a look.  I’m happy to report RECKLESS is a riveting and thrilling film, a  true masterpiece of crime cinema!I love everything about this movie, which is why I am happily giving it five out of five stars.  It is that good.The cinematography in RECKLESS is great, and the film looks tight onscreen.  The direction is outstanding, and it shows in the fluid way the movie moves along.  This is a 90 minute film, but the credits were rolling before I knew it.The acting is excellent as well, with the whole cast giving top notch performances.  Tygo Gernandt and Marwan Kenzari portray the kidnappers, while Sarah Chronis plays the victim.  I am not familiar with their previous work, but I hope to see more of them in the future.The story is the big winner in RECKLESS, though.  It is chocked full of suspense and tension.  There are also several twists that occur throughout, and each is a welcome surprise.  I stayed glued to my screen for the entirety of the film, eager to see what was going to happen and hoping I hadn’t missed anything.RECKLESS is a major win for me, and I highly recommend it.  It is a foreign film with English subtitles and no dub-over, so be ready to read the dialogue.  But that does not detract from the film at all.  Give this one a look for sure.

"*I received a review copy of this book in exchange for an honest reviewClive Barker has always been a huge inspiration to me.  In fact, he is one of the primary reasons I started writing.  I’ve read many, if not most, of his titles:  WEAVEWORLD, THE GREAT AND SECRET SHOW, THE DAMNATION GAME, IMAJICA, just to name a few.  Curiously, I waited until I was in my 20s to read CABAL, the novella which was the basis for the film NIGHTBREED.  But out of all of Barker’s works, CABAL stuck with me the most.  I’m not sure why, but something about it resonated deep within me, as it still does today.Because of this deeply-rooted connection, I was ecstatic to learn an anthology was in the works that showcased the fates of some of CABAL’s residents.  I often wonder what happens to characters in single-book stories after the last page is turned, and this collection is an excellent glimpse into the lives of some of the Tribes of the Moon from Barker’s iconic book.  MIDIAN UNMADE is the title of this anthology, and it is nothing short of masterful.It’s been over 15 years since I read CABAL, but just writing about is stoking my desire to revisit it.  The book was a shining beacon in a dark part of my life, therefore it means a lot to me on several levels.The stories in MIDIAN UNMADE are excellent tributes to Barker and his creation.  Each is written with meticulous care, fleshed out perfectly and written in a style that does Barker justice.  The diversity of voices help to give a new aspect to the Nightbreed world, as does the originality of each tale.  And although the subject matter is a common thread, the stories in this collection are as different as their storytellers.If I were forced to find a favorite tale in this collection, I simply could not pick one.  They are all good, and they deserve recognition.  I hope Barker himself gives a shout out to the authors in this anthology, as they have helped broaden the scope of his Nightbreed creation.  In contrast, I cannot find a flaw with the book, either.  The stories are excellent, the characters are epic, and the collection is just about as perfect as a book can be.MIDIAN UNMADE is a major win for me, and I recommend every horror fan out there snag a copy as soon as possible (the book hits store shelves in two weeks).  Dark and imaginative, this is one world you will want to immerse yourself in…but just for a little while.  If you stay too long, the Nightbreed might look at you as food.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7I48FVKLEP7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765335425#wasThisHelpful","R7I48FVKLEP7Y","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewWhen the press release for a film touts it as “CABIN IN THE WOODS and BLAIR WITCH PROJECT meet JACKASS”, there’s no way I’m going to pass up the opportunity to watch it.  I’m a big fan of CABIN and BLAIR WITCH, and I confess I’m a sucker for the JACKASS antics, so my interest is doubly piqued by a description like that.  THE JOKESTERS press release made such a claim, so I decided to give it a look last night.  Unfortunately, the film itself is nowhere near as awesome as the description.  The result is a lackluster horror flick that falls flat on its face.I am not going to label THE JOKESTERS as the worst film I’ve seen so far this year, however it’s pretty close.  It is a movie filled with promise, yet lacking on almost every level.THE JOKESTERS is shot in a first-person POV, as are most found footage films, and the camerawork is nothing extraordinary.  The production value appears decent, but otherwise it looks like every other lower budget movie.  There are literally no attributes that pull this one up from the rest.The acting is bland and lifeless.  The four main characters are annoying more than anything, and I could not find any reason to care about them at all.  The ‘pranks’ they pull are ho-hum and boring, which completely destroys the credibility of their successful web show.  I was hoping for craziness and off-the-wall…instead, we get one of the guys glued to his go-cart seat.  WOW.The story in THE JOKESTERS has promise, but it never develops in the film.  The first hour of the movie is all set-up (the wedding scenes take WAY too much time), so by the time the ‘horror’ starts, the viewer is ready to fall asleep.  I literally had to pause the film and stand up for a moment to keep from nodding off.  Once the killings start, the film gets a little better, however this only occurs in the last 15-20 minutes…thus, it’s too little, too late.I wish I had better things to say about THE JOKESTERS.  It has an interesting premise and could be a fun film, if it were made by the right people.  Sadly, this version is not.  I cannot recommend this one with a good conscious, but the film is available now in a variety of formats if you decide to check it out.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P3OGVQYO1Y9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W7AG2AI#wasThisHelpful","R2P3OGVQYO1Y9J","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewH.P. Lovecraft’s fiction has been the basis for many films, including both original stories and adaptations of his work.  Several of these films are very good, including THE UNNAMABLE and CASTLE FREAK, while others are outstanding, such as Stuart Gordon’s RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON.  I’m proud to announce Huan Vu’s THE COLOR OUT OF SPACE will join the upper echelon of these excellent Lovecraft adaptations.  This film is a brilliant recreation of the story, and I highly recommend giving it a look.I wasn’t sure what to expect going into this one.  Several years ago, I watched another adaptation of this particular Lovecraft story, only this one was titled COLOUR FROM THE DARK.  It was a good film, but it deviated from the original story quite a bit.  This film, on the other hand, stays much closer to the source material.THE COLOR OUT OF SPACE is shot very well and looks great onscreen.  It is presented in black-and-white, except for the strange meteorite globules, which are shown in shimmering color.  This stark contrast makes for an interesting viewing experience and heightens the immersive nature of the film.The acting is very good, however I have to admit I am not familiar with any of the cast.  Likewise, the special effects look great as well.  I particularly like the CG used for the meteorite globules; this looks impressive, especially when they are shown against the black-and-white backdrop of the rest of the film.If I were forced to find a flaw with THE COLOR OUT OF SPACE, I might have to mention the odd nature of the first five minutes of the movie.  For some reason, these first few minutes seem out of place with the rest.  Perhaps this is because they have a different feel and a slightly different look than the rest of the film.  Granted, they don’t detract from the movie overall, but I do feel this is worth mentioning.Otherwise, THE COLOR OUT OF SPACE is a major win for me, and I highly recommend it.  Be sure and snag one of the Limited Edition Blu-rays (they only made 1000 copies!); in addition to some slick reversible artwork, it also contains an exclusive newspaper cover insert.  Also included on the Blu-ray are:* A variety of Lovecraft audiobooks* Dreamlands Trailer* Making of THE COLOR OUT OF SPACE* Lost scene* Science and Horror Featurette* Effects and Concepts FeaturetteThe film is available now, so make a note and check it out!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O8ZZ6JU6ZB4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2YNKQU#wasThisHelpful","R1O8ZZ6JU6ZB4P","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a review copy of this book in exchange for an honest reviewWhen it comes to movie adaptions of books, the literary version usually trumps the screen version every time.  This is often attributed to the fact a movie can only present so much in an allotted timeframe, whereas a book can present just about anything it wants.  I often read the book prior to seeing the movie because this allows me to create my own images of each character, instead of picturing the actor/actress in each scene.  DAWN OF THE DEAD is a unique scenario for me because I didn’t even realize a book version existed.  Therefore, when I read it, I couldn’t help but picture the cast of the film in my head as each scene played out.  But even so, the book is just as entertaining as the film, and I suggest fans of Romero’s celluloid classic snatch up a copy of this one as soon as possible.I love how Simon Pegg was picked to write the introduction.  SEAN OF THE DEAD is a hilarious horror-comedy, but it’s also a silent homage to the terrifying world Romero created.  As such, Pegg makes the perfect person to set the foundation of the book.DAWN OF THE DEAD is written well and flows nicely, just like its screen companion.  The prose is not overdrawn or lengthy, but reads quickly instead, allowing the action and the intensity to mesh into the story.  I like this attribute, as it makes the book a quick read and an adrenaline-fueled trip into terror.The story is very much like the film, however we get much more backstory.  I found some reviews from readers who did not like this aspect, saying it bogged the story down; I disagree.  I think the deeper exposition gives us a broader picture of the characters as well as the plot.  This grants a more fulfilling experience with the story.DAWN OF THE DEAD is a definite literary win for me.  I recommend it to fans of the film and anyone looking for an introduction into Romero’s dark world.  The book is available now in a variety of formats, so give it a look.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4LCG1O8LHUXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147679183X#wasThisHelpful","R4LCG1O8LHUXZ","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewDon’t let the corny title of KUNG FU KILLER fool you; it is actually a top notch martial arts action-thriller.  I admit the title almost dissuaded me from watching the film, however I’m glad I didn’t let it.  With a riveting storyline, massive levels of intensity, and some brutal fight scenes, this is one film I’m definitely glad to add to my collection.  If you are a fan of high adrenaline action, this film is for you!Donnie Yen just keeps getting better and better.  I am continuously impressed with his work.  If he can keep this type of momentum going, he will be a household name, much like Bruce Lee.KUNG FU KILLER is shot well and looks great from a production standpoint.  But the story itself is what sells this film.  It pretty much grabs you from the start, and it never lets go.  I found myself enjoying it just as much as the action sequences.The acting is very good, with the afore mentioned Donnie Yen headlining a great cast.  Yen delivers his drama just as powerfully as he doles out punches.  Joining Yen this time is Baoqiang Wang, who seems to quickly be making a name for himself in martial arts flick circles.  Wang does a great job portraying a cripple who has overcome his disability with deadly fighting skills.  I hope to see more of him in the future.The fight scenes in KUNG FU KILLER are pure joy, and I have to admit they are some of the best I have seen this year.  They seem to be more brutally realistic than some, filled with cracking bones and smashed skulls.  I think this realism makes the intensity higher, which in turn makes for a more immersive film experience.KUNG FU KILLER is a major win for me, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a thriller with some excellent action.  The film is available now in a variety of formats, so check it out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1700KC5RTV8OV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VHAG0NI#wasThisHelpful","R1700KC5RTV8OV","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewSeveral years ago, a friend of mine told me I needed to sit down and watch John Frankenheimer’s THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU.  When I asked why, he just smiled and said, “You’ll see why after you watch it…it’s bizarre.”  His enigmatic answer was enough to prompt me to watch the film, so I did.  He was certainly right; the film is a very strange take on H.G. Wells’ book…but it’s also way out in left field on certain things.  I always found the film odd, and now, thanks to LOST SOUL: THE DOOMED JOURNEY OF RICHARD STANLEY’S ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU, I think I understand why.  This amazing documentary sheds light on one of the weirdest filmmaking experiences ever recorded in history.I always wondered what happened to Richard Stanley.  After directing two cult-favorite films (HARDWARE and DUST DEVIL), he dropped off the planet for a long time.  I didn’t hear anything about him for years, until back in 2012, when he directed a short in THE THEATRE BIZARRE horror anthology.  I hope the release of this documentary will help usher in his reemergence into the realm of filmmaking.LOST SOUL: THE DOOMED JOURNEY OF RICHARD STANLEY’S ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU is shot like most documentaries and looks good onscreen.  The behind-the-scenes story is exhaustively fleshed out, and the result is a top-notch documentary that is entertaining and engrossing.The film contains a slew of famous faces, including Fairuza Balk, Rob Morrow, Robert Shaye, and even Richard Stanley himself.  I wish the production team had gotten Val Kilmer for an interview, however I can understand why Kilmer probably did not want to be on camera; not a single cast or crew member had anything positive to say about him.This fascinating glimpse into the nightmarish film experience behind THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU is something you simply must see to believe.  Richard Stanley was fired after four days of filming.  Afterwards, more chaos ensued:  John Frankenheimer was called in to finish the film and decided to rewrite the script on the fly; meanwhile, Marlon Brando started acting crazy, and Val Kilmer’s diva-like antics were nothing short of jaw-dropping.  The events prior to and during the film shoot were a perfect storm for New Line Cinema, and it’s a wonder the company didn’t go bankrupt because of it.LOST SOUL: THE DOOMED JOURNEY OF RICHARD STANLEY’S ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU  is a huge win for me, and I recommend checking it out as soon as possible.  If you’ve never seen the Frankenheimer/Stanley film, give it a look and then watch the documentary.  But if you are already familiar with it, this film will answer many of the questions you’ve harbored over the years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMBY9ZQFRS6ES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YXRPJUM#wasThisHelpful","RMBY9ZQFRS6ES","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewDirector Takashi Miike is a man of great talent and diverse vision.  This is evidenced by his extensive filmography.  Whereas many of his titles contain dark and gory elements, a few stand out as unique entries into his portfolio because they are not so.  THE HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS is one of these select few.  And while it might not have many of Miike’s signature staples, fans of his work will quickly recognize his influences onscreen nonetheless.  The film is chocked full of bizarre characters, crazy situations, and a lot of dark humor.  If you’re not a fan of Miike already, chances are you will be after this!If a film’s tagline describes it as “THE SOUND OF MUSIC meets DAWN OF THE DEAD”, how can anybody in their right mind not want to see it?  I mean, wow…hooks just don’t get much better than that!  This film basically had me at hello.THE HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS is a bizarre trek into absurdity, and it is excellent in every aspect.  The film is shot well and looks great onscreen, and it even features some nice stop-motion animation at the beginning.  Granted, the opening sequences don’t appear to have much to do with the rest of the film, but they are fun to watch nonetheless.The acting is over-the-top and hammed up nicely, which adds to the charm of this horror-comedy.  Usually, I would comment on this in a negative light, but this aspect really seems to work for this film.  Given the nature of the subject matter, the crazy characters accent the surrealistic landscape of the film.And ‘surreal’ is a perfect word to describe THE HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS.  Filled with obscure imagery, kooky scenarios, and even a barrage of nonsensical musical numbers, this is one film you have to see to believe.  I highly recommend this film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R375PC3DHTP9BL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TRUJ8UM#wasThisHelpful","R375PC3DHTP9BL","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewIf a movie boasts Simon Pegg as one of its cast, you can bet I’m going to find a way to see it.  I’ve been a huge fan of his work since 2004, when I first saw SHAUN OF THE DEAD.  When I first heard about KILL ME THREE TIMES, I was surprised to discover he was attached; I never considered him assassin material, but I figured he was certainly up to it.  Low and behold, the film blew me away.  I will even go so far as to say it is a definite Must See for everybody reading this review, regardless of whether you are a genre fan or not.  KILL ME THREE TIMES is an excellent film, and it is one of the best I’ve seen so far this year.KILL ME THREE TIMES is one of those movies that almost defies description.  It is definitely a comedy-thriller, but it also runs in the vein of Quentin Tarantino.  I love the diversity in the film, as it has you laughing one minute and cringing the next.KILL ME THREE TIMES is shot very well and look great onscreen.  Director Kriv Stenders has a great eye for film, and this is evidenced by the unique look the cinematography brings about during the story.The acting is excellent, with Pegg sharing screentime with several great names.  These include Alice Braga, Teresa Palmer, Luke Hemsworth, and Bryan Brown.  The entire cast does a phenomenal job together, and there’s a lot of chemistry between everyone involved.The special effects in KILL ME THREE TIMES are quite good as well.  Surprisingly, there’s some nice gore, and it looks great onscreen.  I particularly like the police offer who takes a bullet in the throat; this looks gruesomely realistic, and it almost makes you cringe when you see it.The story is the big winner for the film, though.  It’s got more betrayals and backstabbing than a group of Washington D.C. politicians.  And it’s filled with twists and turns, like a multi-layered mystery novel.  With that being said, the storyline is not difficult to follow at all.  If anything, it’s pretty simple in nature.KILL ME THREE TIMES is a major win for me, and I highly recommend it.  Stenders is a name to watch out for in Hollywood; if he continues to make movies of this caliber, his future will be bright for sure.  This film is available now in a variety of formats.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AIGKS0PEV8JA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9JQP5O#wasThisHelpful","R1AIGKS0PEV8JA","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"* I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewI’ve mentioned before how much I love the After Dark Originals brand from Lionsgate.  The films are usually fun, and some are just downright awesome.  The series’ latest release, ASYLUM, puts me in an odd position, however.  I can’t really decide which side of the fence I am on in regard to it.  Part of me loved it, but another part of me didn’t like it at all.  In short, I’m conflicted, and I don’t think this is going to resolve itself anytime soon.First off, the description for this film is very misleading.  Yes, that is the basis for the plot…but for the movie WITHIN the movie.  Let me explain:  the plot above is for a film that was shot in another country, and it is the film that two editors in the outer movie are watching while they comment on it.  Basically, this is sort of a Mystery Science Theater 3000 setup.  The outer film is very campy and comedic, while the actual horror film seems to be dark and serious.  This contrast is one of the reasons I disliked the film overall.The inner film (the actual ASYLUM movie) is shot well for the most part and looks nice and dark onscreen.  The outer film looks more like a home movie, and its picture quality is not as good.  Once again, this contrast throws the production value off as a whole, and the resulting product does not look as professional as it could have.One major drawback of the inner film is that it is not complete.  This is done on purpose, as the editors are supposedly watching the footage to splice it together (even though it already is), but it really detracts from the film experience.  There are several scenes where wording pops up on the screen to note missing visual effects or whatnot, but I really did not like this; it took me completely out of the viewing experience for both films.If you look at ASYLUM as a horror-comedy or as a MST3K spin-off, it almost works.  I actually chuckled at the editors dialogue a couple of times because they were spot on with their comical assessment of the movie’s situation.  But if you look at this is being a true horror film (which, honestly, is what the plot synopsis advertises this as), then it fails miserably.  The inner film could actually be relevant as a decent horror flick, but only if it wasn’t attached to the outer film.Overall, I’m still torn on this one, and as such, I can’t recommend it in good conscience.  If I had known it was horror-comedy going into it, my perception would would have been different and therefore my feelings would have been, too.  But since I was expecting an actual horror flick, I can’t say this one succeeds.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FW3D82HD6DMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V37CDO0#wasThisHelpful","R3FW3D82HD6DMV","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewIf you’ve never trekked around in the woods at night with just a flashlight to guide you, then you are truly missing out on one of life’s simple but effective thrills.  I’ve lived the majority of my life in the rural south, and I’ve been surrounded by wooded areas for as long as I can remember.  As a kid, my friends and I would play a game called Midnight Hide-and-seek, which is very similar to the premise behind NIGHTLIGHT.  As such, I can totally relate to the terror that a darkened forest can bring about.  NIGHTLIGHT does an excellent job of fleshing out these mind-twisting nightmares.  The film is a heck of a horror flick, and every fan of the genre will want to give it a look.After I finished the movie, I dug around on the Internet to see what other folks thought about it.  To my surprise, many of the reviews I found were negative.  Most viewers thought it was too gimmicky, and they didn’t enjoy the point-of-view in which it was shot.  Others thought it just didn’t make it sense.  I have to wonder if they watched the same film I did…?  I love this film, and I plan on watching it again soon.NIGHTLIGHT is shot well, however it is not your traditional found-footage style film.  Instead, the entire movie is shot from the perspective of the main character’s flashlight.  Yes, you read that correctly.  We get to see things unfold as if a GoPro Camera had been stuck to Robin’s flashlight.  The result is a clever and extremely effective POV that puts the viewer right into the thick of the intensity.  This is especially noteworthy when the scares are involved.  I will not divulge any of them, however I will confess I had to pause the movie and rewind it a couple of times to enjoy a couple of particular scenes over and over.The acting is great, with the whole cast giving memorable (albeit stereotypical) performances.  The main character, Robin, is played by Shelby Young, who fans of Anchor Bay’s THE MIDNIGHT GAME will remember as Rose.  Young once again gives an enjoyable portrayal, this time as the uncool kid trying to hang out with the popular group.  The rest of the cast is top notch as well, but I have to give a particular shout out to Chloe Bridges who plays the uppity bitch, Nia.  Bridges would have fit right in with the cast of HEATHERS, and I commend her for her acting skills.The special effects in NIGHTLIGHT are very nice, and I especially enjoy the creature costumes.  I’m not giving anything away by mentioning them, but they are not what you would expect from a movie like this.  They are beyond effective in raising the fright level of the flick, and I love how they are integrated into the film.NIGHTLIGHT is a huge win for me, and I highly recommend it.  This is not a rehashed version of BLAIR WITCH, nor is it your typical teens-in-the-woods scenario.  It is a taut thriller full of jump-scares that will keep you on the edge of your sanity.  The film is available now in a variety of formats, but try to watch it in surround-sound if you can…the ambient noises that surround you make a huge impact in the effectiveness of the frights.  Give this film a chance, for sure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38U85ZSUX30F9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDAVFRE#wasThisHelpful","R38U85ZSUX30F9","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received a review copy of this book in exchange for an honest reviewI purchased my first Steve Alten novel as a spur-of-the-moment decision in an airport.  I had a three hour flight and needed to kill time, so I put my hands on THE LOCH.  The cover looked intriguing and the plot was interesting, so I thought I’d give it a shot.  Before I realized what had happened, our plane was landing; the book yanked me in from the start, and three hours passed without my knowing.  As a result, I tore through the book in two days.  So when I heard VOSTOK was a sorta sequel to THE LOCH, I knew I had to read it.Interestingly, I couldn’t tear through VOSTOK as fast as I did its predecessor.  Why?  There’s a couple of different reasons, which I will explain below.  But even though I didn’t find it as engrossing as THE LOCH, this book is still an interesting read.  And while it does have flaws, the tale is still entertaining.Alten has a huge imagination, which helps to make his work so much fun to read.  I am going to have to dive into the MEG series.  I am a huge shark fan, and an even bigger sea-monster fanatic, so this sounds like something right up my alley.  As such, my love for water-based beasties is what prompted my interested in THE LOCH and therefore, VOSTOK.VOSTOK is written well and flows at a decent pace for the most part.  With that being said, the story shifts about three-fourths of the way through the book and jumps ahead seven years.  The reader ultimately learns this is integral to the story, however I will admit it throws a loop at first.The characters are vivid and real, both damaged and believable.  I particularly like Zach’s brother-in-law, True.  He is an oaf of a guy who can bed just about any woman he comes in contact with.  But his personality is so rich, the reader can’t help but love him.The story within VOSTOK is where my major concerns come into play.  What starts off as an exploratory journey into the unknown soon becomes a quantum physics playground.  Alten strays out of the story in some parts to explain, in-depth, certain postulations that are vital to the book’s conclusion.  Some of these explanations border on religious fanaticism, it seems.  These sections completely shut down the story for me, and I found myself struggling to return to the story.Still, I have to confess VOSTOK is intriguing enough to warrant consideration.  It is not a bad book at all…it just needs to remember what it is and not try to wander outside of its fictional premise.  Otherwise, I say give it a look.  The book is available now in a variety of formats.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R359N7J7XKLD9L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1681020009#wasThisHelpful","R359N7J7XKLD9L","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewThe fine folks at Full Moon have created a legacy that spans several decades, and they have given sci-fi and horror fans many memorable titles to enjoy.  I have seen numerous films from Full Moon’s massive library, however I am far from seeing them all.  As such, there are many cult favorites that I have yet to experience.  DOLLMAN VS. DEMONIC TOYS is one of these titles.  Combining three of the company’s franchises, this film is a crazy trek into pint-sized fun!This film contains characters from the DOLLMAN franchise, the DEMONIC TOYS series, and a stand alone film titled BAD CHANNELS.  I have to confess I have not seen any of the films in the three franchises other than this one.  But it has definitely given me the desire to do so.  I am going to try and track them all down to enjoy individually.DOLLMAN VS. DEMONIC TOYS is shot well and looks amazing onscreen, but not just because of the HD transfer.  The miniaturized sets and set-pieces are excellent.  This was made back before CG was cheap, therefore the sets are all handmade.  I am very impressed with how real they look, particularly those in the kitchen countertop scenes.  You simply must see them to appreciate their realism.The acting is perfect for this kind of film.  I’ve mentioned before in my TRANCERS review that I always enjoy Tim Thomerson, and this time is no different.  Joining him are Tracy Scoggins and Melissa Behr, who also do a great job.  My favorite actor in this film, however, is the guy who does the voice for the evil Baby Oopsie, Frank Welker.  His demonic dialogue is a perfect contrast to the semi-cute doll’s appearance, and his foul mouth made me laugh on more than one occasion.This film won’t be for everyone, but DOLLMAN VS. DEMONIC TOYS is a major win for me, and I recommend it anyone who is already a fan of Full Moon or just curious about what they offer.  In addition to the HD picture and great sound, the Blu-ray comes with several special features.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DCSV2BS7XQPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5T8BGK#wasThisHelpful","R3DCSV2BS7XQPH","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewI never get tired of watching old-school horror, especially slashers from the Golden Age of Slasher Films.  MADMAN is one of those films I had heard about but never got the chance to see.  The fine folks at CAV Distributing partnered up with Vinegar Syndrome and gave the film a nice HD upgrade before releasing it on Blu-ray.  The result is an excellent film that offers an entertaining horror experience from yesteryear.I love the tagline for the film: “They thought they were alone.”  It just screams ominous.  And for its time period, way back in ’81, I’ll bet this was a perfect draw for horror fans.MADMAN is shot well and looks good onscreen.  The HD transfer is great and the sound quality is top notch.  I am impressed with how crisp the picture looks for the most part; there are a couple of dark scenes that project a grainy image, but I would imagine that is due to the source material.  Thankfully, they don’t detract from the film at all.The acting in MADMAN is pretty good as well. Granted, I doubt any members of the cast won any awards for their performances, but at least they weren’t painful to watch.  I particularly like Paul Ehlers, who portrayed Madman Marz.  He is a towering presence onscreen, and he plays the villain with relished enthusiasm.There’s a few gory deaths in the film, however many of them happen offscreen.  The gore we do get to see is pretty well done, but you can certainly tell it is dated.  The blood is a bit too bright and thin to be realistic, although I’ll bet it looked great back in the day.I loved MADMAN, and I highly recommend it.  Any horror fans looking for a nostalgic trek back into the early 80s will definitely want to check this out.  It’s a fun romp into slasher territory, and its worth every minute of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R366LI1PZ1W99B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UB0QIQE#wasThisHelpful","R366LI1PZ1W99B","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewI’ll say one thing for certain about THE VATICAN EXORCISMS:  the DVD artwork looks great and is a compelling draw to watch the movie.  The imagery is beyond creepy, and it invokes dread from the get go.  But even though the cover promotes the film well, the actual movie is a bit lacking.  It starts off with a fairly decent (albeit very familiar) concept, but the audience is left wanting much more after the credits roll.  Still, the film is slightly entertaining, even if it is because of the hokey possession-acting.The idea of the Vatican concealing many dark secrets is not a new one, however it is fascinating to ponder.  Several films have been made in regard to this concept over the years, however they all seem to fall short for some reason.  Maybe it’s the lack of factual evidence, or maybe it’s because the films never fully flesh out the supposed ‘findings’…I’m not sure.  But the idea is certainly ripe for a horror film.THE VATICAN EXORCISMS is shot in standard ‘found-footage’ style and brings nothing new to the table in that regard.  Many of the scenes are very shaky but nothing that should make the viewer nauseous.  The shooting locations look great, however, as the film was shot on location in Italy.The acting is decent, with director Joe Marino in the lead.  Although he does a good job for the most part, some of his supporting cast is lacking.  The one that sticks out most in my mind is the last possessed victim, who contorts his body in a variety of ways.  Although the idea is a good one, this guy doesn’t really pull it off very well.  You can tell he’s double-jointed from the start, and the novelty (i.e. gruesomeness) is lost on the audience immediately.  This is technically a minor complaint, but I feel it needs to be mentioned.The actual storyline of THE VATICAN EXORCISMS is where I find the most problems.  It starts off fairly strong, but then quickly degrades.  The film never really decides what it wants to be (Vatican cover-up thriller…possession horror…psychological horror?) or where it wants to go.  As a result, it feels thrown-together, a mish-mash of scenes that might possibly be scary…if presented in the right context.As much as it pains me to say this (because I love a good possession movie, and I love Anchor Bay), I can’t recommend THE VATICAN EXORCISMS.  That is, unless you are completely unfamiliar with possession movies or the found-footage genre; that’s probably the only way you’d enjoy this one.  The film hits store shelves next week, in case you want to take a look.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27YEY4QUWB70J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00USBLVNG#wasThisHelpful","R27YEY4QUWB70J","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a review copy of this book in exchange for an honest reviewA few months ago, I had the pleasure of reviewing The Monster Codex for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, a nice compendium of beasties that will cause every Character they meet to quake in their boots.  Now, the fine folks at Paizo have released a new guide to help flesh out these Characters and bring them to life.  The PATHFINDER ROLEPLAYING GAME: STRATEGY GUIDE is a Must Have for new players, but vets to the game might want to snag this one as well.  A perfect companion to the Core Rulebook, this tome will also be a welcome addition for both GMs and players alike.This book is an invaluable resource for anyone looking to make their characters “meatier”.  Not in the sense of beefing them up physically, but for making them more realistic.  The guide gives insight on basic character construction and then takes the reader step-by-step to how they can make their creations more powerful.  Those players who are already familiar with RPGs will probably want to bypass this first section, but the information is valuable nonetheless.Veteran players will definitely want to visit the Playing the Game section, however.  Regardless of how many months or years you’ve been traipsing through the Pathfinder world, chances are you don’t know everything.  This section of the book breaks down basic gameplay and then looks at more advanced options.One of my favorite aspects of this guide is the Tips for Better Gaming section.  It’s fairly easy to sit down, roll up a character, and then jump into a game…but it’s another thing entirely if you make it a group effort and work together.  This Tips section gives vital information on how to make the most of your gaming experience and how to make the journey fun for all.The PATHFINDER ROLEPLAYING GAME: STRATEGY GUIDE is another welcome addition to the Paizo gaming platform, and I recommend giving it a look.

"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewWhen it comes to surreal and bizarre films, they just don’t get much more so than THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MISS OSBOURNE.  I’d never heard of this film prior to getting the press release, but it’s a cult classic from what I understand.  Granted, it will not appeal to everyone…but if you’re in the mood for something ‘trippy’, that will both shock and entertain you, then this is the film to see.Cinema is full of interpretations and adaptations of Robert Louis Stevenson’s dark classic, however I will wager you’ve never seen one like this.  On the other hand, fans of director Walerian Borowczyk will quickly recognize his distinct style and themes.THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MISS OSBOURNE is shot well and visually resembles a fever-dream of epic proportions.  The picture purposely has a slight haze around the edges in some scenes, which gives the viewer the feeling of watching a dream.  This is a clever way of creating atmosphere for the film, and it forces the audience to engage with the story.The acting is very good, with Udo Kier playing the lead and Marina Pierro portraying his fiancé.  The pair have a natural chemistry onscreen, which makes the occasion being celebrated in the film more believable.  Likewise, Gerard Zalcberg does an amazing (albeit disturbing) job as Mr. Hyde; I had no problem believing he was the sexually-voracious alter-ego of Kier’s Jekyll.But the story and the bizarre things that occur around it are the big winners here.  So much is going on within the house, it’s sometimes difficult to take it all in.  One of my particular favorite pieces of weirdness occurs when the General looks out the window to try and track down the elusive Mr. Hyde, but winds up shooting the carriage driver by accident.  The General turns to the coach’s owner and simply says, “Misfortune follows misfortune. Madame, I have murdered your chauffeur. My humblest apologies.”  He then moves on like nothing ever happened!  This type of craziness is aloof throughout the film, and it makes for a very interesting 90 minutes.Although it’s not traditional horror, THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MISS OSBOURNE is still a big win for me.  I plan on watching it again soon, simply to see if I missed anything.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXFDZNBFB4OGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SA7UGD6#wasThisHelpful","RXFDZNBFB4OGR","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewWhen discussions about iconic directors of the horror genre arise, several big names should always come up:  Lucio Fulci, George A. Romero, John Carpenter, Dario Argento, and many others…and of course, Mario Bava.  If you are unfamiliar with Bava or his works, you still owe him a great deal of thanks; he is considered by many (and I would wager most) horror aficionados to be the godfather of the slasher film.  He pioneered the Italian ‘giallo’ films, which were basically murder-mysteries that often contained horror elements as well as a nice dose of eroticism.  These giallo films were the precursors to modern-day slashers.  EVIL EYE is one of his earliest giallos, and although it is in black-and-white, it is still a powerful and influential film.I have to confess I didn’t realize EVIL EYE was a giallo until I got the press info for this Blu-ray release.  Because it’s one of the first, it’s rather tame when compared to later giallos.  But that doesn’t mean it’s not good.  Horror fans and thriller watchers both should enjoy this non-colored gem.EVIL EYE is shot well and looks great onscreen, especially when you consider its time period.  Bava's films have a unique cinematic style, in that they use light and shadow exceptionally well, even better than many modern day films.  This aspect is clearly evident in the film, and it heightens both the tension and the terror.The acting is great, with Leticia Roman playing the lead of Nora, and John Saxon portraying her love interest, Dr. Bassi.  Both do a fantastic job, however Valentina Cortese steals the show as Laura Craven-Torrani.  Her performance is both charming and terrifying, the perfect character study for a film like this.The Blu-ray transfer of EVIL EYE looks great, however there are a couple of transitions that cause the picture to ‘wobble’ every now and then.  This is not overly distracting, but it is noticeable.  The picture clarity is excellent, however, and there’s practically no graininess anywhere.  Likewise, the sound is top notch as well.EVIL EYE is a big win for me, and I recommend it to anyone not experienced with Bava’s work.  This is a great film to start your journey with, and it’s a title every horror fan owes it to themselves to own.  The Blu-ray offers two versions:  the U.S. release, which was titled EVIL EYE, and the European version, which was released as THE GIRL WHO KNEW TOO MUCH.  Regardless of which one you watch, you’re sure to appreciate the impact this film had on our much beloved modern horror genre.  This Blu-ray hits store shelves next week, so make a note.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KM7HW3HD1H45/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0SSDME#wasThisHelpful","R1KM7HW3HD1H45","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received a review copy of this book in exchange for an honest reviewThe minute I laid eyes on the title, I knew I had to read this book.  I didn’t know what a ‘heaven maker’ was or why it might be gruesome, but the mystery of these questions drew me in.  I’m very glad I gave this one a shot, too…author Craig Herbertson has a vivid imagination rife with brutal originality and terrifying concepts.  If you’re a fan of short horror fiction, put this book on your Must Own list.I cheated a bit by not reading this book in order.  I don’t suppose it really matters where you begin an anthology, but this time I jumped straight to “The Heaven Maker”, which is toward the middle of the book, and started there.  This story set the whole tone for the book and is a perfect example of the horror found within it.Each story in THE HEAVEN MAKER AND OTHER GRUESOME TALES is written well and flows at a nice, even pace.  I commend on Herbertson for his pacing…some short story writers tend to rush sometimes and try to reach the punchline faster than they should.  Not so here; Herbertson pulls the reader into each story from the beginning and then delivers a sucker punch when it is least expected.One of my favorite stories in this collection is “Gifts”, a rather short tale measuring only a page and half in length.  This one is told from Santa’s perspective one Christmas Eve, however something is different this year…and it might be a very bad kind of different.  The imagery in this story is very vivid, and the twist ending is unnerving to say the least.My sole complaint about THE HEAVEN MAKER AND OTHER GRUESOME TALES is from an editing standpoint.  I ran across numerous typos and errors throughout the book, more so than I think any edited publication should contain, in my opinion.  Granted, this did not detract from my enjoyment of the book, however I feel it worth mentioning.Otherwise, THE HEAVEN MAKER AND OTHER GRUESOME TALES is a big win for me.  This is a solid anthology with some interesting concepts and horrifying realities.  The book is available now in a variety of formats.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSDS7CXJ9P83Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0957453507#wasThisHelpful","RSDS7CXJ9P83Z","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewDirector Jess Franco’s VAMPYROS LESBOS has been dubbed by some as “the Holy Grail of cult cinema.”  I had heard of the film several times over the years, but I never found a copy to give a look.  When I heard Severin Films was remastering the film and releasing it on Blu-ray, I immediately put it on my To Find list.  Thankfully, the fine folks at Severin saw fit to grace me with a review copy, and I’m so glad they did.  This film epitomizes Franco’s legacy of exploitation and Eurotrash flicks.  If you are a fan of these genres, then this film is a must-have for your collection.Before I continue, I have to confirm the title:  yes, it is translated as ‘Lesbian Vampires’.  Not very controversial by today’s standards, but look at the time period in which the film was made.  Homosexuality was not as accepted back then as it is today, therefore the title alone was enough to send people into a fury about this film.VAMPYROS LESBOS is shot fairly well, however you almost have to be an existing fan of Franco’s work to enjoy much of it.  I say this because the film is Franco’s first venture into his own style of cinematography.  There are many odd shots of abstract things which (if you look closely) do fit with the film.  There’s even some symbolism in regard to what he shows onscreen.With that being said, this is not really a horror flick.  It’s meant to be (I think), but there’s no scares and, if I’m being honest, the blood looks horrible, like someone popped a ketchup packet somewhere.  Still, the film is very entertaining and held my attention the entire time.The acting in VAMPYROS LESBOS is so-so, but people don’t generally watch exploitation flicks like this for the performances.  The beautiful and sensuous Soledad Miranda is always welcome onscreen, and she revels in this portrayal of Dracula’s lover.  Ewa Stromberg and the rest of the cast do ok for the most part, however their cardboard characters are part of what makes the film so fun.VAMPYROS LESBOS is a win for me, and I recommend it…however it won’t be a film for everyone.  Connoisseurs of Franco’s work will definitely want to snatch this version up; the HD transfer for the Blu-ray looks amazing, and the sound quality is great as well.  In addition to the high quality picture and sound, this two-disc Special Limited Collector’s Edition includes a variety of Special Features. This film hits store shelves next Tuesday, so make a note.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SJ4A5HHPQNGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VET1GKO#wasThisHelpful","R2SJ4A5HHPQNGD","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewI love horror films that introduce unique villains, especially those who are original enough to become genre icons in their own right (for example, Jason, Michael Myers, Freddy, Jigsaw, etc.)  The films that birth these characters are usually labors of love and not just someone’s attempt to make a quick buck.  THE DROWNSMAN is one such title, an impressive attempt at adding to the prestigious list of iconic horror figures.  And although it has a few flaws, the film is a lot of fun and I recommend giving it a look.I love the concept of the killer and his unique way of dispatching victims; drowning has to be one of the worst ways to die, and using it as the primary way of a killer dispatching his victims is very clever.  This is especially true when combined with the supernatural elements the killer invokes.THE DROWNSMAN is shot very well and looks great onscreen.  The film was shot using a RED camera, so the picture quality is excellent.  Likewise, the ambient sounds are crystal clear in surround-sound, and lend a huge hand in building suspense for the film.The acting in THE DROWNSMAN is pretty good, although a couple of the actresses are a bit lackluster in their deliveries.  Michelle Mylett, who plays the lead, Madison, does a great job and exhibits a wide range of emotional diversity in the film.  Ry Barrett, who portrays The Drownsman himself, is a solid and foreboding figure.  His silent but menacing performance injects a nice shot of terror into the film.But there are a couple of negatives about the THE DROWNSMAN as well.  For one, we are never told how he pulls his disappearing act in the opening scenes, nor are we ever told why or how he has supernatural powers.  There’s not even any speculation as to how this happened.  Another example is how Sebastian is supposedly defeated: with fire.  Really?  I thought water doused fire, therefore how could a supernatural entity like The Drownsman be terrified of it?  And if it pertains to his backstory, shouldn’t we be told about that?Still, with these minor issues aside, THE DROWNSMAN is a heck of a film, and it highlights the talent of director Chad Archibald.  Given the way the movie ends, I sure hope there is a sequel in the works, and I hope it answers the questions above.  If that is the case, THE DROWNSMAN will move up several notches in my book.  I recommend giving this one a look, if anything to check out a new and original horror figure.  The film is available next week in a variety of formats, so make a note.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25N3ZYA4XPUKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UJH1R60#wasThisHelpful","R25N3ZYA4XPUKX","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a review copy of this book in exchange for an honest reviewThey say fiction has nothing on real life, and I believe that statement wholeheartedly.  The news has been chocked full of atrocious and horrifying headlines for years, making it an interesting place of source material for horror books and movies.  One of the most terrifying concepts to me is cults.  When someone is charismatic enough to convince others to carry out the most heinous of acts in the name of some religion, that is truly scary.  This premise is the basis behind WITHIN THESE WALLS, a chilling new book by authoress Ania Ahlborn.  And although the book is not perfect, it’s very close to being so, and it’s one every horror fan should own.I remember hearing about Jonestown when I was a kid, and how everybody “drank the Kool-aid” to commit suicide.  I was stunned that someone could have so much power over a group of people.  This was my first wake-up call to the real world, and it was a harsh one.WITHIN THESE WALLS is written very well and flows smoothly for the most part.  Ahlborn does a skillful job of telling two stories in one: the primary tale is set in modern day Washington state and details Lucas’ plight; the secondary story is set in the 80s and relates what happened to Audra Snow (aka Avis) and how she is connected to Jeffrey Halcomb.  I had no problem switching back and forth, and I enjoyed the pace of each as well.Speaking of the characters, each is fleshed out well and written with a grand dose of realism.  In this book, everybody is damaged and these personal demons help accent the physical ones.  I like how Ahlborn brings both modern day and past-day people into the mix, sharing with the us the generational nuances that are easily recognizable.  This is just one example of her extraordinary talent as a writer.My sole complaint about the book is that it sometimes becomes bogged down with exposition about what every character is thinking.  In most cases, some insight into the thoughts of the characters is fine…however, in this book we get a bit too much of a look inside their heads.  Thankfully, this isn’t a huge detractor, and the plot is enthralling enough to keep the story moving.WITHIN THESE WALLS is a major win for me, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a spine-chilling story that will haunt you after it’s over.  The book is available now in a variety of formats.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTJF828DMVTDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476783748#wasThisHelpful","RTJF828DMVTDV","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewI have to state right up front that this film is one you will either love or hate, and I will wager many people will hate it.  I will explain why later.  For me, though, I liked it for the most part.  I never get tired of seeing Debbie Rochon onscreen, even in low-budget indies like this one.  And although the storyline is simplistic, it’s still a lot of fun (if you look past the flaws).  Granted, there are many things about the film that could have been better…but everything about it overall works for me on a base level.I should probably also state this is one of those films that is so bad, it’s good.  This statement alone will explain a lot about why I like it so much.AXE TO GRIND looks like it was shot on home video cameras for the most part, and therefore does not have a lot of cinematic value.  The lighting is decent for the most part, although there are a couple of darkened shots that could have been lit better.  The sound, thankfully, is good, so we don’t have any problems hearing the dialogue.The acting is about what you would expect from a B-movie.  I love Debbie Rochon, so she always entertains me, regardless of her role.  Another noteworthy performance is given by Michelle Tomlinson, who plays fellow scream-queen Cheryl.  I first saw Tomlinson back in 2011, in a lesser-known film I reviewed for Hayes Hudson’s House of Horror titled BRAIN DEAD.  She impressed me then, and continues to impress me now.  The rest of the cast, however, is a take-them-or-leave-them group.  Nobody really gives a horrible performance…yet, I don’t think anyone in the cast will win any awards for their acting anytime soon, either.The special effects are ok, however I absolutely hate CG blood-splatters.  The several we see in AXE TO GRIND are poorly done, and therefore come across as cartoonish.  I understand CG is a cost-saving tool, however gore cannot be a secondary aspect in a horror film and should always be given its due.Yet, even with all of its flaws, there’s something satisfactory about seeing Rochon dole out her vengeance on a group of clueless scream-queens who have slept with her husband.  She even takes out the director and his cohorts (although I never quite caught on as to why…maybe her character is just that demented!).  My sole (major) complaint about the film is that I didn’t understand the ending.  I don’t really know what her big ‘performance’ was or even who the creepy caretaker was supposed to be.I can’t honestly recommend AXE TO GRIND, unless you’re a big fan of B-movies or Debbie Rochon.  And even then, you have to give this one a lot of leeway.  If you can do that, however, you’ll be in for a minor treat.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BH69V3VMTYWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PCKG1QU#wasThisHelpful","R2BH69V3VMTYWV","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received a review copy of this show in exchange for an honest reviewI have to confess up front I’ve been collecting Yu-Gi-Oh! cards for several years now.  I don’t play the game, but I am drawn to the cards because of the imaginative characters and creatures, as well as the impressive artwork.  I’ve never watched any of the Yu-Gi-Oh! TV series before either, but I’ve been meaning to; for some reason, I’ve always had something else to watch instead.  So when the fine folks at Cinedigm sent the press release for a recent Yu-Gi-Oh! series titled Zexal, I jumped at the chance to watch it.  I’m glad I did, too.  YU-GI-OH!: ZEXAL is a fun anime series that will appeal to both young and old.After watching Zexal, I think I might have to try my hand at actually playing the game.  From what I’ve been told, I’ve amassed some pretty powerful cards, so I might be a formidable opponent someday.  And if the game is half as fun as this show, then I’m in for a real treat!YU-GI-OH!: ZEXAL is both vivid and intense, a cartoon series that is just as serious as it is campy.  The characters are larger than life, particularly Yuma, who can’t decide if he’s a man in a boy’s body or a just a wannabe duelist who is trying to tread water in a sea of talented card-slingers.  Yuma’s over-the-top antics are half of what make this show fun, although some of his inner dialogue can be painful at times.The show itself looks great, with well drawn monsters straight from the game cards.  I like the diversity of the cards/creatures used, as it really opens the eyes to those not initiated with the actual game.  Likewise, the newer monsters are powerful and cool, welcome additions to an already impressive canon of beasties.YU-GI-OH!: ZEXAL is a win for me, and fans of Saturday morning anime cartoons should love it.  The 3-disc set of season one is packaged in a nice, albeit plain, box case, so it should look nice on any collector’s shelf.  The series hits stores tomorrow, so make a note.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI6M12U2RECFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPN7DY4#wasThisHelpful","RI6M12U2RECFS","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewAs a self-proclaimed H. P. Lovecraft devotee, I try to snatch up every film adaptation I can of his works.  I have not personally read everything he has written, however I can state with a smug smile I have read much of it.  Therefore, every time a filmmaker tries to adapt his work, I have to check it out to see how well it follows the actual story, and also to see if the filmmaker does the story justice.  I’m very happy to report director Tom Gliserman’s adaptation of THE THING ON THE DOORSTEP is a fairly accurate and engaging film that horror fans should enjoy.This is a low-budget film, so don’t expect a Michael Bay-sized production, but the filmmakers do a great job utilizing the money they have.  The film is a true testament to what heart and determination can bring forth when funds are low.THE THING ON THE DOORSTEP looks decent onscreen, although the cinematography is lacking a bit and the picture quality looks cheap.  The scene gets very grainy when light levels are low, which sometimes becomes too much for the story to overcome.  If better lighting had been used or even a better lens, the results would have been drastically better.  Still, the sound quality is solid, so that makes up for a lot.The acting is pretty good, too, especially for a low-budget film.  The cast is pretty solid overall, particularly David Bunce, who plays Daniel.  Bunce has several credits on his IMDB page, however I am not familiar with any of them.  Regardless, he does a good job here, and I hope to see him in future projects.The special effects are average, but they don’t play too much of a role here.  THE THING ON THE DOORSTEP prides itself on suspense and intrigue over splatter-shock or gore.  And it works.  The mystery of what Edward is going through carries the story, and the result is an enthralling thriller that you won’t want to miss.I have to hand it to director Gliserman:  he does a good job with this adaptation.  Sure, there are little differences, such as the movie-Daniel naming his son William, after Edward’s father, whereas in the actual story, he’s named Edward…but these are minor nuances that don’t affect the end result.  My sole complaint about the story is that it is set in modern times, when it would have been so much more effective to set it in its proper time period (back in the early 1900s).  This is nothing that detracts from the film itself, but more of a personal preference.THE THING ON THE DOORSTEP is a big win for me, and I suggest horror fans check it out.  If you are not familiar with Lovecraft’s work, you should read the short story before seeing the film; it might help shape your perception for what you are about to watch.  THE THING ON THE DOORSTEP is available now in a variety of formats.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTQSG37P5B2RC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NARLV44#wasThisHelpful","RTQSG37P5B2RC","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received a review copy of this book in exchange for an honest reviewA couple of years ago, I had the distinct pleasure of reviewing a book by Kristopher Rufty titled THE LURKERS.  I am a HUGE fan of creature-features in both books and movies, so this was obviously a must-read for me.  I loved that book, and I’m excited to report the story continues on in THE LURKING SEASON, the followup that was recently published by Samhain Horror.Samhain just keeps getting it right when it comes to horror.  I have yet to read one of their books that I did not enjoy.  I hope this trend continues, as they are a powerhouse in horror in my book (pardon the pun).THE LURKING SEASON picks up a short while after the end of the first book but forges forward with a new storyline. Like its predecessor, this book is written very well and flows at a nice, even pace.  Rufty once again weaves a thrilling tale of terror rife with intensity and scares.  I am very impressed with his ability to keep his creatures scary; though the characters and story might change, his Haunchies are still vicious and bloodthirsty.And speaking of characters, there are several new ones we get to meet right from the start.  Each is fleshed out well, with individual backstories and unique characteristics.  But we also get a couple of familiar faces as well.  I will not divulge too much information and tell you who they are, because some of these reveals are integral to the story.In regard to the story, this book brings a new aspect of the Haunchies to light.  Again, I won’t say too much, but I can tell you there’s a bigger plan brewing than what was previously brought to light in the first book.  I really enjoy where Rufty goes with THE LURKING SEASON, and I hope this series turns out to be a trilogy.  I can’t seem to get enough of the Haunchies and their bloodthirsty ways!THE LURKING SEASON is another feather in the cap of author Kristopher Rufty, and I highly recommend giving it a read.  Chocked full of good ol’ gory horror, this is one book that every fan of the genre should own.  It is available now in a variety of formats.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RYXXJW1XS6FN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161922772X#wasThisHelpful","R2RYXXJW1XS6FN","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewIn my opinion, THE RAID is one of the greatest action films ever.  There’s a lot to like about it, including the writing and the action.  So when I heard the producers of THE RAID were making another film, I put it on my Must Watch list before I even knew what it was about.  Surprisingly, the film turned out to be KILLERS, a thriller about two men in different parts of the world who share an urge to kill.  And just as I had hoped, the film delivers on every level.I love the premise of KILLERS.  It’s about time we got a movie about “dueling psychopaths.”  But the movie is much more than just two murderers comparing notes.  It’s a look into the existence of two very different individuals who are damaged and trying to make their way in the world.KILLERS is shot well and looks great from a production standpoint.  I love the drastic difference in tone between the two locations.  The Japanese locales are full of vibrancy and life, while the Jakarta locations are more industrial and grim.  This contrast is reversed when looking at the characters.  Nomura is a dark individual, a loner who exists almost in the shadows; Bayu, on the other hand, is a family man and has brightness in his life because of them.The acting in the film is very good.  I am particularly impressed with both of the leads; they do an phenomenal job of bringing their characters to life.  I would even go so far as to say the acting is a big part of what makes the movie so effective.The special effects are great as well.  Gore-hounds will be happy to hear there are several scenes of some nice carnage.  My particular favorite is when Nomura stabs a pimp in the chin during an altercation in a club bathroom.  It takes the guy a while to die, but the crimson fountain that erupts is truly impressive.I give KILLERS a major thumbs up, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a slick thriller.  My sole complaint about the film is its running time.  It clocks in at 2 hours 17 minutes; in my opinion, they could have wrapped it up in just under 2 hours.  But this isn’t a big detraction, just more of a personal preference.KILLERS is available now in a variety of formats.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15D095U75HYWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SJ9UBZI#wasThisHelpful","R15D095U75HYWS","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest reviewOver the years, I’ve grown almost bored with horror movies about asylums and hospitals.  This is primarily because there are SO MANY of them on the market now.  Granted, these are great locations in which to set a horror film…but there’s an over-saturation point that should not be passed, and this one was reached a long time ago.  So when the fine folks at After Dark sent the press release for BEDLAM, I was very skeptical.  Could they actually find a way to make an asylum scary again?  I decided to give it a shot, just in case.As the credits rolled, I sat for a few moments and pondered on what I had just seen.  Was the movie scary?  Not really.  But was it entertaining?  Yes, I have to say so for the most part.  It’s not what I was expecting, but I did enjoy it overall nonetheless.I love the cover art from the DVD.  The image doesn’t have much to do with the film itself, but it definitely does its job and sparks interest.  Thankfully, it’s not too far from events in the movie, so it’s not terribly misleading.  I can’t stand it when a movie poster or media cover art has nothing to do with the film its promoting.BEDLAM is shot well and looks good from a production standpoint.  The location chosen for the asylum is perfect, a building filled with tight corridors, dark recesses, and cramped quarters.  Likewise, the setting feels very aged, which fits perfectly with the theme of the story.The acting is very good, with Guy Edmonds heading up a great cast.  Edmonds gives a believable performance as George, the man who inherited madness from his mother.  Supporting him are John Boxer and Greg Hatton, who portray the two orderlies who torments George behind closed doors, as well as Gary Boulter and Cassandra Swaby, who play George’s fellow inmates.  The whole cast does a great job with their roles.The storyline in BEDLAM is interesting and riveting, however it pretty much as no horror value at all.  I would classify this more as a drama (maybe a thriller) but not a horror film.  I’m not saying this is a bad thing at all; but if you watch this movie, you need to know what to expect.BEDLAM is a win for me, and I do recommend it.  The film is a gripping trek into a madness-filled mind, and it will take you on a journey you won’t forget.  The film is available now, so give it a look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BKH6AGOJXITJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOGGDUW#wasThisHelpful","R2BKH6AGOJXITJ","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ECHOES is one of those curious films that I have a hard time defining.  It’s part horror, part thriller, part mystery, and even part informative semi-documentary.  And yes, it’s entertaining for the most part to boot.  But with that being said, it’s not as enthralling as I wanted it to be.  From the hype I had heard about it, I was honestly expecting more.  Still, I do recommend it, although it’s less horror and more of a thriller.I have to commend director Nils Timm for what has been accomplished with this debut.  From a production standpoint, the film looks great.  The cinematography is tight, the acting is top notch, and the film overall is well made.  The only lagging piece is the story.  Granted, it’s written well, but there’s just something missing from it.As I mentioned, ECHOES is shot well and is visually beautiful onscreen.  The desert scenery is amazing, and it really captures the desolate and lonely atmosphere the film is trying to portray.Also, the acting is great, too, with Kate French and Steven Brand in the lead roles.  I’ve watched both actors in prior works, and I have been impressed with everything I’ve seen.  The supporting cast (as small as it is) does a fine job as well.The story in ECHOES, however, just didn’t excite me that much.  It had a couple of interesting portions, but I found it predictable and saw the ‘big reveal’ coming from far off.  Don’t get me wrong:  it is well paced and fleshed out for the most part…but it’s just lacking something, a specific spark of major interest.Although I have reservations about the storyline, I still recommend ECHOES.  It is a slow-burn thriller that does keep you entertained, even if you can see what’s coming from the start.  And I do hope to see more from director Nils Timm in the future.  ECHOES is available now in a variety of formats.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MHT3E1SMLMVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STPQ7SM#wasThisHelpful","R1MHT3E1SMLMVX","AAPT0IT4F8ABH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPT0IT4F8ABH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like all other edible mushrooms, reishi mushrooms prevent cancer, prevent cardiovascular problems, and boost our immune health.  However, reishi mushrooms are unique among edible mushrooms in that they contain steroid-like substances which boost our muscle strength and bone health.  Don't doubt the wisdom of the Chinese people in selecting this mushroom above all other mushrooms more than 2,000 years ago.Worldwide, dozens of varieties of reishi mushrooms exist.  The healthiest one is the red reishi and the more bitter it tastes, the more likely that it contains the beneficial compounds most abundantly.  The red reishi mushroom powder in this product has a noticeably bitter/metallic taste, which indicates to me that it is genuine and quite healthy for us.  I add boiling hot water to this product and after it cools off, I drink it as is about half the time and sweeten it about half the time with delicious aspartame (with no acesulfame potassium added to it).  This product is only about half as bitter as olive leaf powder and only about one-fourth as bitter as globe artichoke powder, both of which are extremely healthy for us to consume too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IOOXHYOF0YJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EKQ0IVQ#wasThisHelpful","R2IOOXHYOF0YJQ","A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In order to enjoy the extremely powerful health benefits of consuming the phytochemicals from olive trees, we need to choose one of the following strategies:(1)Immediately throw away all vegetable oils in our homes and buy only extra virgin olive oil from now on and consume it regularly together with our favorite foods.(2)Buy whole dried olive leaves, throw away the bad ones, and eat just the good ones.[Unfortunately, whole dried olive leaves are somewhat tough and don't taste that good].(3)Buy chopped dried olive leaves and pour boiling hot water over them to make olive leaf tea.[Unfortunately, olive leaf tea doesn't taste that good and needs to be sweetened].(4)Buy this product, olive leaf powder, and pour boiling hot water over it.[I sweeten my olive leaf powder drink with aspartame that doesn't have any acesulfame potassium added to it].(5)Buy raw unbrined/unsalted olive fruits regularly and eat them.[Unfortunately, raw olive fruits taste somewhat bitter].Conclusion:  Don't worry about the warning from the State of California about this product containing too much lead.

"This product is a very bad choice because it keeps moving around.  Even after fastened extremely tightly to try to prevent it from moving around, it will still move around severely and become like a thigh pad used by a person playing tackle football.  I've even tried using this product upside down and, believe it or not, that helped slightly but it still moved around way too much.This product is definitely not usable for people who need to crawl forward or backward while staying on their knees.However, for people who never walk forward or backward while staying on their knees - people who go down on their knees and then stand up and then go back down on their knees and then stand up - this product can just barely be used but with great difficulty.  The only advantage of this product is the luxurious cushion.  However, the small initial pleasure from the excessive cushioning is more than offset by the powerful displeasure of constantly worrying that it will move around by itself and transform into a thigh pad or shin pad.Conclusion:  This product is borderline fraudulent.  It should be discontinued.  Avoid all Troxell products.  Their claim, ""So Comfortable You'll Forget You're Wearing Them!"" is an outright lie.  At $22.06 (with free shipping), this product is priced way too high compared to cheaper, better knee pads such as Fiskars Ultra Light Knee Pads, which are priced at $9.95 (with free shipping).  The Fiskars Ultra Light Knee Pads won't move around while the person is crawling forward or backward while staying on their knees but the cushioning is less luxurious and less comfortable than this Troxell product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZXOO9D3YRV7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ND0CFW#wasThisHelpful","R1ZXOO9D3YRV7T","A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product is slightly less delicious than yellow corn but these yellow peas are quite delicious - delicious enough.  Both yellow corn and yellow peas are high in the carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, which have been shown to greatly benefit eye health in humans.  By contrast, green peas are high in several forms of lutein but do not contain any zeaxanthin.  Both green peas and yellow peas are much healthier for us to eat than yellow corn, which is slightly healthier for us to eat than white corn because yellow corn is much higher in carotenoids than white corn.  The main reason that peas are much healthier for us to eat than corn is that both green peas and yellow peas are legumes.  Real populations of real people who eat any species of legumes have been shown to be much, much healthier than people who don't eat any legumes.  The 2nd reason is that peas are much less likely to contain cancer-causing mycotoxins (such as aflatoxins, fumonisins, ochratoxins, zearalenone, patulin, citrinin, ergot alkaloids, and tricothecenes) from pathogenic molds (such as Aspergillus and Fusarium) than corn.  When compared against green peas, yellow peas taste quite different - yellow peas have a more fruity, ripened taste than green peas.  Also, green peas tend to always be infected by fungi called, white mildew (white spots), but yellow peas tend not to have this problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OQNK7SQQS3CC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VLVK4E#wasThisHelpful","R3OQNK7SQQS3CC","A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The fact that this product is organic is a disadvantage, in my opinion, because the scientific evidence appears to indicate that the ""natural"" chemicals used by organic farmers (such as rotenone, pyrethroids, copper sulfate, and cow manure) are worse for human health than the man-made chemicals used by conventional farmers (such as organophosphates, glyphosate, and 10-20-20).  Also, organically farmed plant-source foods have been shown to carry a higher risk of contamination by pathogenic E. coli, pathogenic Salmonella, pathogenic Shigella, and cancer-causing mycotoxins than conventionally farmed plant-source foods.  [Organic farmers tend to tolerate greater insect damage to their crops and this directly causes higher levels of mycotoxins from pathogenic molds].

"Toasting definitely makes this product does taste a little more delicious than - and a little more like genuine, creamy, liquid peanut butter than - Bob's Red Mill Organic Soy Flour after boiling hot water is added.  Unfortunately, toasting also reduces the health benefits by creating harmful byproducts of high-temperature combustion, including trans fatty acids, dietary advanced glycation endproducts, dietary advanced lipoxidation endproducts, and possibly also some nitrosamines, heterocyclic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, alkanals, and alkenals.  Toasting temperatures (175 to 230 degrees Celsius) are very similar to frying temperatures (180 to 250 degrees Celsius) and are much higher than canning temperatures (130 degrees Celsius), which are somewhat higher than the extremely healthful practice of cooking foods at the boiling temperature of water (exactly 100 degrees Celsius).The fact that this product is not organic is an advantage, in my opinion, because the scientific evidence appears to indicate that the ""natural"" chemicals used by organic farmers (such as rotenone, pyrethroids, copper sulfate, and cow manure) are worse for human health than the man-made chemicals used by conventional farmers (such as organophosphates, glyphosate, and 10-20-20).

The soybeans used during the manufacture of this product are cold pressed to squeeze away slightly more than half of the soybean oil.  No hexane or other toxic solvents are used to separate the soybean oil from this product.  By contrast, the neurotoxin, hexane, is used during the separation of the the soybean oil away from Bob's Red Mill TVP (textured vegetable protein).Conclusion:  Eating this product regularly will help us to live much, much longer.

"There's nothing wrong with the quality of these Mushroom House brand dried shiitakes.  Just pour boiling hot water on to them and in a few minutes, they can be eaten deliciously.  The vast majority of these Mushroom House brand shiitake stems do not have a black-colored bottom, which would indicate rotting (decomposition) if they did.Keep in mind that although all mushrooms contain vitamin D1, vitamin D2, and vitamin D4, shiitake mushrooms are an especially reliable source of vitamin D4.  Vitamin D4 has health benefits that vitamin D1, vitamin D2, and vitamin D3 (plentiful in wild ocean fish and in sheep's skin) lack.  For example, some medical doctors prescribe vitamin D4 pills to increase the blood levels of calcium in their patients.  Thus, people who suffer from osteoporosis might benefit greatly from consuming shiitake mushrooms (and also the delicious, fermented, Japanese soybean food called, natto, which is a rich source of vitamin K2/MK-7, vitamin K2/MK-8, vitamin PQQ, vitamin C, nattokinase [subtilisin], scyllo-inositol, soy isoflavones, and the extremely beneficial probiotic bacterium, Bacillus subtilis natto).Also, both shiitakes mushrooms and natto are very beneficial against pathogenic fungi (mycotoxin-producing molds) which very frequently get into our bodies from plant-source foods.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F1JGFSBF0RNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RAM51I#wasThisHelpful","R3F1JGFSBF0RNE","A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Scientific studies say that SelenoExcell (Selenium as High Selenium Yeast) works just as well - no better and no worse - as sodium selenite capsules at slightly improving our overall health.  Therefore, shop around for the better price.Zinc, selenium, and iodine are the 3 beneficial antioxidant minerals.  Iron, copper, manganese, and aluminum are the 4 pro-oxidants (very dangerous if consumed in excess).  Arsenic, lead, cadmium, mercury, and barium are the 5 toxic heavy metals.  Beryllium (toxic lightweight metal) and radioactive isotopes would also be detrimental to our health if consumed in excess (for example, Brazil nuts contain a very small amount of radioactive radium).In addition, plant-source foods very frequently contain the following mycotoxins, which are even more dangerous to our health than any of the above-mentioned toxic metals:aflatoxins, fumonisins, ochratoxins, zearalenone, patulin, citrinin, viomellein, sterigmatocystin, A. fumigatus gliotoxin, cyclochlorotine, luteoskyrin and rugulosin, P. jirovecii, C. immitis and C. posadasii, B. dermatitidis, C. gattii VGIIc, phomopsins, tremorgens (penitrems and roquefortines), ergot alkaloids (clavines, ergopeptines, and lysergic acid amides), type A trichothecenes (T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, Stachybotrys satratoxins, and diacetoxyscirpenol), and type B trichothecenes (nivalenol, deoxynivalenol, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol).Many other mycotoxins, including slaframine, moniliformin, sporidesmin [facial eczema], and Neotyphodium fungal endosymbiont toxins, will only afflict plant-eating farm animals.Scientific studies also say that the healthiest selenium compounds are manufactured by plants such as garlic, onions, green onions, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, red radishes, giant white turnips (daikon), soybeans, and mushrooms.  These plant-source organic selenium compounds are much more complex and very different from SelenoExcell's yeast-bound selenium.  Unfortunately, farmers usually do not enrich their soils with added selenium because it just wastes their money and doesn't make their crops grow any better.Brazil nuts (highest), skipjack tuna [Chunk Light Tuna](2nd highest), other wild ocean fish (3rd highest), wheat germ, and shiitake mushrooms are the 5 foods that contain the most selenium.  Of the 3 beneficial antioxidant minerals (zinc, selenium, and iodine), only selenium can bind to mercury and remove it from our bodies.Don't forget:  Radioactive radon gas, which sneaks into our homes from underground, kills millions of people every year by shooting deadly alpha particles at our lungs and causing lung cancer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AZKDZD25T1ZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014B8GCI#wasThisHelpful","R2AZKDZD25T1ZD","A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Organic versus non-organic:(1)Organic ground flaxseeds should not have herbicide residues, assuming that the product is really organic.  The weeds are manually or mechanically removed or smothered before the organic flaxseeds are planted.  Herbicide residues tend to be potentially more damaging to our health than pesticide residues or fungicide residues.(2)Non-organic ground flaxseeds have fungicide residues, which means that the farmer has probably done a better job of minimizing the cancer-causing mycotoxins that grow on flaxseeds.  I consider this an advantage of the non-organic ground flaxseeds.  The organic farmer is prohibited from using fungicides.(3)Non-organic ground flaxseeds are slightly cheaper than an equal amount of organic ground flaxseeds.CONCLUSION:  Organic is better on herbicide residues but non-organic is better on mycotoxins and on price.  These 2 products are competitive.Golden versus brown:(1)Golden ground flaxseeds taste slightly more delicious than brown ground flaxseeds.(2)Brown ground flaxseeds contain slightly more lignans than an equal amount of golden ground flaxseeds.(3)Brown ground flaxseeds have a slightly better (higher) omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid ratio than golden ground flaxseeds, probably because they tend to be grown farther up north in colder temperatures.(4)Brown ground flaxseeds are slightly cheaper than an equal amount of golden ground flaxseeds.CONCLUSION:  Golden is slightly better on taste but brown is slightly better on lignan content and on price.  Because ground flaxseeds contain much, much more lignans than humans need to derive the full health benefit from eating lignans, lignan content isn't really an important issue between these 2 varieties of flaxseeds.  Also, because the human body can convert only about 5% of the alpha-linolenic acid (LNA) into eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and only about 0.1% of the alpha-linolenic acid (LNA) into docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the omega-3 to omega-6 ratio is only a minor issue for me, especially since I swallow plenty of Double Strength Fish Oil softgels every day and also because virgin omega-6 oils have been shown in scientific studies to cause and worsen cancers in animals but not in humans.  Therefore, I lean slightly in favor of buying the golden flaxseeds despite their slightly higher cost.Note:  The vast majority of all brown flaxseeds are grown by our neighbors up in Canada (mostly Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba) but the vast majority of all golden flaxseeds are grown in North Dakota with much smaller amounts grown in South Dakota, Minnesota, and Montana.THE BIG PICTURE:  Ground flaxseeds are probably the healthiest seeds that we can eat.  Only chia seeds, mustard seeds (stings the mouth like raw garlic), and fenugreek seeds (a legume; all legumes cause flatulence) can match or exceed the health benefits of eating flaxseeds.  All other seeds and all nuts are less healthy for us to eat than ground flaxseeds.  Only allium vegetables (onions, green onions, or garlic), cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, red radishes, giant white turnips, turnip greens, collard greens, mustard greens, watercress, or Chinese cabbages), legumes (especially foods made from soybeans), mushrooms (especially shiitake mushrooms), seafoods (especially salt-free boiled fish, oysters, and seaweeds), soluble fiber foods (especially shirataki noodles or psyllium husk powder), probiotic foods (especially fat-free yogurt, probiotic capsules, or natto), and healthy teas (green tea, white tea, rooibos tea, honeybush tea, or olive leaf tea) can match or exceed the health benefits of eating ground flaxseeds.Update:  I downgraded this Bob's Red Mill product from 5 stars to only 4 stars because Amazon has suddenly more than doubled its price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XD11UVG5YY80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VLV91S#wasThisHelpful","R2XD11UVG5YY80","A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product contains only 666mg of glucomannan soluble fiber per capsule, not 2,000mg per capsule as some of us might be misled by Pure Naturals into expecting.  However, the quality of the glucomannan contained in each capsule is excellent.Other ingredients:  cellulose, silicon dioxide, vegetable stearate.It's unfortunate that when glucomannan is purchased in capsule form, it must contain these fillers.  When glucomannan is purchased as a food (shirataki noodles or konnyaku blocks), it does not contain these fillers and tastes much better.  Psyllium husk capsules don't contain any fillers.Of the 2 extremely healthy types of soluble fiber, namely, psyllium and glucomannan, which is healthier for us to swallow?Psyllium capsules are slightly safer to swallow than glucomannan capsules because psyllium capsules are less likely to solidify into an obstruction somewhere in our digestive tract.Psyllium is also slightly better than glucomannan for treating constipation because mucilage soluble fiber (psyllium) has a lower viscosity (is thinner) than glucomannan soluble fiber and therefore can melt away those hardened stools faster.However, for losing weight, glucomannan is slightly better than psyllium becuase glucomannan can be made into a very filling, delicious noodle dish which will quench our appetite.Also, glucomannan capsules are slightly better than psyllium capsules for weight loss because glucomannan soluble fiber has a higher viscosity (is thicker) than mucilage soluble fiber (psyllium) and therefore glucomannan is less likely to cause diarrhea than psyllium.  Diarrhea always washes away the weight loss-causing good bacteria and strengthens the weight gain-causing, cancer-causing bad bacteria.Although glucomannan capsules can cause intestinal blockages if swallowed with insufficient water, there is absolutely zero risk of intestinal obstructions if glucomannan soluble fiber is consumed the way the Japanese in Japan consume it every day, namely, as shirataki noodles (zero calories), konnyaku blocks (zero calories), or sukiyaki (extremely delicious).The big picture is that both psyllium and glucomannan will prevent constipation, heart disease, cancer, obesity, and a dozen other killer diseases.Both psyllium and glucomannan will feed the good bacteria and dramatically increase their numbers.Both psyllium and glucomannan will partly block the absorption of calories from fats and sugars because they are both forms of soluble fiber.[Also, foods that are high in phytate such as wheat bran, ground flaxseeds, chia seeds, fenugreek seeds, natto, edamame, green peas, green beans, and almonds will partly block the absorption of calories from starch and protein.  Phytate will also slightly reduce the severity of flatulence.  Phytate will also partly block the absorption of toxic heavy metals including arsenic, lead, mercury, cadmium, and barium.  Phytate will also partly block the absorption of iron, which like copper, manganese, and aluminum, is a pro-oxidant which, if consumed in excess, will damage every cell in our bodies.  On the downside, phytate will partly block the absorption of zinc, which like selenium and iodine, is a beneficial antioxidant].","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LHVYY7SVE2D1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQLGI3Q#wasThisHelpful","R1LHVYY7SVE2D1","A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Biologists place both ginger and turmeric under Order Zingiberales, Family Zingiberaceae.  These 2 plants manufacture very similar phytochemicals.  The scientific studies involving turmeric (Curcuma longa) outnumber the scientific studies involving ginger (Zingiber officinale) by better than tenfold.  The purported medicinal uses of turmeric greatly outnumber the purported medicinal uses of ginger.  The supermarkets only sell ginger because ginger roots are somewhat more delicious and somewhat more attractive than turmeric roots.Ginger works much better than turmeric for reducing the severity of flatulence.Try this test:  Eat a certain large quantity of legumes such as whole soybeans, whole green peas, whole chickpeas (garbanzo beans), whole black beans, whole navy beans, whole kidney beans, whole pinto beans, whole lima beans, whole great northern beans, whole lentils, or any other whole starchy legume.  Measure the amount of flatulence caused when ginger was not consumed together with the beans.  Then retry the same experiment with plenty of ginger, say, at least 10 capsules.  The severity of flatulence should be substantially less when lots of ginger was added to the beans.Turmeric works slightly better than ginger for (1)preventing and treating metabolic syndrome (causing weight loss, preventing and treating diabetes and insulin resistance, improving cholesterol and triglyceride numbers, lowering high blood pressure, and reducing markers of inflammation),(2)protecting the inner lining of the entire human digestive tract from free radicals, and (3)partly blocking the formation of cancer-causing nitrosamines in the human mouth, throat, esophagus, and stomach.  Turmeric has been shown to be effective at partly blocking nitrosation - the formation of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) such as nitrosamines.Turmeric capsules are easier to chew in our mouth than ginger capsules.  In fact, many brands of turmeric capsules are moderately delicious.  All turmeric products come from India.  This product, Nature's Way Ginger Root, is of such high quality that if chewed in our mouth, the sting from the beneficial phytochemicals in the ginger may be too potent for most people to tolerate and may cause most of us to cough.It's perfectly OK to swallow both ginger capsules and turmeric capsules at the same time.  In humans, turmeric is absorbed very poorly so it's unlikely that turmeric can protect where our blood goes.  Experiments with animals, however, show turmeric being absorbed very well and delivering spectacular health benefits.DISADVANTAGE OF GINGER:  Ginger is always higher in the cancer-causing mycotoxin, ochratoxin A, than any other plant.  Strangely enough, eating Equal (aspartame) at the same time as eating ginger will almost completely block the cancer-causing effect of ochratoxin A in ginger and coffee.  People trying to lose weight and people trying to reduce flatulence should add 2 packets of Equal (aspartame) to their ""ginger tea,"" which can be made by pouring boiling hot water over 2 capsules of ginger to make 1 pint (2 cups) of ginger tea.  Splenda (sucralose) is completely harmless but will not block ochratoxin A.  Equal (aspartame) will block ochratoxin A extremely well but will not block any other mycotoxin.Other mycotoxins that have greatly harmed humans include:aflatoxins, fumonisins, other ochratoxins, zearalenone, patulin, citrinin, viomellein, sterigmatocystin, A. fumigatus gliotoxin, cyclochlorotine, luteoskyrin and rugulosin, P. jirovecii, C. immitis and C. posadasii, B. dermatitidis, C. gattii VGIIc, phomopsins, tremorgens (penitrems and roquefortines), ergot alkaloids (clavines, ergopeptines, and lysergic acid amides), type A trichothecenes (T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, Stachybotrys satratoxins, and diacetoxyscirpenol), and type B trichothecenes (nivalenol, deoxynivalenol, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol).Many other mycotoxins, including slaframine, moniliformin, sporidesmin [facial eczema], and Neotyphodium fungal endosymbiont toxins, will only afflict plant-eating farm animals.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38WZLJSE7T94E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00014EECK#wasThisHelpful","R38WZLJSE7T94E","A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For both dried shiitake mushrooms and dried chanterelle mushrooms:Shiitakes and chanterelles never have white worms, which are a major problem with porcini mushrooms.Shiitakes and chanterelles never have horse manure, which is a major problem with white button mushrooms.For dried shiitake mushrooms:Shiitakes are the most delicious of all mushrooms.  Many people have described shiitakes as having a ""rich, earthy"" taste.Shiitakes have extremely strong health benefits, especially in the area of cancer prevention in humans.Shiitakes are one of the best-selling mushrooms.Shiitakes are one of the most economical mushrooms:The lowest grade (standard grade) of dried shiitakes costs about $50 for 5 pounds, or $10 per pound.[For comparison, maitakes, the other delicious-tasting medicinal mushroom with a Japanese name, costs about $20 per pound.Therefore, the only dried mushrooms that are priced cheaper than dried shiitakes are the extremely horrible-tasting woodear black fungus mushrooms from China, which costs only $7 per pound].For dried chanterelle mushrooms:Chanterelles are moderately delicious but not quite as delicious as shiitakes.Unlike porcini mushrooms, which taste like beef gravy, chanterelles have been described as having a mildly peppery taste and a fruity smell like apricots.This dried chanterelle product does indeed have a fruity smell before rehydration but after rehydration, the peppery taste is completely missing.Like all other mushrooms, chanterelles taste substantially more delicious after rehydration than before rehydration.  However, if mushrooms had to be eaten without rehydration, then chanterelles would be the best choice of all mushrooms for that purpose.Like all edible mushrooms, chanterelles offer substantial health benefits.Chanterelles are not one of the best-selling mushrooms.  Very few dealers sell chanterelles at Amazon.Chanterelles are much more expensive than shiitakes:Dried chanterelles can be purchased for about $50 per pound.[I purchased 1 ounce of this product for $4.57 plus shipping from Amazon.  Although they lacked the mildly peppery taste which is very common with chanterelles, there was nothing wrong with the quality of the chanterelles that I received].Conclusion:Chanterelles are an excellent choice for wealthy people who want to experience eating a wide variety of mushrooms, all of which have different, extremely beneficial mycochemicals.However, shiitakes are a much better choice for the vast majority of people because of their low cost, extremely delicious taste, and powerful health benefits.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GMUVAY1C3YEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BAC6F38#wasThisHelpful","R1GMUVAY1C3YEM","A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disadvantages of eating prunes:(1)Prunes and other dried fruits, if eaten in excess, will cause flatulence.(2)Prunes are extremely high in fructose and other sugars.  Scientific studies say that consuming too much fructose will increase our risk developing diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, non-alcoholic liver disease, hypertriglyceridemia, and all cancers but especially pancreatic cancer.(3)Prunes are extremely high in calories.(4)Prunes are higher in pesticide residues than most other fruits and vegetables.(5)Prunes contain substantial quantities of the neurotoxin, acrylamide, which forms in all dried fruits (especially in prunes and in pears) during the drying process with hot air.(6)Prunes contain substantial quantities of the cancer-causing growth hormone, IGF-1.Advantages of eating prunes:(1)According to scientific studies, prunes will slightly increase bone density and slightly increase muscle mass in humans.  The growth hormone, IGF-1, may very likely be the cause.(2)Prunes will prevent and treat constipation very effectively because prunes contain several phytochemicals that exert a laxative effect.  These beneficial phytochemicals include soluble fiber, sorbitol (a sugar alcohol), and.......................................................(3)Prunes are extremely delicious.(4)Prunes never contain cancer-causing nitrosamines, which are frequently a problem with dried meats, dried fish, dried spices, and dried vegetables.(5)Prunes almost never contain cancer-causing mycotoxins (such as aflatoxin B1, fuminosin B1, ochratoxin A, zearalenone, tremorgens, patulin, ergot, and others), which are frequently a problem with dried whole grains, various seeds, peanuts, pistachios, Brazil nuts, and to a lesser degree, all other nuts.(6)Prunes are rich in the purple-colored antioxidants called, anthocyanins, which give prunes a relatively high ORAC antioxidant score.(7)Despite being high in sugars and calories, prunes will cause substantially less weight gain than the calories that they contain would predict.  The reasons:  (1)Soluble fiber partly blocks the absorption of calories from sugars and fats, (2)Insoluble fiber increases stool size and speeds up bowel transit time, (3)Phytate partly blocks the absorption of calories from starch and protein, (4)Polyphenols (mostly neochlorogenic acids, chlorogenic acids, and anthocyanins) protect the weight loss-causing good bacteria from the free radicals manufactured by the weight gain-causing bad bacteria, (5)Psychological:  I've eaten way too many calories already so I can't eat anything else today.I gave this product 5 stars because these prunes were of high quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAWZQUSZEOEUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001E50X66#wasThisHelpful","RAWZQUSZEOEUP","A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Immediately above the rootlike structures of wakame that cling to the ocean bottom, mekabu is just the thickened trunk area of wakame.  Mekabu is frequently sold in the fresh seafood department of supermarkets as ""ocean salad"" or ""seaweed salad,"" which contains a substantial amount of added vegetable oil, salt, and sometimes, red pepper flakes and/or sesame seeds.  The price of mekabu has gone up in recent years because of the publicity over the marine polysaccharide, fucoidan, which is substantially more plentiful in mekabu than regular wakame.  The big picture is that both mekabu and wakame offer us the same, enormous health benefits from containing large amounts of the marine polysaccharide, fucoidan, the marine carotenoid, fucoxanthin, the marine fiber, alginate, and the marine long-chain omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).This product is not the thick, cordlike mekabu found in ""ocean salad"" or ""seafood salad"" but stringlike and therefore very similar to hijiki.  However, hijiki is always black in color while this product is clear green in color as mekabu should be.  Judging by the taste, about 85% to 90% of the salt was washed away from this product before it was dried.  Most people will choose not to throw away the healthful soup created when this product is rehydrated because it isn't that salty and because they know that it contains lots of fucoidan.The biggest noticeable difference when rehydrating dried mekabu versus rehydrating dried wakame is that the wastewater soup resulting from the rehydration of dried mekabu is much, much more mucous than the wasrewater soup resulting from the rehydration of dried wakame.  This mucous substance in all ""brown"" seaweeds is especially rich in fucoidan.  Also, the wakame wastewater soup will be much too salty for health-conscious people to drink while the mekabu wastewater, which is much more mucous, will not be too salty to drink.I would have given this product 5 stars if the price was more competitive compared to other seaweed products offered by Amazon.Product of South Korea.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13774T5FQ7U1T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XCKL5K#wasThisHelpful","R13774T5FQ7U1T","A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Both products would receive 5 stars from me if they did not come from polluted waters.The Chinese appear to be losing their battle against industrial pollution.  Chinese coastal waters have become much more polluted than, say, the beautiful waters of the South Pacific.  Seaweeds tend to soak up the toxic heavy metals and PCBs much more severely than fish or shellfish.Both products are extremely delicious to eat.It's shocking to me that so many biologists from meat-loving cultures describe wakame as ""an invasive species.""For example, the California government has invested huge sums of money to eradicate wakame from California's coastal waters.According to Wikipedia, ""The sea plant [wakame] has been found in several harbors in southern California. In May 2009, it was discovered in San Francisco Bay and aggressive efforts are underway to remove it before it spreads.[16][17][18]""Also according to Wikipedia, ""In New Zealand, wakame is declared as an unwanted organism. It was first discovered in Wellington Harbor in 1987 and probably arrived accidentally in the late 1980s via shipping from Asia contained in ballast water.  Wakame is now found around much of southeastern New Zealand, and as far north as Auckland. It spreads in two ways: naturally, through the millions of microscopic spores released by each fertile organism, and through attachment to vessel hulls and marine farming equipment. It is a highly successful and fertile species, which makes it a serious invader. However, its impacts are not well understood and are likely to vary, depending on the location.  Even though it is an invasive species, in 2012, the [New Zealand] government allowed for the farming of wakame in Wellington, Marlborough, and Banks Peninsula.[15]""This product, Wel-Pac Fueru Wakame 2oz, sells for $6.29 (with FREE Super Saver Shipping).That's $3.15 per ounce of dried wakame.The other product, Emerald Cove Silver Grade Pacific Wakame, sells for $29.75 (if we Subscribe & Save at Amazon).That's $0.85 per ounce of dried wakame.This product, Wel-Pac Fueru Wakame 2oz, comes with plenty of ocean salt.The other product, Emerald Cove Silver Grade Pacific Wakame, also comes with plenty of ocean salt but, judging with my taste buds, contains slightly less salt than the Wel-Pac Fueru Wakame 2oz.By contrast, nori (laver) always comes with all of the ocean salt washed away (completely removed) and if nori contains any salt, it was added by the manufacturer just before packaging the nori for sale.Caution:  Salt always contains cancer-causing nitrosamines.  Therefore, soak the dried wakame in water for at least 5 minutes to wash away 99% of the salt.  It's a good idea to do this at least twice before eating the wakame.  Unfortunately, most people can't resist the temptation to eat seaweeds deliciously - with plenty of the salt still remaining.Both products are rich sources of (1)the marine carotenoid, fucoxanthin, (2)the marine polysaccharide, fucoidan, (3)the marine fiber, alginate, and (4)the marine long-chain omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).  Scientific studies say that all 4 of these marine phyconutrients cause weight loss in humans and that all 4 of these marine phyconutrients prevent cancer in humans.Wakame and other ""brown"" seaweeds might contain many other beneficial phyconutrients in addition to these ""big 4"" (most highly praised) phyconutrients.Wakame is very beneficial to fish and other marine life.  After eating wakame, fish convert the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) into docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) inside their bodies.Because phytate binds to toxic heavy metals (such as arsenic, lead, mercury, cadmium, and barium) and therefore partly blocks their absorption into our bodies, it might be a good idea to eat foods that are extremely rich in phytate (such as wheat bran, green peas, natto, edamame, TVP, fenugreek seeds, chia seeds, ground flaxseeds, or almonds) together with salt-free wakame in order to optimize the enormous health benefits.  Also, although they only contain a moderate amount of phytate, raw cruciferous vegetables (such as cabbage, Chinese cabbages, broccoli, broccoli sprouts, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, collard greens, watercress, mustard greens, red radishes, radish sprouts, or giant white turnips) will greatly increase the human liver's ability to detoxify our bodies of bad chemicals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDYO1MACXCVBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002L35LH6#wasThisHelpful","RDYO1MACXCVBD","A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scientific studies have shown that wheat bran has greater health benefits than oat bran, corn bran, and all other brans except rice bran, which contains the healthiest combination of phytonutrients.  However, because rice bran always contains a small amount of arsenic, most people prefer to eat wheat bran regularly instead of rice bran.As for wheat germ versus wheat bran, they are both extremely healthy for us to eat but overall, wheat bran is substantially healthier for us to eat than wheat germ.  However, wheat germ is substantially more delicious than wheat bran.  Also, 1 ounce of wheat germ is richer in minerals and phytosterols than 1 ounce of wheat bran.  However, 100 calories of wheat bran contains just as much if not more minerals and phytosterols as 100 calories of wheat germ.Eating wheat bran regularly will substantially lower our risk of developing all cancers, heart disease, and a dozen other killer diseases.  Wheat bran is definitely superior to wheat germ for people who want to lose weight because (1)wheat bran is much, much lower in calories than wheat germ, which is very high in fat, and (2)wheat bran provides more food for the weight loss-causing good bacteria in our intestines than wheat germ.Fiber constitutes 66.3% of the carbohydrates in wheat bran.  That's higher than almost any other commonly eaten food.  Insoluble fiber comprises about eleven-twelfths of the total fiber in wheat bran.  A very beneficial group of soluble fibers known as, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), constitutes the remaining one-twelfth.  Fiber constitutes about 35% to 60% of the carbohydrates in legumes, which are even more beneficial to our health than wheat bran.  However, all legumes tend to cause way too much flatulence because they contain way too much fermentable starches (such as raffinose) in addition to flatulence-reducing phytate.  Because wheat bran is high in flatulence-reducing phytate and low in flatulence-causing fermentable starches (such as raffinose), wheat bran tends to minimize flatulence in the vast majority of people.Bob's Red Mill does an excellent job of preserving the health benefits of wheat bran in this product by tampering with nature as little as possible.  However, because mycotoxin-producing fungi love to eat whole grains, seeds, and nuts, I strongly recommend that wheat bran be kept in an airtight container, preferably with a dessicant inside to keep the humidity as low as possible.  It's not necessary to do this before the clear, plastic bags that come with this product are cut open.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FW7F6TECSWFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VLVIL4#wasThisHelpful","R1FW7F6TECSWFF","A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have very low vision and this phone is easier for me to use than the standard issue phone from Safelink. I have speech on for both menu options and character input. Also invert colors and large fonts enabled. The speech feature is not like ios Voiceover. With Voiceover I can slide my finger around the screen then lift my finger when Voiceover lets me know I'm on what I want thereby activating the option. With this phone the voice speaks and launches or types what I touch so there is no way to first determine that you are on what you want before launching or typing. Still it is useful and as I learn the location of the items on the screen it will get easier to land on what I want on the first try. The voice speaks most things but not everything. Entering my wifi password for instance was difficult because first off no qwerty keyboard option was available so I had to enter the password with the phone-like keyboard where you quickly tap each key however many times necessary to get the desired letter typed.  And the voice is silent so no help there. I managed to accomplish it using a magnifier. I also need a magnifier to type a message. Even though speech reads the character I tap, it also types it so unless I've been lucky enough to land on the right character there is a lot of deleting and trying again. Still though I am happy to have this phone for ten bucks. I can't believe how easy it was to transfer my Safelink service over to this phone. Thanks to many helpful reviews I had my serial number at the ready when I called Safelink and choose the transfer to new phone option. Took only minutes and did not have to speak to a person. About 15 minutes after ending that call my old phone had no service so, as directed, I powered off my 306G then turned it back on. First attempt to make a call failed but then the phone seemed to reset itself and second attempt to make a call worked.

I love little kid sneakers but its not all that cute in adult size 9. But who cares about looks if the shoe delivers comfort. I like how it feels on my 2 - 4 mile walks but they don't feel quite as good as Earth Glides. Unfortunately Earth doesn't offer the Glide anymore so I am glad to be able to buy this brand in no-leather styles.  Update - I had to give up on these shoes. My big toes were killing me and I finally figured out why. The Earth Glides and the other shoes I walk in, the Vivobarefoot Stealth, are extremely flexible. This Altra is too stiff for my feet. I loved the cushioning but I have way less discomfort in the Stealth which has zero cushioning than in the Altra. The Earth Glides were both flexible and cushioned so they were perfect.

I bought it for casual wear over t-shirts this fall so that I can carry stuff without needing a purse. Its okay. I don't love it though. Because there are no pockets on the back all the weight of my stuff is on the front which causes the vest to hang unattractively forward. I've never owned a cargo vest so it didn't occur to me when I chose this one that that might happen. I'm pretty much flat chested so maybe this droop would not happen for bustier women.

They are so short that two coffee measures of ground coffee, typically what is needed for a 12 oz mug of brewed coffee, fills the filter to the top edge.

"I am very small busted and many swim tops have way too much infrastructure than I want or need and too much space to fill. This top fits great.  The pads are thin and triangular fitting right to all three edges of each cup. But they are not cups really, they are only slightly rounded. The bottom edge of each is about 6"" and the other two edges are about 7"". The pads can be removed through small slits in the lining but I left them in because they are not the kind that soak up water and stay soggy. Oddly I find that if I tie the strings in a double knot they come undone but if I tie in a bow they stay secure.  no annoying tag, the label is printed on the fabric ..

"This starter kit is the same version that I bought at Target about a year ago. Except this one comes with four individually packaged wet cloths in addition to a pack of dry cloths and the mop itself. I like the contoured grip on the mop much better than the original model. I turn the brush roller off on my vac and go over my laminate and tile areas. Then I use a dry cloth on the Swiffer to finalize the laminate especially along the baseboards. Usually I mop tile with a big microfiber cloth and hot water. But sometimes I use a wet Swiffer on the tile.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BWM2TQDE6MO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6FT6TM#wasThisHelpful","R3BWM2TQDE6MO","A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They are way too good to easily stop at one and considering their price tag and calorie content I would be busting my budget and the seat of my pants in no time.

"Several times a week I walk two miles each way to my daughter's house to babysit my grandson. Often I need to take a cloth tote bag to transport things and often even if I go over without one I return home with one because my daughter has given me something good to eat for my dinner.  The problem with cloth totes is twofold - the shoulder straps don't stay together and one or both constantly slip off my shoulder as I walk. This ingenious item solves my problems. The straps stay together and on my shoulder. The straps on the tote I've been using this pad on are actually about 1.25"" wide but because they are of soft fabric both fit into the pad by being folded. I have another tote with slightly stiffer straps that are 1.5"" wide and amazingly I can get this pad around them and snapped. But I'm here on Amazon hoping to find the same pad in a wider size to use on that tote. Now, I have not yet hauled a heavy load using this pad. There is no cushioning so possibly with a heavy load this pad would not feel too good on a two mile walk. One last thing - there is as much gripping power inside this pad as there is on the outer underside. So not only does it hold good on your shoulder, the strap stays where you want it inside the pad.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CFG9FKO4X9RW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PNB6QI#wasThisHelpful","R2CFG9FKO4X9RW","A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got this for my mother. She had a brown leather one years ago and wore it out. She has missed it ever since. I set out to find another brown one, synthetic and leather-like because I refuse to buy leather and a nylon one would not fit her persona. I was delighted to see this in faux brown leather so I bought it. Its pretty perfect. Had to adjust the strap to its shortest length and thankfully it fits well. Another inch longer and it would be too big. The strap has no loose part that hangs down which is wonderful. Its made like a purse with a silky fabric lining. Mom slides a pair of reading glasses (the slender style) into the outer pocket. In the main compartment she keeps a large adhesive bandage, keys, and debit card. There is room for a few more items but thats all she needs in a store. The only reason I didn't rate this fanny pack five stars is because there is no credit card slot. I feel that keeping cards and I'd separate and secure is important. The zipper for the main area faces up and is easy to use. Mom wears the pack on her front. The waist belt buckle is the kind where one piece slides into another and clicks. Then you have to pinch to release. It seems secure and not overly difficult to release. Unlike, say, my grandson's high chair seat belt buckle. Sometimes I get scared that I won't be able to get him out!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JTB94FYEXAOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QB0EAKE#wasThisHelpful","R3JTB94FYEXAOV","A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just got this today.  I unboxed and unfolded it and headed to my nearby shopping center on foot. It handled well, about like a $50 stroller. Same for the build quality, not cheap but not fabulous. I am 5' - 4"" and with the handle in the middle position it feels comfortable. I did not kick the rear wheel axle but itt's close and if you have a long stride you may have to shorten it a little while pushing this cart. Unfold and fold-up is easy and I'm glad for that because I have to fold it for it to fit in my closet. I was worried about capacity so I bought stroller hooks from which I can hang bags and put one on each tube leading up to the handle. I did not need them today but sometimes I will. I easily put four plastic store bags in the cart today. Three were very full.  The cart handled well both empty and full. It is quiet except for a squeak in one of the wheels that annoyed me throughout the supermarket. I have since sprayed WD-40 on all the wheels and hope very much it eliminates the squeak. The insulated compartment on the front is almost the full height of the main bag. Today I used it to put smaller items in as I shopped so they didn't end up under heavier larger items in the main bag. Then after checkout I put the frozen items in the insulated compartment for the walk home. Having two separate sections was very nice. All descriptions that I've read online about this cart say there is a small zippered compartment on the back.  I have not been able to find it if it's there. I've emailed the seller, maybe I'm just not seeing it. My previous cart was designed to be pulled instead of pushed. I felt better today, pushing instead of pulling a cart through a store. I chose the orange (mandarin) color because I wanted something sporty and not looking like luggage. It does look just as I thought.  The big flap that covers both the main and insulated areas will flip to the back and hang down completely out of the way so you are not having to deal with it as you put in and remove things. When closed the flap has a buckle that clicks into the receiving piece that slides up and down on a strap attached to the front of the bag. So its really easy to snap together then slide to cinch.  Still though, if the bag is loaded rain can get in on the sides. I don't care if my groceries get wet but if I was toting something like wrapped gifts I'd put them in plastic bags then into the cart. It's very clever how the rear wheels pivot to where they almost touch the front wheels in case you need to pull rather than push.  Like if it were raining I could pull this cart and hold and umbrella. I would not be able to steer while pushing with one hand.  Or if the elevator is not working and I have to use the stairs. You tip the cart forward lifting the rear wheels off the ground, then the rear wheels can be pivoted towards the front wheels, set the cart back down on the rear wheels and go.  So for now, after one trial run, I am pleased with this cart. I will update this review if anything  more occurs to me or if something goes wrong. Sure hope that squeak isn't recurring and that the small compartment is there somewhere. Update - I've made a second excursion to the supermarket with my cart.  It was even better than my first because the wheel squeak is gone. Also this time I did use the hook I put on for a bag with a loaf of bread and big bag of cherries and it worked perfectly. The cart handled just as it does without the added weight dangling from the handle strut. Instead of using the insulated compartment for small items as I shopped I used it for frozen vegetables. I learned that it would be better to do this after the main bag was filled because the frozen items caved in the main bag making it a little difficult to put things down in there. The cart bag is not squared like the picture, its a soft bag, which is necessary for folding. So next time I will buy frozen foods last.  The only dissappointment so far is the missing small zippered pocket as mentioned in the description. It is not there. I like to have a lighted magnifier with me when I shop and was looking forward to having a handy place to stow it.  Another update - Inside a store and on other smooth surfaces I can easily maneuver this cart with one hand. It's only on the uneven terrain that is my route between home and shopping center that I need to use both hands to push and steer. I am loving the cart.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A0X7LJEASOL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TH0T80M#wasThisHelpful","R3A0X7LJEASOL0","A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I took this attractive and well made toy to my grandson's house and handed it over. He is 28 months old. He played with it for several minutes, using the switch on the front to access the three levels. At each level there is a variety of reactions from each key press so a child will not become bored quickly. I left it at my grandsons house and his Mom has told me that he has revisited the toy many times and it seems to hold his interest.  Today I tried to determine exactly what you get from each level but  All i can say is that each level is different and each key press results in multiple ways. My grandson has his own iPad Mini and uses it for games, videos, and Youtube clips of things he loves like ceiling fans, helicopters, surprise eggs, and he is 100% adept at using it. I say this because I feel that if he still finds this toy tablet interesting then Fisher Price has done a good job.

"I am 5' 4"" and weigh 113 pounds. On top I am extremely small, not completely flat but I could easily find a bra that fits in the girls training bra department. All my shorts are 4 or 6 so I ordered the medium size in this suit. It fits me well. The waist comes up a little higher in the front than in the back but it still looks okay I think. I took the round pads out of the top because I don't care for soggy bra pads after swimming. Without the pads the bra dries quickly just like the rest of the suit. Its very hard to find an adult swim suit that fits me right up top. Usually there is more fabric and/or support infrastructure than I can use or fill. I'm not a mesh person but the bras on the styles that don't have mesh are not the same as what I have so probably would not fit me. I'm worried that maybe the fabric won't last long during a summer of frequent use in chlorinated pools so I'm going to buy a couple more. Its an amazing deal considering the price of the very few other waist high swim bottoms for sale. Also how strange that a waist high two piece swim suit is so difficult to find.  Meant to mention above that with this style (Black) the bra pads could be slid out through a slit. And the fabric is double so even with pads out there is no show through. There is a vertical stay on both sides that keep the top in place and in shape. The bottoms are double fabric too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRPBRAJ4EWCIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KICOMJ0#wasThisHelpful","RRPBRAJ4EWCIT","A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have tried many vacuum cleaners and so far I like this one best. Its light but not so light it doesn't clean well. And as for noise it is noticeably less loud than my Eureka 166DX stick vac and 4700D upright, both of which are now headed to the Salvation Army store. Right off I was happy to find that not only is the electric cord for this vac nice and long, we get two roomy cleats spaced a decent distance apart for easy wrapping. Most of my previous vacs had undersized cleats and it was a challenge to fit all of the cord on. I am happy with the placement of all controls. There is no handle release lever to be sought with a foot.  Instead you simply place a foot gently on the base/brush roll housing and tilt the handle.  Removing and emptying the dirt cup was easy although I did have to reach in to pull out a wad of carpet fuzz that was trapped.  I didn't mind. I started on my carpet which is deep but very thick and dense. For this I did not have to open the air intake.  Then I proceeded on to ceramic tile and the strong suction immediately made itself known. I had to open the air intake to lessen the suction for both ceramic tile and for laminate.  This air intake adjuster is right under the handle and very easy to access and adjust. The handle, by the way, is large and comfortable.  Its the kind that abuts the lower palm of your hand so when pushing its not all up to your fingers.  In the past i have used vacs with swivel joints and have not liked how much effort was required to maintain control.  This one does swivel but there is enough resistance so that it doesn't cause a power struggle between me and it. So far I have not triggered the brush roll shut off but its only a matter of time before I go over something that causes a jam. The auto shutoff seems like an excellent idea to me. And maybe because of this feature I do not see any mention of belt replacement in the user guide. Fine by me.  As already mentioned in other reviews, if you want to easily see through the clear walled dirt cup have some Goo Gone handy. The large garish stick-on labels leave a sticky residue that is highly annoying if left there.  I've studied closely the diagrams in the PDF version of the user guide and the disconnecting and removal of the portable portion of the vac looks easy. But I am not feeling adventurous so I'm not attempting it. I do wish there was more instruction in the form of words instead of mostly just drawings. My vision is bad so deciphering what is being illustrated is often impossible. Written direction as reinforcement would be helpful. Finally, when I first used the vac I had not discovered the notch on the back side of the handle to hold the electric cord up.  The low dangling cord was a nuisance and I was delighted to finally see the notch. It holds the cord and is super easy  to get the cord out if you need just a foot more to reach that farthest corner. *** Update - More to love - That when I'm running the brush roller, the brush roller stops when I click the handle in upright position. And both small front and large back wheels have rubber tread. This makes for good traction and quiet rolling on hard floors. And the big hand hold - its for both removing and toting the dirt collector and for lifting the entire vac.  Its smooth, comfortable, and located where it is easy to grasp and where the weight of the vac is well distributed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N7KQUA62UDTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V8IUDRI#wasThisHelpful","R3N7KQUA62UDTS","A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My 27 month old grandson has a ton of toys. Cars, trains, balls, every imaginable electronic toy, animals, and robots but nothing replicating a human. I thought, since he drinks from sippy cups and is approaching potty training, that he might be interested in this very cute doll.

"I see these single serve cereals in the grocery store and am tempted but can't justify paying a buck each. Here on Amazon they are about the same price, even though they come in bulk. So I was happy to have some to review.  Its great - just peel off the easy to remove lid and add milk. The cups are pretty full to begin with so after adding milk its tricky to eat at first so young kids might make a mess.  I like the original recipe best because its not very sweet.  The strawberry is sweet but natural tasting.  The strawberries are real and freeze dried.  If you like sweetened cereal but don't care for the all out blast of sugar you may enjoy this one. The strawberries bring a nice tang to the mix. Cost aside, and if your community recycles plastic, these are a very convenient way to have a bowl of tasty cereal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8V6MB0V6V76C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PHYE802#wasThisHelpful","R8V6MB0V6V76C","A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I mean its not breathtakingly beutiful but the design is attractive. Its simple and given the choice of inexpensive simple or inexpensive flashy I'll take plain any day. I'm glad to have a pump bottle that, unlike the pump bottles that come filled from the store, this one is nice and wide all the way down so it does not tip over easily when not full and weighty. I mainly use liquid body wash but do like a bar of glycerin for my face so I put the soap dish on my shower caddy shelf. And the curtain rings that so many are bashing as cheap happen to be my favorite type. I had some like this years ago but last time I bought new rings I was disappointed that the store I was in did not have them. They are great!  Like a tallish letter C with the ends touching. You just slide the curtain in then flex the ring to snap it on the rod. When working at something where I have to reach up the faster and less complicated the better.  I am very pleased with this set. It is basic and functional, not elaborate and gift-y.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIZ5HSKY4J8QU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOFFCY#wasThisHelpful","RIZ5HSKY4J8QU","A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These diapers are wonderful. Today I put one on my 26 month old grandson who weighs 32 pounds and the diaper fit good. I am stoutly opposed to any and all tight garments on him and I was very happy with not only the fit but the stretchiness of the wide side panels. I felt all around the leg holes and they are snug but in no way tight or binding. The diapers look cool and stay nice and neat unlike his regular diapers that after an hour on him are sagging and all dilapidated.  Just to check out the side tape I used them when a dry diaper was needed and they work great.  We plan to put these on my grandson for a car trip next week. Not only will he not require changing (the trip is one and a half hour) but I think he will be more comfortable in these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA83TC125692Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TX1KIWC#wasThisHelpful","RA83TC125692Z","A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is exactly what I wanted. I have very poor vision and trying to see who is at my door through a typical peephole is impossible. I was afraid, because of my sub standard vision, that this item would not help much but its actually quite awesome. The installation was easy except that the hole in my door for my old peephole was too small.  My largest drill bit is 1/4"" which is not big enough but I was able to enlarge the hole by pressing it against the hole perimeter and sort of filing away the edges. My door has metal skins.  I did not bother enlarging the exterior skin, just the interior so that the barrel would go in. Then the lens went in from the exterior and into the barrel. Also I was unable to utilize the set screw because it has to go in from the bottom of the viewing screen and there is a doorbell housing on my door preventing use of a screwdriver from below.  Anyway I am very pleased with this gadget. Believe me, if I am able to see who is at my door anyone can. I should add that I am in a condo with outside corridors so there is good daylight during the day.

"I bought these to use in my Hamilton Beach Flex Brew because the Flex is unreliable when using K-cups.  Columbian is my fave so thats what I ordered.  With the Flex and K-cups my coffee was stronger than I like even with the maximum amount of water.  With these soft pods I have the reverse - I can use one pod and be content with a small six ounce cup of coffee or use two pods and have a ten ounce mug.  I am going with the mug.  Cost-wise by using two pods per serving I'm not saving by using soft pods instead of K-cups.

"I really like this rice and quinoa side dish.  Its sort of a convenience food but healthier than, say, boxed mac and cheese. The brown rice was parboiled prior to drying so that it cooks in the same time as the quinoa.  But at least its still in the whole grain catagory instead of the flour that macaroni is made from.  Plus theres no cheese and for me thats good because dairy causes my joint pain to flare.  All the seasonings are figured out and the flavor is wonderful.  I was thinking I'd cook it in my rice cooker until I saw the directions were for microwaving. Its great to have something in the pantry that requires little time or effort yet is still somewhat healthy.  I only wish it had less sodium.  Or none at all and I could add how much of my own sea salt as I wanted.  I cook this in a Corningware casserole with glass lid.  Put in the rice/quinoa and contents of seasoning packet with 1-3/4 cups of water.  Cover and nuke on high for seven minutes.  Stir and cook (again with lid on) at half power for 20 minutes. I add the olive oil after cooking.  I appreciate that Near East doesn't skew their nutrition stats by claiming more servings per box than there are.  They say two and thats realistic although to be honest I could eat the entire box if thats all I'm eating.  But i pair it with steamed broccoli.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OLXNVTYIFLLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005A1L468#wasThisHelpful","R2OLXNVTYIFLLW","A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I did not hate this vacuum as much as I thought I would when I first saw it. Mainly I wanted it to clean about 700 square feet of tile and laminate.  My method has beeen to go over the floor with an Eureka stick vac then go back over everything with a dry Swifter.  I was thinking since this vac has a hard floor attachment with a duster attached I could vac and dust at the same time.  And that was true, it did an admirable job on my hard floors.  It is not as loud as  my stick vac and the cord of this one is much longer than the stick vac cord so two plusses there.  By rotating the floor attachment I was able to place the intake edge (normally facing forward) up against the baseboards and so get the very edge of the floor clean.  So that was good.  In order to empty the dirt cup as designed I would have to remove the long extension tool that I attached the floor tool to.  It would be nice to be able to leave the extension installed since that is how I will be using the vac.  I suppose I could bring a small trash can to the vac and try to hold it under the dirt cup drop down door but will probably either remove the extension or the entire dirt cup.  Another negative is that the hot exhaust is blowing out near my arm, hand, and body.  Might feel nice on a cold day but not in sunny Florida.  When attached to the extention the  upholstery/stair tool gets no power to turn the brush roller.  I was thinking that was okay because I could do my small thin area rugs without the edges being lifted by a spinning roller.  And my one large braided rug isn't supposed to be cleaned with a vac with spinning brush roller.  But it did not work out because the pivoting upholstery/stair attachment will not stay straight during use.  The cord in reality can not be conveniently wrapped around the machine so storage is sloppy.  I am 61 and in excellent condition but still, at my age supporting the entire weight of a vacuum cleaner with one arm is uncomfortable.  I have some work gloves with grippy palms and fingers and next time i use this vac I'm going to wear the gloves.  I can see that a person could easily develop calloused hands if using this vac frequently.  One more thing - it of course does not stand up but it does stay in the position I lay it down in, it does not flop over to one side, so its not so bad to pick back up.  In conclusion, I don't hate it but I don't love it.  I think as a corded hand vac it would be very useful.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F3P5DO1ZXUGM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZRBSKA#wasThisHelpful","R2F3P5DO1ZXUGM","A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have had some molars crack in the last few years and can't help but wonder if using a fluoride toothpaste would have made a difference there.

I use it to cook frozen things like fries and vegetarian meat alternative items.  I will update my review when I try other things in it.  The control knobs are easy to grasp and turn and although I wish the markings were bigger I am able to see these with a lighted magnifier.

"I have several over door hooks that I bought because they look good but this one is my favorite.  First off it looks good too because the part that the hooks are attached to and that goes up and over the door is clear so all that is really obvious are the hooks themselves.  And I love that the hooks have fat rubbery tips so things hung on them don't slide off.  Then there is the method of how it is kept in place - the springy part puts a little pressure on the door so the whole assembly is less likely to lift up when removing an item from a hook.  If your door has a very small space between it and the door frame at the top you will still have the problem of not being able to completely close the door but this one does have a thinner over-door part than my other ones which are of all metal construction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HDD7FXD2F524/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0034N1VF8#wasThisHelpful","R1HDD7FXD2F524","A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have always used steel grid sink protectors because I like being able to set a hot pot on it and also because it serves as a drying rack when I've washed just a few items.  This silicone mat also allows me to put hot pots on it and it has indentions that support the bottom edge of washed plates etc so that they can lean against the sink side for air drying.  The small feet seem to raise the mat enough for some air circulation but not as much as a steel grid type.  This mat looks nicer than my metal one and I like the quiet cushioning effect.  I suppose it could be cleaned in the dishwasher since my silicone spatulas can.  The only important drawback about this mat, as compared to a rigid metal type, is that it, being flexible, will not provide an even and level surface in the sink.  This mat will conform to the slant of the sink floor.  All in all I am enjoying this mat and might be a permanent convert from metal to silicone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OWLHJ01PMVA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OCEBMH0#wasThisHelpful","R3OWLHJ01PMVA2","A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This hair product did not work out for me.  I don't hate it but I don't love it.  I think it's a youthful look and I am not young.  My hair is short, thick, fine, dark brown, and beginning to gray.  I get the concept, I spent the first 44 years of my life on the east coast of south Florida  and am fond of the day at the beach look.  And this product does an excellent job of replicating it.  But at 61 the look doesn't fit.  And I much prefer to run my fingers through silky smooth hair than matte hair.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DLLSEMZJ0A19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1NBL40#wasThisHelpful","R3DLLSEMZJ0A19","A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To all the brave users who complained about the rod not staying up, let me congratulate you for getting that far with it.  The instructions say to twist to unlock then twist to lock at the desired length.  I twist and it unlocks but no amount of force will cause the rod to extend.  I have another rod like this one - a royal pain to get in place but once up it has stayed.  After twisting to unlock the smaller diameter tube should slide within the larger diameter tube thus adjusting the length.

"My hair is short, thick, fine, graying, and dry. It didn't used to be dry but is now that I'm in my 60's.  I have been using very thick conditioners, the kind that comes in a tube rather than a bottle. I did not think this conditioner, or any bottled conditioner, would be as good as the thick stuff. But  in fact I like my hair even better with this product.  My hair is smooth and silky.  There is an underlying unpleasant odor though. Not unlike the sulpher smell of perming solutions. I don't notice it after my hair (I always let it air dry) is fully dry. Another gripe is that the product is thick, possibly as thick as the kind in a tube, but its in a bottle and has to get out through a small hole. Not easy to accomplish.

"TruSoft By STAINMASTER Luxurious Bath Rug, 17-By-24 Inch, Fresh Cream - It's a nice rug. The color is very light, almost white. I have owned thicker bathroom rugs but this one is soft and feels nice under bare feet. I prefer to stand on cotton when I'm wet from showering so I always lay a hand towel over the rug at first then hang up the towel once I'm dry. My bathroom is the hall bathroom so its used by visitors. For this reason I do not leave the rug down. I keep it draped over the tub side then put it down when I bathe.

"I put two of these up on a laminated plastic (Formica) cupboard door. I swabbed the surface with isopropal alcolhal before pressing the hooks in place. They don't have the unattached duel-backing tapes like Command  hooks. The tape (adhesive) is already affixed to the hook. You just have to peel away the backing and stick the hook where you want it. As others have mentioned, the tab for some day removing the hook is perfectly visible. The hooks I put up seem sturdy. I would say if you used these in a place where looks don't matter, and especially if applied to a white surface so that the white pull tab isn't so obvious, these could be a less expensive way to get hooks up. Less expensive than Command brand. I can't figure out what benefit the hinge feature offers. Other than making it easier to do the 30 second press in place maneuver by being able to swing the hook up so that my fingers could press evenly on the backplate, the ability to swing up and down seems useless.  Update - I have used all of the hooks now and they work perfectly.  And I finally figured out one good thing about the hinged hook.  It can be used from above like a cup hook.  Stick the back plate on the underside of a shelf and the hook part swings down.  A while ago I was looking for peel and stick cup hooks and could not find any.  So these would fit that description.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32AKA9HJH74RZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J12Q3ZY#wasThisHelpful","R32AKA9HJH74RZ","A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The mittens are very cute and the string (which is removeable) is nice. I live in Florida but before you laugh let me say in my defense that it can get chilly in my area and I don't drive so have to walk everywhere. Today it was in the low 40's and windy. The mittens did not keep my hands warm because the wind goes through the fabric. My hands would have been colder without the mittens so they help but still my hands were not even close to warm. The keeper string was useful when I had to get out my hanky and blow my nose. I could free my hands and the mittens were right there ready to go back on. I would say if you don't have to be out for long stretches, like if you need only walk from your car to your office, etc., these will do.

"Purchased 11/15; Used about 35 hours a week. I had to replace the battery in my mouse once (no bfd). Little to no delay in typing/mouse clicking. Works fabulously...when it works. For about the last three weeks, the little usb receptor thing isn't being recognized by my computer--I have to tap it and wait, tap it an wait, tap it and wait. Every morning. Every time the computer goes into standby. Sometimes for no reason at all. I tried re-installing the driver, but same results. Aye-Yey-Yey! It works great...when it works. I tried it on my work computer and my home computer just to be sure that it is the keyboard/mouse/usb. It is weird. It isn't annoying enough to purchase a replacement, but it is enough to make me write a bad review. I recommend forgoing this set-it is definitely on the cheaper side, but if you have to replace it every 5 months, it is a horrible value.Update: Well, it finally died.

"My husband has developed the strange ability to have weird kitchen gadgets follow him home from the store. Most of the time I can tell right away if something is going to be a dust collector or actually useful. This Progressive Onion Chopper was immediately dismissed as a general 'bad idea'--I mean, it looks like it is ready to fall apart, or get clogged, or completely un-cleanable. I could not have been more wrong. I first used this little guy to chop onions for some delicious delicious chili that i was making. It tore thru those onions and peppers so easily, so uniformly, it was amazing. It is really great to be pleasantly surprised. Clean up was a breeze because of this tiny included rake that gets into the squares. I highly recommend this tool, it is definitely worthwhile.04/21/2014 Update: Guess What? This thing is still awesome. Here are the top 5 things I have learned thus far:Carrots: Cut baby carrots in half & chop. If they are too big, you will need the strength of a marvel superhero to press the door down & complete the process. I've found it helps to yell ""HULK SMASH!"" whilst you are fighting an overly-pushy veggie.Lettuce: Don't be lazy & try to chop lettuce in here; It just turns to water & your taco will be less than pleased.Tomato: If you use cherry tomatoes, you can totally chop them in this, but be sure to grab a tarp & cover yourself. There were little seeds exploding everywhere. Some interesting places I found seeds: My Dress. My Upper Cabinet Doors. The Window. My Hair. It's cool though, because I've never been to a Gallagher show and I think that this is pretty much the jist of it.Onions: No more crying for you. Pop some sliced onions in this bad boy & your eyeliner will still be flawless. This convenience does have one downside--with the ease of cutting onions, you will be more inclined to include them in your cooking adventures & onions smell terrible after you have eaten them. Seriously, use with caution.Veggie Dogs: ""Veggie Wah?"" Yep- veggie dogs. Chop em up, throw them in a fry pan with some veg bacon,(don't judge me) mix them up with beans and you, my friend, are in for a treat. These fantastic little morsels are the best & you will be the life of the party--Biggie Smalls Style.Update: 01/12/2015-Amazing Vegetarian Chili:what you need:Like a Tablespoon of Olive Oil.Pack of Veggie Dogs- Chop them suckers up!Pack of Veggie Bacon-Chop them up too! go crazy! no one is safe.1 small onion- Sweep the Leg Johnny! CHHOOOOPPPPPP ITTTT!!!!!2 Cans of Beans: the weirder, the better. I usually go for like a big fat red bean & a speckled white bean. I am a legume fan. Pick whatever.1 big asscan of diced tomatoes- drainied. You could totally dice them yourself, but they are like super cheap.1 packet of Ranch powder1 packet of Taco PowderWhatever Spices/peppers you got lying around. Have some smoked paprika? throw that in. got any peppers? throw that in too. sky's the limit dude.Directions: Throw in all yr chopped up goodness into a pot with a little bit of olive oil & cook it until it's little crusty. Veggie dogs blow up like balloons sometimes. Then throw in everything else. cookl over low heat for 15 minutes to whenever. What now? Baby, you got a stew (chili) going.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL6PD76YZOYKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FOI4324#wasThisHelpful","RL6PD76YZOYKE","A3A6MEPNP0VYYK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6MEPNP0VYYK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The potatoes are way too bumpy for this to work. Too bad, but it totally rocks the party on apple peeling, so it is worth keeping.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7ZLKZ132TNJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DLTD1C#wasThisHelpful","R7ZLKZ132TNJ5","A3A6MEPNP0VYYK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6MEPNP0VYYK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally purchased this keyboard sticker set at Burlington. It is easy to apply & lasted for years. What I love about this pattern in particular is it is not super-hey-look-at-me-noticeable, but rather a ""hey, whats on your keyboard?"" type of response. The set has several different sizes of the same keys, so you are likely to have everything you need for full coverage. I never had a problem with them lifting up, or peeling off. When I left my last position I found that I missed the fancy keyboard, so I picked these up on amazon & was not disappointed. installation takes about 15 minutes and everyone that has noticed them thinks it is awesome--a really good way to meet people at the new job. :D I would be confident in purchasing other patterns from this brand based on my experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IEHAOZAWA41A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B5WOFMQ#wasThisHelpful","R1IEHAOZAWA41A","A3A6MEPNP0VYYK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6MEPNP0VYYK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I started a new position with a suuuuper awesome company with two downfalls: 1- I moved back into a [shudder] cubicle and 2-they move at a snail's pace to get new equipment. One thing that years in an office has caused is my impatience for talking into a handset, so I immediately ordered a headset from corporate. It was taking forever. (I did mention I am impatient) So, I began looking for cheap alternatives when I found this headset buddy. I was weary of the mixed reviews, so I went onto their website to verify this product was compatible with my desk phone. The chart listed my phone & I watched the video on how to install just to be sure. Side Note: The video is really REALLY unintentionally hilarious. Basically it is a plug & go product, but the really good looking dude that is demonstrating the 'installation' never breaks eye contact with the camera. It is sexy, funny & slightly creepy all at the same time, which is how i like my men.  Im pretty sure it hypnotized me, because I bought the product within 5 minutes. Got it two days later & I was super excited to use with my regular IPhone headphone. Nope- the female jack was too small. (2.5mm) Apparently there are different sized of headphone plugs. After some research, I learned that most headphones are 3.5mm which is way too fat for this adapter. The internets did say that some old headphones are 2.5mm, so I found an old XBOX360 headset. I tested it by talking a little smack on COD and took the Frankenstein headset into work the next day. I plugged it in, but alas-- a No Go--didn't even get a dial tone. What a bummer. Good news is return process was super easy. Good to go. Overall, this might work for you, or you might need a newer headset, but its kinda worthwhile to give it a try because you can just send it back if it doesn't work. Either way- go watch the video & let me know if you think it is as funny as I do. Also, this story has a happy ending- my wireless headset came in a couple of days later.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HRX7BXHXCQPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FVDUAW#wasThisHelpful","R1HRX7BXHXCQPJ","A3A6MEPNP0VYYK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6MEPNP0VYYK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I initally saw this shirt on Pinterest, and was like ""Oh that is so cute!"" After I pinned it, I totally forgot about it until I came across it for sale on Amazon. I had a gift card, so I decided that it was totally worth it to buy. Shipping was uber fast despite the fact that it isnt Prime (Ordered it on a Friday & got it the next Thursday) What is most impressive is the quality. It is so soft. Love that! I was sure that it would be a hit with everyone I know, so I showed my hubby right away. He surprisingly didnt think it was as rad as I thought it was. In fact, no one really thought it was as funny/cute as I thought it was. Whatever-I still love it & I give it an A+++. BTW, Im a chubster (size 16) and I ordered the Medium; fit well, but probably could have gotten away with the small.Update 8/6: I figured out why no one but me finds this shirt as funy as me. the ""just kidding"" part is too small & people dont automatically read it, so they assume that it is just a harvard law shirt. AH HA! I wore this to bed on a girls trip and my friends didnt even notice it said Just Kidding until the next morning over the continental breakfast. So it is funny! Yay!

"OK. So I recently found this awesome lip plumper made by Bite Cosmetics. It has cinnamon oil in it and I really like it...but I want to LOVE it. Im crafty-I can make it better!

At first, I was disappointed--I mean I only felt a little tiny tingle--bummer.After a couple of seconds, I'd realized I should be a Bluth, because I'd made a huge mistake. Holy moley, did it burn.

Yes, it shockingly had the same reaction.

"I was looking into buying curlers to alleviate some of the time spent curling with a traditional curling iron. I have long(ish-about 18 inches) thinner hair, so the traditional multiple sized curlers wouldnt cut it for me. I would likely need to buy 2 sets & set the smaller curlers out to pasture. When I saw this set, I couldnt believe my eyes--all jumbo curlers, and cheaper than the regular set? Oh....wait...it has Twilight written on it. Oh no. Whatever, I dont have to follow R Pats & K Stew to enjoy curly hair, so I bought them and hoped no one would see the package delivered to my door. Luckily, it was in a brown box and I opened it in the privacy of my own bathroom. I do love these curlers with one exception: the clips. God almighty, these U shaped clips are completely useless. I went & purchased some traditional curler clips from Sally's (reason why I deducted 2 stars) & haven't looked back since. This really is a great set, but I strongly suggest using distilled water, or at the very least, filtered water. I can definitely see how the mechanism can get clogged with just regular tap.On a side note, Id also like to comment on the resiliency of the plastic.

Good things must come to those who wait, because let me tell you, my world was seriously rocked when I tried the Bite Beauty Cinnamon Plumping Lip Oil today.Here is why I love it & gave it 5 stars:1-Super cute packaging.

No, there isnt really a color transference onto your lips, but I love that it is pretty in the bottle.3-Smell-So cinnamony & delicious.4-Natural- it is 99.9% natural. Now, Im not one of those ladies that is constantly on the lookout for organic natural makeup, but this is just an added bonus.5-The dealbreaker: It works. It works like gangbusters.

"I love the whole 'stick it and forget it' aspect these types of nail products bring to the table, so I have a slightly unhealthy obsession with purchasing them whenever I see the product on sale. The Nail Bliss Bling Ombre Flair was no exception. I picked these up at a cool 1.99 at a local beauty supply store and they sat in my nail polish dungeon for a few months before I decided to use it. First and foremost-these are different from your regular-run-of-the-mill polish strips because they are not polish at all. Some ways this is way better & way worse.First, the good:They dont dry out. My application of patterned strips is to apply one (or two if im feeling particularly zany) as an accent nail. That means that I have to go to extraordinary lengths to preserve the remaining strips in the package, or else they will dry out faster than a puddle in the mojave . These do not have these problems, because they are actual adhesive on the back of plastic sheets. That is awesome.Studded Nails? Count me in. If you were going to try to replicate look with any other polish/product, it would be like a glitter? OMG, can you imagine trying to get the specs just so? No way. Cute, unique look-This isnt going to be on everyone's fingers.Now, the bad/slightly annoying:They are thick & you can peel them off unintentionally. Did I mention they are stickers? yeah, these are not going to last you longer than a couple of days before the edges start to peel up. No bigs in my opinion.Even with their short lifespan, I still recommend adding these into rotation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X8XZ95XKPVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087Q5XEW#wasThisHelpful","R2X8XZ95XKPVF","A3A6MEPNP0VYYK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6MEPNP0VYYK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I know it is weird to write a product review about a deodorant, but I feel like I must. I grabbed this on a whim in the drug store because I like dove products & needed something strong to hold up to my new-found gym membership.

"So, I decided to read this book in a fairly unconventional way. I stumbled on this really awesome blog (One Good Book Deserves Another) and she really disliked this book, but loved the next book in the series. So, I decided to get this on the basis of  'how horrible can it be?' Well, to answer that question: Pretty effing horrible.The storyline is completely disjointed. It is transparent the (pretty terrible) 'love' scenes were written first and then a (really terrible) storyline was just added to attempt to create some sort of flow. The outcome is a really bad book, that really should be re-worked or never sold again. Im not sure that I feel comfortable getting the next in the series if the book is going to carry on the same flaws/writing style of the first. Bleh!*spoilers* (aka things that annoyed me)-So friggan trite to play the ""oh, i dont think im pretty"" angle.

"Wednesday:In all honesty, I am only 6% into this book...but Im completely, unabashedly, totally hooked. It made me laugh out loud twice already...on public transportation. It is really REALLY well written. OK, I might be slightly biased, as i am a curvy 33 year old redhead in the process of getting her groove back. I really hope this storyline doesnt go down the s'ter. Will update once fully read.Thursday:32% and I am utterly obsessed. I love everything about this book, it is a little unhealthy. I love the banter between the characters, and it reminds me of when I first met my husband. :D  I even started a spotify playlist based on Grace's musical taste (I really REALLY appreciate the music that is described in the book. Everytime a song is mentioned I pull it up & give it a listen) I am pretty sure Im a huge dork--and not a 'omg, im such a nerd, hehe' type of dork, but a true bonifide 'well that is awkward' type of dork. Im almost tempted to write the author and to thank her for writing the book. I will hold off on that.Friday:67% and reading every free moment I have. Might get fired for devoting so much time perfecting my pinboard featuring Christina Hendricks & Jensen Ackles. Worked out to the Prodigy last night--burned like a gazillion calories. Love this author. Tweeted the author, and she responded. She might be the coolest lady on the planet.Sunday:Finished book on Friday, but have been...ahem...busy. What a fantastic book.

"I have very light & clear Irish skin. Im 33, so I have to use some sort of a primer/bb cream to get that flawless look to compete with the natural glowing skin of the countless 20-somethings running around the streets of Philadelphia (enjoy it while it lasts Bs!!) I have tried several different higher end BB creams including Boscia (my absolute fave), Too Faced & Smashbox. All are VERY nice... but I'm not thrilled with the price at almost $40 a pop; After the very last drop out of my Boscia tube was squeezed out, I neglected to replace it, and instead decided to venture into uncharted territory-a drugstore! (gasp!). Well, I never really got around to it until one lazy Sunday afternoon when I was strolling around my local grocery store, I came upon the L'Oreal Youth Code BB Cream. I thought to myself ""Hey, I need some youthfulness AND BB cream! This is totally cheap at 15 bucks--Im going to try this out. I'm so smart & frugal. Look out younger generation--I've got yr code now!!! YOLO!""(I sort of wish I had made up that last statement for the purposes of this review, but unfortunately, that is my actual thought process/what I possibly said out loud.)The next morning, in a sleepy haze I started to put on my daiy makeup. When I remembered I had the product, I fished it out of the grocery bag, ripped open the box, squeezed out a pea size amount & rubbed it into my face in an upwards motion. It applied easily enough & had a bit of slip to it (plus?), but overall it just kind of sat there and didn't really absorb into my pores. Eh, no bigs, I wasn't expecting the same quality as the products I've used in the past. I felt younger already-sort of like when you buy your first bottle of foundation and you look like a quasi-nutball until you find a shade that makes you look like you're not wearing nutella. Other than that, makeup went on fine, didn't really see a difference during the day either-kinda just felt a little thicker.Fast forward to the end of the week after wearing the BB Cream about 4x. This was when I truly found out what L'Oreal means by Youth Code...hint-It's pimples. Seriously, broke out on my chin, on my cheek, and just for laughs, the tip of my nose. Do you have any idea how ridiculous a pimple on the TIP OF YOUR NOSE looks? ugh.Needless to say, I immediately discontinued using & slam dunked it into the trashcan. Im half-convinced this product was secretly made by Proactive to get you to buy their stuff.BTW, isn't it totally ironic that I had to spend extra money on buying pimple cream/face wash because I didn't want to shell out the cash for a quality product in the first place? Goes to show you, just do it right the first time.  Not all is lost, I do feel a lot younger having to purchase Oxy products while fighting the strange urge to find some Electric Youth perfume & watch Weird Science.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U1T4GKE6LY68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BS9YNC#wasThisHelpful","R1U1T4GKE6LY68","A3A6MEPNP0VYYK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6MEPNP0VYYK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"All of these colors were fan-tab-ulous! I am never ever dissapointed with the quality of China Glaze nail polish, and the colors in this collection are perfect for any fall wardrobe. There are only two weird things about the collection as a whole: #1 Do they represent Hunger Games? Um....not really. I never read the books, but I did watch the movie (surprisinly good, btw) and I did not see any coorelation. No bigs. #2 The collection was released at the beginning of 2012 summer--they are clearly fall colors. I picked them up anyway & kept them for later. Favorite polishes: Fast Track, Smoke & Ashes & Mahogony. Dress Me Up came a close second. HINT! these colors also go super well with the Safari Collection (released shortly after HG collection) So much so, in fact, that I have a sneaking suspicion that these were all apart of the same collection.

"OK, full disclosure: I have wide calves. This means I have a limited amount of options when it comes to adorable rain boots. When I found these on sale at a store that was going out of business, I was ELATED that they fit and looked great. It was the beginning of the summer 2012 when I bought them, so I only wore them about 2Xs, and maybe 6Xs in the Fall and 4xs this Winter. Well, I was just about to order some cute monogram decals from Etsy to add to them, when Whomp! the heel sole pulled away from the rest of the boot! NOOOOOOO! I can hardly believe that they broke after less than a season. I was bummed, but since they were so cute, I figured that I would come onto Amazon & pick up another pair, but I am flabergasted at the price! I want to say I picked them up for about twelve bucks, and that is really all they are worth in my eyes--Im totally debating if I should spend thirty. They are adorable though. If you do decide to get them, just be sure to handle them with kid gloves, and maybe you will get more use out of them. For now, Im going to try to glue them back together--it is a clean rip, so all hope might not be lost.Update 7/24: I used the shoe goo to fix them good as new!

"Just got a 10 week old English Bulldog that has a crazy strong unrelenting bite. After she got ahold of my big toe, I decided it was time to put a stop to the behavior. I ran out and bought this on sale at my local pet store (on sale for a Lincoln)and sprayed it all over me-my arms my hands & most importantly, my toes. The pup got one taste of it and was completely turned off by it. No more biting. I also followed her around and deterred her from chewing other things like wires, the couch, the stairs, the credenza, the puppy gate, teh pillows, a blanket and an ottoman. She likes to chew, but she is still pretty awesome.On the other hand, my mom has three weiner dogs. One of them decided a corner of the wall tasted delicious, so she went out & bought bitter apple. The chewer was thoroughly deterred from chewing, but in a wacky twist of fate, another weiner dog loved the taste--he would sit and lick the walls like a tootsie pop. He is a weird dog though.

"Nothing Special-I did have to clean it becasue it got musty smelling, but other than that, it is just yr run of the mill coffee maker. I long for the days of my K Cup sometimes, but whatever, this will do.Update: 11/29/2012The carafe broke last month. I have never had a carafe shatter, but I guess there is a first time for everything & I cant blame it on the shoddy craftsmanship of Hamilton Beach. It's no big loss though, because the tank was smelling a little off anyway. Since then, I have been using the single brewing side, but Im over it. It is pretty messy to clean the single side filter and the steam even smells. Clean it? oh-great idea-I do. All the time. And it takes forever clean. Spending an hour continuously running water after a vinegar bath thru the machine is no picnic. Ive got episodes of Duck Dynasty to watch. And even after the water is clear, it still tastes a little off within a couple of days. What do I mean by off? Sorta like a sponge that is past its prime. Lame.Getting this coffee maker was a pretty bad decision overall. The quality and width are really not suitable for me.  I only have about 14 inches on my counter for my coffee station, so this has been sitting wonky for the entire time. I suppose if you have a baller kitchen and have enough room it wouldnt be the worst machine for you, but it might look weird to have a cheap machine sitting next to yr viking range across from the subzero fridge. It would probably be better to have this outside of your home theater in that case.In closing,  I was spoiled from a series of Keurigs, and I should have just bought another expensive machine in the first place and not cheaped out on this one. Im getting the new Breville YouBrew, so if anyone is interested in this machine, it will be on the sidewalk shortly. If the YouBrew is bad, im just going to go back to french pressing.

"I found this pattern in my local dollar store, and I cannot tell you how pleased I am with the pattern. I initally purchased to cover a copy paper box that I keep in my office, but the roll keeps going and going! I have covered my light switch, an outlet switch, a pop tarts box and a cereal box, and guess what? i still have a bunch left over! If you are looking for an easy, inexpensive way to bring together small accessories, this is definitely the way to go.

"Hi There! I wanted to have a huge (5ftx3ft) ""Keep Calm and Carry On"" Logo for my office wall. What I did not want was the hundred dollar price tag that Etsy wanted for the Decal.

"I got this as a surprise birthday gift from my husband. I love the look of the firkin (faux birkin) It seems sturdy, but Im sure not to overload it as I know the handles will show wear if I dont take care of it, as I know this by experience with other purses.My one and only complaint, and the reason for the one star deduction is this: Stinky. It has been unseasonably raining in Philly lately, and my bag has gotten wet (not soaked, but rained on) a couple of times, and it has gotten this funk about it. I took out all the contents of the bag & febreezed the bejesus out of the lining and wiped down the outside with some leather wipes. It is still stinky, so I sprayed some Stella Nude into it & put it into a oversized ziplock bag overnight. It is definitely less stinky, but not 100% gone. Weird, I know--but unavoidable unless you treat yr firkin like a quasi-gremlin and avoid getting it wet at all costs. (I havent given it food after midnight, so i dont know if that will affect it at all)Update 01/29/2013 I used this bag maybe 1x a month, and the other day I noticed the handles are ripping, the bottom leather has scuffed off and the lock has lost its luster. I am not overly tough on my bags, but I think this one just has mediocre quality. Not sure if it is worth the price at this point. oh, it is also still a smidge stinky.Update 04/18/2013: Guess what? Used some Shoe Goo to fix the handle! Good as new....well, the lock lost it's luster, but Sorta good as new.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2888HI9PRM4O7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003GQZ4WY#wasThisHelpful","R2888HI9PRM4O7","A3A6MEPNP0VYYK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A6MEPNP0VYYK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have have my echo for a few months.I am listening to more music than ever because it is so easy to ask Alexa to play songs or playlists. I pay spotify and I can play spotify through the echo but more often I am accessing Amazon prime music and music from my Amazon cloud which has every song I've ever bought from Amazon on cd or a record album ( they automatically give you an electronic copy of all that)The whole family uses Alexa to add items to the store list. Even family members who are worried about the rise of the machines like the store list feature. I keep the hand held remote control at the other end of the house so I can items when I'm out of her range. Then at the grocery store you open the echo app and check off the items. Or you can order them through Amazon through the app. ( it's definitely an Amazon shopping portal but that's ok by me )I love the news briefing feature which can be customized.The weather forecast is perfect. Accurate and just the information you need.Alexa is easier to talk to than Siri but Alexa only knows Wikipedia and you have to ask questions in a certain way to get the information you want. We find she is getting better at this data retrieval task.I ask her to read my book to me and my audible book starts off where I left off ( in the audible voice ). Then my phone knows that she read some and takes over at that spot.In the winter I used the traffic feature.I recently found that she could not pronounce the name of a nearby town and so I emailed Amazon through the echo app and they emailed back that they are teaching her that word. ( this showed me the need for the slow roll out process )I'd like to have another echo at work. I'm not sure when we can start buying additional units.I talk really fast but Alexa can usually understand what I'm saying except when happy hour gets carried away then forget about it. She can't understand me at all after a couple drinks.It's fun to talk to her about random things to see what she has learned. We just discovered that she knows the Game of Thrones. She'll quote Star Trek lines to you if you say ""live long and prosper"". She knows some famous movie one liners. She can tell jokes.She can reorder stuff for you from Amazon if you've already ordered it once before. You can buy songs through her.The quality of the speaker itself is very nice. You just ask her to turn herself up or down for volume control.Basically I'm over the moon with this thing.one night I was on my way to bed saying the usual good nights to the family and the dogs and on a lark I said ""Alexa, good night"" she said "" don't let the bed bugs bite"". Cracked me up.We changed our wifi router and she knew she wasn't connected any more and told me what to do to fix her. ( this stuff all freaks my wife out but I think it's great )Bottom line, if you have an Amazon prime account you will cetainly get your money's worth out of this just with the music selection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AKV7JLJBG85N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9EOQCO#wasThisHelpful","R1AKV7JLJBG85N","A2KFAEOHLMLX0H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KFAEOHLMLX0H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

(You only have 3 seconds to make a first impression so I'm trying to establish why I think I am so wise in the ways of beer and qualified to review things dealing with beer and wenches)My wife follows this author's web postings. I'd never heard of her before this book. The writing is very funny. The book is easy to understand and I think it is put together in a useful manner.This book does not have recipes for making beer. It has recipes for cocktails that have beer as an ingredient. It has recipes for food cooked with beer as an ingredient and it discusses beer and food pairings. As I read the book I found myself dog earring many pages containing recipes.This is one book where I'm inclined to recommend considering the kindle version. So when you're out at a brew pub you have the information at your finger tips and when cooking recipes you can set up your electronic device to view the book.

"Took an hour to assemble. You are supposed to let the battery charge for 18 hours before using it the first time. I charged it for 16 and it seemed to work fine.

When the accelerator is disengaged, the wheels can still roll but there is some resistance. There is no brake petal. It stops when you take your foot off the gas.After it's together it is very easy to pick up and move. It's not that heavy just bulky.It ships in a large cardboard box. We didn't have to sign for it.It comes with a wrench but you'll still need a Phillips screw driver and an adjustable wrench for assembly. The instructions are easy to follow.The wheels are plastic with 'treads' that make it drive fine on rough ground. We tried the yard and a very rough parking lot.

"I work all day and night with Dell PCs and laptops and a few chromebooks. This is the first Lenovo product I have used. If you put these same specs into a Dell you'd pay much more so this is a good value. The materials on this Lenovo are similar to Dell's Inspirion line. The unit feels solid.The display handles true 1920 x 1080. The wireless is a/c. Back lit keyboard. Speakers are on the bottom of the base and the sound is good even when folded upon itself.The cursor continues to freeze. The touch pad becomes unresponsive until I hit the alt key. This could possibly be a windows 8 issue but the touchpad looks a little indented at the top to me so i'm not really sure if it's hardware or software but it's a pain in the neck. Also when i'm in tablet or touch mode and the focus is in a data entry field I have to ask the keyboard to come up and display. On an ipad, for example, this happens automatically. Also in table mode the virtual keyboard does not have a windows key which is also a problem.The real keyboard has a number pad. The spacing and feel of the keys is fine for typing at length.No dvd/cd drive.The touch screen is responsive. I was playing Hearthstone for an hour and I kept switching back and forth from laptop and touchpad to tablet and touch screen and it was seamless. The game switched from laptop to tablet during the game with no lag or glitching. The Lenovo never got hot even after an hour of playing.With the display on bright and a game going the battery ran down a fast clip. You have to sit near an outlet.Windows 8 is what it is. Once you get used to it .... well I wouldn't really know because even after all this time I'm still not used to it but i've learned to tolerate it. This comes with a bunch of Lenovo apps installed.When i'm at home I generally use my ipad for everything. However I find myself picking up this touchscreen laptop more and more. I really like the display for games and videos. It is very thin and light weight even though it's 15.6"". I like typing on it.  It's is versatile.

"This diaper bag with built in changing pad is a great idea well executed.The coloring and style of the bag is perfect because it is grown ups who carry the supplies so it makes sense to style the equipment in a more mature way instead of in all baby colors and designs.The bag has pockets and fits more than you might think based on the messenger bag like shape.Also, when you dont need it for baby any longer you can use it for your laptop or tablet.

"The bad news, imo, is that there is no mention of Serial or Invisibilia. As amazing as Serial was, Invisibilia is even better. Talk about story telling and driveway moments. I assume that's because a graphic novel takes long to put together. This one says since February 2012. Also I assume there is no mention of these shows because ""editing"". Anyway, if you love story telling look into the podcasts for Invisibilia. And you're welcome!Anyways, the good news is that there is lots of red meat in this weird book. It's about 200 pages and of course it's hand drawn pictures and speech bubbles. It takes a good amount of time to digest all the information.This is the sort of book that's tough to pass on even though I really enjoyed it. ""I just read this really interesting book."" ""What's it about?"" ""Behind the scenes at public radio."" ""Pass."" ""There's pictures?"" ...When you are an NPR junkie, all week you keep boring your friends by trying to retell them the stories you heard.

"I have over a dozen bird feeders and I have tried every style of Niger feeder. Stainless steel with small holes, all kinds of bags and plastic feeders. The squirrels love the bag type. The birds hated the metal type. And the plastic ones never last but I've decided they are the best option because at some point I always end up with clumped Niger seed and the feeder is dirty and gross and just needs to be replaced. So I get this basic style every time now. This looks nice. I think the yellow attracts the goldfinches (just my opinion) and they are very affordable so I don't mind if I just get one or two seasons out it.

We see multiple new movies every week.This was our favorite movie of the year for sure. We watched this movie three times in one weekend. While we watch lots of movies there are not many that we re-watch like that.We just couldn't stop talking about it and pointing things out to each other and simultaneously knew we had to re-watch. The second viewing we asked our 18 year old son to join us. He noticed things we hadn't. Later that same weekend after more discussion and reading about the director/writer (she's new) we watched it one more time.Thanks to Amazon for having the movie available. We were upset that our local art house theaters had not shown this Australian film yet. I assume it will eventually show itself.

"The main character's real name is Hild. Hild was a real young woman who we know a little bit about. I recently read an almost 600 page book by Nicola Griffith who basically took what is written about this historical figure (very little) and fleshed out a story around that. That book was challenging to read but very engrossing. ""Half the World"" took the character of Hild and let her be much more of a tom boy and this story was not challenging to read. It was a page turner. I did not read the first book in this trilogy and I still loved this story. I never felt lost but I can't wait to get caught up by reading the first book now.I love most things Viking and everything with strong female characters and this book is all of that with a good sense of humor and adventure inside a very entertaining story.There was a strong Karate Kid vibe, but with female characters and it's very groovy. BTW there is nothing here that should turn off male readers but hooray for all the chicks who kick butt in this story.There is a relationship between the young female lead character and a male character. It is sexual but not graphic at all. There is some mild cursing. Appropriate Viking curses, again nothing extreme.I am recommending this book to the same people I recommended the Hunger Games when I found it. Also my 18 year old son loves GOT and Patrick Rothfuss so I ordered him the first book (Half a King).As I read I could see and hear the characters easily. Basically it was a joy to read and I highly recommend it. I laughed often while reading. This is a smartly written story that is accessable to all readers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJOI5P6LC8JT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178429#wasThisHelpful","RJOI5P6LC8JT6","A2KFAEOHLMLX0H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KFAEOHLMLX0H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have what I think are normal size female hands and I find these pruners to be a smidge challenging to get a good grip on. So I choke up on them and I think due to physics that means I have to exert more pressure when pruning but I can usually get through the branch in one squeeze.The pruners do cut cleanly. They cut nicer on an angle.

"I always wash my car by driving through the local laser wash. I have a Subaru. My understanding is that if you have a very expensive car you would never use a laser wash. I have no qualms using one on my car. I'm generally just interested in getting off winter salt and such things.I used this 303 spray on my car AFTER going through the car wash and I got LOTS of dirt off my car. It was very easy to use. It smells awesome. It worked great on the plastic parts on the front and back of the car.It did not take off the license plate dirt.

"To my way of thinking the only reason someone would consider a review of Far Cry 4 is if they have not played previous Far Cry game. This bogus debate of Far Cry 3.5 is nonsense because if you played Far Cry 3 then you loved Far Cry 3 and why would you not want more of the same but amped up.If you have never played Far Cry and you are considering it for your new PS4 console then the answer is YES. Other people in the house will be walking by the display and stopping to watch your game play as if it was the movie of the week.If you've never played Far Cry this is a really nice mix of story and mission and activity. Did you like Red Dead and Uncharted? Of course you did so you will like this blend of tower structures, camping, hunting, shooting, family drama engaging story line.The co-op play with option for 10 friends is awesome.

"Let me start this review by stating that Focusrite has top-notch customer service...and that's pretty hard to find in this day and age.I had an issue with the connectivity between the iTrack Pocket and the Impact for Focusrite App. Specifically, I wasn't seeing an icon on the app that I should have been seeing, when I plugged in an electric instrument. I emailed Chris (whose email address is on the enclosed documentation) and he responded within an hour-and-a-half. He said he believed I had a defective cable and said he would send one immediately via Priority Mail. That was on a Friday. By Tuesday, my new cable arrived (from California to Pennsylvania). Kudos to a company who cares about the consumer and not just the number of units they sell. That is a huge plus!Now on to my review. I'll begin with the Cons, which are minimal and are nothing that would discourage me from purchasing this product. They do not affect the performance of the device. They could be considered by Focusrite as opportunities for improvement.•First, I am using an iPhone 5S and I have a protective cover on it. This cover does not add much thickness to my phone, but in order to place it in the device slot on the iTrack Pocket I had to remove the cover which was quite difficult. In designing this device it would have been nice if the slot was a little deeper to accommodate phone covers.•I had to register the device and open an account in order to access the user guide. Based on the simplicity of the device, an enclosed user booklet would have been nice.Now for the Pros: I have to say, without reserve, that the iTrack Pocket is the coolest little device on the market for people who like to record videos without going through the trouble of setting up web cams or cameras and microphones. It is very portable and can travel virtually anywhere. It is also very affordable.•In essence, the iPhone is the video camera and the iTrack Pocket is the microphone. It is a hands-down better microphone than the one built into the iPhone.•The video quality is very good. Of course, this has to do with the superior camera in the iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 lines. I emailed a clip to myself and noticed the video quality had degraded somewhat from the original clip, although the sound quality was still there, which I credit to the function of the iTrack Pocket. I haven't tried posting to Youtube and probably never will as I plan to use this device as a self-monitoring tool (to make sure I'm not making funny faces when I play). Therefore, I don't know if there will be degrading of the video if it's uploaded to Youtube.•I tested the sound using electric and acoustic mandolins and I have to admit I was pretty impressed in both scenarios. The microphone was surprisingly good at capturing sound. The sound from eight feet away sounded as good as it did at 2 feet. I also did a clip of just me talking and I was also pretty impressed with the quality of the sound. The microphone is really sensitive so you have to pay attention to gain, which you can control via the levels dial on the side of the iTrack Pocket. A red light will come on if levels are not properly adjusted. I tested this by recording while the red light was on and during playback I noticed the sound of the TV from two rooms away as well as a static-sounding distortion to the instrument sound. So don't forget to verify your levels before starting to record.•The input jack for electric guitar (or in my case, an electric Mandolin) is pretty awesome. I was very surprised at the quality of the recording. After you plug you electric instrument into the iTrack Pocket and launch the Impact App, you will see a guitar icon. Pressing on this will bring up the option to record in the following modes: Stereo Mic, Guitar & Mic and Guitar. You can also choose to use or not use headphones. Finally, there are three ""Amplifier"" options (in addition to recording ""clean""): Twin (with sliders for Drive and Reverb), Brit (with sliders for Drive and Delay) and V-AC (with sliders for Drive and Reverb). Not being an expert in sound engineering, I played around with these setting and managed to come up with some pretty off-the-wall sounds on an electric mandolin. I was happy with recording using my acoustic and electric mandolins, but I have to admit I will stick primarily to acoustic recording. I am getting an electric UBass for Christmas, so I'll be looking forward to trying that out using the input jack.•The editing controls, while minimal, are pretty cool. The Impact app allows you scroll through the editing options based on what you're doing. Editing consists of ""Enhance"" and ""Compress""  sliders and the ""Fx"" which adjusts sound based on what you're editing. There are editing options for Acoustic Guitar (or other acoustic instrument): Fx controls are Small Room, Big Room, Chorus, Echo and None;  Guitar and Vocal: Fx controls are Small Room, Medium Room, Big Room and None; Electric Guitar (or other input device): Fx controls are Small Room, Echo, Large Room, Large Echo and None; Female Vocal and Male Vocal: Fx controls are Doubler, Huge Chorus, Big Room and None.The effects are pretty cool and I can see kids going wild over adding effects. For what I was doing, I adjusted the ""Enhance"" slider and kept the ""Fx"" at None which, in my opinion resulting in a sound with a little more bass.•The Impact for Focusrite app is user friendly. The bar graphmeter and the red light on the front of the iTrack Pocket let you know if you're getting into trouble with sound gain. As I stated before, you can then make adjustments with the gain control dial on the side of the iTrack Pocket. After making sound adjustments you can hit the ""clip editor"" icon in the lower right of the screen and video frames appear along the top of the screen and you simply use the sliders to clip off the beginning and end of you video where you're reaching to start and stop the recording. I have found that it's more effective to clip the recording using the sound line at the bottom instead of the clip line at the top.There's one other thing that's neither a pro nor a con and that has to do with the start / stop button. It's a little small, so I found myself getting very close to the screen to see if the timer has started. I finally noticed that when the device starts recording, the little white circle in the red button turns into a white square. There's a tip that will make starting and stopping your recording a little easier.The iTrack Pocket can also function in another capacity. From a psychological perspective, recording oneself and getting comfortable with seeing oneself on recordings can be a true confidence booster and can go a long way in overcoming performance anxiety. I just had to add that because there are many musicians dealing with confidence and/or performance anxiety issues.All-in-all, I must say this is this year's must-have device. It is  a really cool, handy device for the money. I would highly recommend this device for people who are just beginning to dabble in sound and video recording, for people who put lots of music video out on Youtube and want a quick and easy way to do it or for people like me who just want to monitor their playing and presence.

Buy one now...you won't be sorry!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E0MGI6KELMYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NB42FTG#wasThisHelpful","R3E0MGI6KELMYJ","A2KFAEOHLMLX0H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KFAEOHLMLX0H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I think Wolf Winter is a perfect winter blizzard book. For Summer beach reading I grab light easy reading because the book has to go well with the weather and the abundance of summer cocktails. Winter has the advantage of pairing with dark roast Swedish coffee, and a caffeinated brain can handle more meaty reading.Wolf Winter hits me in all my sweet spots. Strong female characters, suspense, fantasy (of the magic variety), survival skills, and lots of snow. I read many nordic noir stories and also historical fiction and this is a nice balanced blend of the two.So basically this is a murder mystery with very nice turns and twists. The setting is as important as the plot. The characters, some are alive and some are not, are drawn in what I think is a typical Scandinavian style in that you get to know these people in small bits and pieces over time.The year is 1717 and the politics of the time and place are important to the story but the writer leaves the boring details out altogether. That was ok with me. There is plenty of revelations and clues and secrets and hauntings to fill out the story. Lots of characters considering the setting but it was never too complicated to keep them all straight.There is a scene in the book with a snow blizzard and an explanation to clear off the porch every time the snow on the window sill reaches an inch. Otherwise they'd be snowed in and wouldn't be able to open the front door. This is the same week in New York state the lake effect snow dumped 6 feet and the news showed photos of a dog who wanted to go out but couldn't because there was a wall of snow behind the front door.It isn't good when we forget the old ways and this is one of the main morals of this book.For readers who care, there is no swearing and no sex on screen. It's a murder mystery with ghosts but it's not a gory horror book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22JCA7BSPN0Z7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1602862524#wasThisHelpful","R22JCA7BSPN0Z7","A2KFAEOHLMLX0H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KFAEOHLMLX0H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a bridge camera with a 60x zoom which is great for birding photos. I I also have an iPhone that takes fantastic photos when I'm not out birding.But when I want a good snapshot of a face, human or dog, I reach for this camera.  It's perfect for faces. And for vistas, landscapes. It takes perfect videos. It focuses very fast. It feels good in my hand. It is very light weight. It takes great photos very fast and very easy.I used to have a manual film canon and I took a ton of photos and developed my own slides for a time. Learning what all the buttons and menus do on the digital canon takes some trial and error and rereading of the manual. The camera takes great photos on all auto but learning the manual opens up many more options for good photos that are in challenging lighting or have other issues.Next stop a 70-300mm lens.This kit comes with everything you need to get started except for a memory card. I bought a 32gb sandisk sdhc for about $20 on amazon. The lithium battery needs to charge before using.

"The Energy Suspension Urethane bushings # 9.8107R (Red) and 9.8107G (Black) are practically indestructable, and will last for many miles/years. I have used them off-road on 2 different Land Cruisers, and for highway use on large Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury sedans -- they also fit Camaro and Firebird ('82-'02), as well as many other applications. The bushings will out-last the shocks, and can be re-used when the shocks are replaced. Urethane shock bushings are far superior to the rubber type, and help to keep your shocks attached firmly and your car, truck, or off-road vehicle's suspension tight and under control. When installing new shocks, remove the original rubber bushings and install these.

"We got sick & tired of paying $4 to $5 per loaf for edible bread, so the Kitchen Goddess and I decided to make our own. After consulting with our Italian breadmaking friends and a few recipe sources, including Cuisinarts, we started our list of necessary ingredients. I guess we should call our bread ""Amazon Italian"", since many of the ingredients and utensils used were bought here at Amazon.  Yeast - Fleischmann's Active Dry Yeast -- the same great stuff that our mothers and grandmothers used.  Flour - King Arthur Bread Flour -- unbleached. Premium high-protein flour. Made in USA since 1790.  Agave Nectar -- used in place of cane sugar.  Water -- Double-Charcoal-Filtered.  Salt -- Himalayan Grinder salt.  Oil -- Garlic-Infused Avocado oil used in place of extra-virgin olive oil. The above ingredients were purchased at Amazon. Flour, salt, and yeast were sifted together with an OXO Good Grips ""Shaker"" sifter. Bread was baked on Farberware ""No-Stick"" Baking Pan. Silicone Baking Sheet from Artisan Metal Works kept the bread from sticking, without the need for a corn-meal ""dusting"". The above utensils were purchased at Amazon. Using Amazon-purchased ingredients and utensils and a combination of recipes, we made 2 beautiful loaves of Crusty Italian Bread -- with excellent color, texture, and flavor. The Fleischmann's Yeast worked perfectly -- easy to measure, easy to store, and completely worry-free. Refrigerate after opening. The 4-oz. jar = 16 envelopes.

"The Samsung 16GB Micro SDHC is the perfect card for the Garvin 66LMT -- it can and will handle any and all updates to the software for years to come.

This Samsung EVO Class 10 card is big enough and fast enough to get the job done well -- and at a minumum of expense.

"Found this Cordless Dremel tool as a replacement for a 25-year-old corded model, and the new 8100-N/21 fits my needs and my budget perfectly.Comes with a black plastic case, one (1) Lithium-ion battery, a quick charger, and a bag of assorted sanding/grinding/polishing accessories.

"These tough, inexpensive black plastic wire separators are the perfect choice for keeping your ignition wires separated and neatly in place.They snap on easily, and help to keep your wires looking neat and away from hot manifolds and moving linkage. High-voltage ignition wires need to be kept separated to avoid power-robbing cross-fire, and these looms do the job cheaply and effectively. The separators fit and hold 7mm and 8mm wires firmly in place while they tidy up the engine compartment.

"Still learning about my Garmin 66LMT, but it looks really good, so far !! I programed a 30-mile trip into it, and it got me there quickly and with no fuss or muss -- or any voices yelling out ""recalculating"", as so many others have complained about. The 6-inch (diagonal) screen is easy to read, with real-time elevation, posted speed limits, current vehicle speed, over-speed warning, up-ahead direction indicator, distance before turns, and a legible map were just a few of the features that make for easy navigation -- and without all the usual ""Oh, s**t, we missed the off-ramp!"" exclamations along the way !! Example: Samantha says ""Three-quarters of a mile ahead, turn right onto 75th Avenue."" -- which gives me a plenty of time to get in the proper lane. Wife and I both liked the clear, well-enunciated voice (Samantha) -- and the timely, easy-to-follow instructions that she gave. What we liked most about our new gizmo was the ""HOME"" button -- the machine knows where we live, and it took us there quickly and by a very convenient route. It has a ""qwerty"" keyboard and a numbers pad, so entering info while on the road is quick and easy -- but PLEASE don't attempt it while driving !!

"I read a ton of reviews regarding the compatability of the  GN097-USB mount with various models of the Garmin gps, and considered many pros and cons before deciding on a course of action when mounting a Garmin 66 LMT in my Mercury Grand Marquis. The GN097-USB is listed by Garmin as ""incompatible"" with models that employ the ""LMT"" features, (= Lifetime Maps/Traffic) because the USB doesn't deliver enough power to meet the requirements of the ""LMT"" features -- the power cord that comes with the Garmin unit DOES deliver adequte power, so here's what I did: I bought the USB mount, and cut off the USB cord flush with the stalk. When fully extended (straight), the mount measures 8 1/4 inches overall, but the plugged-in length is 6 1/2 inches. The mount plugs directly into the cigar lighter, and stands straight up out of the ash tray/cupholder, so there is no wiggling, jiggling, or flopping around. The charger that comes with the Garmin 66LMT plugs into an under-dash power supply (cigar lighter type) and feeds the Garmin plenty of power to supply the Updates/Maps/Traffic information that the USB cord can't cope with. The modified USB mount is less bulky than the regular GN097, which has the plug-in socket on the side of the stalk, where it is clumsy and cumbersome -- Cutting off the USB cord makes the whole installation neater and cleaner-looking from all angles, and it allows full access to the heater/AC controls. I modified the Arkon Mount even further, by removing the adjustment screw and knob that connects the upper and lower parts of the mount. An 8 1/2 inch length of 3/4 inch Schedule 40 PVC pipe was added between the upper and lower sections, which made the Garmin stand up higher where it could be more visible and easier to read. Two wraps of 3M electrician's tape around each section made for a snug fit when pressed into the PVC pipe. 2 coats of black paint for the PVC pipe, and the modified Arkon Mount gives me the height and stability that I need -- with no flimsy wires, no suction cups, no blocking of air vents, no flopping around, no bulkiness, and all the power I'll ever need to quickly charge the Garmin's battery and drive those LMT options !!Note: The LMT features take up most of the internal memory, so an additional Micro-card is recommended. Garmin Support suggests a 16MB Micro-card as the largest size that is practical, and that a 32MB card is the MAXIMUM size that the unit will accept. I opted for the recommended 16GB Micro-card, which should cover all info and updates for several years. A shake-down cruise with the Garmin 66LMT and the modified GN-097 USB mount was a great success -- The mount was sturdy and steady, with no shaking or flopping around. Wire from 66LMT to under-dash power supply left the area neat and uncluttered. The whole deal is easy to remove and stash neatly in the glove box. I searched high and low for a mount that would fit my needs exactly, and the Arkon GN097 USB was as close as I could get. A bit of tinkering, and I got exactly what I wanted. Give it a try, and see for yourself !!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGGG5T47H8G7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001US4RUA#wasThisHelpful","RGGG5T47H8G7M","APKBGB3JBWL5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APKBGB3JBWL5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You will need a hydraulic jack and a clean, flat surface and 4 jack stands to support the vehicle. You'll need a 1/4-inch electric drill-- and a small jar of Vaseline (to hold small parts in place). I use a Craftsman ""clicker"" torque wrench (inch/pound type) to be sure of proper torque on all bolts. Over-tightening of the bolts can warp the valve body and ruin the tranny and all your work. B&M suggests that you have 10 quarts of the proper type of trans fluid on hand. I drained the torque converter, too -- so it took 12.5 quarts to bring the level back to ""Full"". Put the 10 quarts in first, and add the rest after the trans is fully warmed up. Check the fluid level with engine fully warmed up (driven for 10 miles), and DO NOT OVER-FILL !! I spent the extra dough to get Mobil 1 Synthetic Trans Fluid -- Amazon's price was better than the local shops. These transmissions are electronically controlled by the ECM (computer) -- To avoid electrical problems with computer-controlled devices, disconnect the NEGATIVE battery cable before work begins! Review the included instructions CAREFULLY before beginning -- the list of required tools is short, but be SURE to have the proper snap-ring pliers on hand !! ALL of the necessary drill bits are included in the kit, but you'll only need the 5/64ths drill bit for the ""RV-Heavy Duty"" option. Handle ALL parts carefully, being careful to avoid any source of dirt/debris. This entire job CAN be completed in one day -- but I allow an extra few hours to take extra care and avoid being rushed. I had already installed a B&M Drain Plug Kit, so the job of changing the fluid and filter wouldn't be messy. Be careful to SAVE the original (RE-USEABLE) pan gasket -- clean it carefully with WD-40 before re-installing. Some brands of Trans Filters come with a cork gasket, but these things are a nasty mess to install, and even worse to remove at your next filter change!! I recommend using the Motorcraft FT100 Automatic Transmission Filter - it's of premium quality, Made in the USA, and available at Amazon. Re-use the original gasket for best results !! Use diesel fuel to clean all parts -- it's cheap and non-explosive !! I have installed the same and similar B&M Kits in the Ford C-6 and the 4R70W automatic transmissions with excellent results. The Kit comes with complete instructions, but you can print a copy of the instructions (downloaded the PDF from JEGS.com) to study while you're waiting for your kit to arrive -- it'll help you line up the job and to have the necessary stuff on hand before you start work.Good Luck !! Update: Using the ""RV-Heavy Duty"" option, a Shake-Down cruise on city streets, freeways, and some mountain driving showed impressive improvements over the stock transmission -- shifting was firm and positive, on both the up-shift and the down-shift. The most noticable improvement was in the feel of the trans during mountain driving -- a better feeling of being ""connected"" to the road. Didn't do ""before & after"" timing runs, but the car felt a bit quicker under acceleration. Will need to run several tanks of gas through it before checking for mileage improvements.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R66U4NWD0BNKD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CIKC3U#wasThisHelpful","R66U4NWD0BNKD","APKBGB3JBWL5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APKBGB3JBWL5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the price, these earbuds have surprisingly rich sound. Vocals are clear, highs are crisp. Bass is adequate, but not thundering. If you're a hip hop fan, you might want just a little bit more.The overall quality is very good (as has been the case for all Mengo products I've tested). I have an ear where I'm missing much of the tragus (the little flap that's closest to your cheeks), so many earbuds don't stay put in my ear - the iPhone buds are the worst and slip off immediately. Thankfully, the Mengos stay put very well thanks to several earbud options of different sizes and shapes.The wires also seem to be reinforced and give it a nice high-quality feel. There is an inline button and a mic. The button does not control volume. One tap pauses a song. Two taps skips forward one track. Holding it button engages the voice command on my LG G3 phone. The sound quality during a call is very good. Unfortunately, there is no clip on the mic, so you really need to hold it up to your mouth for the other party to hear you clearly.Overall, this is a great pair of everyday earbuds! I've owned may earphones that cost under $20, and this one has some of the best sound in that category.I received a highly discounted sample in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XACB73F10QG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZJ7CFW0#wasThisHelpful","R1XACB73F10QG1","AF3BYMPWKWO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF3BYMPWKWO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a pretty small bag of kale chips. Kale is costlier than potatoes, so it's not a fair comparison to say that this is an expensive product. If you're used to buying ""superfoods"" that are organic, the cost is par for these products.I tested the Kool Ranch flavor. Don't expect it to taste like Doritos. The ranch flavor is subtle, but the overall flavor is more complex than I was expecting. I liked the flavor, but I like kale, and the other ingredients these chips contain: kale, sunflower seeds, tahini, carrot, cane sugar, apple cider vinegar, onion, seal salt, lemon juice, dill weed, garlic, white pepper. I wish they had left out the sugar since this product doesn't need it. The garlic and onion taste like the powder forms, and could have been used more judiciously to let the kale flavor be more prominent.The texture of these chips is thick and hearty and I did enjoy it, along with the crunch. It's not the lightweight homemade version of kale chips. Unfortunately, these chips are also a bit fragile, and my bag had too many crushed up small pieces.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7U4Q9PEO6H5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2RRWNG#wasThisHelpful","R7U4Q9PEO6H5S","AF3BYMPWKWO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF3BYMPWKWO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The design is classic and the wipers make good contact with the glass for clean wipes without streaks.

"I've been using palm sugar (aka coconut sugar, jaggery, etc.) for many years. I love its rich complex flavor and subtler sweetness compared to table sugar. But a lot of palm sugar comes in hard chunks that have to be shaved or hacked off to be used. And it doesn't dissolve readily either.This palm syrup tastes every bit as good as the solid stuff, but is much easier to use. If you've never had palm sugar, it tastes similar to brown sugar but more complex. I like to use it in cocktails based on rum or whiskey, instead of a simple syrup. It gives the drink more depth. It also has a lower glycemix index than table sugar - but that doesn't necessarily make it healthy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UV6A0CVHY9WA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y1C8G7W#wasThisHelpful","R1UV6A0CVHY9WA","AF3BYMPWKWO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF3BYMPWKWO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While our little one, Gomez, is too small for such complicated assembly sets, we decided to give our twin nephews, Marcus and Brad, the KForce Build and Blast and let them have at it! With nearly 400 pieces and six different ways to assemble the thing - including two guns, which of course the nine-year-old boys immediately wanted to build - we suggest you make sure you keep the long instructions AND the box for the final pictures.And given our Texas locale, the boys were right at home tearing through the streets with their newly built guns, and proud of what they built. But it wasn't easy and it didn't happen fast.If you're looking for the assembly challenge of Legos, the engineering and movement of erectors and, you know, the blast 'em in the face of Nerfs, well the KForce might be for you.But it took a long time, and some slightly frazzled kids (not to mention adults) to figure it out. And the set doesn't have its own containment case, so once it starts getting pulled apart - and heaven help you if the pieces get mixed in with the Legos - well, it's time to throw up your hands and just try to build a truck or something out of the remaining parts. Still, my understanding is that this set is easier to put together then some other K'Nex sets, like the Ferris wheel.By the way, two things to add so you're not surprised. The cross bow is not actually a functioning cross bow, it just looks like one. And be warned, the KForce shoots 75 feet! That's a lot of power, even for a soft dart. At one of two feet, that thing hurts. We know this by experience as the first person my nephew shot was me.

"For a battery powered chainsaw, this is pretty good. It's lightweight and great for small jobs. I've cut logs up to 6"" thick with it without issues. It's nice to have a battery powered chainsaw for its portability, but you do trade power for it. It includes a battery and a charger, though the battery can be charged on the saw itself.The construction of the saw is not the best. The plastic feels thin and bends while using. It has stayed together but I'm doubtful about the longevity of this unit. The chain blades also aren't that sharp, though they were adequate for my needs. Still, I would prefer a sharper blade and might consider sharpening these.There are other cordless chainsaw choices out there. Scotts isn't really known for power tools. And with cordless tools, the battery is usually quite valuable and it makes sense to stick to one brand's line of cordless tools to take advantage of battery interchangeability. Since Scotts doesn't have that many power tools available, I would consider a chainsaw from Black & Decker instead of this one (they have a 10"" saw for about the same price as this). B&D has many more cordless tools in their inventory that you could use their battery with.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FQQWEUXKIF31/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LVT18I2#wasThisHelpful","R2FQQWEUXKIF31","AF3BYMPWKWO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF3BYMPWKWO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this to make high extraction flour from whole wheat that I mill myself. I had tried a Winco 22-mesh sieve before and it was letting too much bran through. This 50-mesh sieve is perfect for keeping the bran out and results in a very fine high extraction flour. I had debated between a 50 and 70 mesh and am happy with the 50-mesh for my needs. I feel like with a 70-mesh, it would be very difficult and time-consuming to sift the flour through.The overall quality is good and the size is perfect for me (I do large batch sizes).

"Things I liked:- Good thickness- Felt like it had a solid foam core - could tell there were multiple layers of foam used- Good length, could be used for someone taller- Well cushioned. My hands and feet really sunk into it, kind of like with a memory foam mattress- The underside was pretty grippy, which was better than the top side with the logo on it.Things I didn't like:- Very slippery and shiny. Odd since they bill this as a ""non-slip"" mat.- Intense new mat smell. Hope this dissipates over the next few weeks- Wasn't much different overall from the starter cheapy mat I bought at a yoga studio - same materials, just a little thicker and a little more slippery on the top sideIn regards to grip, I would give my Jade Harmony yoga mat a 9 out of 10, and a regular Gaiam mat a 6 out of 10.  The back of this one I would give a 7 or an 8 out of ten, but the top side I would give a 5 or 6 out of 10.

"I've only tried this and another, headset but that one had to be connected to the phone with a wire. So right away I liked that there were no wires to deal with thanks to the Bluetooth connection. I quickly glanced at the manual, turned it on and started using it - it was very easy to pair and use. As for the quality, it's decent. It took me a little while to get used to the fact that you have ear buds on and this means that you don't hear everything that goes on around you like the sound of traffic and other exterior noises. I just make a mental note to be a bit more aware when I have the headset on. The earbuds were a little snug on my ears and hurt a bit, but I have small ears so that might not be a problem for others. As for sound quality, it's decent. It is not as clear as when I am talking in the phone directly, but it's clear enough to have a conversation while driving on the highway. Family members at the other end did note that I sounded like I was on speakerphone. One issue I ran into was how to store the device without breaking it.

"I love the smell of this soap. The lavender is pronounced, but the sage doesn't smell like Thanksgiving stuffing...it's more spicy smelling. A half push will be plenty of soap for washing hands.

My hand is left feeling slightly moistened, but not overly so.

"I was surprised at how big this oven is, because I thought it would be closer to a normal toaster oven size. But it holds a real 12"" pizza, which is great. The selling point of this oven is that it can get to 600F, which is great for cooking up fresh dough pizzas, but not as much for thicker frozen pizzas. The high heat setting on a thick pizza will burn the outside before the inside is cooked. But that setting works adequately for thin crust frozen pizzas, as long as you watch the pie and turn it once or more to get the right amount of crispiness without burning. The rear of the oven runs hotter than the front, probably because there is additional reflected heat from the rear wall - pretty common in all ovens without convection.  Speaking of which, a convection setting would have made this oven perfect and able to cook pizzas even faster.I think the strength of this oven is in cooking fresh homemade New York style pizzas (a thinner crust that might have a little bit of sugar and oil in it to help with browning). The high heat and low profile chamber gives it a nice rise and bits of browning on the cheese, better than in an unmodified full size oven. The oven does not get hot enough for Neapolitan-style pizza.Ultimately, this is a dedicated machine for mostly pizzas. It's not as versatile as a pizza oven. maybe you can make cookies with the lower setting. It's big and gets pretty hot on the outside and requires quite a bit of dedicated space.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YOMWFB58EIM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2OZM66#wasThisHelpful","R1YOMWFB58EIM8","AF3BYMPWKWO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF3BYMPWKWO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well known in the recording industry, Tascam delivers a multi-purpose home recording cardioid condenser for the budget-minded.Utilizing an 18mm diaphragm, larger than the majority of the Tascam microphone line, frequency response is stated being very wide at 20hz-20khz. This combined with the circuit design produces an equalization profile relatively even up to mids around 1khz, with boosts starting at 6.5khz to 10khz, rolling off noticeably upward. Lack of a pad is somewhat made up forby a stated SPL of 136dB, which adds to the options one can record.Sources such as cymbals came through well with upper register accents, and string instruments produce a defined body. Mid and high response can compliment higher range voices, although a low cut switch would be a great addition to clean up excess low end frequencies. The aluminium body construction is solid, but out-of-studio use would not be recommended. Overall the microphone makes a good complement to other mics due to the upper mid/high emphasis.Considering that accessories include a shock mount, mini desk stand, and short XLR cable, the TM-80 would make a great addition to a home studio looking for versatility with affordability.Pros:  Great mid and high response. Full body from the low mids. Solid build quality.Cons: Lack of Pad/Low Cut switch. Mid vocal frequency lacks emphasis.

"The Vector 180 is a great drive that is compatible with many laptops and desktops due to its 7mm 2.5"" form factor. It also looks sleek, but you won't really see much of it once it's installed. Vector touts this series of drives for their reliability as well as the hassle-free ShieldPlus warranty process, which is one of the best in its class (they'll send a replacement with a prepaid label to ship back the defective drive. No receipts required, just the serial #).Performance-wise, I find the drive to be pretty speedy for my needs, especially compared to non-SSD drives that I've recently used. If you look at benchmark tests, this drive performs in the middle of the pack compared to similar drives from Samsung (best) and Crucial (worst).A drawback of this drive is that it consumes more power than other drives in its class. Even compared to the Vector 150 series, power consumption is 15-50% higher as reported by some hardware sites.

"While this (rather pricey) toothgel might actually be good for your teeth and gums, I don't really like using it. It just does not leave my mouth feeling clean. I don't mind that the flavor is very subtle (of mint and aloe vera); most toothpastes from the big corporations taste way too artificial and sweet anyway. However, I do mind that my teeth still feel like they have gunk on them even after using my fancy electric toothbrush for the recommended 2 minutes. I actually had to use my regular toothpaste right after I used TheraBreath.As for the ingredients that make this product unique, there is some scientific basis to it. There is some evidence that CoEnzyme Q10 and aloe vera help with dental issues. As for their proprietary OXY-D, we don't really know what it is except some derivative of sodium chlorite that also contains stabilized oxygen. The idea is that the oxygen is released while brushing and kills anaerobic bacteria that cause bad breath.

"PROS- It's cast iron, which has great thermal mass. You can sear meats well.- It's enamel coated, which means no worrying about seasoning the pan to keep it from rusting.- It's very good quality and large.- Flat lid top which allows for it to be used inverted on a burner, like a grill pan.- Good seal between the lid and pot, preventing moisture loss during long cooking times.CONS- It's cast iron, which means it actually heats very unevenly.- It might be too heavy for those with weak hands.- The grill marks on the lid pan limits its usefulness as a general pan.- The price is on the higher end of enameled cast irons, close to what the French imports cost.- The black interior makes it difficult to judge development of browning of fond, roux, etc.I have a lot of experience using cast iron cookware, but this is my first enameled cast iron pot (aka a French oven. The enamel coating makes it French vs. a Dutch oven which is naked cast iron). The main advantage of this pot over a bare cast iron Dutch oven, is that it does not need to be seasoned and requires less maintenance overall. I own many Dutch ovens, and although I spend the effort to season them thoroughly, the seasoning always becomes vulnerable when a long braise is performed. All the cooking in liquid, especially if it is acidic, takes its toll on the seasoned surface. So for braising, I really prefer an enameled pot such as this one.This Kitchen Aid pot is very nice indeed. I can't really tell the difference between it and a Le Creuset. And honestly, a Lodge brand enameled pot probably performs just as well as these higher priced ones, for less than half the cost. But still, this is a nice pot and I'm happy to have received one to review.It has the main advantage of cast iron, which is high heat capacity and thermal mass. It's great for putting a nice sear on meat to develop flavor before it's braised. But it does stick more than a well-seasoned Dutch oven because the enameled coating isn't as nonstick. But as Jeff Smith, The Frougal Gourmet, used to say, ""Hot pan, cold oil. Foods won't stick."" And if the chunks of meat you're browning are still stuck, it probably means that you need to leave them alone for a bit longer. They will release themselves when they're ready.Contrary to popular belief, cast iron does not heat evenly. If you want even heating, you need copper or aluminum, which conduct heat much faster, thus evenly. Cast iron heats up very very slowly, hence there is a pretty big gradient of temperatures on the cooking surface. Go ahead and dust the pan's bottom evenly with flour and then place it on a burner. You'll see the area directly above the fire turn brown and black much sooner than the rest of the pot. But this is generally okay for a Dutch/French oven, specially if you're going to put it into an oven to braise for several hours.A note about the lid: I really like that KitchenAid elected to go with a handle-less lid that allows to be used on a burner. Much like the Lodge Double Dutch Oven (one of my favorite pots), it allows you to sear the meat on both the big pot and the lid simultaneously, saving a bit of cooking time. Unfortunately, KitchenAid decided to put grill marks on the lid, which really really limits its usefulness. In my opinion, grill pans are a marketing gimmick. They give you much less surface area for your food to come into contact with the pan when compared to flat pans. They will not brown all over as well, limiting how much flavor is developed. And good luck trying to make pancakes on a grill pan. Some say the ridges help distribute condensation evenly as it drips back down onto the food. I don't think that really matters.The other negative of this pot is the black interior. Sorry, a black coating does not resist staining better than a white one - you just don't see the staining. A black interior makes it more difficult to judge how the cooking is progressing. let's say you're making a Louisiana-style roux, which is cooked to a very deep brown. It becomes difficult to see how brown the roux is before you risk burning it. I prefer a light interior because I can see how all the fond (the tasty stuck on bits) are developing and can stop the cooking before they get burnt. Yes, you have the same problem with an uncoated cast iron pot, but if I'm paying extra for enamel, make it light, please!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YFN2WCNPENSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EFCK932#wasThisHelpful","R1YFN2WCNPENSG","AF3BYMPWKWO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF3BYMPWKWO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With spring right around the corner in our little corner of paradise here in Austin, and baby Gomez still sharing the bedroom with us, we were looking for a small unit that could fit into our city apartment. The AeraMax Baby Air Purifier is perfect for our bedroom that we share with our baby. Although Gomez doesn'thaven't any allergens, we just wanted to purify the air a bit. The  unexpected benefit we discovered was that the smell from the diaper genie is minimized! It also acts as a sort of white noise which helps with warm weather noise of all those hipster scooters. Also, my partner has very bad allergies and has just resorted to taking nasal spray. This seems to help a bit with the allergens, but it's still a little early to see if it's really the machine or the fact that we cut down a few trees outside this past winter.

"I've tried several different headlight restorers in the past, but none of them have really worked. So I was pretty skeptical about Meguiar's 2000 as well. But I have a 2002 Honda Civic that has very oxidized headlights, so I gave it a shot.First, you apply a cleaner by buffing it in with an included sponge. Wipe it off thoroughly (I used a microfiber cloth), and then apply the protector.The cleaner really diminished the yellowing on the lens. It didn't get rid of all the scratches and erosion, but I still think it significantly improved the look of the lens and how much light passes through.

"According to the ingredients list, this product contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex. Menadione is a synthetic precursor (ahem, not the ""natural choice"") for Vitamin K and has notably been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural sources of vitamin K (such as leafy greens, kelp, etc.) is only justified for cost-saving reasons. It is disingenuous of The Naturo Company to claim this to be a natural cat food when menadione is not a naturally occuring chemical.Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997. Some may argue that since this was a toxicology study, the doses are unnaturally high. Perhaps, but that's the de facto methodology in the field to determine if something is potentially toxic before doing a drawn out longitudinal chronic-exposure study. Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells. In fact, menadione is a tool frequently used in the toxicology field to induce oxidative stress and organ damage.I don't know about you, but I'd prefer not to feed my pets something that's actually used to cause cell and tissue damage.

"I have  a 2012 Honda Fit. The Texas sun has bleached out some of the black plastic and vinyl on the exterior. I used this stuff on 5 different spots made of different materials. It totally restored 3 of the spots back to a nice deep black. But it didn't do anything to the other 2 spots, leaving them still looking bleached gray.Unlike some other restoring products I've used (some made by this same company), this stuff goes on more like a spray paint rather than a cream you rub on. Using too much can leave a visible layer of coating. It leaves a semi-gloss finish, which is attractive unless you use too much.Since this is a spray can, there is a lot of waste when trying to apply to small areas or thin trims. It will get on the windows, which seemed to removed a layer of something when I tried to wipe it off. And then you end up breathing this stuff in, which is probably not good for your lungs.

"I decided to investigate Qi Wireless Charging after I purchased a new Toyota that came with the feature built in.I started by purchasing a DigiYes Wireless Charger Charging Receiver Module for Samsung Galaxy S3 from Amazon, which is a very thin device that I inserted between the battery and the battery cover on my Samsung Galaxy S3 to enable wireless charging.Then I bought this device to wirelessly charge my phone when I'm in my house.  The device consists of a square plastic pad that measures about 3"" x 3"".  It has a small blue light in the front and a USB plug in the back.  You have to supply your own USB power supply, and the USB charger that came with my phone worked fine.I was surprised at how well this works and how convenient it is to use.  I've previously avoided wireless charging because I felt that it was a gimmick.  After all, it's pretty easy to just plug in your phone to a charger, right?After using this, I can say that I'm pretty impressed.  It's even easier to just place your phone on the charging pad and watch the blue light come on.  While I haven't used a timer to measure the speed at which my phone charges, the charging time is not noticeably slower than it was when I used to plug the phone in, and since it's so easy, I find myself using the charging pad everytime I get home, and have had fewer low-battery events as a result.Overall, I'm very happy with Qi charging and with this particular charging pad, and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q9FKHJJQRIW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C40OG22#wasThisHelpful","R1Q9FKHJJQRIW2","A1CPRP3VFJRS1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CPRP3VFJRS1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a a great sunshade.  It attached to your chair or any other pole-like surface, and will keep the sun off of you.  It is very sturdy and has many adjustment points.  The umbrella is lined on the inside with a material that completely blocks out the sun.  It's probably not large enough to keep the rain off of you, but it works great to block the sun from a single person sitting in a chair.I own several of the much larger Sport-Brella products that are designed for use by several people at once, and find this a better solution, more portable, and more economical solution for providing portable shade.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H9E3MU7C8K4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HA2ZKCO#wasThisHelpful","R2H9E3MU7C8K4N","A1CPRP3VFJRS1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CPRP3VFJRS1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this device several years back and was using it with great results for several years.  Recently, I updated to the latest firmware (dated in 2014), and began having serious video quality problems, including video dropping out completely every 30 seconds on one channel.  I found a thread on SiliconDust's forums where customers have been complaining about the problem since 2013, without any response from SD personnel.I managed to find the 20120405 Firmware and downgrade and all of my problems were resolved.  Unfortunately, SiliconDust no longer makes it easy to find the older firmware.  If you contact support, they may give you a link, and there are links posted to the 20120405 bin file (not the whole software) which you can use to downgrade the firmware using the latest software and the 20120405 bin file.However, if you run the Windows software again, it will automatically upgrade your firmware to the 2014 version again. You can stop that from happening by deleting the .bin files from:C:\Program Files\Silicondust\HDHomeRun\Note:  After I went through all that trouble, I found out that the disk inside the box contained the 20120405 firmware.

"I received this product through Amazon's Vine Program.  That means that I received it for free in exchange for my agreement to write a review.When I received the router, I originally did not like it because I reviewed it for its intended purposes, i.e. as a travel router.  As a travel router, it is a poor device because it is not self-contained and appeared to require the use of a set-up disk.  It turned out that a set-up disk is not required, but you must understand that to configure the device, you must first connect to it using Wifi using the credentials listed in very small print on the router.  You cannot initially connect via the wired ethernet port.Once I did that, I was quickly able to convert it from a travel router to a wireless client.  I've been using it to connect my VOIP phone to my Wifi network ever since, and it has been very reliable for that purpose.  It is also very small, and so it is easy to conceal under the phone.  Overall, I think that this is a great device for giving wifi access to devices that lack Wifi.As a travel router, however, I still prefer something that has a built in power supply.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SVGQPQRNPQQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PTCFFW#wasThisHelpful","R3SVGQPQRNPQQX","A1CPRP3VFJRS1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CPRP3VFJRS1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this product through Amazon's Vine Program, which means that I received it for free in exchange for my agreement to write this review.I have owned several of Schlage's keypad products, including my favorite, the Schlage BE365VPLY505 Plymouth Keypad Deadbolt, Bright Brass, and so I was anxious to compare the two.  Ultimately, I decided that I liked the older Plymouth Keypad Deadbolt better.  Here's why:Style:  The Plymouth Keypad Deadbolt looks more like a traditional deadbolt, and thus matches my existing handles and decor better.  This product has a much more futuristic design, which would be fine if that were the style of the rest of my house.Size:  The interior components of this deadbolt are much larger than the Plymouth Keypad Deadbolt.Price:  The Plymouth Keypad Deadbolt is considerably cheaper ($100 vs. $200).Durability:  The Plymouth Keypad Deadbolt does not use a motor to drive the deadbolt.  Instead, it simply engages a latch that you can turn yourself.  Fewer moving parts generally means greater durability.  In contrast, this product uses a motor to drive the deadbolt.This product is supposed to support Nexia and Z-wave, however many of the other reviews indicate that it doesn't work with Z-Wave.  I don't use either, as I am opposed to using server based services when the nature of the technology doesn't require a server based system, because (1) they'll stop working if the company that provides the server decides to discontinue the server and (2) they generally require monthly payments.  While I certainly understand Schlage's desire to get a monthly income stream from this type of product, there's nothing inherent in the nature of the product that requires a server or that requires a consumer to make a monthly payment in order to get the same functionality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8P514JNY5MYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AGK9KJQ#wasThisHelpful","R8P514JNY5MYX","A1CPRP3VFJRS1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CPRP3VFJRS1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this item through Amazon's Vine Program, which means that I received it for free in exchange for my agreement to write this review.Because of it's size, the chair will be delivered by a freight company, and not by FedEx or UPS.  They will call you in advance to schedule the delivery.  It comes in a very large cardboard box which contains another cardboard box inside.  Inside that box is the chair itself and the back and bottom cushion (which are connected together).  It was well-packaged to prevent damage and was fully assembled out of the box.  The only thing that I had to do to begin using it was to remove the protective cardboard and styrofoam from the legs, remove the plastic cover from the cushions, and then place the cushions onto the frame.HINT:  Open the plastic cover for the cushions at the top so that you can re-use the cover as a protective cover for the cushions during the off seasons!The chair itself is a black/brown color and the cushions could be described as light-brown or off-white.  The chair back is adjustable in five separate positions, and can be laid flat as well.  It is very lightweight given its size, presumably because it is made from aluminum.  It is fairly large, and is more than suitable for my six-foot tall frame.  The cushions are firm, but comfortable.I also own the Strathwood Basics Hardwood Chaise Lounge, which is considerably cheaper, but is made of wood and requires that cushions be purchased separately.

"The Blade MQX is a flying remote controlled toy that is commonly referred to as ""quadcopter.""  It is insanely fun to fly, but requires some experience before you can fly without crashing.The MQX is available in two versions.  The ""RTF"" (Ready to Fly) version includes a very basic remote control.The ""BNF"" (Bind-N-Fly) version comes without a remote control, and is intended for people who already own a Spektrum remote control.  Spektrum makes a wide variety of remote controls that can be used with a wide variety of Blade brand helicopters and E-flite brand remote controlled airplanes.  I use the Spektrum DX6i, which you can buy from Amazon.com for $139.99.  It can remember ten different planes/helis at once, has a very nice display, and includes a timer, which is helpful to prevent crashes due to dead batteries.  If you buy two of the DX6i, you can even connect them together and put them in training mode, which allows you to give and take control from another controller when you're teaching someone else how to fly.Both the BNF and RTF versions include the MQX Quadcopter, a single battery, a single battery charger, and a user manual with a diagram that shows how all the parts go together and (more importantly) what each part is called.  Each battery yields about ten minutes of flight time.The MQX is a quad-copter because it has four independent motors that operate four independent blades.  It flies by adjusting the speed of the blades to allow it to pitch forward and back, roll left and right, and to yaw (turn) left and right.The MQX includes a stabilization system that Blade uses on its mid-level helicopters.  It flies very well in no to light wind.  In moderate winds, it can still generally maintain stability, but it tends to wobble a little, and the wobble becomes more pronounced as you increase the throttle or the wind speed increases.Unless you have a lot experience, do not fly this inside your house.  This toy is for use in large open spaces, i.e. parks.  While beginner helicopters will auto level when you release the right control stick, the MQX does not.  In addition, it can fly very fast.If you push the right stick forward, the unit will start leaning forward (and flying forward) and will continue leaning farther forward until you release the stick.  When you release the stick, the MQX will continue leaning forward and flying forward at the angle it was at when you released the stick until you counter the forward lean by pulling the stick towards you.  As you hold the stick towards you, the MQX will slow down, and eventually stop.  If you continue pulling the stick towards you, the MQX will begin flying backwards.  The same principles apply when you move the right stick to the left or the right.If you turn the MQX around using the left stick while it is flying forward, the forward momentum will be translated into sideways momentum, which you'll need to counteract with the right stick.So, for example, if you are flying forward and push the left stick to the right to make a 180 degree right hand turn, when the unit comes out of the right hand turn, it will begin sliding to its left (your right).  You'll need to counteract that by pushing the right the stick to the right.  It usually will stop as well, so you'll need forward input on the right stick to get it going again.  The opposite is true if you make a left hand turn:  You'll need to give it right stick input to the left at the conclusion of the turn as well.You should also note that when you turn the MQX around and face it towards you, all of the controls become reversed.  When the MQX gets far away from you, the easiest way to tell which side is ""forward"" is to look for the white blades.  As sold, the white blades are in the front and the black blades are in the rear.  Blade also makes a set of high contrast Orange blades, which I used to replace the black blades (in the rear) on mine.If you buy this product, you should consider also buying some additional parts right away.  As you're reading the rest of my review, it might help you to refer to the MQX user manual (which you can also download from Blade's web-site), because it includes a parts diagram that shows the name of each part and where it goes on the MQX.1.  Buy several packages of replacement Thruster Boom with Wiring (2): mQXs.  You will need them.The Thruster Booms are made from carbon fiber.  Every time you crash, the carbon fiber will weaken, and eventually it will break.  Even before it breaks, it loses rigidity, which can increase the wobble in light winds and on heavy throttle.  Replacing them is incredibly easy.  They come pre-wired.  No tools are required.  You just unplug the old ones and plug the new ones in.Start by pulling the decorative cover off the center of the MQX.  Then, unplug the wire from the old Thruster Boom that goes onto the main board.  Then pull the motor mount cover off the motor mount (jiggle it while pulling it towards the center of the unit).  Unplug the motor from the wiring on the Thruster Boom.  Now pull the Thruster Boom out of the center of the unit and out of the motor mount.  Reverse the process with the new one.  Make sure that you line up the sides of the wire plugs that are painted green.2.  You should also buy several packs of replacement blades.  When you crash, there is a 30% chance that a rotor blade will become bent.  If the bend is minor, you can sometimes bend it back.  If the bend is major, you will experience significant wobble and an unusual noise as well.When buying blades, do note that each of the four blades has a specific color and direction.  A full set of blades includes a black clockwise blade, a black counter-clockwise blade, a white clockwise blade, and a white counter-clockwise blade.  Blade also makes a set of high contrast, easy to see Orange blades, which I recommend using in place of the black blades.When installing replacement blades, grab the blade and pull it upwards.  The blade will pull the propeller shaft out of the motor mount and the white gear will fall out of the bottom of the MQX.Remove the screw that holds the propeller in place and then replace the blade.  Tighten the screw only until you feel the very slightest of resistant.  If you keep tightening, you'll strip the propeller shaft and have to turn it around and use the backup screw hole or replace the propeller shaft.Push the propeller shaft back into the motor mount housing, and slide the white gear ring onto the bottom.  Be sure to line up the flat spot on the white gear ring with the flat spot on the propeller shaft.3.  You should buy several additional batteries (Model EFLB5001S25).  Do not buy aftermarket batteries.  They may be slightly cheaper, but the connectors don't fit quite right.  They're a pain to plug in and unplug and may even damage the unit when you have to pull the wires so hard that you rip the connector off the circuit board.4.  If you purchase the Bind-N-Fly (BNF) version, you should also buy a DX6i Remote Control.5.  If you're going to fly at night, Horizon Hobby sells a light kit (Ram190) for about $15.00.  It is very easy to install (I used scotch tape to install mine) and makes night flying easier than daytime flying.If you are buying multiple parts at the same time, it is usually cheaper to pick a seller (like HopMeUp) that charges for shipping separately.  Several Amazon sellers will charge $8.00 per battery with $3.00 for shipping, while others will charge $11.00 per battery with free shipping.  If you're only buying one battery, the price is the same.  But, if you buy five batteries, the shipping for all five will only be slightly higher than $3.00, and you'll save a ton of money on the $8.00 batteries.  The same is true of other parts.The only other common maintenance item on these involves the motors.  The motor mount covers have a small lip that keeps the motor in place.  When you crash, the motor sometimes jumps over the lip.  When that happens, the motor will no longer connect with the gear.  It's easy to fix:  Just push the motor back down into the housing, and then push the motor mount back into place.I've been pretty aggressive with mine.  I've flown up and down a large park hundreds of times, and done quite a few rolls as well.  As a result, I've had to replace at least fifteen booms, four motor mounts, and several blades as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HIABZA4YFS2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006R6EGCY#wasThisHelpful","R3HIABZA4YFS2O","A1CPRP3VFJRS1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CPRP3VFJRS1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own four Logitech Harmony One remote controls and love them.  What makes the Harmony One such a great remote is its combination of hard keys and touchscreen keys.  Frequently used keys were available as physical buttons.  Your fingers can find them and push them without having to take your eyes off of the TV.  Less frequently used buttons can be moved to a touch screen.  All of the related hard keys were located within easy reach of one another.  The touchscreen was not within easy reach, but that didn't matter because you had to take your eyes off of the TV screen to see and push them anyway.Unfortunately, Logitech took all the great design features of the Harmony One and eliminated them when creating this remote.  This remote is a HUGE step backwards.  Here's why:1.  Bad Software:  With the Harmony One, Logitech used software that you downloaded from their web-site and ran on your computer.  It was very well designed and easy to use.  Now, they use a web-based application that relies on Microsoft Silverlight.  It is quite buggy and slow.2.  Inconvenient Keys:  The transport keys are located above the touch screen, while all the other keys are located below the touch screen.  This is very inconvenient because it means that you have to look down at the remote and physically move it in your hand in order to reach the fast foward, rewind, pause, stop, and record buttons, and then move it back when you want to use the up, down, left, right, guide, PVR, Info, and OK buttons.On the Harmony One, the transport keys were just below the navigation keys.  Having related keys near one another makes the remote much more convenient to use.  Separating them makes the remote far more difficult to use.3.  Missing Keys:  The skip forward and skip backward buttons are gone.  Completely gone. You can remap the fast forward and rewind keys, but then you have to use the touchscreen for those (or remap the colored keys, which are located as far away from the transport keys as they could possibly be).4.  No motion sensor:  Older Harmony Remotes had a motion sensor and would activate the touch screen when you picked up the remote.  You could turn the feature off if you didn't want it.  This remote doesn't have the feature at all.5.  More Missing Keys:  The Help and Activities button have been replaced with touch-sensitive keys that have icons.  The Activities button now looks like a Home icon.  Just to make things more confusing, the word ""Home"" also appears on the screen when you are on the Home screen, but pressing on the word home does nothing.  The Help button is now a question mark icon that's way too easy to push by accident.6.  Swipe now required:  Previously, you'd see 3 activity choices on the touch screen at a time.  Now, you only see one.  To get to the others, you have to swipe to the left or the right.  I'm fine with swiping to get to more choices, but there's no reason why they made only one option per screen.7.  Bigger screen, fewer options:  The screen is larger, but you have fewer options on each screen.You can no longer get to the devices from within an activity.  Now, if you want to change a setting on a device that isn't included in the activity, you have to go back to the home screen.Also, Logitech changed the size of soft buttons from a finger sized square to a longer, thinner rectangle, making it even easier to hit the wrong button.8.  Poorly designed charger:  The charging plug for this unit comes with a british AC adaptor and then a U.S. converter.  As a result, it sticks out of the wall by about 3 inches.  Dumb!9.  Battery not removable:  Prior Harmony remotes had removeable batteries, so if the battery died, you could replace it.  This one is permanently installed.  You have to break it open to remove it (only at the end of the product's life).  So, I pay more, and get less!  Thanks Logitech!This remote is a redesign that sacrifices function for form.  It is a huge step backwards with no corresponding benefits.In my view, the best remotes don't use a touch screen at all.  Having a screen that is accompanied by hard buttons is best.  The screen allows the hard buttons to have different labels, and a more button to scroll.I used to recommend the Harmony One even though it had a touch screen, because setup was so easy and there were enough hard buttons that the touch screen only needed to be used infrequently.Today, I recommend either URC MasterControl RF20 Universal Learning Remote with RF Capability or the URC R40 ""My Favorite Remote"" Advanced Universal Remote Control for up to 18 A/V Components.  Both are even better than the Harmony One because they have all hard, physical buttons.  The buttons at the top are adjacent to a screen, which allows those buttons to be used for more than one function.  The transport buttons are conveniently located near the navigation buttons.  The only downside of these remotes is that they are programmed by hand, and not using a computer.  They're preprogrammed with many common remotes, and can learn directly from an existing remote, but the process is a bit more complicated than the Logitech software and more time consuming.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3URU5L9DR1D7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009EIUH6G#wasThisHelpful","R3URU5L9DR1D7E","A1CPRP3VFJRS1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CPRP3VFJRS1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very poorly made copy of the Blade MSR.The only positive thing that I can say is that the controller feels well built and is a faithful reproduction of the Blade controller.However, everything about the helicopter is AWFUL.  The gyro does not function correctly, and so the helicopter always turns as you increase or decrease the throttle.  It also was not adjusted properly and so it drifted from the factory.  The drift can be repaired by making adjustments, but there's no way to fix a poorly designed electronic gyro.  I bought two of these and both are going back.If you're looking for an inexpensive entry level outdoor helicopter, I recommend the WL Toys V911 or V912.  If you want top qualify, the Blade 120 SR is an excellent choice.  This is not worth the $30.00 that I paid.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ8OPIO94O4N2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090UILAW#wasThisHelpful","RJ8OPIO94O4N2","A1CPRP3VFJRS1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CPRP3VFJRS1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The WL Toys V911 is a 4 channel fixed pitch helicopter with flybar that uses a 2.4 Ghz remote control. It comes with the helicopter, two batteries, a charger, and the 2.4 Ghz Remote.  It is a great choice for people who are starting out with helicopters and want an inexpensive starter helicopter to use outdoors.Because the helicopter is a fixed pitch helicopter with a flybar, it is moderately stable but can fly very quickly. Because it uses 2.4 Ghz, it has a good range and will not suffer from interference from lights (like some IR controlled helis will). Because it has replaceable battery, when the battery dies, you can simply replace it with a charged one. Because it is 4 channels, you can fly forward and backwards, go up and down, spin left and right, and can slide to the left and right.Be sure to buy extra blades and a screw kit. The blades tend to get damaged when they hit things. While the flybar won't get damaged, the screw that holds the flybar in place can become bent, and when that happens, the helicopter will lose some stability and may experience what is known as the toilet bowl effect. If you experience vibration, the screw that holds the flybar in place might be too loose. If you experience a toilet bowl effect, try loosening the screw that holds the flybar in place.Quality control is an issue for this helicopter. The first one that I received had a bad gyro, and so it would turn to the right.  Even the ""good"" ones have a slight tendency to rotate to the right, and it gets worse as the battery level drops.The second and third one did not have the swashplate adjusted, and so the helicopter would tend to drift.  If your helicopter drifts instead of hovering, determine which direction it is drifting (forward, back, left and/or right).  Then while the helicopter is sitting on a table, move the remove control in the direction oppose of the drift.  Watch which levers move in which directions.  Then adjust the black plastic/silver control arms to move the swashplate in that direction by popping the black plastic control arms off of the black swashplate ball joint and then screwing or unscrewing the black part of the arm against the silver part of the arm to lengthen it or shorten it.WL Toys offers no U.S. based support, but you can find parts if you want to try to repair the helicopter yourself.It is not a toy and because the blades can cause serious eye injury, you should not fly the helicopter near anyone and should not allow children to operate it.The helicopter is fun to fly, but as you lift off, be sure to move the right stick about half way to the right.  These helicopters have a natural lean to the left to counter the force of the tail rotor and you need to counteract it at lift-off or the heli will veer off to the left and crash.If you don't mind spending a bit more, you should consider these helicopters:Blade MCX2- Coaxial helicopter, 4-channel, replaceable battery, 2.4 Ghz controller. Great for indoor use, but can be used outdoors if there is no wind. Still slow. U.S. based support and good quality. Around $120.00 with the controller (less if you already have a compatible controller).Blade CX2/CX4- Similar to MCX2, but considerably larger and so it can be flown in very light wind outdoors. Around $150 to $200. U.S. based support and good quality.Blade SR 120- Fixed pitch, 4-channel, replaceable battery, 2.4 Ghz controller. Too large for indoor use. Great as a park flyer even with some wind. Very fast. Around $160.00 with the controller and $130 if you already own a Blade compatible controller. U.S. based support and good quality.----Here's a summary of the different technology choices when it comes to RC helicopters.Blade SystemsCoaxial- A coaxial helicopter has two sets of blades, one on top of the other. Coaxial helicopters are generally very stable and move fairly slowly. They are great for beginners and for flying indoors.Fixed Pitch- A single set of blades. Not as stable as a coaxial helicopter, and can move much more quickly than a coaxial helicopter. A ""FP"" helicopter cannot fly upside down. Fixed Pitch helicopters are generally for intermediate flyers and are used outdoors.Collective Pitch- A single set of blades whose pitch changes to raise or lower the helicopter. A ""CP"" helicopter can fly upside down. For advanced and expert flyers.Stabilization SystemsGyro- An electronic system inside the helicopter that prevents the helicopter from rotating in the direction opposite the blades. All modern helicopters have electronic gyros.Flybar- Two weights that are connected together using plastic or metal and which spin around along with the helicopter blades. Fixed Pitch Helicopters that have a flybar will level off when you release the stick. Helicopters that do not have a flybar (and Collective Pitch Helicopters) will not level off when you release the control stick. Collective Pitch and helicopters without flybars are not suitable for beginners.Control SystemsInfrared- Use infrared light to control the helicopter.

"The WL Toys V911 is a 4 channel fixed pitch helicopter with flybar that uses a 2.4 Ghz remote control. It is a great choice for people who are starting out with helicopters and want an inexpensive starter helicopter to use outdoors.Because the helicopter is a fixed pitch helicopter with a flybar, it is moderately stable but can fly very quickly. Because it uses 2.4 Ghz, it has a good range and will not suffer from interference from strong lights. Because it has replaceable battery, when the battery dies, you can simply replace it with a charged one. Because it is 4 channels, you can fly forward and backwards, go up and down, spin left and right, and can slide to the left and right.Be sure to buy extra blades and a screw kit. The blades tend to get damaged when they hit things. While the flybar won't get damaged, the pin that holds the flybar in place can become bent, and when that happens, the helicopter will lose some stability and may experience what is known as the toilet bowl effect. If you experience vibration, the screw that holds the flybar in place might be too loose. If you experience a toilet bowl effect, try loosening the screw that holds the flybar in place.Quality control is an issue for this helicopter. The first one that I received had a bad gyro, and so it would turn to the right. WL Toys offers no U.S. based support, but you can find parts if you want to try to repair the helicopter yourself.It is not a toy and because the blades can cause serious eye injury, you should not fly the helicopter near anyone and should not allow children to operate it.If you don't mind spending a bit more, you should consider these helicopters:Blade MCX2- Coaxial helicopter, 4-channel, replaceable battery, 2.4 Ghz controller. Great for indoor use, but can be used outdoors if there is no wind. Still slow. U.S. based support and good quality. Around $120.00 with the controller (less if you already have a compatible controller).Blade CX2/CX4- Similar to MCX2, but considerably larger and so it can be flown in very light wind outdoors. Around $150 to $200. U.S. based support and good quality.Blade SR 120- Fixed pitch, 4-channel, replaceable battery, 2.4 Ghz controller. Too large for indoor use. Great as a park flyer even with some wind. Very fast. Around $160.00 with the controller and $130 if you already own a Blade compatible controller. U.S. based support and good quality.----Here's a summary of the different technology choices when it comes to RC helicopters.Blade SystemsCoaxial- A coaxial helicopter has two sets of blades, one on top of the other. Coaxial helicopters are generally very stable and move fairly slowly. They are great for beginners and for flying indoors.Fixed Pitch- A single set of blades. Not as stable as a coaxial helicopter. Increasing the speed of the blades causes the helicopter to rise. Lowering the speed causes the helicopter to drop. A ""FP"" helicopter cannot fly upside down. Fixed Pitch helicopters are generally for intermediate flyers and are used outdoors.Collective Pitch- A single set of blades whose pitch changes to raise or lower the helicopter. The speed at which the blades rotate are normally not changed. A ""CP"" helicopter can fly upside down. For advanced and expert flyers.Stabilization SystemsGyro- An electronic system inside the helicopter that prevents the helicopter from rotating in the direction opposite the blades. All modern helicopters have electronic gyros.Flybar- Two weights that are connected together using plastic or metal and which spin around along with the helicopter blades. Helicopters that have a flybar will level off when you release the stick. Helicopters that do not have a flybar will not level off when you release the control stick. Helicopters without flybars are not suitable for beginners.Control SystemsInfrared- Use infrared light to control the helicopter. Bright lights, sunlight, and TV remote controls will interfere with the operation of the helicopter.

"The Syma S107G is a 3.5 channel coaxial helicopter with an infrared remote control and an internal battery.

"My house is wired with a home distribution system that allows for changes to the routing of video, audio, and ethernet.  Unfortunately, every time that I need to make a change, I had to call a technician who had the proper tools.  I got tired of paying $100 every time I wanted to change something and I so I started looking at what tools I needed and how to use them.I found a number of useful websites online and Youtube videos explaining what each tool did and how to use it.  Amazon doesn't allow me to post links here, but if you Google ""swhowto"" (or just type those letters and add .com to the end), you'll find a number of resources that explains the tools you need and how they work.I found that there are a number of companies that make tools for this purpose.  Since I don't do this for a living and I knew that the tools wouldn't get used all that much, I focused more on value.  Paladin makes a number of different reasonably priced kits, and after exhaustive research, I settled on this one.  Fluke Networks also makes tools, but they appear to of significantly higher quality (and also more expensive).This kit includes:1.  A wire cutter- to cut wires2.  A coax stripper- used to make the ends of TV/Coax cable suitable for adding a connector.3.  A network cable stripper- used to make the ends of phone/network cable suitable for adding a phone or network plug.4.  A universal crimper- used to squeeze a coax screw connector and/or a phone/network plug so that it will stay on the end of a coax or ethernet cable.5.  Die Sets- these are installed into the crimper so that it can be used on coax or ethernet.6.  Punchdown tool- used to punch wires onto a wire block or onto the back of a a wall jack.  Although it has the ability to impact, I find that its easier to just push on the cable until it seats.  If you actually punch it down, it will often damage the modern blocks, which are somewhat fragile.7.  110 Blade & 66 blade- these are blades that are installed into the Punchdown tool to match the size of the holes on the block.  They are different sizes, and it is important that you have a blade to match the size used on your block.  110 and 66 are the most common, but there is also another version8. Coax/Network Cable Tester- used to test network cable or coax cable to make sure that it is wired properly and not damaged.9.  A Tone generator and banana probe- used to locate/identify which wire goes where.10.  Various connectors and adapters for #8 and #9.11.  A RG45 Adaptor that will allow you to plug-in a network cable and then access each of the eight individual wires for testing without cutting off the end of a cable.11.  A very nice tool bag and box.The only thing that this kit doesn't have that I recommend is the Paladin Tools 4599 SurePunch Pro Detachable Light and Batteries.  It costs about $15.00 and allows you to add a tiny flashlight to the punch down tool, which is often very helpful because all this equipment tends to be installed into a dark closet","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TWQLLDQ8YCT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009F0PQ0#wasThisHelpful","R1TWQLLDQ8YCT7","A1CPRP3VFJRS1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CPRP3VFJRS1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this device to allow me to monitor the temperature and humidity in my garage, in my car, and in my house.  It works great for that purpose.The product includes four devices:  A main base unit with a display and three remote sensors that connect wirelessly.Each device runs on AAA batteries.  I use Eneloop rechargeable batteries and the LaCrosse BC-900 to recharge them.I have only one complaint:  The humidity sensor will not register humidity under 20%.  So, if the humidity goes under 20%, the unit continues to show 20%.Other than that, it works great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMUJ3US0KQ8GP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ORAVRK#wasThisHelpful","RMUJ3US0KQ8GP","A1CPRP3VFJRS1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CPRP3VFJRS1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The idea behind these devices is a sensible one:  Make a cheap GSM phone that can operate on a disposable AA battery and keep it for emergencies.  Here's the problem:  The days of the GSM network in the U.S. are numbered.  When the GSM networks go offline, these phones will be useless.  Also, these devices aren't cheap.AT&T and T-mobile have already begun taking their GSM networks offline in some areas, and AT&T has indicated that it will turn off the GSM network everywhere in the U.S. by 2017.There is an easy fix:  The maker of this phone just needs to make the phones support the new 3G standard which currently works on all AT&T and T-Mobile towers in the U.S.  Even better, they could make the phones support the next generation for mobile voice, LTE.  I realize that this would add to the cost, but at $50, this phone is already overpriced.This phone includes no screen, no flip mechanism, no battery, and no 3G, and so it should be cheaper than the comparable Samsung.  With no screen, there's no way to determine if you've dialed a wrong number until you hit send and see who answers.  To make matters worse, the tones that are generated when you push a button are wrong.  For example, when you push 9, it sounds like you are pressing 0.  All the digits are off in the same manner.  So, even if you could recognize the tones by the sound they make, you won't be able to use that skill on this phone to verify that you dialed the correct number.  Finally, with no screen, you can't send a text message.  In a disaster where mobile networks are overloaded, text messages are much more likely to get through - yet you won't be able to send them with this.Right now, you can buy an un-subsidized Samsung flip phone that will work on AT&T or T-Mobile for about $20.00.  Those phones support 3G (not merely GSM), and include a rechargeable lithium ion battery, a color screen, and web browser.  If you want to be able to power it using AA batteries, you can buy the Energizer Instant Charger for Micro USB Mobile Phones.At $50.00, this product is way overpriced, and is already useless in some places and will be useless everywhere in less than 5 years.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GRM6O0M4HMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008B291SQ#wasThisHelpful","R3GRM6O0M4HMC","A1CPRP3VFJRS1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CPRP3VFJRS1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an electronic timer switch that plugs into a 3-prong U.S. electric outlet.  The unit plugs into the wall, and the prongs are located on the back of the unit.  You can then plug any 2 or 3-pronged electrical device (such as a lamp) into the bottom.The timer allows you to set up to 100 different on/off periods, which you can program on a particular day of the week, during the weekend, during the workweek, or everyday.  You can program the timer to start or end a time period based upon the time of day or based upon the sunset or sunrise time in a particular location, and can even program it to offset from that time, i.e. 30 minutes before sunset.The timer includes a wired remote control which you can press to turn the switch on and off.  If you press the remote and release it promptly, it will toggle the load on or off and then continue with whatever timers you set.  If you hold the remote button, it will toggle the load and override the timers until you push the button again.Another review on Amazon indicates that the wired remote is not useful unless you can see the display, but I have not found that to be correct.  Nothing on the display gives any useful information relating to the use of the remote.  You simply push the button and the attached light turns on and push it again to turn the light off.  It is possible that an older firmware version of this remote operated differently, but the version that I bought in December of 2012 works with no need to see the display.Another Amazon review indicates that the unit has problems with a low battery condition.  I find this surprising.  The battery is only used when the unit is not plugged into power.  The backup battery is used to allow you to program the unit without having it plugged into the wall and presumably also keeps the time correct during a power outage.  The unit contains no ""low battery indicator.""  Rather, the unit has an indicator that indicates when the unit is running on battery power.  Unfortunately, the icon that indicates that the unit is on battery power looks suspiciously like a low battery indicator.  I suspect that the reviewer who was concerned about low battery may have been confused.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RGS09UGIDB8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0040718V4#wasThisHelpful","R1RGS09UGIDB8G","A1CPRP3VFJRS1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CPRP3VFJRS1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this product through Amazon.com's Vine Program, which means that I received it for free in exchange for my agreement to write this review.The idea behind the Tap2Pass receiver is that you connect it to your garage door opener and then you can connect to it using your smartphone and then open your garage door.  This solves the problem of having to carry a garage door remote control around in your car, when you only have room to carry your smartphone.Unfortunately, there are three issues with this solution:1. The range is incredibly short.  This is the nature of Bluetooth.  It is supposed to be a very short range service, i.e. a few feet.  Since this device is intended to be inside your garage and you are going to be outside your garage, adding a garage door and car between you makes the range way too short.2.  Bluetooth is too slow.  Bluetooth pairing isn't fast enough to make this useful.  It takes several seconds after you get into range before your smartphone and this device will pair.3.  Most cars have room for a garage door remote control.These three issues, combined with the cost to purchase and install it, make me wonder why anyone would prefer this option over the option of simply purchasing an extra garage door remote (which should cost between $10 and $30).Having said all of that, if they made this device an 802.11 wifi device, and you set it up to connect to your home Wifi, the first two of these problems could easily be overcome.  Wifi networks can easily be configured to have significant coverage outside of someone's home and today's smartphones can connect to a Wifi network in less than a second.Even if the device operated on Wifi, I'm still not sure that a case could be made for buying it rather than getting another garage door remote.All in all, I'd say that this device is a solution in search of a problem.  The trouble is that the problem doesn't exist.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KZU9LNUPC0VP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007GR44PM#wasThisHelpful","R1KZU9LNUPC0VP","A1CPRP3VFJRS1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CPRP3VFJRS1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received the Otterbox Prefix case for the Samsung Galaxy S3 through Amazon.com's Vine Program, which means that I got it for free in exchange for agreeing to write this review.I have been a long-time fan of Otterbox.  I was first introduced to Otterbox case after my daughter dropped and broke her iPod touch.  Since then, we've always protected all of our electronics with Otterbox cases.  In fact, I will not buy a mobile device unless Otterbox makes a case for it.Having said that, this case is not worth the price I paid, i.e. ""Free.""  Instead, I would recommend that anyone considering a case for their Galaxy S3 get the higher-quality Otterbox Commuter series case instead.Here's why:1.  This case (Otterbox Prefix) is a piece of junk.Because it is a one-piece design, it is relatively difficult to put on, and requires quite a bit of stretching and contorting both the case and your device.  Once installed, the case does not fit my device snugly, but is instead bowed out towards the middle.  When you use the device, the case squeaks as it rubs against the device in certain spots.  It is also considerably more bulky than the Commuter series case.The Prefix includes no protection whatsoever for the charging and 3.5 mm headphone ports.The outside color is a very drab gray.Currently, it is more expensive than the Commuter:  Amazon charges $24.95 for this case today.2.  The Otterbox Commuter case is fantastic.It has a two piece design, including a soft inner shell and a harder outer shell.  It is very easy to install without having to contort the case or the phone.  It is less bulky than the Prefix case and fits like a glove.The Commuter DOES include protection for the charging and 3.5 mm headphone ports.The Commuter case is available in a variety of colors, including my favorite:  Black.The Commuter series case is supposed to be a higher quality case, and has a higher MSRP than the Prefix.  However, currently, you can buy it for between $16 and $20, depending upon the color.  I have read complaints that the it is difficult to press the power button on the Commuter case, and I've found that to be true.  However, it is not **that** difficult, and making it a little difficult will prevent inadvertent button pushes and save battery life.So, in sum, skip this one and get the Commuter series case instead.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMLPAAH1X6RFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009S4FMAM#wasThisHelpful","RMLPAAH1X6RFU","A1CPRP3VFJRS1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CPRP3VFJRS1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this product through Amazon's Vine Program, which means that I received it for free in exchange for my agreement to write this review.Over the last few years, a number of products have come out promising to allow you to extend the reach of an ethernet (computer) network using other types of wiring.  The first to arrive was the Ethernet Over Power devices (not to be confused with POE, which sends power over ethernet), which allowed you to send computer networking signals using the power wires inside the walls of your house.  The first models were very slow and unreliable.  The latest powerline models are much more reliable, but they still don't deliver anywhere near the performance and reliability of true ethernet.Similar products that deliver ethernet over coax have been promised for years, but this is one of the first products that I've actually seen available.  I'm not sure why, though, because almost every house in America is wired with Coax.  In any case, this one works well and is much more reliable than the powerline models that I've tested.This is one of the first reasonably priced commercially available Ethernet over Coax products available in the U.S.  It uses the MoCA networking standard.  Although the box says that it is ""Not for Use in Satellite TV Homes,"" the unit will work just fine as long as you don't attempt to use the Coax that connects your Satellite Dish to your Satellite Receiver.The box that I received includes (1) two black adapter boxes, (2) two coax patch cords, (3) two ethernet patch cables, (4) two power supplies, and (5) one coax splitter.Each adaptor box has two coax jacks, an ethernet jack, a power jack (for the AC adaptor), a reset button and a switch that reads ""config/run"".Installation was simple:  Hook up the ethernet jack to whatever you want (your router, switch, computer, etc) and then plug in your coaxial cable and AC adaptor.  There is an additional jack to hook up a TV or Set Top Box output if you want to use the coaxial cable for sending video in addition to sending data, but using that connector is optional. Then repeat this process at the other end.The speed and reliability was very good, and certainly comparable to 10/100 ethernet.  It claims to support up to 16 devices, although I only tested two of them.The documentation consists of a single, double-sided sheet of paper that does nothing more than tell you how to plug everything in.  There is no explanation of what the reset button does, when you should push it, or how to use it (momentary press or hold for 10 seconds?).

"I received this product through Amazon's Vine Program, which means that I received it for free in exchange for my agreement to write a review. I've had it for about two months, and so this should be my final review.The product came in a single box, that included (1) the outdoor speaker unit, (2) an indoor transmitter, and (3) a power supply for each.(1).  The outdoor speaker unit is stylized to look like a spanish lantern, but it emits no light.  It has six faces.It appears to contain two speaker drivers (a small one and a larger one).  Both are on a single face of the unit and so the unit emits sound in only one direction.  You can apparently purchase another speaker unit and use it with the same transmitter if you want stereo sound.  The outdoor unit can run on batteries or using the supplied AC adaptor.The outdoor unit is apparently weather resistant when run using batteries, but surely is not when using the AC adaptor.  Further, the unit's design will only resist rain and other water that is falling down, and will not protect the unit from rising waters, floods, or immersion.The outdoor unit has five buttons, all on one of the faces of the unit.  The buttons include (1) Bass Boost, (2) On/Off, (3) Auto Scan (used to scan through the 3 channels), Volume +, and Volume -.The sound quality is very good, and includes ample bass and treble.  Depending upon your source, however, I found the overall volume low.  You won't be using this at any large parties, but if you want to enjoy music for a small group on the patio, you should be very happy.(2).  The indoor transmitter is a bit larger than a bar of soap, and is definitely NOT weatherproof.  It runs only on AC power, and has no option to use batteries.  It supports stereo audio input via RCA style jacks (Red for Right, White for Left), and comes with an adaptor cord that will plug into a standard headphone jack like one you would find on an iPod or Android device.You can choose from three transmit channels.  It transmits on 900 Mhz, which means that it won't interfere with 802.11 Wifi Networks (which use 2.4 Ghz).Overall, I was very happy with this product, but I believe that in order to really enjoy it, you should purchase two of them so that you can stereo sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNQ0TKHZNVIYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BQGPC2#wasThisHelpful","RNQ0TKHZNVIYH","A1CPRP3VFJRS1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CPRP3VFJRS1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This mini dehumidifier is based upon a great concept, but it has a few design flaws.1.  The air intake has no filter.  This is a problem because dust will eventually coat the cooling unit.  There's no easy way to clean it without taking the unit apart.2.  The air exhaust is covered by a grill mechanism that significantly restricts the airflow. The grill mechanism almost looks like it would act as a filter, were it on the air intake.  It probably also serves to keep dust from settling in the machine when the fan is off.  However, because it comes after the cooling mechanism, the only purpose that it serves is to restrict airflow and make the unit work less efficiently.  Fortunately, it snaps right off, and when you take it off, the airflow almost doubles, making the unit work much more efficiently.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IWD5213X5OQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000H0ZDD2#wasThisHelpful","R3IWD5213X5OQQ","A1CPRP3VFJRS1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CPRP3VFJRS1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This new entry from IFC Midnight is a Horror/thriller about a group of 12 year old girls who are having a sleepover at a  luxurious house set in the snowy woods.The snow  makes for both a beautiful and creepy setting.The house itself is the star of the film with it's huge glass windows everywhere and lot's of modern, pop art, throughout.I was obsessed with the Marilyn Monroe piece that had a sliced boiled egg in loo of her face.This film was said to be based on a true story.It's mainly about bullying ,cyber and real time as well.It isn't very gory but there are a couple of kills that are somewhat bloody.The cast was amazing. Chloe Svengny,Timothy Hutton and Taryn Manning.The  young girls did a believable job at being vicious,cruel spoiled brats as well.They kept showing a series of graphics that had the look of Twitter ,Candy crush and Tinder.As the masked killer stalks them the images are being submitted online and rack up a bunch of likes.It seems the more violent the more likes they receive.The film had somewhat of an arthouse feel to it with scenes such as the girls putting on artistic yet creepy masks  and dancing.There is a lot of catty dialogue about who's fat,who's gay.Who might not be a virgin or who lives in the ""poorer section of town"". Basically anything that they can use as ammunition.I was entertained and might even watch it again.The wintery shots combined with the art and the movie itself are enough to make it quite memerable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SU879UHDL6LY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0186BX7F4#wasThisHelpful","R2SU879UHDL6LY","A1MECEHZHFE5PT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MECEHZHFE5PT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My nephew said this was the best headset he had ever used. The design is sleek and looks cool especially the blue on the side that lights up.They give amazing sound and are very comfortable as well. Because he will play for hours on end and if the ear gear isn't comfortable, it's a problem.The fact that it has the adjustable band across the top is very helpful when both kids and adults use them.I also tried them out ,although I'm not a big gamer could feel the great fit and hear the intricate sound.These are winners and you can't beat the price for comfort and quality.They're a winner.Set up is so easy  and they seem very sturdy.I highly recommend them as does my 10 year old nephew. He's the real critic where there items are concerned concerned.(In fairness I was given these for a fair and impartial review).

"All I can say is this film is pretty amazing! The story well thought out. The acting was amazing as was the cinematography. But the star of this film are the awesome creature effects .I don't want to give too much away but I can tell you this is the best creature feature I've seen in a very long time, that has a right to play it completely straight.Which is refreshing as we've had many schlocky,Horror Comedies this year.Don't misunderstand, I love those films too but this filled a void this year. You become easily invested in the main characters which makes the film more endearing and enjoyable.There's no unessacery filler.All is relevant and entertaining. The last 45 minutes is insane!

"This was a pretty good home invasion flick.Granted it wasn't the best but it did have great acting.Two relationship misfortunes thrown in the mix and a twist.It was somewhat like You're Next in that when the home invasion occurred the son's girlfriend (Kara Scodelario) had sneaked in and so no one knew she was there but the boyfriend and the mother.She hid and  when opportunities presented themselves she kind of went ninja girl on the bad guys.There wasn't any gore but there was some brutal violence.Stand outs were Dougray Scott and Kara Scodelario but all were effective.It's not going to satisfy a hardcore Horror fan but it will serve as entertainment for lovers of One location thrillers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A2CS96BQZ4A8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013W7LSE4#wasThisHelpful","R3A2CS96BQZ4A8","A1MECEHZHFE5PT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MECEHZHFE5PT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a back to basics Slasher .With good practical effects.It starts with a tale about the legend of a young deformed Charlie and his cannibal family.Of course some not so smart people think it would be a good idea to visit the farm,investigate and camp.All except  Tara Reid,who weighs all of 80 pounds! Charlie himself was quite menacing and huge at 7 feet tall and 350 pounds. His creature makeup was done nicely too.So when Reid and Charlie meet it isn't actually a fair match up! The odds are much better when Charlie takes on Kane Hodder's character.As I said before it's back to basics ,but I like formulaic Slashers.They're what I grew up loving and still do! There were quite a few brutal kills with a good amount of gore and the lighting was sort of dark during these scenes because they were usually done either at night or in a dark barn. So it made them look all the more real.There were a couple of kills in the daylight and one was a (WTF) I have to rewind this about 5 times moment!I can't say that I really cared that much about the characters as to be disturbed if they got offed.

"A group of people camping in some Turkish ruins play a game called (Murder In The Dark) Then they start turning up dead for real .Not just dead but also missing internal organs.The scenery and camera work is beautiful and the acting is very good as well.This film was  experimental in that none of the actors knew who among them the killer was until they got to that part of the film .Plus there was a lot of ad lib acting.I personally thought the story was somewhat stagnant and the characters one dimensional. I didn't guess the killer but then again I wasn't very inspired. For a film about organ transplant research the film was virtually bloodless.The only way they could have redeemed this would be if there was some good gore to go with the organ transplant theme.No such luck! Sorry but this was a big miss for me.I realize it was an experimental film.But remember your core audience is watching this because (8 Films To Die For) is usually known for over the top horror which includes gore or atleast disturbing visuals!","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R6COM4A1KNWP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015SK8WU6#wasThisHelpful","R2R6COM4A1KNWP","A1MECEHZHFE5PT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MECEHZHFE5PT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There was some pretty good gore and some Campy splatter as well.It was a fun viewing experience and is sure to become a Halloween staple.I loved seeing all the different actors that we have come to recognize from Horror films past.The list is quite impressive and these scream kings and queens add to the overall personality of the film.My personal favorite tales were Sweet Tooth,Friday The 31st ,The Ransom Of Rusty Rex and Bad Seed!Although everyone will have there own favorites.

"This could have been a really good film had they not dragged everything out .Otherwise,the acting was good.The locations and scenery were beautiful and it had good production value.It was just too little too late because the only real action or anything really interesting happened in the last 25 minutes.It was supposed to be a creature feature but it was very lite on the creature .It was about a mutated polar bear terrorizing a group of people in Alaska.But we never really get a good look at it.I understand if you show a creature too much we as an audience can become desensitized to it.But in order for us to fear it we must be able to be properly introduced to it on film.James Remar is always good and this role is no exception.There were a few scenes of violence but nothing that took it to a level of real Horror.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RMK1U4N6RIXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015S61AZO#wasThisHelpful","R3RMK1U4N6RIXO","A1MECEHZHFE5PT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MECEHZHFE5PT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Suspension is filmed beautifully using different color schemes such as using monochromatic grays but then during a kill using vivid blood red so it really makes a statement.The story itself is about a girl Emily (Ellen MacNevin) and her little brother who are home alone ,frightened that there psycho dad will come calling. Emily is bullied at school so she escapes by drawing pictures of a bloody murders which seem to be coming to fruition in real life!The acting is well done and the characters are fine enough.There is quite a lot of bloody violence but nothing extremely gory.There's a lot of stabbings and killings of that nature. I enjoyed it except there was a twist which I saw coming quite clearly.I liked the killers mask and thought he was creepy enough to scare someone who has the luxury of still being frightened by these types of films.There was also a little bit of black comedy thrown in to round it out.I would recommend this to lovers of teen Slashers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15M29YCIKF5EX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015SKCBD0#wasThisHelpful","R15M29YCIKF5EX","A1MECEHZHFE5PT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MECEHZHFE5PT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's roomy enough so all your makeup  fits in it and small enough that it can be carried in a large tote bag.I love that it has separate zipped compartments.

There were a couple of really awesome and disturbing kill scenes and some good gore effects.I also liked it because I didn't have to see the rapes as there were none shown except for brief flashbacks.The film keeps cutting to Jennifer\Angela sitting in the office of a counselor but we never fully understand the complete reasoning until the end of the film.Some of the film can be somewhat subjective at times or ambiguous leaving one to form his or her own opinion.Everything seems very dark ,even when inside.

They managed to get in quite a few very cleverly toned down kills,and it was enough to satisfy me.The production was amazing.The sets are perfection as was the acting and hilarious dialogue. It had a sweet side to it as well seeing as it deals with the relationship between a daughter and her deceased mother.This is as of now my top Horror film of the year even though it's a straight up Horror\Comedy.The casting was also pitch perfect. (Taissa Farmiga) of AHS Coven fame was perfect as Max and in my opinion the stand outs were (Alia Shawkat) as Gertie and (Adam DeVine) as Kurt. Both are hilarious and have the best executed lines.

"This was another Halloween anthology, a sequel to All Hallows Eve .It starts out with a woman finding a strange VHS tape on her doorstep, then she pops it in the VCR and starts watching.! There are about 6 or 7 short films but there were really only 3 that were memorable and the rest were average to underwhelming at best!There wasn't much gore and few effects.The last short had a very creepy feel to it and the makeup was well done.It was in Spanish with English subtitles. The overall offering isn't bad but not good either. It had promise but fell short.They skimped on the gore and effects.There was oppurtunity for some good splatter and  other gore but they went the easy route.The first story dealing with pumpkin seeds was the best and had the only really decent gore effect.That could have definatley brought the movie up a couple of stars.If the stories had been better executed and been more suspensful,they might have been able to get away with it. I did however enjoy the musical score and found it creepy and fitting.The pumpkin face man that delivers the tape and lurks outside the main characters house is sort of creepy in a couple of shots but once you see him full on in a more lighted setting he's not at all disturbing. I liked what there intentions were but I would really only recommend it for a Redbox rental or if you had no other Halloween films to choose from.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBO6IVVGEA2DQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015AIKSRG#wasThisHelpful","RBO6IVVGEA2DQ","A1MECEHZHFE5PT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MECEHZHFE5PT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was pleasantly surprised by this Slasher flick! It has a well peiced together storyline and doesn't at all seem like some of these thrown together messes we have seen alot of lately.Even though it has some camp appeal.There are some genuinely disturbing and creepy scenes.The story starts out as a flashback and builds wonderfully from there.Of course these are critics that will say ""the characters made stupid decisions""  .But if they didn't,the film wouldn't be as fun!The acting was good and we get large doses of Horror icons (Bill Moseley) and (Kane Hodder) who play psychotic brothers with some distasteful habits.This isn't the first time we've seen an ambulance used for purposes of carnage in a slasher film,in 2008 we saw it in the After Dark Horror Fest film Autopsy.This film isn't without some twists and turns along the way and the ride is fun! There are some well done practical gore effects and some splatter,I believe I saw one CGI kill but that's all.I would give it a 6/7 on the 1 to10 gore meter.I was never bored, not even in the beginning when they took quite awhile to introduce and develop the characters.I think most slasher fans will find it quite entertaining and satisfying.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDQL92A4OZB48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3DC79I#wasThisHelpful","RDQL92A4OZB48","A1MECEHZHFE5PT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MECEHZHFE5PT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"(Awaken) is a movie about organ harvesters who own two islands. One for the actual procedures to take place and another where their  soon to be victims wake up on shore having no clue how they got there. The harvesters  make sure the captives eat fruit and clean thier systems out before they hunt them for the operations!There's a really good ensemble cast of you might say ""has beens"" like( Daryl Hannah) (David Keith)(Jason London) etc. There's also (Michael Copon) and the awesome (Natalie Burn).It's pretty good,some of it believable some of it not so much.Burn as Billie steals the show as an butt kickng ,tough but hot new captive girl.The story is interesting enough to pull you in and keep you watching because you want to see how the characters fare because the character development for the main characters is good .There are a couple of not so surprising twists that add a little spice.There is violence but nothing really gory save one scene of a cadaver who's organs have been taken..The fight choreography was good and fun to watch especially when Billie was kicking butt! There are also alot of gun fights.  Over all it's definitely worth a watch especially if you like the fight or die or trapped on an island type genres.

"(Stung) is a fun creature feature about mutated wasps crashing a boring garden party .But it's OK they really liven things up(Matt O'Leary) and (Jessica Cook) play Paul and Julia, 2 party caterers that just happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. There's some sexual tension between the two but mainly on Paul's part.It also stars the great (Clifton Collins Jr) and horror veteran (Lance Henriksen).Collins as  the nerdy son of the woman throwing the party ""quite a departure for Collins"" and Henriksen as a guest.At first the wasps are large but when they bite someone they burrow into them and Become huge mutations.There is plenty of action and gore and other gross stuff. Turns out Paul is not the loser Julia thought he was as he  takes on the dreaded creatures with hero like finnesse.This movie is fun,entertaining .It has romance betrayal and is the best creature feature I've seen in a long time.

"(Clown) was a movie I have been wanting to see since I heard about it! I'm a huge Eli Roth fan and he didn't disappoint with this .I found the story to be quite original and unique.The main character Kent played by (Andy Powers) finds an old clown suit ""that unbeknownst to him has an evil and terrifying history"" he puts it on for his son's birthday party to play (Dummo The Clown)  and it actually starts taking root on and in his body.He finds out the suit is cursed and is turning him into a demon that eats children.The transformation effects are really good especially when he is completely transformed,he is terrifying and looks freaky and so cool.There's was a nice amount of gore but not as much as I expected, and it was all done extremely well.They don't shy away from showing children getting eaten or killed either.The story got a little bogged down in a couple of places but that's such a small thing to complain about. There was a found Footage scene that was quite chilling as well.The fact that they took the movie seriously said alot about the confidence they had in the story because it could have gone really wrong fast but it worked perfectly. All in all I think it's one of the best horror films I've seen in quite awhile.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17ZKFQ003JNL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ871O4#wasThisHelpful","R17ZKFQ003JNL0","A1MECEHZHFE5PT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MECEHZHFE5PT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"(Bound To Vengeance) which has a running time of  only about 1 hour and 15 minutes wastes no time in getting straight to the meat.Even though it doesn't build much character development in the beginning we come to know the two main characters as the movie proceeds.Eve (Tina Ivlev) who reminds me of a young (Evan Rachel Wood)) wakes up in a dark dank room,chained ,beaten,raped and filthy.Her captor Phil (Richard Tyson) attempts to feed her but she over powers him by beating him in the head with a brick then fastens a neck snare with a very long handle and takes control of his gun! ( no spoiler,it happens in the first 5 minutes) She finds several polaroids of other girls with names and numbers on them.Should Eve do the easy thing and run or try and rescue the other girls? Well,she's a pretty bad a** chick so she decides to go on a rescue mission.From here the movie becomes a fast paced adrenaline, revenge and blood  filled adventure. The acting is superb.The situations are white knuckle inducing.Sometimes hard to watch ,sometimes satisfying ! There is bloody violence and some quick glimpses of gore but not enough to call it a slasher flick.It is one heck of a good revenge thriller though. (Tina Ivlev) as Eve is believable and so good you can't take your eyes off of her.There really are no twists but more like a couple of revelations. It does have a very short running time, but not a moment was wasted on anything frivolous.I really liked the song near the end of the movie and am glad they sang it in Spanish otherwise it would have seemed a bit cliché.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WG6TUD7KD2H7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010FF63AU#wasThisHelpful","R1WG6TUD7KD2H7","A1MECEHZHFE5PT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MECEHZHFE5PT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is nothing but an exploitation movie about transsexuals narrated by a ""specialist in the field"" (Dr Leo Wollman) with a large portion of dialoge coming from a very passable and pretty transsexual named  (Leslie). Most of the other people under going (sex change therapy) ""as it was called back then"" are unconvincing as the opposite sex save a couple.It's almost a porno film ,even porn star (Harry Reems) of Deep Throat fame is in it ,as they reinact how a trans woman has sex too soon and he leaves her in a small pool of blood after intercourse. They actually show a full sex change surgery blow by blow. Then show the results weeks after with her spread eagle! I must say they have certainly come along way in the surgery department! Now with the new technology the vagina is  aesthetically pleasing and one would never know it was created and not genetic.But this film is just for shock value although most of the information as to the mindset of transgender individuals is accurate.

"Eddy (Jason Tobin) is an introverted Asian man who denies his Asian descent,to the point of telling Asian jokes to one of his male coworkers and perpetuates Asian stereotypes.He is obsessed with serial killers,his favorite being Ted Bundy!Laughed at and ostrasized by some girls at work Eddy starts his murder spree by offing one of them.After that kill he gets bolder, as he does with every other kill. Eddy becomes romantically involved with the boss' mistress and that is the basis for most of the story.The story was interesting enough although stagnet at times.The acting was good especially by (Jason Tobin) but the kills were lackluster and unsatisfying! There was some blood but no gore! The first kill was the closest thing to being slasher worthy and it was just a stabbing through clothes with some blood splattered on the killers face.Bottom line ...This is an OK film that has a much used plotline.The production value is better than one would expect.There is violence but nothing a hardcore horror lover would find interesting .","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KCS4TYXIXVCE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0107OS5ZK#wasThisHelpful","R2KCS4TYXIXVCE","A1MECEHZHFE5PT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MECEHZHFE5PT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm sorry to disagree with these glowing reviews. Most of which have no more than three total reviews or less! But,I do.This movie while somewhat entertaining, fails when it comes to casting and the fight scenes were so bad at times I was like ""hurry up and kill him already"".While Dean Cain's acting was good,I found it very hard buying into him being an army of one after being placed in the same prison as the man  (Victor Abbott) played by 7 foot tall Wrestler Paul Wright who killed his pregnant wife.The story was cliché but that would be OK if it gave us something juicy to latch onto. This didn't. Yes, there was some bloody violence as we would expect from The Soska Sisters but it certainly wasn't gory as some have written.There was a bright spot and that was (Michael Eklund) as Warden Snyder.Eklund is always great as the wormish bad guy and plays it so well everytime he makes me want to choke him.Nothing different or special here,it's a do a crime so you can do the time ,get into prison to get revenge on an inmate film.Of course it's usually you against the rest of the prison but there becomes a bit of a different spin on that.I'm not saying it's horrible or unwatchable just that if I don't believe the main actor in his role ,it makes it hard to invest emotionally!","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R102H80FW8QDMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZHTDOU2#wasThisHelpful","R102H80FW8QDMK","A1MECEHZHFE5PT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MECEHZHFE5PT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Cake was far from a feel good movie but it does give the viewer hope that life, even under the most tragic of situations is still worth fighting for.The ensemble cast was perfect .Yes (Jennifer Aniston) as Claire Bennett was great but so was the often overlooked (Adriana Barraza) as Silvana and (Sam Worthington) husband to the late Nina Collins (Anna Kendrick) who killed herself by jumping off a busy overpass.As much tragedy as the film boasts Jennifer Aniston's comedic timing and dry wit are perfectly utilized and while lighten the mood do not make light of the situations. Claire is heartbreaking to watch. You can see she's in agonizing pain physically and mentally.She also punishes herself by allowing men to use her body as if she has left it spiritually which is further emphasized when we see her having conversations with the deceased Nina.Kudos to Aniston for allowing herself to be filmed in such an unattractive light. It just wouldn't have worked if she looked beautiful.I personally found this to be one of the best films of the year. It made me feel so many real emotions and that is great film making.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R9XSHG3J9AGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY6CM7U#wasThisHelpful","R1R9XSHG3J9AGX","A1MECEHZHFE5PT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MECEHZHFE5PT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was part documentary part fiction. Kim Filth is a weed smoking, pill snorting loser who lives with his father. He writes poetry and quotes it thoughout the film. I found his poetry to be depressing but prolific.If and when Kim was acting I couldn't tell. Either most of it was real or he's that good!Some might find this rather boring or mundane but I was mesmerized by Kim Filth/Shadow Zombie ""his alter ego"" and the strange unfortunate people that we're introduced to. There is some disturbing imagery that somehow ties into the story but there was never enough explanation to know exactly what the full extent of the images were.One of the images was explained at the end of the film, the one dealing with Kim not the bloody images that Cookie/Brandi was seeing. Brandi is a very disturbed girl who dresses up as a clown named Cookie .Shadow Zombie and Cookie have a brief stint as boyfriend /girlfriend until she loses it. He also has a love interest who is an amputee and lets him suck on her stump!I guess I liked it so much because Kim is a real person.One with rotten teeth, a very thin frame,he's highly disfuctional and really has nothing to look forward to but more tragedy ,yet he keeps on keepin on.

"Being an Eric England fan I've known and heard about this film for a couple of years. I finally got to see it.(Ace Marrero) and (Katie Stegeman) who are no strangers to England's films play Dan and Mindy Summers.A married couple with a baby on the way.They're on the way to Dan's sisters house when they are trapped in the clutches of a madman with a high powered rifle. When asked why ? by Dan,the man says. Why not! From here they have to do whatever it takes to try and survive which includes not freezing to death as it is Christmas eve.While I found it entertaining and the acting quite good it just felt a little hollow. I thought seeing as it was mostly dialogue, the dialogue could have been sharper .It did had some very tense moments a feeling of dread and some nice camera angles.This is definitely not England's shining moment but it's better than a lot of low budget thrillers I've seen recently. As far as gore, it's not that kind of party but there is one scene with a splatter!

"I love horror films  where the villains are creepy, religious fanatic family members,and this was certainly one of those .These very messed up siblings take it upon themselves to capture and ""purge"" so called Dirty Girls of their sins. The methods they use are very brutal and deadly.It seems the siblings were terrorized and tortured as children by their schizophrenic mother in the name of the Lord, which are recounted in flashbacks. The cast was well balanced and the acting quite good. (Kaylee DeFer) as Michelle being the main focus.The reason she is being punished  is because she was driving drunk and her boyfriend and 2 other people were killed as the result.I found it to he engaging enough but it lacked some depth and logic, which I usually don't mind but this had the makings of a really good film. The gore was about a 4 on a scale of 1-10 but at least what they did have was done Decently.There are some scenes of torture that include a power drill and box cutter.I would recommend it for a rental.It actually only had a running time of about 70 minutes of movie.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R318SLL60V5YP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EIEPG4Y#wasThisHelpful","R318SLL60V5YP","A1MECEHZHFE5PT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MECEHZHFE5PT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm conflicted about this film. There are many good points but unfortunately some areas that are not so good.To me, it seemed as it didn't quite know what it wanted to be and commit to it.Just when I started taking the plot seriously there would be something that pulled me back to (oh, OK, it's like this). Meaning it was somewhat of a parody or mockumentary there is  even some ""found footage "".It makes fun of while also sympathizing with the way people that were deemed crazy in the 1960s were treated while in state asylums. There are dreamlike sequences that in my opinion are the bright spots of the film. (Guy Edmonds)  plays our main character George Kilner,who voluntarily commits himself into the asylum without knowing the horrors that await him.Edmond's acting is another bright spot.He really takes us were the role takes him.(Gary Boulter) as Cutter was believeable as well.There is also some sketchy acting, I won't hurt feelings by saying the main, mood killer! Because you can be into a movie and a wooden performance can take you right back out of it. I found it entertaining and certainly wasn't bored because it certainly has its clever moments and points. There was a lot of violence and torture that was effective and disturbing but the gore effects were pretty weak.There are scenes of rape and also mentions and recountings of child sexual molestation.George's perverted uncle whom we see in flashbacks is very creepy and disturbing but then again anything to do with child molestation skeeves me out. If you like any kind of films dealing with asylums or mental illness this will be right up your  alley .As a film about the horrors of the treatment of mentally ill patients, it works but as a slasher not so much.I think the director (Chew Barker) has a bright future ahead of him and for his first film did an admirable job!","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPUM3HOMAW4FL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOGGDUW#wasThisHelpful","RPUM3HOMAW4FL","A1MECEHZHFE5PT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MECEHZHFE5PT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This film revolves around a couple who's car breaks down along the Irish countryside ,who then stumble upon an old farmhouse that leaves much to be desired in the lighting department.In a flashback the farmhouse owner has exumed some sort of undead creature who then starts stalking them. The creature is really creepy even though we never get a really good look at him except for a couple of shadowy face shots.His figure, presense and sound are quite frightening .It seems the only thing he is frightened of is light and the couple have very little except a dying flashlight, cellphone, one lamp in the farmhouse and some candles. There is some nicely done gore but not a lot ,also the lighting in the film is nicely done but some things are meant to be hard to see or left to one's imagination.I won't give anything else  away as not to spoil .I found it to be fast moving and attention keeping even making me wince and clutch my pearls a few times.

"This was such a sweet and inspiring film. I'm so glad they used  transgender actress (Michelle  Henley) instead of using non transgender actresses as they have in the past. As Ricky, Michelle was a joy to watch, as was (Michael Welch) as Robby her best friend since the age of Six. Welch really put his heart into this role and didn't let anything hold him back.All the actors were great and I was emotionally invested in each of them for different reasons.This story takes place in a small town where everyone knows Ricky is Trans but most everyone treats her with respect. It's basically a love story with a couple of twists and secrets.I thought the actress who played Ricky was very brave to do a full frontal nude scene as a preoperative transgender woman, it wasn't gratuitous but needed for the scene to be impactive.There are a lot of dynamics explored, such as, am I gay if I sleep with a pre op transsexual ? Am I straight if, I, as a pre op transsexual,sleep with a woman ? etc. It seems confusing but it is dealt with in a respectful and graceful manner.It made me weepy in certain spots but sometimes it was an (oh that's so sweet)  kind of weepy. As a transgender woman, myself, who had the surgery in 2000, I recommend this film whole heartedly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9GISKF8AZ9L9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TJ14IBI#wasThisHelpful","R9GISKF8AZ9L9","A1MECEHZHFE5PT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MECEHZHFE5PT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There was some moments that really worked.I have to say this movie creeped me out and I was scared, and that never happens.The cast was good as was the acting.The POV shots were effective and the lighting and lack there of provided some of the best thrills and chills.There was no gore to speak of but there was violence and some disturbing images.The actors were all very attractive, so we had something nice to look at.I thought it was a clever film and definitely worth a watch.Make sure you watch the beginning and the ending carefully.

"Digging Up The Marrow was much more fun than I had anticipated. Adam Green is hilarious as himself in what is basically a mockumentary about a strange man William Dekker played to perfection by veteran actor(Ray Wise) .Dekker claims to know of an underground world of Monsters called ""The Marrow"" that he has been keeping tabs on for years.Everyone from Green's wife to Victor Crowley himself (Kane Hodder) make appearances in the film as themselves as well. I found it to be quite clever and fresh,but  was surprised that there was no gore seeing as it was an Adam Green film. Dekker enlists Green to document his findings but has very ridged and paranoid rules attached to the project.It took quite awhile to get through the silly stuff to the horror aspect of the film.When it did it was quite chilling and left an quite an impression on me. I enjoyed this film very much. It's one that you will either really like or not!

Chris Coy's subtle performance as ""John McCormick"" son of the detective who was obsessed with the Francis Visser case, until he blew his own brains out due to his frustration with Visser never being convicted or punished for his crimes of torturing and burying women alive.John comes to the small town looking for Eugene/Francis,but what are John's true intentions? This is something that comes to light when the plot allows.This is a slow burn thriller that keeps you own your toes and enthralled .There are enough twists and turns to make one Dizzy.The cat and mouse between Eugene and John is quite entertaining to watch but plays out evenly, without seeming too far fetched because everything ties together quite brilliantly.The ending gave me great satisfaction and closure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37J1SJDZEIA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVTE0JE#wasThisHelpful","R37J1SJDZEIA1","A1MECEHZHFE5PT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MECEHZHFE5PT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Indonesian slasher film took me by surprise as to how good it was. It's reminiscent of the French slasher ""Frontiers"".It boasts all the cliches that I have come to love in these cannibalistic gore fests.

"The first hour of this film is very slow moving as they try to build character development for the six lead characters.The acting is good but most of the characters are uninspiring.They take a group picture at the beginning of their trip, which in these movies is always the kiss of death.The six of them go to spend the weekend at a cabin near a lake Somewhere in Finland. After about an hour into the movie they realize they're being stalked by someone or something. There are a few boring kills with little or no effects.They have no electricity or phone service so they decide to take off into the woods to find help.There is some creep factor to it but for this type of film they needed some gore. If I told you what was killing them, it might be a spoiler. Even though I'm not even certain what it was supposed to be,myself !

"This is the best kept secret I've discovered in awhile. I had no clue this film existed until yesterday. As a lover of Disco and slasher flims I feel like I won lottery .It's certainly not a masterpiece but for some like me it is a gem. The story is about a guy who had a very traumatic experience while disco type music was playing, so now, when he hears it he goes insane and murders and mutilates women. I'm really glad I got to experience Discopath.I think it's essential viewing for retro slasher lovers.This is a gore fest and the effects are really well done. At times I actually forgot I was watching a movie that was made in 2013,It felt so much like a film from 1980.In certain scenes it had a  Dario Argentina feel to it, like when the woman was in the corridor and her dress was blowing.The music was authentic as well, with tracks from Ronnie Griffith,Walter Murphy, Kiss,KC & TheSunshine Band and more Disco faves.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S2RAQ3YMXWMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K0BSGNM#wasThisHelpful","R3S2RAQ3YMXWMQ","A1MECEHZHFE5PT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MECEHZHFE5PT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I never knew this French horror/Slasher film existed until yesterday.I love French horror and this one was pretty good. It was a bit muddled in spots but it made up for that with Great acting, amazing creature effects and well done gore.The story is somewhat formulaic as we begin with a woman driving down a desolate stretch of road,then wanders into an inn where everyone is weird and people go missing. It has a Gothic feel to it which adds to the creepy atmosphere.From here it gets crazy.

"""Nathan Phillips"" best known to horror fans for his roles in ""Wolf Creek"" and ""Chernobyl Diaries"" Heads up the cast in this film in which there is only about 15 hours left until the world comes to an end by way of fire.He plays James, a seemingly self centered party boy.On his way to the last party ever, where everyone  gets wasted and acts like Sodom and Gomorrah part 2, James stumbles upon Rose ""Angourie Rice"" a little girl who has been taken by two disgusting pedophiles.He saves her then has to make a moral judgement as to take her to her family or go to the party.From there James and Rose create a bond and encounter all types of inhumane people. There's violence, some very graphic but nothing really slasher film worthy save one scene with a machete. It's a very moving story that is also very frightening because it seems so plausible.Nathan Phillips looks sexier than ever, showing six pack abs and a bit more than that in one scene. This is definitely not a feel good movie but there are moments that restore your faith in mankind when so much madness and debauchery are lurking in every corner.There have been some good movies out of Australia lately with Wolf Creek 2, The Babadook and now, this one.

"Muck was basically a vehicle to showcase naked and half naked girls running around with blood all over them. In the beginning I thought they were going to go the straight slasher route with extra T&A. But then it became quite comical, spouting such lines as (if it makes you feel any better ,my car got tossed on the hot chick I was gonna bang tonight).It's also full of Scream-esque horror references and some clever horror film puns.Unfortunately the movie itself is muddled and all over the place.The bald albino creatures are creepy and effective at first but they became somewhat ineffective after being visible for so long. There was a lot of blood splatter but not anything hard core like decapitations or severed limbs.Basically Axes to the chest in darkened lighting and impalement  by pitchfork .Although they do shine in other areas where effects are concerned. Lachlan Buchanan was hilarious as ""Troit"" an intoxicated dude that's really good at killing these creatures.This movie could go either way .People could really like it or maybe not so much.depends on what you're looking for in a slasher film. If you want lots of T&A, Comic relief and lots of blood splatter then you will love it.

"""Hunted"" is a film that was released in 2012 under the title ""Rufus"" which I feel is a more fitting title. Regardless of what title it's under,it is a great vampire  film.Rufus shows up in a small town after his very elderly ward delivers him there, she then steps in front of a bus and he is alone.Before she dies he promises her he will try and blend in. He then moves in with a family who lost a son in a terrible accident. The man of the family just happens to be the sheriff,which could either be a blessing or a curse!It's very reminiscent of (Let The Right One In) only The vampire is a boy of about 15 or 16 named Rufus and he finds an understanding girl who lives across the street who falls in love with him. This really isn't a horror film but more of a Thriller/Drama although there is a fair amount of blood in some scenes.The rest of the film is very moving as Rufus tries to blend in and feed his hunger too. He's very much like the HBO character Dexter in that he only feeds on people that are bad or a danger to him or someone he loves.A mysterious stranger comes to the small town soon after Rufus arrives and he has an agenda and it isn't a pleasant one.All the performances were good but ""Rory J Saper"" as Rufus was amazing and heart tugging. This is a vampire film with heart and it has a nice soundtrack too. I will buy this and re watch it because I found the characters endearing and I cared what happened to them.I love this film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIYL0P6FRUK66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T9DIUOM#wasThisHelpful","RIYL0P6FRUK66","A1MECEHZHFE5PT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MECEHZHFE5PT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has to be the best horror film I have seen so far this year!Think ""I Spit On Your Grave"" meets ""Dead Girl"".There is no down time, the film starts off with a bang and doesn't let up.Although it's very racially offensive, it only serves as a catalyst for us to hate all the more, the gang of rednecks that Kill Indians for sport, use the N word and kidnap, rape and brutalize our Heroine ""Zoe"" played flawlessly by Amanda Adrienne.This has gore galore and very well done gore at that. I was amazed at the production value of this film. The lighting was amazing and reminded me of the film (Borderland) .All of the acting was above average as well.After this ordeal Zoe has one thing on her mind, Revenge! I's a lot of fun watching her get it too.I highly highly recommend this film. It's what we as slasher/horror lovers have been waiting for this year.

"This is a great multifunctional light vacuum.  It was very easy to put together and easy to use.  It's top heavy so it can't stand on its own.  Fortunately they have a holder you can put up which I will be doing very quickly.  I've used it on vinyl, hardwoods and area rugs so far and it's done a very good job.

"This blanket is so warm and it feels fantastic.  It's very comfortable and heats quickly and across this whole blanket.  At the same time I got this one, however, I also got the plush.  That one is just so so soft.  So if you want a super soft blanket, go ahead and spend a few extra dollars and go with the plush.  If you just want the warmth and aren't going to have this directly on your skin, save the money and go with this model.

"When I read the synopsis of this book, I was on the fence about whether or not I wanted to read it.  However, I've read Albom's other books and enjoyed all of them so I thought I'd give it a shot.  Boy am I glad I did.  Not only is the writing great, but this is absolutely his best so far. The thoughts are unique and original and I was just pulled into this world of music and into Frankie's world.  This is a character you will care about and it will make you think about your own life and the meaning of everything around you.  I know Albom's books are always thought provoking in that sense.  However, this book is just different from the others and you have to read it to understand.

"This blanket is so very comfortable. The blanket is the ultimate in softness with the microfleece. It heated very quickly and maintains a comfortable warmth at the setting where you put it.  I actually am sitting under it now - the warmth helps pain in my legs so I like to use even when I'm not too cold. There are two controls and they are very user friendly.  I was able to use them without any problem.  Each has its own a/c adapter so you will plug into 2 different outlets for the one blanket.  The one I received actually looks much lighter to me than it does in the photograph.  It is an off white - an ivory.  I've had a blanket similar to this and though I loved it a lot, it didn't last as long as I had hoped.  I think longevity will be the key to this one.

"I have an enormous amount of ginger growing in my front yard and in my back yard so I seem to have a never ending supply of it.  Often, I just don't want to bother with it. I like to use it for tea and in my smoothies -so many recipes call for it and you see the anti-inflammatory health benefits of it constantly.  Enter this little gadget.  After I ordered it I wasn't sure that I would use it but I'm happy that I have it now.  It's not too large and doesn't take up too much space.  It is very pretty and reasonably priced and it works well.  If you use ginger enough it is a product worth purchasing.  You can throw it in the dishwasher which is great.

"These are such great products whether you want to use as  nanny cam, a pet monitor or just a home check.  My sister has one and she uses the 2 way communication to talk to her dog throughout the day.  I use this to monitor my home and check on my pets.  I've had other brands before but the difference with this one is that you can move it where you need it without the cord.  You can charge it and put it where you want to.  Also, you can watch what happened through the day.  The other brands I have also have that ability but they charge you.  If I wanted to keep paying I could pay a monitoring company but I'm not interested in doing that.  So those two things make this product superior.The setup is easy and you can watch quickly what took place during the day.  If you are concerned what's going on in your home but don't have time to keep checking all day this is perfect.  The night vision works well but I find that so with most of the brands.

"I was beyond thrilled to get this Deebot.  I have a dog that sheds so badly it is impossible to keep my dark hardwoods clean.  It would require sweeping at least twice a day and I don't have the time or energy to do that.  This is soooooo easy.  The only con so far is that the little debris tank fills up pretty quickly but I think that is because the vast amount of hair this dog and cat shed.  I don't mind dumping it though since I don't have to vacuum or sweep myself.  It's not totally perfect.  It does miss some spaces but overall this is my dream product.  I can't think of many things I'd rather have than this because it just saves times.  You can schedule it to clean at a specific time schedule as well so you don't even have to turn it on and you don't have to be embarrassed by your floors when someone shows up unannounced.!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRQ4C2Y7CAP70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010DWI09C#wasThisHelpful","RRQ4C2Y7CAP70","AJ9AE2BVND0GS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ9AE2BVND0GS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The box wasn't damaged at all and it was packed well, so I think it is jut one of those things that can happen when you ship breakable items.

"This is a very advanced digital painting software with a steep learning curve for those who are new to it.  The new features for this version add even more dimension to the software and they have video tutorials that explain them in detail and show what you can do with them.  They all are on youtube and you can watch them prior to purchasing if you want to.  The great thing about this software is that is has so many features - just a vast expanse of abilities for any artist to exploit in any format.  If you have a lot of knowledge of artistic technique, you will probably pick this up pretty quickly.  If you are a novice or have moderate ability, there will be a much steeper learning curve.  However, if you put in the time, you will be able to create some amazing work in any format you desire.  I admit I've watched numerous video tutorials so far and I'm only able to scratch the surface of what this software can do.  I'm in it for the long haul though and I expect to get better.  I just have to get the knack for the digital combined with the traditional art.  I will say the new audio expressions is a strange addition.  For the professional artist, I'm not sure that this will seem much more than a neat little gimmick but the addition of the speckles will provide much more depth and is worth having in the digital art repertoire.  This is an amazing software and I believe anyone who considers themselves an artist today would be lacking without this in their painter's arsenal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F66SU0LS7VF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123C648Y#wasThisHelpful","R2F66SU0LS7VF9","AJ9AE2BVND0GS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ9AE2BVND0GS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These razors are a good value.  These products have become so expensive over the past few years that I appreciate a good value on them.  It's a nice basic razor without a lot of extras you can see on some of them - like moisturizers.  That's okay and I'm fine with these.  I will admit I don't feel I get as smooth a shave as with some others I have tried (while I'm actually shaving) but they do the job and the shave is actually a very close shave which leaves my legs more smooth after the fact.  I like this product and can see myself preferring this to other more expensive options.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4W0MRGTJJA0T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YUYVMQ#wasThisHelpful","R4W0MRGTJJA0T","AJ9AE2BVND0GS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ9AE2BVND0GS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing I will say about these tables is they are tiny, and I do mean tiny. However, if you've priced nightstands and end tables lately you know you can spend a small fortune for one.  I went back and forth between 3 and 4 stars and I'd give it somewhere in the middle.  It's great that you can get 2 tables for this price but they are so short and you have to be ready to assemble them as well.  I am posting a picture so you can see it in relation to the bed.

"I'll start by saying I don't mind the flavor of these at all.  It's a little like banana with a veggie aftertaste.  I wouldn't have even thought anything about it had I not looked at some of the reviews and seen that as the primary complaint.  I like Garden of Life supplements and take the Primal Defense probiotics. I've been using that along with digestive enzymes for a few years now.  After spending nearly 20 years on meds like Prevacid, I hardly need them anymore.  I wouldn't have thought it possible but this combination seems to be very good for my very bad tummy.  The change doesn't take place overnight.  It takes months and you hardly notice the effect until you quit taking it and suddenly feel terrible or you just realize one day, wow I feel so much better and  don't even need an antacid.That has been my experience with enzymes.  I wanted to say that because I have tried different brands of enzymes and they are definitely not all the same, especially with my preferred brands of supplements.  Some don't seem to work at all.  What's important to know is that it takes time to take effect and just be patient as long as you aren't having any negative effects. I'll keep taking these and see how I'm feeling by the time I finish the bottle or update if I have to quit taking for some reason.  I very much like that these are organic whole foods in here and non-GMO verified as well as gluten free, soy free and dairy free with no sugars, preservatives, artificial sweeteners or fillers added.  I tend to react to a lot of those things so it's important they not have that.  So far it seems like a great product and I will update.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BFDSEYW9TVKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y8MPKVU#wasThisHelpful","R2BFDSEYW9TVKE","AJ9AE2BVND0GS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ9AE2BVND0GS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You dissolve these tablets under your tongue.  They dissolve.  I love chamomile because I have allergies to everything and sometimes it seems like the only thing that can calm my system down.  I only use chamomile soap because it doesn't irritate and redden my skin and seems to calm it and I drink the tea to calm me some evenings.  I didn't even know these tablets exist.  I saw that about helping rheumatic pain and decided I needed to give it a try.  I had not heard of this for helping with that before either and did a little research as a result.  It seems literature is mixed on whether this ha a significant impact or not.  But I've been in a mighty flare lately and need to try what I can.  It does have a calming effect but I will wait til I've taken a while longer to see if it has an impact on the rheumatic pain and will update.  I have a feeling it will probably be specific to each individual taking it but I will know for myself soon.

"I fully expected not to like this very much and yet I do  The idea of no more brown cardboard ending up on my bathroom floor and crowding the garbage can is very appealing to me.  The container is more compact and thus it's easier to carry and it fits just fine o the toilet paper holder.  If you are ocd about having a perfectly round toilet paper roll, you might not like this.  Otherwise, it's just as good as the traditional roll.

"Wow, this is a huge juicer.  I have been juicing for about 10 years now and have owned many juicers.  This by far has the largest chute and strainer of any of them.  I like the pitcher as well.  When I read it had a froth catcher I thought it would be a pain to clean  That has been my experience, but this one is not like that at all. I only wish the pitcher was a little larger.  Most juicers pretty much have the same type of mechanism and this one is like that too so no surprises there.  It has only 2 speeds, but my experience is that's pretty much all I need.  The Breville I've had for about 8 years has 5 and I rarely use any but 1 and 5.  The key to my Breville is that is has lasted so long.  I will be curious to see the reliability of this one.  So far it works great and I have no complaints.  The pulp is a little but drier than this one but this one is faster. The key to juicing is to get it done as quickly as possible so you don't burn out on it and it feels like just a chore.  This helps because of that extra large chute and the great cleaner for the strainer.

"This is the best relationship book I have ever read.  When I chose this I actually had pretty low expectations and thought this would be a gimmicky little book with a list of 7 quick fixes to make your marriage perfect.  This is not what I thought and is not like that at all.This is years of couples therapy in a small book.  The key is you have to have 2 willing partners who want make their relationship work.  This is great for couples who plan to marry or for those who have been married for 25 years and all those in between.  My suggestion would be to buy one for each partner and have them read and make notes.  I underlined, marked stars and made notes.The marriage therapist who wrote this books treats marriage and this book with all the seriousness it deserves.  This is foundational and will take time but with the investment of that time and effort, you could end up with a very satisfying marriage and partnership that will fulfill you very deeply.  I believe 100% if you do what this author says, you can give yourselves the best chance possible - even in a rocky marriage that seems to be on its last leg.  There are great ideas and examples in here.I wish I could see this author myself.  I read this thinking all was absolutely fine in my marriage.  Yet I realized so much I should be doing and paying attention to.  It points out ways that a marriage can just slip away from you without your even noticing it.I noticed a review that said this isn't for problems right now.  I couldn't disagree more.  Your marriage didn't get into trouble overnight and you won't repair it in one.  But if you will start making changes immediately, I think the dynamic of an entire relationship could change, and ultimately change your life for the better.  If you do this and your marriage still fails, I do believe you can tell yourself you have given it the best shot possible.The basis for the marriage is one that is God based.  The author focuses on that.  Even if you are not real spiritual you can still find meaning with this.  The second chapter discusses this and don't let yourself get scared off by this chapter.  Just keep pushing through.  Even he admits himself there were moments he could get uncomfortable about things, yet you have to keep doing it to see the positive results that you get from just giving it a try.As I said, I read this book slowly and carefully and took notes the whole time.  I'm ready to reread it and focus even more this time.  I have already recommended it to family members and friends and will continue to do so.  I plan to recommend it to as many as possible because I think it's that good and really believe in it.  It's neither shallow nor gimmicky and I think could be life changing for many.  And there are just too many marriages in trouble.  This could be a game changer for you and your whole family.  It may not address your specific problem circumstances, but I believe those will improve by focusing on what he says to in here.  Great book and highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21JCER0JL0MF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310342279#wasThisHelpful","R21JCER0JL0MF1","AJ9AE2BVND0GS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ9AE2BVND0GS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very nice basic, slim design monitor.  It's perfect if you have a smaller one and are looking to upgrade or if you just have a laptop with a broken screen.  That's how I'm using mine.  My old HP laptop overheated all the time and ended up melting at the attachment for the screen and the screen quit working.  I simply attached the cord (I'm using VGA but there are two types you can use - DVI) and all is well again.  It's that simple.  So if you've broken your screen and have lots of important info on that computer and aren't ready to purchase a whole new system this is a great idea.  The design looks very nice.  Although it doesn't have a touchscreen I have found I truly do just fine without one and don't really need it except on my convertible tablet.

"My dog is very picky but she seems to like dog food with venison and she initially inhaled this.  Since that first introduction she seems a little slower about eating it.  So I think she is on the fence about it.  The good news is that it doesn't seem to irritate her sensitive stomach at all and I think she will probably continue to eat it when the soft food isn't there.  When I first gave her this, she chose it over the soft food.  So she may just be being moody about what she wants to eat right now.  The ingredients are satisfactory and I like that the bag seals.

"I stay dehydrated from a medical condition and my body just can't tolerate my heater in the winter.  Consequently, I use room heaters.  Some can still be very drying while others can be fire hazards.  After researching a lot of types, I've discovered these are very good for not drying you out so badly and not exposing things in the room to being burned on its elements.  I bought a couple that were a different brand a few years ago and paid 3 times as much for each - they worked great but didn't last very long and I was disappointed.  The price on this model is great and I really can't tell any difference from the ones that cost a lot more.  The key for me will be how long they last too. This unit heats the room very will and it is very convenient.  And thank goodness no assembly required.  When I read it had little wheels, I was certain I would have to put those on at least but I didn't and I was thrilled about that. And as I said, it's not as drying as the forced air heat.  This one actually says moist heat on the box.  I wouldn't go that far but it is much better and I'm thrilled with this unit so far. It looks nice too and blends in with the furniture instead of sticking out like a sore thumb.

And I'm always lacking in minerals from an illness so I want to replenish any way I can which makes products like these invaluable to me.  There's one big caveat  - the scent.  I feel like a broken record in my beauty reviews lately.  If I want to wear perfume, I will.  Please don't put strong fragrances in products like these - maybe a very light scent that's almost imperceptible to others.  There are so many of us who are sensitive to fragrances and we are usually the ones looking for nourishment like this.

"This was a very enjoyable read and I kept wanting to pick it back up every time I had to put it down.  I liked the characters.  They were unique and not the typical HR hero and heroine.  I've read so many of these that it's hard for me to find some that I really enjoy but I did with this one.  The characters had some heavy emotional issues that guide the story.  It's a story that pulls the reader in right away and keeps you until the end.  I thought the heroine's age should have been a little older in the beginning to be a little more believable to be everlasting love.  And the almost immediate acquiescence after being taken felt a little unreal.  I thought there probably would have been a little more resistance with that circumstance. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a good HR novel and need something a little different, this is a great choice.  I absolutely plan to read this series and continue reading this author.

"This is a great modem and it works great with Comcast.  It's fast and setup on your part is very easy.  The hard part is dealing with Comcast.  Had I not dealt with this before with Comcast I may have given up.  But I have changed about 5 modems with Comcast and doing so every single time is like pulling teeth.  When I called the agent said although this said Comcast on it, it really wasn't supported by Comcast.  This is not my first rodeo as I said so I knew to ask for a supervisor because I knew it was.  The rep then hung up on me.  I called back and the same thing happened except this time the agent transferred me to billing instead of a supervisor.  I was transferred back and the exact same thing happened once again.  After over two hours of this, I finally got an agent on the line who was competent enough to ask for help and he got the modem processed.  This is typical of Comcast service - you just expect the worst and hope it's not worse than that. So, my point is, if you have Comcast, sometimes you have to just be persistent.  When they tell you it won't work or call you stupid for thinking that it will (which happened with a previous modem), you just keep telling them it will and keep asking for someone else until you reach someone who knows what they are doing.  I changed another modem a few days ago and the first agent I spoke to was able to do it - granted she had to call me back and it took her three tries, but she worked at it until she got it and I was glad about that.  I guess it's the luck of the draw with the, but it is never fast and easy.  Please understand it has nothing to do with the brand of the modem.

"These bars are delicious.  The chocolate is very creamy and the almonds are unlike any almonds I've had in a chocolate bar before. I will say these arrived slightly melted although in it's own box and 2 others.  It was 96 degrees so that is why, but just be sure of the conditions where you are shipping and make sure not too hot so you don't get any melting because these bars are pretty pricey.  Those 2 things are the reason these don't get 5 stars.  If you love large, round crunchy whole almonds, these are for you.

"Okay, so I tried this in the formula that is not labeled weight management and my very picky dog loved it.  I decided to give this a try and she loved this formula just as much.  I was shocked because she always turns her nose up at anything listed as weight management - well at most foods actually. These are a good sized can so there was plenty for her to eat as well. You can see the rice pieces along with the meat and gravy.  I can't tell any difference in appearance between this formula and the one that's not weight management - they look the same to me. The cans come with a pull top so you don't need the can opener.

"I really liked this conditioner and how soft and healthy my hair felt after I used it.  The problem is the fragrance is too strong for me.  If you don't mind the strong scent, this is a very good conditioner.  It seems as though most shampoo brands have really strengthened the level of fragrance in conditioner and it just makes it more difficult for me because I am sensitive to strong smells.  I will say this came in a bubble wrap envelope and the top had been slightly opened and some of the product leaked out.  They should probably use a box.This one gets 4 stars because the conditioner is good and most people don't have the fragrance issues that I do and that is only thing I really didn't like about the product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EYOIZQRSXSE2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SKEL9XK#wasThisHelpful","R1EYOIZQRSXSE2","AJ9AE2BVND0GS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ9AE2BVND0GS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was pretty nervous about switching over my modem and router which work very well to an all in one unit.  I was afraid I would lose range and it is  always a pain to change modems with Comcast.  This one is very easy to setup and works fine with Comcast.  You just have to plan for about an hour time to get connected - 20-30 minutes of that will be waiting on hold for Comcast and then another 10 giving them information and the rest will be them processing your modem.  When it's a non-Comcast modem, they always seem to have to process it a few times.  This time was no exception - I've done this many times.  Just make sure you give them the model Archer cr700.  They will get it.  It works well and the range is even better than what I had before so I am happy.  I tested the speed and all is fine. After you set up, you may want to go to the tplinkmodem.net site to rename your network and put your own personal password in there.  I always do that.

"I was excited to get to try this because I have been so interested in light healing after reading a medical study about led lights healing as well or better than antibiotics on sores on the skin.  I ended up researching more and learning how great it is for skin, pain relief and hair growth.  I actually bought a light therapy device for my face and my mom and sister ended up buying them too.  When I saw this I though it was a great idea.  Why not for plants too?  I haven't had it long enough to tell if it's as effective as is claimed but I am happy I am trying it.  I will update after I've had longer.  I will say the light itself feels very good quality and like it's made to last.  It's not like your basic flood light that you purchase at the hardware store.

"This 2500 model is a great no frills printer that has full functionality.  It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the higher end printers but it can do it all as far as the printing and scanning goes.  Wireless setup was easy and although installing the ink is a little different, I'm thrilled to have long lasting ink that always runs out at the most inopportune times in which you end up having to purchase it at the most expensive place.  I love the printer and what it can do.  The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is I'm still on the fence about the price.  Yes, you are prepaying for the ink at a good rate and giving yourself the  convenience of very infrequent refills, but it's still a little high.  Nevertheless, if paying that at once is okay with you, in the long run you will probably be very glad you did it.  Thinking long term, it makes sense. Oh and I printed out several pictures and the quality was fantastic so I'm happy with that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15P36X0HKFNT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JHMG#wasThisHelpful","R15P36X0HKFNT4","AJ9AE2BVND0GS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ9AE2BVND0GS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow, this thing is a bit larger than I anticipated! But, overall, a 20000mAh battery is a pretty awesome thing to have as a backup for multiple devices or numerous charges.This is one of the first battery backups that I have had that wrote out the percentage on the battery indicators. Most just have 4 blue LEDs. This has them too, but also states ""25%"", ""50%"", and so on next to them.To charge it up takes a few hours, or more, depending on how discharged it is when you plug it in. Again, it's a 20000mAh battery, so that is to be expected.The device itself feels solid with no rattling or moving parts. I haven't dropped it yet, but the plastic feels like it may crack if dropped on concrete. It's not very 'rubbery' feeling—you know, the type of plastic that feels like it won't shatter on impact.The instructions are basic, in very tiny print, and with many typos/grammatical errors. You can figure it out on your own, or using the instructions. If you have a major difficulty with all electronics, then the instructions may be tough for you to follow. Not sure why they have to be so small when the device is so big—they certainly have a lot of room left in the box.I also noticed that there was no mention of what the lightening bolt icon means on the back of the device. I had to look on the Amazon detail page for this product to figure it out. It shows you what port is for the Quick Charge 2.0 feature that some phones have.Works well with iPhone 6.

The weight of it is actually pretty comfortable, considering it has 3 AAA batteries in there.

"These are a great replacement set of earbuds to those that come with your electronic devices these days.First thing I noticed was that the labels for right (""R"") and left (""L"") were REALLY hard to find—they are on the little rubber mount between the cable and earbud.. Once I learned that the earbuds tend to point forward when held, I no longer needed the labels.Second, you will likely have to split the cable a bit more. When I put these on they barely reached my ears. Just gently separate the wires near where they are sealed together.The sound is really good. I did have to go into my EQ on my phone to boost the bass up a bit (on an iPhone 6). It sounds clear and not tinny or flat. Once I had it on ""bass booster"" or ""rock"" it sounded good.For me, the default ear cups are too big, so I used the smaller ones that were provided and they fit great. Easy to install too. Three sizes included.The cord is plenty long enough to have my phone in my pocket and earbuds in-ear. The jack on the cord is not to wide, so it should fit with most cases on your phone.Not sure what ""Adoric High Performance model"" means in the description on this page. I looked ""Adoric"" up but can't find anything mentioning it. Either a typo or marketing speak.Description also mentions ""Music, video playback and volume control"". Music, sure, it plays that.

"These are amazing! I have the original battery that came with my Hubsan X4, which I believe is a 240 or 380mAh battery. The X4's battery is also half the physical size of these batteries, so I thought I was out of luck. BUT they work!The connector (a ""micro losi connector"") and voltage on this battery is the exact same as the Hubsan X4's battery, so it works perfectly. The only problem is that the battery is too big to fit inside the X4, so I rubber-banded it to the bottom. The battery fits the clearance between bottom of the shell and a flat surface perfectly. With the rubber bands they hit the flat surface and lift the feet up a bit, so some thin double-sided tape should do the trick if you charge in place (and don't crash.)The flight time on this battery was insane! It was double the OEM Hubsan battery! I was guessing that the added battery weight would negate the added mAh of the battery, but I was wrong. I flew for almost 20 mins—LEDs on, in a good breeze, at 60-degree temps, in an obstacle environment. So awesome!While I state that I loaded up my Hubsan X4 with these, I am not sure what the added weight does to the life of the motors. I do know that I was deeply surprised that it only slightly affected the flight controls and lift of the X4. After a few mins of flying it I forgot about any diminished maneuverability/lift. I did, however, notice that decent was a lot faster and found myself full-throttling it more often than usual a quick decent.I received a free sample of this product to evaluate and provide an unbiased and honest review.

"Got this for my 21-month old son, and yes I realize it says ""Not for children under 3 yrs."" due to small parts. He's good about not eating the tiny pieces. He has a Fisher-Price Doodle Pro Trip, Aqua that he uses extensively, and figured this would be a nice change.The moment I took it out of the package I knew this was not going to last long. It feels cheap, looks cheap, and bends really easily (even in toddler hands.) And my son has managed to sort of break it in a few days—the sliding erasure doesn't go all the way across anymore.The pen is on a cheap thin string, and has a metal tip that is about the thickness of a wire coat hanger. I say this because he has managed to dent the surface with this tip, and come very close to poking a hole in it. The tip is needlessly pointy/sharp. And placing the pen back in the tray is difficult even for an adult since you can only do it pointing one way (downward) and it has to be rotated a certain way to fit onto the pegs.Once the two shapes came out of their cups they don't go back in. I've pushed them in and they just fall out. Weird. They do work well on the surface though, and my son enjoys using them more than the pen.The sliding erasure thing is a real pain to slide across, even for an adult. My son can hardly do it, and he has the Doodle Pro mentioned above so he knows how to do it just fine. Now it stops an inch or so from the edge and won't go all the way unless I turn it over and fiddle with it.the screen actually works quite well with easy to see contrasting colors. I was deeply surprised by this given the quality of the rest of the device.Overall its just okay, The Doodle Pro mentioned above is a better deal, and WAY more durable.I received a free sample of this product to evaluate and provide an unbiased and honest review.

"This review is based on a pair of medium gloves worn by a 6"" 5"" male.While the medium size fits just right for finger length, the elastic wrist hits me at the base of my palm. For a 6' 5"" male that normally wears gloves in size large, I would recommend getting a large in these too. For these types of gloves, you do not want them too big or loose.If you have cracked or chapped hands, the inner material is pretty annoying in that it feels like velcro to your hands. It's almost like a microfiber insert. It's certainly warm and breathable, but I found that when take the gloves off/on a lot it gets annoying to have my cracked/chapped hands stick to the inner material.Outer shell is pretty unassuming and not over-designed.

"I got these and had them shipped to the office to share with others. They only lasted about an hour before they were gone!At first I wasn't all that interested in the raw walnuts thinking they would be an odd combo to this mix of roasted, salted and flavorful nuts. But they ended up being a good compliment to the mix.The candied pecans are also a nice touch without being too sweet. And the hickory smoked almonds are not too salty or to smokey, they're just right.The box it came in and the bow around the nuts container make this a great option for gifts (office, business, holiday).

"I wanted to love this keyboard since my Apple keyboard keeps eating up (rechargeable) batteries weekly, and this is a smaller form factor.Problem is that I paired it with my 6-month old MacBook Pro running El Capitan and it was really laggy. I'd type a few keys and look up to see it still typing away slowly. I disconnected it and now whenever I turn on the keyboard I have this dialog box pop up on my screen for a split second and go away. I found out it is the numerical pin you have to type into the keyboard. Problem is it disappears before you can read it so I can't type it on to get it connected again. Tried everything, but the keyboard no longer works with the MacBook.So, I tried to connect it to my iPad running iOS8. It works, and the dialog box on the McBook went away. By the way, when the dialog box was popping up there was no way to disconnect it form the Bluetooth control panel.I thought I would like the smaller form factor, but it is really only good for shot usage when traveling or having to type on an iPad. Great for keyboard replacement on touch screens, just not a better keyboard than what comes with my Macbook and iMac.Also, the keyboard's battery saving policy is aggressive. It keeps turning off (or sleeping) much sooner than I think necessary.

"This is my second solar-powered battery backup, and I think my new favorite.First thing I noticed was that it is about the same size as an iPhone 6 (in a case), just a bit thicker. The rubberize grips on the side help keep it from slipping out of your hand (not that you'll be holding it much.) It looks and feels a lot like some external harddrives.I also noticed that there is fair amount of flex to the device when I go to try and bend it lengthwise. The outer case does not appear to add a lot of support to the device so much as protection.As with many battery backups on the market, this one also has the 4 blue LED indicators to show you how much charge is left (1 for 25%, 2 for 50%, 3 for 75%, and 4 for full.) They are not as bright as others, but can be seen on the sunlight quite easily.When the unit is enough sunlight to start charging itself, a single green LED illuminates. There is also a MicroUSB port to charge the unit using the supplied USB to MicroUSB cable.The instructions are, in one case, ironic:— ""Solar charging only for emergency..."" Hmm, thought this was its main m.o., no?Other solar chargers only charge the unit to 75% capacity under the sun (for some safety reason.) I didn't see that mentioned in the instructions, and I noticed that I got a full charge under the sun with this one!I received a free sample of this product to evaluate and provide an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQGLRMD1ENWHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PSRNTXK#wasThisHelpful","RQGLRMD1ENWHF","A291XTI6NO7DEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A291XTI6NO7DEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The quality of the lenses are somewhere in the mid-range. I noticed the the edges of the viewable area are darker (vignette) and a bit out of focus. The images get a bit darker as well.

I have a thin case, but still need to take it off otherwise the lens doesn't sit properly and the viewable area becomes very small and dark.Great for:— playing around— kids— taking close up (macro) shots of objects.The macro lens works best out of all of them.

"We have had a lot of Bluetooth speakers in the past year, many of them sounded horrible. When I connected this one and played some music my wife was impressed with the sound quality. I have to admit that it is not the best Bluetooth speaker I have heard, BUT for a dual-speaker system it does have decent sound and gets loud enough for outdoor use.When you turn on the flashlight you can look into the side audio port and see one speaker. the other speaker is inside the belt loop area and looks to be oval shaped.Having a battery backup, speaker and flashlight all on a bike/bar mount is pretty cool. This all-in-one unit can make it pretty handy for:— camping— hiking— RVs— biking— kids— garage— strollersThere are 3 mounting options: carabiner, belt/strap, and bike/bar mount (included.) The bike/bar mount is fairly large, and comes with rubber and foam shims to make it work for smaller bars. This fit on the round handle of a Joovy Caboose stroller just fine.The audible prompts are nice. It says ""connected"" and ""low power"" instead of relying on forgettable blinking light patterns.The front of the unit (in orange) has a bit of an under-designed funky kind of vibe going on. Almost doesn't match the rest of the unit.The speaker sounds good when the back rubber panel is closed and fully seated. But, when you open it, the speaker sounds tinny and weird. Seems like the sound design relies on it being closed, and when it is playing you can really feel the bass in the rubber panel.The outer rubber cover can be lifted up around the sound ports on the sides and bottom—it's not glued to the unit.The ports on the bottom allow for a belt/string/strap to go through to hang it by. Doesn't seem to interfere with the sound, so long as the belt or strap isn't too thick an blocks the speaker that is in this area.The flashlight is not super bright, but would work for biking or stroller use at night.The instructions are in SUPER tiny print, and the English version is badly written.

"This light claims 1200 lumens (the brightness of light measurement). So, I compared it to my 970 lumens LED flashlight and found that it was very similar, if not the same. Either it is hard to see the difference of 200 or so lumens, or one of the specified ratings is a bit off.This light also casts a bit of a yellowish color, whereas my other one was brilliant white, almost blue. Again both are using a very similar square LED style bulb.The light end of the flashlight is a LOT bigger (wider) than I expected. It's about the diameter of a U.S. half dollar coin at 1 and 3.4 inches across. The convex lens on it is huge, and sits close to the edge when standing verticlaly on a flat surface. Meaning, the lens is a bit more exposed than other flashlights of this type.I also noticed that my flashlight lens has some scratched and gouges on it. Nothing serious, but they are present. Thought they were dust at first but you can feel the etching of the scratches.Battery is easy to replace, no tools required, and no plastic sleeve needed around the battery.The button works well, and comes with a simple half-press function to change to flashing/strobe, high and low intensities. The unit is all-black, even the button.The charger is super basic and built to charge one battery. Has a somewhat short cord (which is nice that you don't have a ton of cord to coil up or get in the way).I also did not get any packaging or instructions with this flashlight.

"I was pleasantly surprised how soft and comfortable this pillow is. Most neck pillows I have used are stiff and not very moldable. This pillow allows you to pile it up where you want and thin it out where you don't want it.The design of the strap and buckle is really smart too. The way of putting it under your arm and up around your shoulder is genius! It really works well.I found the cover to be softer than any sheet or blanket I have at home. It did not irritate my face and was a real pleasure to lay on.I also found that it makes a great hammock companion. Just wrap it around the top of the hammock and get in.

"I really like the design how the bottom contact slides down to fit different battery lengths, and works as a spring loaded clamp to hold the battery in place. Makes charging different sized batteries simultaneously a lot easier.One of the first things I noticed from using it and reading the instructions was that the unit automatically detects the battery type and best charge for it. I found it detected Ni-MH, Li-ion and Li-FePO automatically. I was a little confused on the selected charge since it didn't match what was stated on the batteries. Battery states 1.2v and the charger showed it was charging at 1.4v. Not sure how that works out.I did notice that compared to my other charger, this one gets a little warm, and so does the batteries. Again, my other wall charger does not.I like chargers that plug directly into the wall. I can see how some people prefer the cord so they are confined to hogging up an outlet. The box plug is nice in that they thought about the other plug and made it sideways so as to not obstruct the other outlet or work in a bar-type multi-outlet extension cord.The instructions are brutal to understand and read. Super tiny print that made me get out a lighted magnifying glass! The way they describe the settings is tough to follow. I have been using the auto detection just fine, but some of you may want to override it. At least the display is easy to read, which is great.I would have liked it more if this had battery conditioning and a better explanation of the settings.Great for those that have a bunch of different sized rechargeable Ni-MH, Li-ion and Li-FePO batteries.I received a free sample of this product to evaluate and provide an unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L7GBGN5J18J6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ULA80M4#wasThisHelpful","R2L7GBGN5J18J6","A291XTI6NO7DEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A291XTI6NO7DEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was surprised by how sturdy this stand actually is. I wouldn't go leaning my whole body weight on it, but it most certainly holds my large laptop well.At first, I doubted the two legs would be able to hold it from folding over side to side. But, we put laptops on it and typed on it and pushed it around and it really held up! It does wiggle side to side if you push it, but when you are typing it barely moves at all.The mouse try is kind of useless for a traditional mouse since it is small and the mouse falls off—the tray is at an angle. We did find that an Apple Wireless Magic Trackpad works well since you don't have to move it.The fans are USB powered. If you only have one USB slot, or no free ones, this can be an issue. In that case, I recommend you use a USB wall charger to power it (you'll just have to find a USB extension or be close to an outlet.Adjusting the legs takes some work. We found ourselves making numerous adjustments until we got it at the right height and in such a way as to not tip forward/backward. It's a balancing act. Also know that you cannot adjust the legs when your laptop is still on the tray.

"Keep in mind this is a ""thin thermal"", and that you can see through it when held up to even low light. Like tiny little mesh holes throughout it. It makes it exceptionally breathable, and a good layer to be used under/over other clothes.Upon inspection we did notice quite a few threads hanging of of the seams. Some attached, some not.Zipper is good. On the black version the zipper is all black, which is nice.Size wise the large felt a touch too small.

"This is a fun little camera for those times when you want to give out 2""x3"" prints right away (well, 10-15 seconds later.)The prints come out very slowly, but are ready to hold and completely processed once they do. No more waiting! Some print stock comes with a peel and stick back to turn them into stickers.Instructions are lacking, big time! The entirety of the instruction manual that come sin the box is a small card with just illustrations on it. NO words. They are meant for those that have some experience with film and Polaroid cameras before. If this is your first real print camera (non-phone camera), then you may be at a loss for a little bit. I HIGHLY recommend you do a search for ""Polaroid snap user manual"", or download the manual from the product detail page for this camera on Amazon, which is far better than what is supplied here.The viewfinder is just a toy, and really just the power button for the camera. It isn't really calibrated to be used accurately. When I did, the shot come out way too close and not what I saw in the viewfinder.The viewfinder is also way too easy to flip open which turns on the camera. You barely bump it and it's open and on.

"I have been using a jojoba oil with vitamin E every day for years now. This oil is a pleasant change to that daily regimen in that it has the same moisturizing qualities, but with a very pleasant almost woodsy scent. And I mean woodsy in that outdoorsy kind of way, not smelling like actual cedar or pine.Also pretty stoked that the fragrance is subtle and not overwhelming. When I use it I notice the smell during application but it tends to go away over time and I am not left with it all day. Again, it's pleasant but subtle.The pour spout on this is just okay. You have to be gentle when pouring—like you are pouring out an insanely spicy hot sauce. Reason is that it tends to go everywhere, and then drip down the side of the bottle. It has one of those plastic caps with a small hole in the middle. Unscrew the metal cap and gently tip it into your hand. Don't shake it! Just give the plastic bottle a tiny squeeze, then roll the plastic cap along your hand to wipe off the excess that likes to drip down the side.

"I like it. This is a great lens for those that have an iPhone 5/6/6+. There is a a clamp option for other phones, but I have to admit that using the large lens on the clamp is not advised: it falls off easily and is really hard to align correctly. The fisheye lens works great with the clamp, though!The quality of the materials is pretty good. Mostly metal, minimal plastic, and the lens appear to be real glass. The view through the lens is crisp and clear. Serious camera fanatics may notice some quality issues in the lenses per se, but most other people won't.I found the idea great, but the execution of swapping out lenses a bit tedious. I really like the fisheye on the clamp setup the best, since it is fast and easy. Having to take my phone out of my case to use the supplied case with the long lens is a bit tedious. If that was the sole purpose of the day, then it's fine. But, if I just want to take one or two shots, it's a bit of work to set up.You have to turn off your camera flash since the supplied case covers up the flash and it just ends up shooting across the case and lens thus making some interesting, albeit useless, images. (See the image I uploaded.)I found the tripod to work ok. My phone did not sit straight (like in the product photos) and kept turning clockwise (downward) from the weigh of it. This meant I had to hold the phone level while taking the picture. The tripod is fairly stable though with a nice wide stance.I received a free sample of this product to evaluate and provide an unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MZ5LR24MFMYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z9JYJU4#wasThisHelpful","R1MZ5LR24MFMYL","A291XTI6NO7DEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A291XTI6NO7DEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 65', 1/8-inch wide, 7 core rope is a highly functional part of our camping kit.

"I like it. It's a tiny robot the size of a quarter and is pretty easy to program and reprogram to do what you want.The contents were surprisingly abundant!— 2 robots with internal rechargeable batteries— 2 USB charging cables— holding tray to protect them— GREAT, well-written instructions with calibration circle— 4 covers that go on the robots, plus 2 carry caes— stickers!— and race trackPlus you get free access to the Blockly website to reprogram your robots (no sign up/in required).I found the act of reprogramming the robots to be educationally challenging in that it takes the user a bit to move the blocks around on the screen in a cohesive order to make the robot do what they want it to do. There are also pre-written programs, should you just want to jump into it.If you have a curious and patient child no younger than 7 or 8, I would highly recommend this. You need to have access to a computer with a USB drive (for charging) in order to program the robots. Without a computer, they simply go off of their preprogrammed functions and work on the race track. So, they work right out of the box (should they still have a charge.)Programming a robot is very easy, and works like a linear Lego chain. Do this first, do this second, and so on.I received this at a discount to evaluate and provide an unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27BL3CM7ZAQ42/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZYUU7UE#wasThisHelpful","R27BL3CM7ZAQ42","A291XTI6NO7DEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A291XTI6NO7DEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for a genuine Hubsan X4, NOT a clone or knockoff. **Be careful some people are getting clone/knockoffs. Request a refund from Amazon if you do NOT get the genuine Hubsan X4.This is my first drone, and I was told by another drone pilot to get a Hubsan because they are the best for beginners to learn on. After flying an X4 for a few weeks, I have to agree: this has been a great teaching tool and helped me feel like I can get a more expensive drone.// TWO MODESI like that the X4 has two modes, one for newbies that helps keep them from flipping it and crashing as easily, and another for experts that gives them free range to do what they want.I did NOT feel like the newbie mode was a bummer to fly at all. If you have never flown one before, this is the mode for you. If you have, then you may feel it to be a bit restrictive because it is keeping you from flipping it. Think of it more like a governor.// REPLACEABLE PARTSMine came with an additional set of propellers, which was good since mine got bested up after a dozen or so crashes. They are simple to replace: just push them onto the motor spindle with your hands, no tools required. I did notice that the ones that came preinstalled fell off more easily in crashes than the second set that I installed. Not sure why, same style crashes hitting the same things.Mine did NOT come with the prop guard. Wish I had one at first, but now feel I did not need it.// INSTRUCTIONSThe instructions are not the best. Took me a couple read-thrus to get it. And even then it was a lot easier to learn how to properly calibrate the drone and controls from another drone pilot or YouTube videos. I highly recommend watching some videos on calibration tips for the X4. So much easier than the instructions that come with it.I HIGHLY recommend this for those new to flying drones. If you have remote controlled vehicle experience, you should be able to pick it up really quickly. Others may take a handful of flights to start to get the hang of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7N132U0KF3UL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZC6C8E#wasThisHelpful","R7N132U0KF3UL","A291XTI6NO7DEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A291XTI6NO7DEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my sixth small form bluetooth speaker, and my third single speaker type. I say that because it is important to note that a single speaker will rarely sound as good as a dual or multi-speaker system.// SOUNDIn the single-speaker category, this sounds pretty good. A bit monaural, but the quality is fairly clean and crisp. The bass is only really noticeable when the speaker is pointed directly at you since it comes out the top, not the bottom or sides.You may want to play with the EQ on your phone/laptop to help improve the sound a bit.// WEIGHTThe weight of it is impressive. When you pick it up you will notice that it has some heft to it— a bit less than the weight of a full cup of coffee/tea. It also feels very solid and dense, not flimsy or cheap at all.The unit alone (no cables) weight 272 grams, or 9.6 oz.// BATTERYThere is some discrepancy in the description on Amazon and the instruction manual. Amazon detail page says ""Unrivalled [sic] 8 to 12-hour playtime"", but the instructions state ""about 6H"". Depending on how loud you play the music, how much bass there is to it, the battery life may vary a lot. I'm not one to let the battery go all the way to empty—and I usually only listen for about 30 min intervals—so I don't know how long it lasts yet.// PACKAGINGI would consider the packaging to be gift quality.

"These are some well-built flashlights! All metal construction that looks like they are CNC machined, not poured (don't quote me on that process though).They are really bright, but I would not say that they are the brightest I have seen. While I would not want this shown into my eyes, I would say they are right up there with some Maglites' I have had in the past. Again, satisfied, but if you are looking for the type of light that stuns and looks like this product, this is not a stun light.The smaller light is not as bright as the bigger light. It is more like the bigger light's medium power. It only takes an AA battery, not the supplied 18650 battery.The larger light takes one 18650 battery (2 are supplied, plus wall charger) or 3 AAA batteries using the converter sleeve.The button works well, and the flash orange color stands out in low light situations. The small light does NOT Have a multi-function button. The large light does have a handful of settings that you can access by turning on the light and half-pressing the button to cycle through them (high, med, low, pulse, and SOS).

"This case is very similar to other battery backup cases in form and function.// FEELThe case itself does not have any sharp edges, and is very smooth in your hand. Large corners and a velvety smooth finish with a subtle amount of grip to it. Just enough to keep it from slipping out of your hands, but not too much that it is a pain to get out of your pocket.// CHARGINGThe case does not come with a cable since you use your Lightening cable to charge the case, and the case charges the iPhone. This is awesome! One less cable to own and manage.Charging the phone (when unplugged) simply takes you pressing the silver button on the back of the unit. Press it and release to turn on and charge phone. Press and hold for a couple seconds to turn off battery backup. If not phone is installed, the battery backup will turn off automatically after about 10 seconds. You can see if it is on by the 4 blue LEDs on the back of the unit.I think it charges the phone at a good rate of speed. Not as fast as another battery case I have, but also not slow either.I feel like the statement in the details from the Seller ""Swap your low battery for a fully charged one to get your phone to a 100% charge immediately"" is not completely accurate. If your phone is dead, you can place it in this case and turn the case on so you can use your phone. The case does not instantly bring your phone to a 100% charge (that's not possible), but it does offer a full charge on standby. So, a dead iPhone and a full case will equal one full charged iPhone.// BUTTONSThe buttons are not awesome. I had trouble using the volume buttons to take pictures since they are hard to get to. Ended up taking the top of the case off to use them with obstruction.Power button is gnarly to press and operate. Has a ribbed feel to it that can get annoying if you are one to turn your phone on/off numerous times throughout the day.I received a free sample of this product to evaluate and provide an unbiased review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19M42LPU0AM0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YEFWK0A#wasThisHelpful","R19M42LPU0AM0S","A291XTI6NO7DEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A291XTI6NO7DEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It took longer to download a cardboard VR game for this than it did to set up. No tools required—just unfold and fold according to instructions, takes about 5 seconds.Works great with the iPhone 6 (not Plus). The space for the phone is made to be a little forgiving, but I recommend you take your phone out of your case (unless it is ultra thin).// TRIGGERThe ""trigger"" is the pad on the top right, and it is made of some conductive material to transfer your finger to be a tap on the screen. You barely need to tap it and it works. At first I was pulling it like a trigger and getting poor performance. When I treated it like a remote screen and only tapped it, it worked better.// LIGHTINGWorks great in all sorts of lighting conditions. But, you must be sitting or standing for it to work. If you are laying down (on your back) it will think you are looking directly upward. So, you do need some room and mobility for most games.// GAMESThis device does NOT come with games. It is meant to work with existing 'cardboard VR' games in the app store (iPhone and Android). Simply do a search for ""cardboard VR app"" or cardboard VR games"" to find some you are interested in.I downloaded VR Flappy and Vanguard VR from the Apple App Store. Both are great intros to the world of cardboard VR games, and playable by kids too.// NO QR CODESome other cardboard VR devices have a QR code that you scan when using a game. This doe snot, so you simply press 'skip' on that step of the apps/games.// CONSTRUCTIONIt's thick, durable cardboard. So, know that it will wear out if not handled properly. It's meant to be a lightweight recyclable device. The cardboard VR device is really a statement saying that you can have virtual reality in the form of something made from paper and use your phone.It's durable, the trigger works well, and they even thought about the tape on the area where your forehead goes so it doesn't get gross.There is a noticeable glue smell when you first open it and place it on your face.

"First thing is: if you are one of those people that HATE those metal edged sunshades for your car that you can never understand how to get folded up correctly, then you are are going to struggle with this even worse. I can get the sunshade things folded up easily, but this thing is something else. I read the instructions printed on the bag, followed it to a T, but could not get it folded to go back in the bag—and YES, you need the bag to hold it together to move store or move around.Second, it would have been nice to have the sandbag corners you see on some other products like this. It's where the corners have pockets that you can fill with sand or rocks or weights to hold it down. This brand gives you these cheap straight metal pegs that are completely useless on the beach. And ""beach"" is in the title of this product!So, once you have it set up on the beach, the wind easily blows it away because there really isn't anything to hold it down.

Guess it coming in two jars really paid off.My wife is not a fan of the 'fudginess' of Nutella. This is thinner than that, and does not have that pasty, fudge-like consistency.

"These lids really are thin and very flexible. They are also VERY sticky, in a way that helps them stay in place. This also means they tend to stick to one another and are not something you can just slide out from one another.We have a large stainless steel bowl that measures 10-inches across and we found it is about an inch too big to work for the largest lid here. I'd say a 9-inch across bowl would work fine. Those small one cup pyrex glass bowls work great for the smallest lid.Getting the lids to stretch around a bowl can sometimes be a bit tricky. The material sticks so well to the bowl that it does NOT slide over it. You have to stretch it out beyond the bowl and bring it down over the side without dragging it across the bowl.

"They work! For those that are worried they won't work from reading other reviews, know that they do work, and are in fact some of the longest lasting temp tattoos my son has ever worn!// PRO TIPYou have to make sure:1) that your child's skin is clean and free from sunscreen BEFORE you apply the tattoo2) you must use a VERY wet washcloth/rag/towel and some good amount of pressure to work well.3) hold the wet cloth on the tattoo for a good 2-3 mins.The above steps have worked for us on over a dozen of these M&D tattoos. When we try and put it on an arm that already has sunscreen on it, they fail. When we only do a short session with the wet cloth, they fail.// SUNSCREEN REMOVES THE TATTOOSWhen you place the tattoos on a sunscreened skin, they will come off. If you apply sunscreen over the tattoo, they will get stick/tacky and start to disintegrate MUCH faster. Sunscreen is a great way to remove the tattoos too!// LAST FOR DAYS!My son has been wearing his latest two tattoos for well over a week, almost 2 weeks! Some last shorter, but that depends on the number of applications of sunscreen (have I hammered this home enough?) and baths he takes.// DESIGNSThe designs are cheesy, okay, and awesome. Seems kind of like 2-3 designers worked on it, or someone modified them after delivery, because some are really fun and cool while others are really cheesy—even for kids. My son couldn't care less, he just likes having them on his arms so he can point to them and exclaim ""tay-toooz!""","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SHJ51PFBW0GB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0079EMAQC#wasThisHelpful","R1SHJ51PFBW0GB","A291XTI6NO7DEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A291XTI6NO7DEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've tried a bunch of bluetooth speakers that were this size, and NONE of them sound this good, and are as easy to pair with my phone.// SOUND & BASSThe bass ports out the bottom, and at first I thought that it would just get muffled from sitting on the counter/desk. But it doesn't! I put on some really heavy rock and—again, seriously: for the size and price—this thing pretty amazing! The sound isn't all lopsided or tinny, it's fairly balanced and actually sounds pretty good.// CONTROLSThere is an on/off switch on the back, and four buttons along the top. Like most bluetooth speakers do, they have some buttons doing double-duty. The volume up/down is also the track next/prev. You have to press and hold for the volume to work.

"This is my second brand of coconut sugar, and my favorite so far. The texture and taste is great—can be eaten straight from the bag. Not as syrupy sweet as sugar, but similar level of sweetness (if that makes sense). Packs similar to brown sugar, though a bit more crumbly.Great for use in baking (use 1:1 to sugar), and especially in coffee. Can also be sprinkled on top of cupcakes, cookies, cakes for a nice flavor that is not too sweet. UPDATE: We just made a pumpkin pie with it (again, using a 1:1 ratio when substituting the regular sugar) and it turned out great!The bag is kind of useless. It is a lined paper bag, and the contents are 4lbs, so the bottom doesn't really hold up well. What I mean is the design of the bag has this sort of base to hold it upright, but after a couple uses the paper base just crumbles under the weight and the bag doesn't really stand up straight anymore.

"Takes a minute to get used to drinking out of this spout design. There is no air hole, so you can't suck on it like other bottles, you have to leave a bit of room for the air to go while drinking. Technically, you pour it into your mouth.It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out how to disassemble the bottle, BUT the instructions to do so are on the inside of the paper sleeve that is inside the bottle. Would at least recommend putting the first line of the instructions on the outside to read so some people can easily disassemble it without guessing if you unscrew the bottom or top or just pull it off.I like the lid lock feature. Great for keeping my toddler out of it.Note that the lid screws onto the outer plastic shell, not the glass bottle. So, you can remove the glass bottle and use the plastic shell as a snack container (very small snacks since the spout is very small) for kids. Cheerios work, and the small spout slows 'em down a bit.Only holds 16oz of water, so it does not last me very long and find that I have refill it often.

"I was really surprised that the two smaller ones fit great in our toaster oven.

They recommend you place it on your fridge, but it doesn't stick very well. In a day it started to curl and come off.

"After 8 tries and back and forth with support, I finally got it to work. Once. Then no more.First, the instructions that come in the box are virtually useless, riddled with typos and missing a LOT of pertinent and critical information to being able to get this device working. The company sent a PDF of some ""updated"" instructions that look very similar. While they have fewer typos, they are even more useless since they have connectivity information for an entirely different device that doesn't work on this one.Second, there is no explanation of what the button and indicators do on the device, or how use and read them. Sometimes the lights are on, but mostly they are not. When it did finally connect (once!) the lights were all on. Never got it to do that again.Troubleshooting is minimal and did not help me connect.The instructions state that you use 192.168.10.1 in your address bar of your browser to log into the admin panel for the device. This is normal for most routers, but they failed to mention what the username and password was. Had to email them to find out. Now I know it is admin / admin. They even referred me to another reviewer's post to get this information! One would think that they would print this in the instructions.The instructions state that the key in ""on the product box"", but it is not. There are plenty of other numbers to confuse you into thinking it is, though. The key is 12345678, again, had to email them to find out.Here's the kicker: when I unplug the repeater to move it to another location, it is never able to reconnect. I tried everything, but the repeater simply will not show up in my available networks. To make things worse, once I set up my wifi SSD and password in the device's admin panel, I cannot use 192.168.10.1 to access it anymore, it simply says ""gateway timeout"". So, the only way to access it is to reset the device by holding down the reset button on the side and start all over from scratch.I REALLY wanted this thing to work.

"I was super excited to get the bike for the weekend, but also expecting to spend an hour or more putting it together. I was wrong! It only took about 20-30 mins to put it all together enough for my son to ride it. Another 5-15 mins spent getting the brakes tuned (one side dragged, at first), the reflector on and the seat adjusted just right.// ASSEMBLYThe vast majority of the bike comes pre-assembled. Out of the box it is all protected with foam wrapping and looks a bit daunting. Once you get the strings untied and the wrapping off, you find that you simply just need to put the front wheel on and the handle bars in the frame. Everything else is already preassembled (though may need some tightening.)Keep in mind that you may need to adjust the brakes—ours were off-center and a bit loose.// TOOLSWhile an open-ended wrench and two Allen wrenches come with the bike, you DO NEED a Philip's head screw driver to install the reflector, and tighten the bell and brake handle.// TIRESThe tires are not fully inflated, but I found them to road-ready anyway. They are supporting my 30-pound son just fine, but plan on inflating them soon.// SEAT HEIGHTOur son is 34"" tall (unsure on the inseam at the moment, though he does wear 2T/3T pants), and we have the seat all the way down with the seat front pointing down a bit. He fits it just right. An inch higher on the seat and he might not be able to touch the ground all that well.The bike comes with a second longer seat post, which is awesome! He will be able to ride this bike for years to come.// WEIGHTI was surprised to find the bike feels solid, yet not that heavy. I wouldn't want to carry it up a mountain for 3 hours, but if I had to walk a couple miles with it I would be ok. We are looking to make some carry straps or get the PUKY one.// CONSTRUCTIONThis bike feels very solid. Once everything was tightened up and the way we wanted it, it feels solid and doesn't make a sound when moved or placed (dropped) on the ground. Some bikes rattle or sound janky, this one DOES NOT. Really impressed with the build on this bike. I'm confident that it would even support a fully grown adult (try at your own risk).I HIGHLY recommend this balance bike for anyone with children that are 34"" or taller (or wearing at least 3T pants).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OJRJT0YLV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P49UK7K#wasThisHelpful","R2OJRJT0YLV9","A291XTI6NO7DEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A291XTI6NO7DEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great organizer to help keep the items I need most often—especially the small ones—out of the bottom of the stroller.The insulated drink pockets are large! I assumed they would be can size. They're larger and able to fit most sippy cups, adult water bottles and even a 40 oz beer.Pockets are well-thought out and easy to access when the bag is in place. The only problem was that with our UPPAbaby Vista stroller the bag sits pretty low and close to the basket. It's ok since it keep the center of gravity closer to the middle and not tipping the stroller backward, but also not really that easy to access while walking. We don't hold heavy items in it, and wanted something more accessible while walking and not have to stop. We wrapped the straps around the handle bar and that seems to keep it up higher and easily accessible while walking.Zippers and velcro all seem to work well, too.

"Keep in mind that this requires some assembly. No tools needed, just press in the legs to the bottom.// LEG BROKEAnd that's where the trouble happened. One of the clips on a leg snapped off. Believe me when I say that we didn't abuse or force it, it just snapped trying to put on the leg. Now the leg sort of wobbles and comes out fairly easily. It's still useable, but I had to tape it in place from the inside.// THE LIDThe lid to the potty is kind of useless, to me. First, my son likes to step/stand on it, and the lid always caves into the potty or flips over. He sees it as something to stand on, but it is far from able to support a toddler standing on it. So, I just removed it. It's not like I am going to store any waste in there for an extended period of time.// SIZEIt's a nice size.

You know, make it fun.// CONSTRUCTIONThe construction is okay. I would recommend being careful with them. It's simply rolled/stamped metal that is crimped together with a seam. During washing I noticed the largest one's seam is not 100% secure and will likely be the first to come apart. I recommend you do NOT keep these in a drawer with other larger, heavier objects— they could be smashed, and again, the seam may not take the force. Keep them in a small plastic container to themselves.// CUTTINGThe metal itself is not very sharp, which is a good thing for those of us that handwash. But, it still cut the veggies and potatoes quite easily. If you are using the red cover to push the tool down, you will need to push out the veggies every 3 or 4 cuts since the cut shapes stay inside the metal tool. If you don't use the red caps, the cut shapes can come out the top and you can just keep on stamping.// WASHINGHandwashing these is tedious. If you have a dishwasher, I recommend putting these in a basket and not just over the pegs, for they could come off and end up in the bottom.I received a free sample of this product to evaluate and provide an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XG2HS698EWZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UD7QJO#wasThisHelpful","R2XG2HS698EWZ3","A291XTI6NO7DEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A291XTI6NO7DEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a bit smaller than I expected, but the light is more than bright enough to make up for its size.// BATTERIESThis requires 3 AAA batteries. Problem is that when I went to insert the batteries the battery compartment opening was very tight and I had ram the batteries into the compartment. Once in, they worked fine, but getting them out means I have to bang the light against my hand—they don't just slide out.// NO ON/OFF SWITCHI know that the unit is motion activated, but it would be nice to be able to turn it off as an override for times when I may not want it on. To turn it off, you have to open the battery compartment door on the side, which is fairly easy to do, but not as easy a s switch.// GOES OFF IN 5 SECONDSInstructions said it goes off in about 15 seconds, but I found mine goes off in about 5 seconds, which is nice for me.// ADHESIVE MAGNETIC STRIPI was looking forward to mounting this using the magnetic strip. In my situation, all the surfaces that could mount it too (drywall, door, shelf) are too rough for the adhesive to stick to. So, I used a Velcro tape to loop around it and mount it to a handle in the closet and it works well.// GREAT FORThis is great for:— closets— RVs— car glovebox— kids toybox— bathroom nightlight (though it is bright!)— office desk drawerI received a free sample of this product to evaluate and provide an unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P2T6SLNDL00Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MH1V8GK#wasThisHelpful","R2P2T6SLNDL00Y","A291XTI6NO7DEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A291XTI6NO7DEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First thing I noticed was that the coffee grinder I pulled out of the box is a reddish-pink, not black. See picture. There is also a Jumbl logo printed on the 2 jars. I don't really care about the color so much since it doesn't affect the way it performs, but mention it because I didn't see anywhere on the detail page where I could choose a different color, and the box doesn't mention any other color options either. May have been a mixup at the factory?// SETUPPutting the coffee grinder together is easy, and only takes about a minute. The instructions included showing you how to put the handle on and explain how to adjust the grind are very well written and illustrated.// THE GRINDYes, this is a manual grinder. It takes a minute or three to grind the coffee. The point is that the grind is much better, more even than an electric grinder. And, it allows you to take it camping, on picnics, hikes, and elsewhere that you can make hot water but not have electricity.How hard it is to turn the handle depends on the beans. Some brands' beans are very hard to grind while others are like butter. Try a couple different roaster before you give up.// COMPARE TO OTHER MAJOR BRANDI also have a very similar coffee grinder made by a major Japanese brand. It's designed and works very similarly. In the other one I notice that the handle screw comes loose very easily. I've had two of them and this happened on both. With the Jumbl one, the screw stays tight and I don't have to retighten it multiple times during grinding. Nice!With Jumbl you also get an extra storage jar and brush, and the jars are thick and durable. This is not something you usually get with other brands.// CLEANINGThe included brush makes it easy to clean the burr grinder, which really only ever needs to be brushed off. The jar jars can be hand-washed or put in the dishwasher. As for other parts, I would recommend hand washing as needed (but not the actual burr grinder.)// CapacityThe top cup will hold about a cup of beans, max. I recommend you not put more than a half cup in at a time since they can spill over the edge while grinding—the unit can move around as you turn the handle. This is normal for a hand grinder.I received a free sample of this product to evaluate and provide an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BC7H5NADHFO9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPAPZC4#wasThisHelpful","R2BC7H5NADHFO9","A291XTI6NO7DEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A291XTI6NO7DEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the solid copper version, but think it applies to all of themFirst, if you are looking to take this off/on every day, I would advise against it. It requires you to bend the bracelet to get it on/off, and after a while that may wear it down to the point of breaking.It is soft and pliable, so getting it to fit right doesn't take long. After it warms up to your body it is a little more pliable.In my case, I found it limits the motion of my hand at the wrist. When I put my hand to the floor while playing with my son, I find myself constantly having to move it up my wrist first or else it sits right between my hand and wrist and is uncomfortable. It's very comfortable during normal wear, but when moving my hand to pick up boxes or let's say do a push-up, it's uncomfortable.The magnets are surprisingly powerful for their size. And I found the quality of the metal and finish to be nicer than expected. It's solid and doesn't feel cheap at all.

"I did read the description, and nowhere does it overtly say that a microSD card is NOT included. I didn't realize this until I received it and had to buy one. Two suggestions for Polaroid, either:— include a basic microSD card with the unit, OR— be upfront with the fact that it will not work unless you have a microSD card// VIDEO QUALITYThe 1080p picture quality is great for such a small camera. You won't be making any feature films with this, but it is more than good enough for video for the web. In virtually all cases, when you post to Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and other platforms, they compress/degrade the quality anyway. This shoots well above what they compress down to.The size of the 1080p video is 1920 x 1080px, and the 720p is 1280 x 720px. The quality of the 720p is okay to good. In lower light situations you can really start to see the pixelation. Again, it is definitely good enough for posting to facebook and other web platforms.// AUDIO QUALITYAudio is recorded through the tiny hole/port on the front under the lens. The quality is barely okay for quiet situations, and does pick up louder conversations quite easily. I would say the range of the mic depends on the volume of the noise, but is not really all that far. After about 10 feet it degrades noticeably.The enclosure seems to be really quiet. I tossed the Cube up in the air and caught it a few times, and it didn't pick up the noise of it hitting my hand hardly at all. Where my hand came close to the mic I got some scuffling noise, but that was about it.// ENCLOSUREDetails say it is weather/water resistant, but I have to say that after reading some reviews I don't trust that claim at all. I highly recommend a waterproof case for it if you are going to be in the rain.// CAPABILITIES & LIMITATIONS— You cannot record while the USB cord is plugged into a computer or charging the Cube. All you can do is turn it off/on.— On Macs, plugging it in and turning it on will automatically open the Photos app (when using Yosemtite OSX). You can use that app or the Image Capture app on earlier OSX's to download the videos.— You can copy and delete the videos on the microSD using the two apps listed above (on Macs).— There is no live streaming— No wifi connectivity— No bluetooth connectivity— There is no way to start/stop recording without the beeps. These do not get recorded on the video.— You have to way for the three green light beeps to end before you can start recording. This means form off state to recording tales about 5 seconds. From on state to recording takes about 2-3 seconds.— there is no menu. It's a simple on/off and record/stop type device.— things about 4-5 inches away from the lens start to get pretty blurry. About a foot away is best for close shots.— It takes a surprisingly wide shot. Seems like it is wider than my iPhone 6 camera, for comparison.// MAGNET MOUNTThe magnet dimple mount is fairly strong. I'm not totally sold on that it can stay in place on some handle bars of a mountain bike. I'd recommend a better aftermarket mount that wraps around it and clamps it securely in place.It doesn't stick to flat/straight metal surfaces as well as it does to one that fills the dimple. So, it doesn't stick to metal bike handle bars as well as the corner of a metal toolbox. Make sense?// RECORDINGAs stated in the beginning of this review, you MUST supply your own microSD card. I bought a Samsung 32GB EVO Class 10 Micro SDHC on Amazon and it works very well, no problems. I feel Polaroid should at least supply a basic small capacity microSD with the unit.

"// CRYSTAL CLEARThe magnification is very clear and sharp. Everything from edge to edge is in super sharp detail. NO fading or warping of the magnification near the edges of the lens.// LIGHTThe light is very bright and helpful. Great for bright rooms as well as dark situations. If you are thinking of using this to read, know that the light is a wee bit bright for lengthy use. It's a great brightness for inspecting something for 5-10 mins, but after that it tends to wear on your eyes, especially for hours of reading on bright-white pages.// BATTERYThe battery compartment is easy to access without tools, and appears to be a standard sized flat button battery. The LED lights should help it last a long time. Also, be sure to use the on/off switch to help keep the light from turning on accidentally.// OPERATIONIt's a simple push down on the lens ring to turn it on/off. You don't have to touch the lens at all, but it sounds like other reviewers have trouble with that. I feel there is plenty of metal ring around the lens to prevent you form having to touch the lens to turn it on/off.As I said above, be sure to use the on/off switch to help keep the light from turning on accidentally during storage/travel.// CONSTRUCTIONI was deeply impressed by the all-metal body of the magnifying glass. And the glass seems to be real glass! Nice. I also really like the grooves that go around the bezel and body. Another nice touch that make using it feel nice in your hand/fingers.

"This is my fourth brand of fish oil soft gels that I have tried. This also the first brand to use the ""Enteric coating"" claiming they reduce the 'fish burbs'. I haven't had a problem with that using other soft gels, but figured I would give these a try. And they're great!The soft gels look like they have been sandblasted: they have a smooth textured surface, not the smooth almost clear surface other brands have. I think this is the ""Enteric coating"", but seems to also keep them form sticking together in the bottle.Opening the container you do NOT smell any fishiness. To the most sensitive nose you may smell something similar to the flakes used for fish food, but it's subtle.

"One thing I quickly noticed was that a common sized potato does not fit. The opening for the blade area is about a half-inch to 1-inch smaller than the potatoes I bought, so I had to cut them into quarters and still each fourth into the slicer individually. I don't feel the potatoes were especially large at all. I think the blade area could be designed an inch larger across.// CLEANINGThe blades and entire unit can go in the dishwasher. I recommend you place all pieces on the top rack of your dishwasher. Hand washing can pose a challenge since you will need a bristle brush to get in between the blades.The top white slotted piece that goes inside the green Darth Vader-looking cap has a button sticking out of the top of it. This can fill with water during washing and is best if you pry it off and let air dry.// LONG VEGGIES AND POTATOESThe cup under the blades doesn't hold much, and any long veggies/potatoes can hit the bottom and stop it up.

I found this to be the most irritating part of the stand. When you go to pick the phone up while it is plugged in the stand comes up with it since the cord doesn't slide right through.

"I have been wanting to try out an LED filament type bulb for a while now. I love the style the filaments and fact that they burn much cooler than CFLs and especially incandescents.Know that there are large numbers stamped on the bottom of the bulb, about 1/4-inch tall in black ink. Looks to be a 5-digit part number of something (see photo.) Thing is, this is not shown in the images by the manufacturer. If you are using these bulbs in a bare-bulb situation, you may see the lettering (depending on where it ends up when screwed in.)The light it emits is very nice.

"This review is for the ""Car"" version. Took me about an hour and a half to put together, and I'm mechanically inclined. The main reason it took so long is that the instructions to build the car you see on the box is printed on the back of the box, kind of blurry, and with VERY tiny print. Some of the pieces are similar shape, size and color, but on the instructions it is near impossible to tell them apart. I got stuck on step 6 for the bulk of the time because of this.In the end, I'm not feeling like what I built is the same as what is on the box. Close, but something isn't right. I went over it a bunch of times and can't see where I went wrong.I think this toy would be good for some older kids.

"These are plastic. For those of you that did not read past the ""Wine Glasses"" part, know that these are made of resilient plastic, not glass.I have a set of real wine glasses made of glass, and I would not want to take them camping, picnicking or traveling, basically they don't leave the house. So, these are great for that, and much better than drinking wine from a red plastic cup.From a distance of about a couple feet almost no one can tell they are plastic. The seams are well hidden and only really visible on the bottom. SO, while holding it, no one will know, but while drinking they can see the seam, if that matters.// NO PLASTIC SMELL!When I first opened the box I figured they would smell like new plastic cups. BUT they didn't! There is literally no smell of plastic to these cups to interfere with your wine.// TASTEI found they do NOT interfere with the taste of the wine.// THUMB NOTCHI like the thumb notch. It's perfectly formed and placed, and makes drinking out of the glass just that much more pleasant. I dent all soda/beer cans this way, so it's a welcomed design for me.// CHEERS! WELL, NO.So, where these wine glasses fall short is in clinking them together during a toast. They sound much the same as a couple red plastic cups banging together. No big deal for me since I'm more interested in drinking wine from them that clinking them together.// WASHINGI would be very careful to NOT wash them with an abrasive pad/brush, for they will scratch. They are dishwasher safe, but very lightweight so be sure they are locked in place otherwise they can flip over during the rinse-wash cycle.

"This grinder is solid, and HUGE. It can hold a lot of herbs. The all metal construction means it will last a long time and stand up to some abuse.My problem with it is that the lid you use to grind with seems to have just enough slop that when you turn it the teeth hit each other. Not enough to stop the turn, but enough to be annoying. I'm not a big fan of metal on metal grinding. This may just be happening in mine, not sure since I don't have another to compare.The herbs that do get ground up come up a medium to large chop size. Piece from tiny almost-dust-like, to pinkie nail size. Depending on what you are grinding up, it may not come out totally consistent. If you need a consistent sized grind, this may not do it for you.The little plastic tool that comes with it to get herb out of the grinder teeth is too small for me. I prefer (and recommend) a clean, stiff boar's hair brush. That works great.Notable grinds:— peppercorns... did not work out at all.

Namely, the masts are fragile. If bent it can still work, just not hold up the sails as well. Maybe age 5 or 6 on up would be best.// TOOLS NEEDEDNo tools needed, but I do recommend some scissors or a small flat screwdriver to push out the small plugs/bits of foam core. Some people could use their fingernails. No glue or tape needed.//CONSTRUCTIONThe ship is made out of two sided foam core about 1/8 inch thick.

"I think these might be the best sounding earbuds I have ever used. And I have tried a lot of them over the past 10 years. Maybe 40-50 different sets from OEM to aftermarket.// SOUNDI am deeply surprised by the sound quality of these. While there is no comparison to over-the-ear large format earphones, these do an amazing job for such a tiny speaker. Good bass, which better mids and highs—overall a good balance when used with an EQ.Using this with an iPhone I went to Settings > Music > EQ and tried out some different options to get the right sound. ""EQ off"" on iPhone is miserable, but the settings ""Bass Booster"", ""Hip Hop"" and ""Rock"" work especially well with these ear buds.// CORDI also really like the faux braided cord. It isn't that rubbery feel so many cords (like Apple) are using now that make tangles more common. This feels braided yet smooth and seems to keep the cords tangle free (so far.)The jack housing is metallic and is long enough that when using it on my phone with a case I still have a good amount sticking out to pull the jack out without having to use the cord to pull on.// MIC + BUTTONThe mic and button in the middle of the cord are missing the clip I like to use to keep the weight of the cord from pulling down on the ear buds.It has one button which ONLY answers/ends calls, plays/pauses music, and activates Siri when you hold it down (iPhone). It does not control the volume or tracks.// FITI found the ear buds to stay in place and not fall out so easily like other brands. I still can't run with ear buds, because (for me) no matter the brand they always work themselves out of my ear. Like almost every other ear bud manufacturer, they come with 3 different sizes of ear cups to get the right fit.// WARRANTYA 1-year no-questions-asked warranty is really exceptional for ear buds.I received this product at a deep discount to evaluate and provide an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39DOG6KYXGWZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZJ7CFW0#wasThisHelpful","R39DOG6KYXGWZK","A291XTI6NO7DEG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A291XTI6NO7DEG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's the size of a large egg, and weights about half as much as one (that's with the batteries in.)I've used an oximeter of this type before, and I found the area for the finger on this model to be a bit smaller than another I used. It still allowed an adult male finger of average size to fit nicely and take a reading, I just noticed that when fully open it is a bit smaller than others. If you have very large/wide fingers, this may not be for you.// DISPLAYThe display is easy to read, and allows you to change the direction of the readout to suit your needs. While the numbers are large, the labels for what those numbers are is very small. Once you know what number is what, the labels don't matter, but they are very small and may require many people to break out their glasses.The display is bright and has some custom settings that allow you to set the alarm to go off/on at certain SpO2 and heart rate levels, as well as turn on/off the beeps.// BATTERIESThe unit takes two AA batteries. the compartment for the batteries is fairly easy to get open, and does NOT require a screwdriver or other tool to open.

"For anyone who is thinking of buying this for the Melt Method exercise program, here is some general info I have found on this roller (I have ordered it tonight from Amazon and am waiting to receive it in the mail) --Recently I bought the Melt Method book from Amazon.  I had assumed that I could try out some of the moves without having any equipment at the beginning, but after I received the book, I soon discovered that every single exercise in the book requires either a foam roller or a small rubber ball.Additionally, there are specific requirements for the equipment - the roller must be of a full length and particularly soft, and the ball must be relatively small and also particularly soft.The creator of the Melt Method technique offers her own range of equipment for sale on her website.  She designed it specifically for use with the Melt Method.-- Her roller is blue, full-length, quite soft, and apparently 5 inches in diameter (therefore, it is smaller than this OPTP roller, which is apparently 6 inches in diameter).  [When I last checked her site, it appeared to cost about sixty, with perhaps fifteen extra for shipping.]-- She sells a set of 3 balls in varying hardnesses and sizes.  The small+soft one is apparently the main one for beginners to use with her program, while the other two balls are for more advanced use.  [I do not remember how much this set was the last time I looked at her site, but it includes instruction cards and 1 or 2 DVDs, so it's probably thirty or over.]Because I am not even sure if the Melt Method will be of help to me, I'd rather not spend a lot of money up front before even trying it out, but since having a roller and one ball is absolutely necessary to experience the program, I have returned to Amazon tonight to buy cheaper versions of both items that are as close to the ""official"" items as possible (but not as expensive as they are).-----------------------Roller:I have read many comments on Amazon that say the ""OPTP Pro-roller Soft Pink Marble"" was the original roller that was used in the Melt Method, before the developer of the Melt Method created her own equipment a couple of years ago.The official Melt roller has a smaller diameter (5 inches vs. 6 inches) and might be a little bit softer than this pink OPTP Pro-roller Soft.However, most commenters who mention the Melt Method seem to say that the pink OPTP Pro-roller Soft is just fine for doing the Melt exercises.Therefore, I decided to order this one, which is about half the price of the official one (considering Amazon's free shipping).Note -- There are lots of comments on Amazon about how the official roller as sold by the Melt website was backordered in the last year or two and was taking maybe 6 or 8 weeks to arrive, but I haven't seen any recent complaints (submitted in the last few months) that say it is backordered, so its availability from the Melt site is probably immediate these days, and that was not a factor in my decision.Note -- There is a blue roller for sale in a different listing on Amazon that calls itself a ""Melt roller"", and the product listing shows a picture of the official Melt roller, but several customers have commented on that listing to say that they bought it and were unhappy to find that it was not the official one, so I would be wary of that listing, because it does not seem that the Melt Method company sells their products anywhere but their own website and through their official trainers who teach Melt classes.Note -- There are two colors of OPTP rollers on this item's Amazon listing, pink and blue. Some commenters here say that there is a difference between these two, that the pink is softer than the blue and therefore is more suitable for doing the Melt exercises with. If you'd ordinarily prefer the blue color and would rather not have a pink one, you could check out the OPTP website to see if they describe any difference in firmness between these two colors.-----------------------Ball:  After looking at a number of balls here on Amazon, I decided to try the yellow (softest) ball on the following listing:  ""Isokinetics Inc. Hand Exercise Squeeze Ball - Round - 5 Resistance Levels - Sold Separately"" which is about seven with free shipping.Many people said they went to a dollar store, pet store, sporting goods store, toy store, etc. to find a little, soft ball for the Melt Method, but this one is specifically designed for hand exercises and gets pretty good reviews, so I thought I'd give it a whirl.-----------------------After I receive these and try out the program, I'll update my review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA8K892LVFVZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002C9MSAC#wasThisHelpful","RA8K892LVFVZ9","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review as of September 2014:I purchased 2 of these Intex Recreation Mid-Rise Airbeds from Amazon in May 2014.I had never bought an air mattress before, but the few times I've slept on air mattresses (ages ago) were not comfortable experiences, so I knew the product qualities I wanted to avoid!The first order:The first one of these I got for an elderly relative, who had asked me to find an economical way to ""fill up"" the gigantic space that was left in his king-size waterbed frame (which sits in his never-used second bedroom) after the original 1970s water mattress that came with the frame developed a leak and needed to be discarded. He refused to get rid of the waterbed frame and get a conventional bed frame, and he didn't want to leave the waterbed frame empty because he wanted to have a useable bed in that second bedroom, for guests. After looking up many different options, I decided that the cheapest and easiest way forward would be to buy an air mattress of the right dimensions that would fit inside the waterbed frame.It was actually not easy to find an air mattress of suitable dimensions for the high sides of the waterbed frame, because most air mattresses are several inches shorter or many inches taller than this one. This particular mattress, which I got in a queen size, is a perfect height for the waterbed frame - 13 inches tall. The length of 80 inches is just fine for the waterbed frame. Unfortunately, the width of 60 inches is about 15 inches too narrow, but I arranged the space gap to be next to the bedroom wall, filled it with rolled-up spare blankets, and after the mattress is made up with mattress pad, sheets, bedspread, pillows, etc. on top, you can't see the gap. This specific mattress is not meant to be regularly slept on, it's just there to be used once in a blue moon by the random guest. My relative was very pleased that we could find a solution as nice as this air mattress is, but for only about fifty dollars.The characteristics I was looking for in an air mattress to fit the above scenario were:- The waterbed frame dimensions which I needed to accommodate- Good quality- Sturdy construction- Comfortable support for sleeping on- Electric, built-in pump- No built-in ""pillow"" (I find those very uncomfortable to sleep on - too low to entirely stand in for a pillow, but too high to use a real pillow on top of)- No raised ridges along the edges- Reasonable price- Many good customer reviews, or at least not many bad reviewsIt took quite a lot of shopping around the internet to finally stumble upon across this model, which seems to fulfill all of the requirements except the last one -- at the time I bought my relative's air mattress, I could find no reviews at all on this mattress. (Since then, one has been posted here on Amazon.)However, I read hundreds of reviews on other Intex air mattress models, and studied closely the Amazon reviewers' photos that showed the typical defects of each model type (each air mattress model seems to have its own special way of going a little haywire!) One reviewer said that the Intex models which are over 13 inches tall (and thus taller than this Intex Recreation Mid-Rise model) probably have more problems with internal bursting and such, which makes sense.This mid-rise version seems to be a great combination of a ""luxury"" construction (at least considering the product category as a whole, it's sort of on the ""luxury"" end!); a top-of-the-range built-in electric air pump; a sleek, no-nonsense, completely-flat sleeping surface; and a reasonable price (competing brands seem to retail for hundreds of dollars).The big downside of these air mattresses is, of course, that they seem to come with absolutely no warranty from the manufacturer, Intex. I have found conflicting information about the warranty situation -- I've seen in many places on the internet where there is no warranty at all, but in the question-and-answer section of a different Intex air mattress listing on Amazon, a representative of Intex answered a question about the warranty by saying that there was some kind of limited warranty of a few months (I have lost the link to that, but it's probably still up somewhere on this website) and that customers should just contact Intex if there is a problem. Maybe the warranty varies amongst their products, I don't know. I don't see any information on the ""owner's manual"" or retail box of this air mattress about a warranty, so I assume there isn't one. (The only protection the buyer has is Amazon's own 30-day guarantee, so it's prudent to set this mattress up right away, leave it inflated for a few days to see if it loses any air, maybe even sleep on it yourself for a few nights during those first 30 days -- even if you are buying this only to use when you have guests over to stay, or to take on vacation later in the year.)My relative's air mattress has been slept on a couple of times in the last 4 months by guests, and has reportedly been comfortable. It loses only a little air as the days go by. It has retained its shape. Its length x width dimensions are still true to the standard queen-size mattress dimensions, and queen-size fitted sheets fit on it well.The second order:It is time to replace my bed frame and mattress that I've had for a number of years, and while I'm figuring out what to get, I decided (after setting up my relative's air mattress) that it would probably be more comfortable to sleep on an air mattress of this caliber for a while, rather than to sleep on my old mattress, which had begun to hurt my back.For size versatility in later uses of the air mattress (for guests, on trips, etc.), I wanted to get a full/double rather than a queen, but when I came back to this Amazon listing, the full size was no longer listed (sometimes it's available on this page, sometimes it's not), and the twin was on backorder, so I had to go with a queen.Some other Intex air mattress customers have recommended first to blow up a new air mattress to about 90% capacity to give the wrinkles in the vinyl time to stretch out, and leave it like that for 24 hours before topping the air off to the desired firmness for sleeping on. That is what I did when my mattress first arrived.I am really sensitive to ""chemical"" odors, and I was concerned that such a large expanse of new vinyl would give off a pretty overwhelming scent for days, if not weeks. When I first took the mattress out of its packaging and blew it up, I was surprised (and happy) that there didn't seem to be much of a smell coming from it, but after I had it pumped up for a full day without any bedding on it (to ease out the wrinkles), I found that it emitted a medium-strong plasticky odor, similar to a new vinyl shower curtain. After a couple of days, the odor died down and I can't notice it at all now.I did not measure the dimensions of my new air mattress precisely after I first inflated it to the pressure that was comfortable for me to sleep on, but I had bought a new queen mattress pad for it which fit the mattress fine when I first put it on (although it was quite a tight fit).My air mattress seems to lose air more quickly than my relative's air mattress, but of course mine is slept on nightly, and his is not. I have to top the air up for about 30 seconds, once every 3 to 7 days.I have always been careful not to inflate this air mattress too much. Unfortunately, despite my measured, gentle treatment of it, it began to develop bulges after a couple of months -- bulges along the sides, all the way around. It's a good thing these bulges didn't pop out on the top surface (where some other Intex air mattress models tend to develop bulges), because that would make it hard to sleep on, so I'm lucky in that way. The problem is that the side bulges have enlarged the size of the air mattress so much that it is now a number of inches longer and wider than a queen -- it's even wider than a king now! That means that my new queen mattress pad does not fit on it any longer (it's stretched out to maximum capacity and pops off the ends), and the nice-quality, deep-pocket queen fitted sheets that I bought for the air mattress do not fit. I am having to use a king-size flat sheet on the mattress instead of a fitted sheet, but even with the massive size of a king flat sheet, it does not tuck under the mattress properly and bunches up underneath me during the night. I am sad that the size and shape of my air mattress has altered like this. I had wanted just a full/double in the first place, but after a few months of very gentle use by one lightweight person, as measured side-bulge to side-bulge, this ""queen"" is bigger than a king, the new bedding I bought for it (the new queen sheet set and the new queen mattress pad each cost more than the air mattress did!) does not fit it now, and it takes up a lot of floor space in my bedroom.But at least the sleeping surface has remained flat, even, and comfortable to sleep on, after 4 months of daily use. I can't even tell that it's an air mattress when I'm lying on it (unless I am right at the edge). It's not the *most* comfortable mattress I've ever slept on, but it's one of the better ones I've ever tried... which is pretty amazing for a fifty-dollar vinyl box full of air!I'm giving it a 3.5 stars out of 5 (rounded up to 4 to fit Amazon's rating system).======================Note: I did try to find this specific model at other retailers to check on customer ratings and prices, but I could only find it (sold out) at one or two other sites, with no reviews. Even at the manufacturer's own site, I traipsed around their numerous air mattress offerings but couldn't find this one... until I looked at the ""international"" version of Intex's site, rather than the ""US"" version. This model might not normally be for sale in this country; maybe that's why it's not really carried at other American online retailers, as far as I could see. The comparable ""high-end"" Intex models that are for the US market seem to have built-in ""pillows"" and/or to be much taller than this one, but I prefer this one for its completely-flat surface and its moderate height.=====================================December 2014: I thought I'd come back to my review to say that I have found a workaround for the way this ""queen-size"" air mattress has bulged out so much on every side that queen-size sheets do not fit it:I use a king-size flat sheet for a bottom sheet, and I secure it around the sides of the mattress with 4 bungee-corded thingies that are sold as ""The Original Bed Band"", which I found here on Amazon for about 14 dollars. They hold the sheet perfectly in place on the mattress.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HZSDEQ6PLRRO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GII9YB4#wasThisHelpful","R3HZSDEQ6PLRRO","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first time I've tried DGL licorice.I generally research a supplement category pretty extensively to compare ingredients, prices, and customer reviews before making a purchase.  I try to avoid supplements with unnecessary fillers, so for DGL, I narrowed down the list of potential products to the following:-Nature's Plus, 60 caps, about 17 cents each, 500 mg extract, less than 2% glycyhhrizin-Solgar, 60 caps, about 17 cents each, 250 mg extract, less than 1% glycyhhrizin-Swanson Vitamins, 90 caps, about 7 cents each, 750 mg extract, less than 3% glycyhhrizinAlthough the Swanson version has the highest amount of DGL per capsule, and is also the cheapest per capsule, the percentage of glycyhhrizin is possibly higher than in the other two products.  If one is worried about limiting the glycyhhrizin percentage as much as possible, she/he might wish to go with the Solgar, although it's the most expensive per mg of product.  I decided to try the Nature's Plus because I felt it offered a happy medium on price, quantity, and glycyhhrizin percentage, and had relatively good reviews too.I generally like the taste of licorice candy (real black licorice candy, not the Twizzlers sort of thing), but I wasn't worried about the taste of this product in any case, since the capsules can be swallowed quickly with a gulp of water.I have read that DGL benefits the digestive system more if the powder in the capsule is emptied on the tongue and kind of chewed for a bit before swallowing, so I have been doing that with these, and I actually really like the taste of this powder and find that it comes close to tasting like real black licorice candy (such as the Panda brand that is available in the US at stores like Whole Foods and Earth Fare).  But I might have strange taste buds!I am trying a few other products for my digestive issues alongside this one, so I can't say how well this product is working to soothe my digestive system.  I expect that it is helping a little bit, and I plan to keep taking it, for the short term at least.(I have read on some sites that licorice herb, even if the glycyhhrizin has been partially removed, should not be taken over the long term, but limited to a course of perhaps 6 weeks or 8 weeks before taking a break from it.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B9FLL5S62F4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00014D1L0#wasThisHelpful","R3B9FLL5S62F4P","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have worn this sort of shoe from K-Swiss for about 25 years.I last bought this exact ""model number"" of shoe about 5 years ago (I bought 2 pairs at that time because they were on sale, and when the first of those 2 pairs finally fell apart about 2 years ago, I broke out the 2nd pair from the back of the closet, and I have been wearing that pair since then, and they are due to be replaced now).I noticed that there was a 25% off sale on shoes at Amazon a few days ago, and decided to get a new pair of these.Because several recent reviewers had noted that the sizing on these had changed and the fit for their particular size is now looser and longer (...at least one person said their size was a full inch longer than before) than it had been in the past, so that I could be sure that I got a pair that fit me, I ordered 3 pairs of these shoes -- one in the size I bought 5 years ago, one a half-size down from that, and one a half-size down from that.  I was thinking that if the length on these had been altered by a full inch, I'd probably need to go an entire size down from my normal size.However, when I received the 3 pairs of shoes in the mail, I tried on my ""usual"" size first, and it fit exactly the same as the ones from 5 years ago.  I compared the old ones with the new ones side-to-side and sole-to-sole, and, if anything, the shoes I got yesterday are a smidgen shorter than the shoes I got 5 years ago (with the same size written on their inside labels).  Out of curiosity, I next tried on the half-size down of the new shoes, and it was definitely a half-size smaller (and therefore it was also ""true to size""), so I kept the new pair in my usual size and returned the 2 smaller pairs to Amazon.Once again, I really appreciate Amazon's policy of free returns on shoes (which they sell directly), which gives one peace of mind in ordering shoes online, sight-unseen.----I thought I'd note that this new pair of shoes has a pungent ""chemical"" odor that I don't recall my past K-Swiss pairs having.  It was so strong that I actually had to put the shoes out on the porch to air out (they are still there).  I expect this is typical for most inexpensive leather shoes these days, and has to do with the way they put them together in modern manufacturing (the chemicals that they use to create the kind-of-real leather material, the glue, the 'rubber', etc.)  This also was the case with the 'leather' cell phone case that I bought recently, and other items.  After a week or two, the odor goes away.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GL58WQSL80YO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001CMQOA#wasThisHelpful","R2GL58WQSL80YO","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love merino wool generally -- having everything from socks to hats made out of it, I was excited about the idea of *literally* being clad head-to-toe in it this winter, with underwear being the missing piece!These Icebreaker panties get such good reviews (here and on other sites), and the bikini panties of another brand that I've worn for the last 20 years have been discontinued, so I had high hopes these hipkinis would be just what I am looking for.Although these are expensive, a momentary discount was being offered, and I figured that if they are as long-lasting and comfortable as most of my Icebreaker clothing is, they would be a good investment.In the normal Icebreaker clothing, for tops I wear a small and for bottoms I wear either an extra-small, small, or medium (depending on the item, the fit, the material, the style).  With Amazon's free-returns policy on clothing and shoes, I usually order 2 sizes and see which fits me better, so for these underwear I ordered a small and a medium.  (I decided not to order an extra-small to try, mainly because I had a feeling they'd be too small for me because of what previous reviewers had said about the hipkini sizing, but also the choice was made for me because Amazon was out of stock in that size at the time I placed my order.)One reviewer had said that because the wool material is naturally stretchy, the mediums and the smalls seemed to fit almost the same to her, with the mediums giving just a bit more coverage on the behind and a little more height towards the waist.  I would agree with that assessment - the medium had more material, but it felt nearly the same as the small when it was on.When taking them out of the box, they seemed well-made and the material seemed nice.However, when they were on, these looked awful on me!  I don't have model proportions and I never expect to look like the typical Icebreaker catalog model when I am wearing Icebreaker clothing, but still, I am a relatively small-size person with a smallish bottom, small hips, and medium thighs -- and my old panties (by a different brand) in size small look boringly-ordinary on me -- but these Icebreaker hipkinis looked downright ugly on me.  It must just be the way they fit *me*, because they get so many good reviews from other women!These were the problems, on me:- The black was out of stock, and the other colors they had to choose from in the sizes I needed were too bright for my taste, so I got the light grey color.  I like that color generally, but it looked terrible with my skin tone, and from a little distance they looked like once-white panties that had become grungy and discolored.- The elastic around the leg openings and the waist was tighter than the fabric was cut to be, so between the two areas of elastic the panties gave me a lower-waist ""spare tire"" that I don't have in real life.  This happened with both the smalls and the mediums.  Neither pair was actually too small for me, and, if anything, the mediums were probably a little big for me, but it's just that the nature of the elastic made it look like it was string tightly wound around the middle of a balloon or something, or a rubberband wrapped around a beanbag, with my skin puffing out above and below the elastic.  The elastic didn't *feel* too tight - this was just the appearance of it... strange.  For that particular 8 inches of my lower trunk, I suddenly looked like the Michelin Man!  ;-)- The whole hipkini style looked wrong on me.  I was surprised at that, because a few years ago I had some inexpensive ""boy shorts"" with a wide band of fabric on the outer hips which looked relatively good on me, and I thought these Icebreaker hipkinis might have that flavor of fit -- but, no.  (Considering that it's just an inch or two of fabric, and a small difference in cut, it is amazing how much better my old-standby bikini panties look on me than these hipkinis do.  I wish that Icebreaker made bikini-style panties, but at the moment they do not.)Sadly, I had to return the hipkinis.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E7NC9T47G46P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I55ZTQM#wasThisHelpful","R3E7NC9T47G46P","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Original rating:  4 starsI bought this for a relative who must take a lot of medications each day.  He has not begun to use it yet and I have only examined it for a minute, but my first impression is that it's exactly what I expected it to be from its Amazon listing -- extra-large and easy to use.One of the best things about it is the ease of lifting the lid and filling all 28 spots at once, instead of trying to fiddle with opening 28 little lids on ""normal"" 7-day pill holders.One earlier reviewer said that he learned to use long-handled tweezers to get out pills that he couldn't reach with his fingers, but I think that the individual boxes are big enough to use a small kitchen spoon or measuring spoon in, if some pills are hard for you to get out of this.  I don't think my relative, an elderly man with medium-to-large fingers, will have a problem getting his pills out of this organizer with his fingers.  (And, if you take your pills in the order you have laid them out in this box, you could always turn the box upside down and empty the current moment's pills into your hand or on a placemat/kitchen towel/plate, because the cover would keep all the future pills safely inside their little boxes.)This organizer takes up a lot of space and the blue is bright, so it is eye-catching if it is sitting on a counter or table.  If you need to take medicine frequently during the day, you'll appreciate the visual reminder that this offers if it's left sitting out (and not tucked away in a cabinet or something).One thing I did not notice is whether the main lid or the 7 daily lids are likely to pop open and spill the contents all over the place if the container is accidentally dropped on the floor, but the organizer did not seem to be too fragile in that respect.After he starts to use this, if my relative has any complaints about it, I'll update this review.=====Update after a few weeks of use:  I have lowered my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.This is working pretty well for my relative, but we have noticed that the white malleable plastic insert that holds the pills has a lot of very thin, see-through places, especially in the corners of the individual compartments, where it would take next to no pressure (from fingers trying to scoop out pills, etc.) to punch a hole straight through it.  I foresee that we will have to patch some of the corners of the insert to plug up holes that will occur even with careful use, which is going to be a little awkward to do, since you can't use bare tape against medications, of course.  It is a shame that the insert is not sturdy, since this item was relatively expensive.The relative does appreciate the way the plastic doors slide open for each day, and how the whole thing can be filled at once by opening up the main lid.Even though I am disappointed with the build-quality of the insert, I am thinking of getting a second one of these, so we can prepare 2 weeks of pills at once for him, instead of spending so long each week carefully doling them out (he takes a lot of medications).","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K9SGJXP471NN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XUI54U#wasThisHelpful","R2K9SGJXP471NN","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After receiving these, I checked them against a few other measuring cups that I have, and unfortunately 3 of the 4 Norpro scoops hold different amounts of water than my older measuring implements do.- The 1-cup and 1/2-cup of the Norpro scoops each hold a bit less than my older measuring cups, maybe 1/2 ounce less (that is a rough estimate).- The 1/4-cup Norpro scoop seems to hold the same amount as my older measuring cups.- The 1/8-cup Norpro scoop is much bigger than it should be -- one of them fills up 75% of the 1/4-cup Norpro scoop, as well as my older measuring cups in the 1/4th size (instead of only filling them 50% of the way, which a 1/8-cup ought to do) -- and three of them overflow the Norpro 1/2-cup scoop, whereas three of them should fill the 1/2-cup scoop only 75% of the way.It would be one thing if every Norpro scoop in the set held just a bit less than its corresponding size in my regular measuring cups -- perhaps my older measuring sets are incorrect (although I don't think they are) -- but when the Norpro scoops don't even agree with each other about measurements, that's a problem.My set might just be a ""lemon"", of course.  This listing on Amazon features very good reviews and many happy customers.But as it stands, at least with my scoops, they look large, sturdy, shiny, eye-catching, and expensive, but they don't do the job they are meant to do.  For around twenty-five dollars for 4 implements, I would expect good accuracy, and, of course, internal consistency across the set.  I decided to return the set for a refund.As an aside -- I also was hoping to be able to use the 1/8-cup scoop for double-duty as an extra-sturdy mixing spoon, but when I held it in my hand, I realized that it would have felt awkward, to me, to use it for that purpose.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKVCW6BSW2DVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002IK4Q0#wasThisHelpful","RKVCW6BSW2DVY","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this for an elderly relative who decided that he would like a support rail for his toilet.I checked out the various styles and brands, and chose this one for the following reasons:1.  This one is freestanding and does not need to be inserted between layers of the toilet seat on its rear screws.a.  This saves time and annoyance because there is no fiddling around with un-attaching and re-attaching the toilet seat.b.  Unlike with the rails that have to be screwed in, putting weight on this rail does not put any stress on the toilet screws or on the toilet surface itself (I had read a customer comment on one of the listings for that type of rail which noted that she felt that putting her whole weight on the rail was putting a lot of pressure on those screws and on the porcelain of that small section of her toilet.)c.  This makes it easier to clean the toilet area than a fitted rail would, because the entire rail can be removed from the bathroom in a few seconds and there is no dodging of the contraption to clean the lower parts of the toilet and the floor area.d.  This can be moved easily to other rooms in case the person needs support in standing or sitting somewhere else in their home.e.  The freestanding nature makes it relatively portable by car to other locations, if need be -- although it does not fold up flat (after it has been assembled for the first time), like some of these rails do.f.  This rail allows the toilet seat to be raised as normal, resting unimpeded against the tank (at least it does on my relative's toilet), and the person using the toilet can lean back on the lid (if they normally can do this with their particular toilet when there is no rail around it) -- while it appears that a few other styles of toilet rails do not let that happen with the lid.2.  This one was relatively inexpensive - less than forty using Amazon Prime.3.  This one is sturdy and holds a lot of weight, but the rail is not too heavy to lift/move.4.  This one is not too wide for my relative's small bathroom, where there are only a few inches between the tub, the toilet, and the sink.5.  This one has an adjustable height and it only takes a few seconds to make the adjustment.6.  It's made by what seems to be a reputable manufacturer of this type of equipment.7.  It is quick and easy to put together and requires no tools for assembly.There were a few minor negatives:1.  Due to the way the back two legs are connected to the crossbar in the back, the front two legs splay out sideways an inch or two when weight is put on the rail - it's not by much, and it's not destabilizing to my relative, but I would prefer if the two front legs did not move sideways at all.  On our rail at least, that particular connection to the crossbar can't be tightened (it came this way from the factory).2.  The top of each rail, in the foamy cushion part, arrived having been quite flattened out during shipment, and the foam did not poof up again after the rail was assembled and the damaged area was massaged for a while.  This was exactly the place where a person would need to put his/her hands while using the rail, so it was a shame that the cushion-y feeling in that area of both rails was damaged and lessened.  I ended up working the rubbery/foamy covering of the top part of the handrails around 180 degrees so the undamaged part of the covering was on top and the flattened part was on the underside. (The flattened area that is now on the underside can be felt with the fingers as one grips the rails, but at least one's palms, which are bearing the most weight, have the normal amount of cushion.)  This was probably as a result of poor packing inside the box, and might just have been a one-off type of defect that occurred during storage/shipment of the box.3.  There appears to be no way to fold this rail up flat, like at least one other brand of freestanding toilet support rail allows for.  However, that other brand costs at least twice as much as this rail.  My relative will likely be leaving this in place around his toilet most of the time (except for when the bathroom is being cleaned) and will not be transporting it often or wanting to store it away in a closet, so being able to fold the support rail was not a priority for him.So far, my relative seems pretty happy with this item.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SCAT0JOJY33D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XI0XXA#wasThisHelpful","R3SCAT0JOJY33D","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recently I tried out the Ibex Woolies Bottoms and Crew Tops, in both the 150 gsm (grams-per-square-meter) and 220 gsm merino wool knits, in several sizes.  This was my experience --Background:Before last month, I had not heard of the Ibex brand of merino wool long underwear and clothing.  I found out about Ibex Woolies when I was searching on Amazon for merino wool items similar to those of Icebreaker.I have been a long-time customer of Icebreaker's wool clothing.  [My extensive review of Icebreaker items can be found on Amazon listings such as that for ""Icebreaker Women's Sprite Leggings"" at http://www.amazon.com/Icebreaker-Womens-Sprite-Leggings-Black/dp/B00AFTRUS6.]  Unfortunately, in recent years, Icebreaker's evolving leggings pattern has become much too low-rise in the waist area for me.  I have some Icebreaker leggings from 6 and 8 years ago which come up to my natural waist (bellybutton area) and feel warm, sturdy, and comfortable, but unfortunately all the pairs of Icebreaker leggings that I have purchased in the last few years I've had to return for a refund because of the poor fit.Those old leggings are at the end of their lives now, so I will need some new leggings this winter.  Last month I began looking beyond Icebreaker to other brands of merino wool long underwear.A.  Woolies Bottoms, 150 gsm:When I learned that Ibex's women's leggings (Woolies Bottoms) are made of 100% merino wool and are reported to come up the natural waist, I ordered some with high hopes.Based on the size chart, I ordered one small and one medium in the lower-priced 150 gsm Woolies Bottoms.  I expected that the medium-sized Woolies Bottoms might fit me better than the small-sized, but with Amazon's free returns on clothing and shoes, I usually try out a couple of sizes to get the best fit.[For comparison's sake -- generally I am a women's size 4 or 6 in US sizing, a women's size 8 or 10 in UK sizing, and a small when it comes to small/medium/large sizing. I am about 5' 4"" tall.]The mediums were too big from the start, and I decided to return them.When I first put the smalls on, they fit well and comfortably, neither tight nor loose.  They were one or two inches too long for me in the legs, so there was about an extra inch and a half of fabric bunching at my ankles, but it was not so much that it would be a problem. However, after wearing them for a couple of hours, the smalls got bigger and bigger, becoming loose everywhere, especially in the thighs.  I could grab a handful of excess material on the side of my thigh.  It was clear that I'd have to return the smalls, too.Because I loved the relatively-high waistline and the 100% merino fabric of the Ibex Woolies, I decided to exchange the smalls for some extra-smalls.  The extra-smalls fit me perfectly -- they came right to the bottom of the ankle without any bunched-up fabric, they fit my thighs, they fit my waist (at the moment my waist is perhaps 28 inches, which in a lot of brands would require a medium size, certainly not an extra-small!).  They fit sleekly without being too tight, and this is the fit I want for wool leggings, so I can wear them under jeans or hiking pants, or to sleep in during cold weather.Oddly enough, unlike the smalls, the extra-smalls do *not* stretch out after I wear them for a couple of hours (or even all day).150 gsm wool material is on the thin side.  The particular knit of the Woolies is fluffier and stretchier than my 150 gsm Icebreakers.  It also seems more delicate than the material of my Icebreakers, and I've read several reviews here and elsewhere that said some customers had noticed runs or holes developing in their Woolies pretty quickly, so I have decided to wash my Woolies in a mesh laundry bag, to be safe.  (I have never felt the need to do that with my Icebreaker items.)B.  Woolies Crew Top, 150 gsm:I also ordered a Woolies 150 gsm Crew Top in size small and medium.  The medium was too big and I decided to return it.  The small top appeared to fit okay, but it arrived from Amazon with a noticeable puckered spot on one shoulder which I could not smooth down, so I returned it too.I wanted to exchange the defective small for another small, but that particular size was out of stock on Amazon at that time.  However, the Woolies Bottoms and Crew Top in the thicker 220 grams-per-square-meter weight were in stock, so I ordered those to give them a try.C.  Woolies Crew Top, 220 gsm:The 220 gsm Crew Top in size small fit me okay at the beginning, but over a couple of hours it stretched out (even in the arms) and the loose folds of fabric, especially on my stomach area, began to bother me, so I returned it.  At that time, Amazon didn't have the extra-small 220 gsm Crew Top in stock, so I couldn't do an exchange to see if an extra-small would fit me better than a small, as with the Woolies Bottoms.D.  Woolies Bottoms, 220 gsm:Unexpectedly, the 220 gsm Woolies Bottoms in size extra-small fit me differently than the 150 gsm ones.  The 220 gsm were less stretchy, felt smaller all over, and came quite a bit lower on the waist than the 150 gsm ones.  When ordering them, I had anticipated that they would fit me with no problem since the extra-small 150 gsm ones did, so I had ordered 2 pairs of the extra-small 220 gsm Woolies Bottoms... but when I received them, I was surprised to discover that one of the 220 gsm pairs was about 1.5 inches lower on my waist than the other pair, while both were well below my belly-button, which is what I'm trying to avoid in leggings.  I returned both pairs.  It is likely that the small size 220 gsm Bottoms would fit me better (come up higher on the waist) than the extra-small 220 gsm Bottoms, but I was concerned that they might stretch quite a bit like the smalls of the 150 gsm items, so I didn't do an exchange (and it is possible that they also were not in stock from Amazon at that time).Outcome:Since I was happy with the extra-small 150 gsm Bottoms, I decided to order a second pair of those.  Fortunately, the second pair fits me as well as the first pair does.-------------------------------Positives:Partially made in North America.It's great that Ibex sources its marino wool from New Zealand and constructs its clothing in the US and Canada.Waistband is near bellybutton.I hope they continue to make leggings that come up to a woman's natural waist, like their 150 gsm Bottoms do on me (their 220 gsm Bottoms do not come up to my waist).Proportions seem good, flattering fit.The proportions of the extra-small leggings fit my body exactly.  They look nice on.Negatives:Knit is stretchy.The Woolies merino wool knit seems to be stretchier than the several Icebreaker knit types that I own garments made out of.  My Icebreaker tops and bottoms do not loosen up much over time, while the ""small"" Woolies items did after just a couple of hours of light wear (and I was pretty much being stationary, working on my computer).Knit is delicate, less resilient.After about 5 washings, the two pairs of leggings that I kept seem to be fuzzing up a little on the inner thigh, almost as if they are about to develop some little friction-balls on the surface (I hope not!)I put these in mesh wash bags to protect them in the laundry.I am worried that these leggings might not hold up as long as my ancient Icebreaker leggings did.  The Woolies Bottoms look to me as if they might have 2 years of wear in them, instead of 6 or 8 years.Sizing.The sizing was not as I expected (all sizes being larger than expected), and the waist area of the leggings was not uniform across the 150 and 220 gsm wool weights of the extra-small and small leggings.The extra-smalls that I ended up keeping would surely be baggy on a *genuinely* extra-small-sized woman, although I guess people could wash them in warm water and dry them in the dryer to try to shrink them down if they are too big.Price.At seventy dollars for the 150 gsm Bottoms and eighty for the 220 gsm Bottoms (and that's with a great Amazon discount!), I think these are overpriced.  As nice as they are, if these leggings were not the only option for me to have a high/natural waist in a merino wool legging, I wouldn't pay more than forty-five for them.Rating:150 gsm Crew Top:  3 out of 5220 gsm Crew Top:  3 out of 5150 gsm Bottoms:  4 out of 5 (I'm giving them an extra point because both pairs of the extra-smalls that I tried on - and kept - have the rare higher-waisted style that I am looking for)220 gsm Bottoms:  2 out of 5 (I'm taking away a point because both pairs of extra-smalls that I tried on were lower-waisted than I am looking for, and the waistband of one was quite a bit lower than the waistband of the other, even though they were supposed to be the same size.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HO0SV41X8F6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008PRF3EI#wasThisHelpful","R3HO0SV41X8F6X","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update as of November 2015:It seems that Ibex has recently redesigned their Woolies Bottoms for Women (in all the different wool weights they offer).For example, the 150 wool weight Bottoms are now named ""Woolies 1 Base Layer Bottom"".  Here is the current Amazon listing for the new design of those:  http://www.amazon.com/Ibex-Outdoor-Clothing-Womens-Woolies/dp/B00YSGTVL6From the photos I've seen of the new design, and the written description on the Ibex website, the waistband is now over 2 inches wide and the pants appear to fit lower on the waist than the original ""Woolies Bottoms"", at least as compared to the Woolies 150 Bottoms that I praise in the review below (and which I have several pairs of now!) for their high waist.I have a feeling that I would not like the new waist design and waist height, so I've returned to Amazon tonight to buy up a couple more pairs of the old style!I expect that the company has mainly already depleted their stocks of the old style, since the manufacturer does not even offer the old style on their website anymore.If you are purchasing these in the next month or two (late 2015), be on the lookout for the two different designs of the Woollies Bottoms (in the same wool weights of 150 gsm, 220 gsm, etc.), and make sure you buy the leggings style that you think you'd prefer.Also, it appears that they have redesigned and renamed the various Woolies Tops, also.--------Original review:Recently I tried out the Ibex Woolies Bottoms and Crew Tops, in both the 150 gsm (grams-per-square-meter) and 220 gsm merino wool knits, in several sizes.

Here is the current Amazon listing for the new design of those:  http://www.amazon.com/Ibex-Outdoor-Clothing-Womens-Woolies/dp/B00YSGTVL6From the photos I've seen of the new design, and the written description on the Ibex website, the waistband is now over 2 inches wide and the pants appear to fit lower on the waist than the original ""Woolies Bottoms"", at least as compared to the Woolies 150 Bottoms that I praise in the review below (and which I have several pairs of now!) for their high waist.I have a feeling that I would not like the new waist design and waist height, so I've returned to Amazon tonight to buy up a couple more pairs of the old style!I expect that the company has mainly already depleted their stocks of the old style, since the manufacturer does not even offer the old style on their website anymore.If you are purchasing these in the next month or two (late 2015), be on the lookout for the two different designs of the Woollies Bottoms (in the same wool weights of 150 gsm, 220 gsm, etc.), and make sure you buy the leggings style that you think you'd prefer.Also, it appears that they have redesigned and renamed the various Woolies Tops, also.--------Original review:Recently I tried out the Ibex Woolies Bottoms and Crew Tops, in both the 150 gsm (grams-per-square-meter) and 220 gsm merino wool knits, in several sizes.  This was my experience --Background:Before last month, I had not heard of the Ibex brand of merino wool long underwear and clothing.  I found out about Ibex Woolies when I was searching on Amazon for merino wool items similar to those of Icebreaker.I have been a long-time customer of Icebreaker's wool clothing.  [My extensive review of Icebreaker items can be found on Amazon listings such as that for ""Icebreaker Women's Sprite Leggings"" at http://www.amazon.com/Icebreaker-Womens-Sprite-Leggings-Black/dp/B00AFTRUS6.]  Unfortunately, in recent years, Icebreaker's evolving leggings pattern has become much too low-rise in the waist area for me.  I have some Icebreaker leggings from 6 and 8 years ago which come up to my natural waist (bellybutton area) and feel warm, sturdy, and comfortable, but unfortunately all the pairs of Icebreaker leggings that I have purchased in the last few years I've had to return for a refund because of the poor fit.Those old leggings are at the end of their lives now, so I will need some new leggings this winter.  Last month I began looking beyond Icebreaker to other brands of merino wool long underwear.A.  Woolies Bottoms, 150 gsm:When I learned that Ibex's women's leggings (Woolies Bottoms) are made of 100% merino wool and are reported to come up the natural waist, I ordered some with high hopes.Based on the size chart, I ordered one small and one medium in the lower-priced 150 gsm Woolies Bottoms.  I expected that the medium-sized Woolies Bottoms might fit me better than the small-sized, but with Amazon's free returns on clothing and shoes, I usually try out a couple of sizes to get the best fit.[For comparison's sake -- generally I am a women's size 4 or 6 in US sizing, a women's size 8 or 10 in UK sizing, and a small when it comes to small/medium/large sizing. I am about 5' 4"" tall.]The mediums were too big from the start, and I decided to return them.When I first put the smalls on, they fit well and comfortably, neither tight nor loose.  They were one or two inches too long for me in the legs, so there was about an extra inch and a half of fabric bunching at my ankles, but it was not so much that it would be a problem. However, after wearing them for a couple of hours, the smalls got bigger and bigger, becoming loose everywhere, especially in the thighs.  I could grab a handful of excess material on the side of my thigh.  It was clear that I'd have to return the smalls, too.Because I loved the relatively-high waistline and the 100% merino fabric of the Ibex Woolies, I decided to exchange the smalls for some extra-smalls.  The extra-smalls fit me perfectly -- they came right to the bottom of the ankle without any bunched-up fabric, they fit my thighs, they fit my waist (at the moment my waist is perhaps 28 inches, which in a lot of brands would require a medium size, certainly not an extra-small!).  They fit sleekly without being too tight, and this is the fit I want for wool leggings, so I can wear them under jeans or hiking pants, or to sleep in during cold weather.Oddly enough, unlike the smalls, the extra-smalls do *not* stretch out after I wear them for a couple of hours (or even all day).150 gsm wool material is on the thin side.  The particular knit of the Woolies is fluffier and stretchier than my 150 gsm Icebreakers.  It also seems more delicate than the material of my Icebreakers, and I've read several reviews here and elsewhere that said some customers had noticed runs or holes developing in their Woolies pretty quickly, so I have decided to wash my Woolies in a mesh laundry bag, to be safe.  (I have never felt the need to do that with my Icebreaker items.)B.  Woolies Crew Top, 150 gsm:I also ordered a Woolies 150 gsm Crew Top in size small and medium.  The medium was too big and I decided to return it.  The small top appeared to fit okay, but it arrived from Amazon with a noticeable puckered spot on one shoulder which I could not smooth down, so I returned it too.I wanted to exchange the defective small for another small, but that particular size was out of stock on Amazon at that time.  However, the Woolies Bottoms and Crew Top in the thicker 220 grams-per-square-meter weight were in stock, so I ordered those to give them a try.C.  Woolies Crew Top, 220 gsm:The 220 gsm Crew Top in size small fit me okay at the beginning, but over a couple of hours it stretched out (even in the arms) and the loose folds of fabric, especially on my stomach area, began to bother me, so I returned it.  At that time, Amazon didn't have the extra-small 220 gsm Crew Top in stock, so I couldn't do an exchange to see if an extra-small would fit me better than a small, as with the Woolies Bottoms.D.  Woolies Bottoms, 220 gsm:Unexpectedly, the 220 gsm Woolies Bottoms in size extra-small fit me differently than the 150 gsm ones.  The 220 gsm were less stretchy, felt smaller all over, and came quite a bit lower on the waist than the 150 gsm ones.  When ordering them, I had anticipated that they would fit me with no problem since the extra-small 150 gsm ones did, so I had ordered 2 pairs of the extra-small 220 gsm Woolies Bottoms... but when I received them, I was surprised to discover that one of the 220 gsm pairs was about 1.5 inches lower on my waist than the other pair, while both were well below my belly-button, which is what I'm trying to avoid in leggings.  I returned both pairs.  It is likely that the small size 220 gsm Bottoms would fit me better (come up higher on the waist) than the extra-small 220 gsm Bottoms, but I was concerned that they might stretch quite a bit like the smalls of the 150 gsm items, so I didn't do an exchange (and it is possible that they also were not in stock from Amazon at that time).Outcome:Since I was happy with the extra-small 150 gsm Bottoms, I decided to order a second pair of those.  Fortunately, the second pair fits me as well as the first pair does.-------------------------------Positives:Partially made in North America.It's great that Ibex sources its marino wool from New Zealand and constructs its clothing in the US and Canada.Waistband is near bellybutton.I hope they continue to make leggings that come up to a woman's natural waist, like their 150 gsm Bottoms do on me (their 220 gsm Bottoms do not come up to my waist).Proportions seem good, flattering fit.The proportions of the extra-small leggings fit my body exactly.  They look nice on.Negatives:Knit is stretchy.The Woolies merino wool knit seems to be stretchier than the several Icebreaker knit types that I own garments made out of.  My Icebreaker tops and bottoms do not loosen up much over time, while the ""small"" Woolies items did after just a couple of hours of light wear (and I was pretty much being stationary, working on my computer).Knit is delicate, less resilient.After about 5 washings, the two pairs of leggings that I kept seem to be fuzzing up a little on the inner thigh, almost as if they are about to develop some little friction-balls on the surface (I hope not!)I put these in mesh wash bags to protect them in the laundry.I am worried that these leggings might not hold up as long as my ancient Icebreaker leggings did.  The Woolies Bottoms look to me as if they might have 2 years of wear in them, instead of 6 or 8 years.Sizing.The sizing was not as I expected (all sizes being larger than expected), and the waist area of the leggings was not uniform across the 150 and 220 gsm wool weights of the extra-small and small leggings.The extra-smalls that I ended up keeping would surely be baggy on a *genuinely* extra-small-sized woman, although I guess people could wash them in warm water and dry them in the dryer to try to shrink them down if they are too big.Price.At seventy dollars for the 150 gsm Bottoms and eighty for the 220 gsm Bottoms (and that's with a great Amazon discount!), I think these are overpriced.  As nice as they are, if these leggings were not the only option for me to have a high/natural waist in a merino wool legging, I wouldn't pay more than forty-five for them.Rating:150 gsm Crew Top:  3 out of 5220 gsm Crew Top:  3 out of 5150 gsm Bottoms:  4 out of 5 (I'm giving them an extra point because both pairs of the extra-smalls that I tried on - and kept - have the rare higher-waisted style that I am looking for)220 gsm Bottoms:  2 out of 5 (I'm taking away a point because both pairs of extra-smalls that I tried on were lower-waisted than I am looking for, and the waistband of one was quite a bit lower than the waistband of the other, even though they were supposed to be the same size.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZIPV6URXWA6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001NPE6NI#wasThisHelpful","R1ZIPV6URXWA6L","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I will preface my review by saying that I tend to be sensitive to medications and some natural substances (I have various allergies).Everyone has a unique genetic makeup, and body chemistries differ.  What works for some people may not work for others.Maybe because I am used to being outside of the ""norm"" as far as my reactions to some common substances and medicines, it does not surprise me when a new product does not work on me the way it is said to help other people.Unfortunately, just one of these Jarrow citicoline pills (250 mg) caused me to have an unpleasant few hours yesterday:  45 minutes after taking it, I developed a bad headache and felt quite nauseous.  Those symptoms continued to be bad for 1 hour, then reduced to about half their strength during a 2nd hour.  In the 3rd hour, just as the headache and nausea started dissipating and I was relieved at that, I began to feel gastrointestinal distress and cramping (I was doubling over and moaning due to the pain) for another hour, and then I experienced loose bowels.I didn't feel any energetic or cognitive benefit from the pill.And although I had 8 hours of sleep last night, today I feel out-of-sorts, sad, and tired.Needless to say, this was the opposite of what I hoped to experience from citicoline!I had researched it quite a bit before purchasing it (looking up scientific studies on PubMed and the like) and it appears that it does provide measurable benefit to some people.I think that my body chemistry must have an issue with choline and related substances -- the one time I took one capsule of lecithin as a supplement, it also gave me an unpleasant time (headache, wired feeling, temperature dysregulation, couldn't sleep the entire night afterwards).There are mentions in some of the Amazon customer reviews for various brands' citicoline (and combination formulas that contain citicoline, like Jarrow's NeuroOptimizer) that some people are ""choline dominant"" and react badly to these products.  I have looked up ""choline dominance"" online and didn't find any information in mainstream medical sources, but some blogs (by laypeople who are very interested in health and wellness) do mention it as a concept, suggesting that some people already have enough choline (either due to diet, or inherent body chemistry) and adding more with a supplement has bad effects, rather than the good effects that are experienced by people who are ostensibly low in choline.  Some articles mention that 1/3rd of people are ""choline dominant"", but I'm not sure where they got that percentage.My diet is not high in choline - going by the published charts on choline content in foods, I don't even meet the minimum dietary recommended intake on most days.  I don't take any supplement that contains choline in any of its forms, so I'm not getting it that way.  I think, instead of getting a surplus in my diet, that my reaction is probably due to a body chemistry that is antagonized by taking choline in a supplement, and simply doesn't always respond the way that the majority of people's body chemistry responds.I did notice a couple of reports suggesting that some aspects of citicoline are still unknown, or possibly have negative effects, such as:- Neuroprotective Properties of Citicoline: Facts, Doubts and Unresolved Issues, CNS Drugs. 2014; 28(3): 185-193. Published online Feb 7, 2014. PMC3933742 (the entire paper is available to read for free on PubMed, just do an internet search)- Gut flora metabolism of phosphatidylcholine promotes cardiovascular disease, Nature  472, 57-63 (07 April 2011) (the abstract is available on Nature's site)Going by the percentage of negative customer reviews on products like this one (and that isn't such an accurate way of knowing how all the people who purchased and tried this product really felt about a product, but it's the best information we have here), maybe one-third of people don't get noticeable benefits from citicoline and/or other similar substances**, but possibly most of that group probably don't feel much at all from the pills - nothing good, nothing bad - and so they give it a try until the bottle is gone, then move on to something different.  Maybe 8 or 10% have such bad reactions in the first few days of taking the product that they cease taking it.I am certainly in the small group that has an immediate negative reaction to citicoline (and to supplemental lecithin).  I am definitely going to steer clear of this type of product** from now on.But that doesn't mean that this particular item (Jarrow citicoline) is bad, falsely-advertised, poorly-manufactured, or a ""waste of money""!  This seems to be one of those things that the individual has to try, to see if it helps or not.(For something like this, which does not work for a significant minority, you may wish to buy it from a retailer that offers a money-back guarantee for any reason.)** As far as I am aware, similar substances to citicoline are:  betaine (not betaine hcl - betaine hydrochloride - which is a digestive aid and apparently different), lecithin, trimethylglycine (TMG), choline bitartrate, etc.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HSMVA4ADK0XE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JO4EFU#wasThisHelpful","R2HSMVA4ADK0XE","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Icebreaker's version of the ""Tech Top"" that has a half-zip (like a turtleneck with a zipper) is one of my favorite styles of Icebreaker clothing. The half-zip tech top that I have in solid black is always the first thing I put in my suitcase, no matter what time of year or where I'm going!  Last year, I bought a turtleneck (with no zip) in one of Icebreaker's other ranges and it was too tight for my neck, so I had to send it back, but this is one I'd like to try.I wear Icebreaker garments year-round, and really love the ones that I have. Since some listing descriptions for Icebreaker items offer few details about the products, making it difficult for the online customer to make an informed purchasing decision if he/she is unfamiliar with this brand of clothing, I thought I'd type out some general information about Icebreaker clothing and my personal impressions of it, based on my experience of their products from 2000 to early 2013.Note that my review is quite long and usually only the first half of it is shown on this page. If this happens on your screen and you wish to read the second half, all you have to do is press the ""read more"" button at the bottom of the review and Amazon will show you the rest of it. :-)----------------------OVERALL IMPRESSIONIcebreaker's marino wool items are generally made well, last a long time, are easy to care for, feel fantastic on the skin, are ""natural"", don't get smelly easily like polarfleece does, let the skin breathe, etc.Many of my Icebreaker items have been worn and washed several hundred times and are still holding up much better than would be expected.I am a BIG fan of this company's products. For my overall experience of them from around 2000-2010, I would give them a solid ""5 stars""!However, I regret to say that my opinion of the items I bought from Icebreaker in 2012 was not as high. In late 2012 I bought 7 different Icebreaker items (most of them in various sizes) and decided to return all of them because they were not as well-cut as the very ""same"" items that I bought in the 2000s (which I still have and wear, so I can make like-for-like comparisons easily).Based solely on my 2012 experience of Icebreaker products, I would give them 3 stars, meaning ""it's ok"". For me, this is not good enough to command prices of $50 - $100+ for quite simple items, even if the basic wool material itself is outstanding and long-lasting.For my star-rating on this review, I will average the ""5"" I give Icebreaker historically and the ""3"" that I would have given Icebreaker in 2012, and give them a ""4"" now.As of November 2013: Soon I plan to buy a few items from this year's production, which I hope will work out better for me.---------------------MY EXPERIENCE WITH ICEBREAKERI bought my first Icebreaker clothing about 13 years ago when I needed some long underwear for skiing.Up until about 6 years ago, I had been buying Icebreaker items very sparingly, due to the eye-watering prices at London UK sporting goods shops . Then, I discovered that Sierratradingpost sells various Icebreaker styles (usually discontinued items from years past) on their site for a discount. Fortunately, for a couple of years after I discovered this, they had a large selection of women's Icebreaker stuff, so I bought quite a few things for great prices. (These days, Sierra's Icebreaker selection for women appears to be smaller, and the prices comparatively higher, than before. I expect that there are more discounters they have to compete with now, to get that kind of stock.)In addition to bricks-and-mortar sports shops and Sierratradingpost, I have also bought Icebreaker items from several sporting goods online retailers, Amazon, and the Icebreaker website.I still have almost every Icebreaker item I've bought. Even the discounted items have been somewhat pricey, but the quality and longevity were worth the initial investment.----------------------CAVEATWhat I have written below is based on my current knowledge about their products, but it is possible that I have misunderstood some aspects of the brand.If you wish to better understand their product offerings, I would absolutely recommend that you have a look at the Icebreaker official site to view their entire range and gain more clarity about what items are for what purposes, what the wool weights are about, what the quality levels of the different clothing collections are, etc.(Unfortunately, their website, while snazzy, does not fully explain these things, leaving it up to the customer to piece some of the puzzle together.)----------------------ICEBREAKER WOOL WEIGHTS:Icebreaker's marino wool items generally come in four weights of fabric: 150, 200, 260, or 320. This is ""grams per square meter"".150 is quite thin.It provides light warmth.The material is generally see-through. (I wouldn't wear items of this weight out and about in public without anything over them, but some reviewers have said that they do.)It's good for a first base layer, for strenuous exercise, or for sleeping in.Their items of this weight, especially in the ranges intended for athletic use, tend to be really form-fitting in one's typical size.All Icebreaker material seems VERY resilient and long-lasting to me, but because the 150 wool weight is pretty thin, it is the likeliest to be torn, develop holes, get ""runs"" (like pantyhose). I don't think this happens too much with it, but I've seen some reviewers mention it (most often talking about how they accidentally poked holes in it with long fingernails), and three of my 150-weight leggings have developed runs in them after several years of heavy use.200 is slightly thicker, but still on the thin side.It's pretty warm.The lighter colors are definitely see-through, such as grey and cream. My older black and brown items made out of 200 weight wool don't seem to be see-through, but some of the newer dark-colored ones might be.It's good for a base layer or mid-weight layer, for exercise, and sleeping in.Especially in the ranges intended for athletic situations, their items of this weight tend to be form-fitting in one's typical size.260 is on the thicker side.It's definitely warm, a cozy weight.None of my 260 items are see-through. I can wear tops made out of this weight on their own (without anything over them) and not worry that my underwear or too many lumps&bumps will show through.It's good for a mid-layer or top-layer, and sleeping in (if you get cold at night, like I do).Items of this weight tend to fit looser than items of the same size in the 150/200 weights do. This may have something to do with how much naturally-stretchier the thicker fabric is, but it also seems that they cut these 260-weight items bigger because this weight is often worn as a top-layer or middle-layer, instead of as a base-layer.I like this weight the best. I think that the company says that this is their most popular weight across the board.320 is thickest, of course.It is quite warm, very toasty and sturdy.This weight is generally a top-layer, so items made out of this material are relatively loosely-cut.--------------------------ICEBREAKER LINES / RANGES / ""COLLECTIONS"" OF CLOTHING:Icebreaker makes different ranges - some intended for wearing as normal underwear (like panties and sports bras and tank tops), some intended for wearing as thermal/long underwear, some intended for wearing as everyday clothing, and some intended for wearing as athletic wear.Even though at first glance most of their items appear VERY similar to each other, there are different feelings to the fabrics (even in fabrics of the same wool weight), different quality levels, different cuts, and different design details amongst these different lines, so it is good to check their website about the particular Icebreaker item you are thinking of buying to make sure that it is intended for the activity you want it for.Two of the popular ranges at the lower end of the Icebreaker price scale are:BodyfitThe Bodyfit range seems to be for athletic situations, but also casual-wear and sleeping-in. The knit of this range's wool is usually flatter and less stretchy than the knit of the ranges that are for underwear or purely casual wear. Items in this range are usually cut to fit relatively snugly.EverydayThis range is made of a looser, thicker, stretchier knit than the Bodyfit, and is more for general sleeping-in and casual long-underwear needs, not so much for athletic situations. (However, I'm sure that they would be okay in many athletic situations, and I have worn them skiing and hiking.) Everyday items tend to be made of a stretchier knit and cut to fit more loosely than the Bodyfit items. I wear a size below my ordinary size in this range.Other rangesTheir other ranges appear to include: Black Sheep Collection, RealFleece Collection, Pure Plus Collection, Journeys Travel Collection, Premium Underwear Collection, GT Technical Sports Collection, GT Bike Collection, Technical Base Layers Collection, and Technical Mid Layers Collection. Please see the Icebreaker site for more information on their ranges.Frankly, I feel that they've made this aspect of their brand over-complicated and too confusing for the average customer, and I have not been able to locate any overview of the various collections on their site or on their product packaging materials.-----------------------ICEBREAKER COLORS:Icebreaker tends to make most items in black, as their basic universal color.Many items are offered in about 2 to 8 other colors, as well. There is often some version of blue, red, grey, and green - sometimes a pink, sometimes a brown or purple, etc. Often the colors are skewed towards the cool end of the spectrum (which I notice because my coloring is on the warm end of the spectrum and cool tones look awful on me).The different weights of wool and/or different ranges (e.g., Bodyfit, Everyday, Journeys Travel Collection, etc.) will tend to have their own mini-set of color options. (For example, the current grey color in the 200 Bodyfit is a medium-grey and is called ""blizzard"" and the current grey color in the 260 Bodyfit is a dark-grey and called ""metro"", and they don't offer those particular colors in other weights of wool or other ranges, as far as I know.)They change their colors every year or so (I think), and some colors tend to sell out mid-way through a season and are not restocked, so if you see an item in a color that you love, or there is a matching set (of long underwear or something) and you want both pieces in the same color, you probably should get it at the time, because it's not guaranteed that it will be available in the future.---------------------EXTRA DESIGN FLOURISHES:A couple of their ranges, mainly the more athletic lines, feature ""pops"" of contrasting color in a certain part of the garment, such as a stripe running down the sleeves or down the sides, or a triangle of bright material at the ankle. Most internet retailers' photographs of the garments do show these features because the areas of differing colors are pretty obvious, but it pays to read the item descriptions (and check out the manufacturer's site for confirmation) if this kind of thing is not what you are looking for.In a couple of their clothing ranges, mainly the underwear, 150-weight, and casual-wear lines, some of the tops and bottoms have printed patterns (like floral motifs or abstract swirls - sometimes in contrasting colors) on the sleeves or in the hip-region. This *can* escape your notice when the only images of the item you have available to you are the tiny product photographs that most internet retailers provide, so do double-check the customer reviews of the item, and maybe the Icebreaker site's own full description of the item, if you want to know for sure if the item comes with a printed pattern on a section of it.---------------------ICEBREAKER SIZING:Sizing and fit are so variable from person to person and from brand to brand, but in case it may help, I'll talk about my experiences with Icebreaker clothing.For reference, generally I am usually a women's size 4 or 6 in US sizing, a women's size 8 or 10 in UK sizing, and a small when it comes to small/medium/large sizing. This goes for both tops and bottoms.---Sizing of TopsAlmost all of my Icebreaker tops from the last 13 years -- crew tops, long-underwear tops, turtlenecks, and zip-up jackets -- are women's size small.The only tops I have in size extra-small are from the Skin range (which they phased out in 2006, but the sizing and type of material used for the Skin range appear to be very similar to those of the current range called Everyday).Generally, I know that an Icebreaker small top is probably going to fit me.The main issue that I've had with their tops is sleeve length (too long). This is not uncommon for me, because I do have arms that are on the petite side: most suit jackets I buy have to be shortened a little in the sleeves, and I often have to turn up sweaters one turn at the cuff. And one feature of some Icebreaker tops is a thumb loop which necessitates that the sleeves are meant to be about three inches longer than the wrist - I understand this, and just roll those tops up a turn or two. However, I've read quite a few reviewers' comments that mention that Icebreaker sleeves tend to be long, and I do think that their sleeves are longer than normal. [""Normal"" being subjective, of course! ...the only women I've met from New Zealand actually did happen to be tall, lithe, and willowy, so maybe that's normal there. :-) ] Last week, I bought a 2012-made Icebreaker ""Oasis"" top in a size small, and while it was too tight in the chest area (which is normally NOT a problem for me with Icebreaker), the sleeves were a crazy four or five inches past my wrist, even though they didn't have thumb holes and therefore were meant to end at the wrist. I had to return it.---Sizing of Leggings:I have run into inconsistency in Icebreaker legging sizes. I have some in extra-small, some in small, and some in medium. (And in one 2012 collection, the extra-smalls are a little too big for me but there isn't a smaller size to go to.)I have not found Icebreaker's official sizing chart (available on their site) to be terribly accurate for leggings.For the leggings, it seems to me that one must experiment in each Icebreaker clothing range and wool weight to discover the best size and fit for oneself.I will spell out below the ones that I have tried. Because the sizing of the ""same"" leggings sometimes has varied across the years, I will mention what year I got them.1. BODYFIT range1a. Bodyfit 150 leggings2006 or 2007 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize medium. The label says ""slim fit"" (possibly back then they had different ""fits"" within the Bodyfit range, but they don't seem to now).Fit me snugly, but well.Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2008 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize small.Are a bit too small for me this winter - they fit me when I'm about 5-to-8 pounds less than I am at the moment.Waistband hits 1 inch below the belly button, feels okay.2012 Bodyfit 150 leggingsI decided not to buy new 150-weight leggings in 2012 because after a few years of heavy use, my old Bodyfit 150 leggings developed some un-mendable ""runs""/""ladders"". I still wear them and love them, but they are slowly self-destructing. It is comparatively easy to snag them on a rough surface or to poke a fingernail through them when pulling them on or off.Actually, I've just looked on the Icebreaker site (December 2012) and they don't list ANY Bodyfit 150 leggings. The only 150 weight leggings they list are the ""Sprite"" leggings from the Premium Underwear Collection. Also, I think that the ""Nature"" leggings (which are a discontinued style) were of 150 weight, and I have seen these still on sale on a few websites.1b. Bodyfit 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around eighty (discounted price of around sixty).2008 Bodyfit 200 leggingsSize medium.Fit me, and there is extra room in them - I probably could go up 5 to 8 pounds and they would still fit. When I purchased those mediums, I tried on the small size and found it to be way too small, especially along the tight and narrow waistband that these leggings were made with at the time. (I think it was a reaction to the consumer response to that waistband that they made the newer waistbands really wide and soft.)Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2012 Bodyfit 200 leggingsAt first, based on the Icebreaker official size chart, I ordered a medium in these. They were too big, so I exchanged them for a size small.The small fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 or even 3 inches below the belly button. This is a more ""modern"" position for a waistband, of course, compared to coming up to the true waist, but I prefer ""athletic"" base layers to cover my entire body - neck to ankle, to enable the base layer shirts to be securely tucked inside the base layer pants, and to feel really secure when I'm moving around -- but this waistband was so low on me, and so wide and stretchy that it felt like it was about to slide down to my hips at any moment because the elastic wasn't very tight.Not only from the practical side was this low waistband a problem, but MAN, the whole cut of the upper part of these leggings seemed to be designed to make my tummy area look as flabby and unattractive as possible! I tried my old leggings on when I took these off -- just to check that it wasn't bad lighting or post-Thanksgiving excess weight that was to blame for how these made me look, but my older Icebreaker Bodyfit 200 leggings looked a lot better on me than these leggings did.I had to return them. I have decided to wait until next year's production, to see if they alter the cut of the waist area.1c. Bodyfit 260 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around ninety (discounted price around seventy-five).2012 Bodyfit 260 leggingsSize small.Fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 inches below the belly button. They had the same issues as the 2012 Bodyfit 200 leggings did - waistband too low, too loose, too wide, and quite unattractive in the belly region!I also had to return these. I hope next year's will be cut higher on the waist.2. EVERYDAY range2a. Skin 200 leggings (discontinued 2006) - the Skin range was probably similar to Everyday.2005 Skin 200 leggingsSize extra-small, yet are the largest I own - I could gain 15 pounds and they would still feel okay. But they fit me nicely when I'm at any weight - 10 pounds less or more than my present size - they are simply the coziest and softest that I own.Waistband comes to about 1 inch higher than belly button, feels secure.2b. Everyday 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around sixty (discounted price of around forty-five).2012 Everyday 200 leggingsTwo weeks ago, I bought them in size small which were too big, so I exchanged them for an extra-small. Even the extra-smalls had extra material in places on the legs, which is unusual because my legs are not toothpicks (this kind of legging is not supposed to be baggy, so the cut of these must have been off).Worse, the upper part of the extra-small leggings was cut strangely - the waistband was in a deep V, so that the middle was 3 inches below my belly-button (which is way too low for me), but the sides rose up 3 inches higher than that (it wasn't a curve, it was a visible V). Yet the waistband elastic wasn't tight enough, so the tall sides wanted to sag down and bunch up around my hips -- strange. (And that was not the way the smalls I tried on the week before had fit my waist area! In fact, I think the smalls of last week fit me better generally than the extra-smalls of this week.) I don't have the energy to go through the rigamarole of ordering a different pair of extra-smalls, but maybe I just got a bad apple.I had to return the extra-smalls.I was very disappointed because they were the 7th Icebreaker product I've tried in the last 2 weeks. This Icebreaker shopping quest has taken up a fair bit of my time lately, but I have nothing new to show for it. I've given up trying to get anything now and will wait a year and see how their 2013 production fits me.3. OTHER rangesTheir other legging types are more expensive than the Everyday and Bodyfit, and seem to be geared towards high-tech athletic use, or constructed to be worn on their own as pants/trousers. Some have Lycra in them. Check out Icebreaker's site for more info.--------------------------------OTHER TIPSThe other main retailers of this kind of product sometimes offer free shipping on their Amazon listings of an item but don't offer free shipping on the exact same item when sold through their own site (even when the price of the item itself is the same on both sites), so it can save you money if you pay attention to that.The best selection BY FAR is available from the manufacturer's site, but the prices there are generally higher. However, they have discounts from time to time, such as their ""Black Friday"" sale when they offer 30% off all items that are black in color (at least they have done so in prior years).Amazon sometimes calls the Icebreaker Bodyfit range ""BF"" and sometimes ""Bodyfit"", so if you are searching here for Icebreaker's Bodyfit range, do a separate search under each of the two search terms to get the most accurate results.In terms of merino wool socks, I prefer Smartwool socks over Icebreaker's. Sierratradingpost is one retailer which often carries a large selection of them at good prices. Those socks last a really long time. I wear them almost year-round because the lightweight ones breathe really well even when it's warm out.The Smartwool women's small size is the only sock I can find that truly fits my feet (which aren't even that small, all things considered!) without bunching up inside my shoes.If you have a smaller foot (size 7 or less) and are female, note that the Smartwool unisex socks in the small size are bigger than the smalls made just for women, even though that company's size guide says that both sizes are meant to fit the same range of women's shoe sizes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35ON2A0VBMNIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LLBW0I2#wasThisHelpful","R35ON2A0VBMNIE","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This ""tech top"" with the half-zip is one of my favorite styles of Icebreaker clothing. It's always the first thing I put in my suitcase, no matter what time of year or where I'm going! Originally I bought one in solid black about 8 years ago, and then when I found them on sale a couple of years afterwards, I bought two more (also in black - the only color that seemed to be available) to have as back-ups!  In 2013, I bought one of these in grey from Amazon, but it didn't the same fit or look as my previous black ones, and I sent it back. I am not sure how this new patterned version of the Tech Long Sleeve Half Zip Top would fit, but it appears in the listing's photo to be shaped pretty much how my older ones are, so that's a good sign.I wear Icebreaker garments year-round, and really love the ones that I have. Since some listing descriptions for Icebreaker items offer few details about the products, making it difficult for the online customer to make an informed purchasing decision if he/she is unfamiliar with this brand of clothing, I thought I'd type out some general information about Icebreaker clothing and my personal impressions of it, based on my experience of their products from 2000 to early 2013.Note that my review is quite long and usually only the first half of it is shown on this page. If this happens on your screen and you wish to read the second half, all you have to do is press the ""read more"" button at the bottom of the review and Amazon will show you the rest of it. :-)----------------------OVERALL IMPRESSIONIcebreaker's marino wool items are generally made well, last a long time, are easy to care for, feel fantastic on the skin, are ""natural"", don't get smelly easily like polarfleece does, let the skin breathe, etc.Many of my Icebreaker items have been worn and washed several hundred times and are still holding up much better than would be expected.I am a BIG fan of this company's products. For my overall experience of them from around 2000-2010, I would give them a solid ""5 stars""!However, I regret to say that my opinion of the items I bought from Icebreaker in 2012 was not as high. In late 2012 I bought 7 different Icebreaker items (most of them in various sizes) and decided to return all of them because they were not as well-cut as the very ""same"" items that I bought in the 2000s (which I still have and wear, so I can make like-for-like comparisons easily).Based solely on my 2012 experience of Icebreaker products, I would give them 3 stars, meaning ""it's ok"". For me, this is not good enough to command prices of $50 - $100+ for quite simple items, even if the basic wool material itself is outstanding and long-lasting.For my star-rating on this review, I will average the ""5"" I give Icebreaker historically and the ""3"" that I would have given Icebreaker in 2012, and give them a ""4"" now.As of November 2013: Soon I plan to buy a few items from this year's production, which I hope will work out better for me.---------------------MY EXPERIENCE WITH ICEBREAKERI bought my first Icebreaker clothing about 13 years ago when I needed some long underwear for skiing.Up until about 6 years ago, I had been buying Icebreaker items very sparingly, due to the eye-watering prices at London UK sporting goods shops . Then, I discovered that Sierratradingpost sells various Icebreaker styles (usually discontinued items from years past) on their site for a discount. Fortunately, for a couple of years after I discovered this, they had a large selection of women's Icebreaker stuff, so I bought quite a few things for great prices. (These days, Sierra's Icebreaker selection for women appears to be smaller, and the prices comparatively higher, than before. I expect that there are more discounters they have to compete with now, to get that kind of stock.)In addition to bricks-and-mortar sports shops and Sierratradingpost, I have also bought Icebreaker items from several sporting goods online retailers, Amazon, and the Icebreaker website.I still have almost every Icebreaker item I've bought.

The label says ""slim fit"" (possibly back then they had different ""fits"" within the Bodyfit range, but they don't seem to now).Fit me snugly, but well.Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2008 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize small.Are a bit too small for me this winter - they fit me when I'm about 5-to-8 pounds less than I am at the moment.Waistband hits 1 inch below the belly button, feels okay.2012 Bodyfit 150 leggingsI decided not to buy new 150-weight leggings in 2012 because after a few years of heavy use, my old Bodyfit 150 leggings developed some un-mendable ""runs""/""ladders"". I still wear them and love them, but they are slowly self-destructing. It is comparatively easy to snag them on a rough surface or to poke a fingernail through them when pulling them on or off.Actually, I've just looked on the Icebreaker site (December 2012) and they don't list ANY Bodyfit 150 leggings. The only 150 weight leggings they list are the ""Sprite"" leggings from the Premium Underwear Collection. Also, I think that the ""Nature"" leggings (which are a discontinued style) were of 150 weight, and I have seen these still on sale on a few websites.1b. Bodyfit 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around eighty (discounted price of around sixty).2008 Bodyfit 200 leggingsSize medium.Fit me, and there is extra room in them - I probably could go up 5 to 8 pounds and they would still fit. When I purchased those mediums, I tried on the small size and found it to be way too small, especially along the tight and narrow waistband that these leggings were made with at the time. (I think it was a reaction to the consumer response to that waistband that they made the newer waistbands really wide and soft.)Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2012 Bodyfit 200 leggingsAt first, based on the Icebreaker official size chart, I ordered a medium in these. They were too big, so I exchanged them for a size small.The small fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 or even 3 inches below the belly button. This is a more ""modern"" position for a waistband, of course, compared to coming up to the true waist, but I prefer ""athletic"" base layers to cover my entire body - neck to ankle, to enable the base layer shirts to be securely tucked inside the base layer pants, and to feel really secure when I'm moving around -- but this waistband was so low on me, and so wide and stretchy that it felt like it was about to slide down to my hips at any moment because the elastic wasn't very tight.Not only from the practical side was this low waistband a problem, but MAN, the whole cut of the upper part of these leggings seemed to be designed to make my tummy area look as flabby and unattractive as possible! I tried my old leggings on when I took these off -- just to check that it wasn't bad lighting or post-Thanksgiving excess weight that was to blame for how these made me look, but my older Icebreaker Bodyfit 200 leggings looked a lot better on me than these leggings did.I had to return them. I have decided to wait until next year's production, to see if they alter the cut of the waist area.1c. Bodyfit 260 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around ninety (discounted price around seventy-five).2012 Bodyfit 260 leggingsSize small.Fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 inches below the belly button. They had the same issues as the 2012 Bodyfit 200 leggings did - waistband too low, too loose, too wide, and quite unattractive in the belly region!I also had to return these. I hope next year's will be cut higher on the waist.2. EVERYDAY range2a. Skin 200 leggings (discontinued 2006) - the Skin range was probably similar to Everyday.2005 Skin 200 leggingsSize extra-small, yet are the largest I own - I could gain 15 pounds and they would still feel okay. But they fit me nicely when I'm at any weight - 10 pounds less or more than my present size - they are simply the coziest and softest that I own.Waistband comes to about 1 inch higher than belly button, feels secure.2b. Everyday 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around sixty (discounted price of around forty-five).2012 Everyday 200 leggingsTwo weeks ago, I bought them in size small which were too big, so I exchanged them for an extra-small. Even the extra-smalls had extra material in places on the legs, which is unusual because my legs are not toothpicks (this kind of legging is not supposed to be baggy, so the cut of these must have been off).Worse, the upper part of the extra-small leggings was cut strangely - the waistband was in a deep V, so that the middle was 3 inches below my belly-button (which is way too low for me), but the sides rose up 3 inches higher than that (it wasn't a curve, it was a visible V). Yet the waistband elastic wasn't tight enough, so the tall sides wanted to sag down and bunch up around my hips -- strange. (And that was not the way the smalls I tried on the week before had fit my waist area! In fact, I think the smalls of last week fit me better generally than the extra-smalls of this week.) I don't have the energy to go through the rigamarole of ordering a different pair of extra-smalls, but maybe I just got a bad apple.I had to return the extra-smalls.I was very disappointed because they were the 7th Icebreaker product I've tried in the last 2 weeks. This Icebreaker shopping quest has taken up a fair bit of my time lately, but I have nothing new to show for it. I've given up trying to get anything now and will wait a year and see how their 2013 production fits me.3. OTHER rangesTheir other legging types are more expensive than the Everyday and Bodyfit, and seem to be geared towards high-tech athletic use, or constructed to be worn on their own as pants/trousers. Some have Lycra in them. Check out Icebreaker's site for more info.--------------------------------OTHER TIPSThe other main retailers of this kind of product sometimes offer free shipping on their Amazon listings of an item but don't offer free shipping on the exact same item when sold through their own site (even when the price of the item itself is the same on both sites), so it can save you money if you pay attention to that.The best selection BY FAR is available from the manufacturer's site, but the prices there are generally higher. However, they have discounts from time to time, such as their ""Black Friday"" sale when they offer 30% off all items that are black in color (at least they have done so in prior years).Amazon sometimes calls the Icebreaker Bodyfit range ""BF"" and sometimes ""Bodyfit"", so if you are searching here for Icebreaker's Bodyfit range, do a separate search under each of the two search terms to get the most accurate results.In terms of merino wool socks, I prefer Smartwool socks over Icebreaker's. Sierratradingpost is one retailer which often carries a large selection of them at good prices. Those socks last a really long time. I wear them almost year-round because the lightweight ones breathe really well even when it's warm out.The Smartwool women's small size is the only sock I can find that truly fits my feet (which aren't even that small, all things considered!) without bunching up inside my shoes.If you have a smaller foot (size 7 or less) and are female, note that the Smartwool unisex socks in the small size are bigger than the smalls made just for women, even though that company's size guide says that both sizes are meant to fit the same range of women's shoe sizes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39N5GL0G0RM7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I53C1HY#wasThisHelpful","R39N5GL0G0RM7J","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having owned an Icebreaker zip-up jacket for many years, I have always wished I could have a vest version of it. This one looks ideal. This vest is one of those basic items that you can use autumn-winter-spring, and can throw into your suitcase on any kind of trip and end up using it more than you'd expected to.  (Unfortunately, they seem to cost as much as the jackets, despite the reduction in material!)I wear Icebreaker garments year-round, and really love the ones that I have. Since some listing descriptions for Icebreaker items offer few details about the products, making it difficult for the online customer to make an informed purchasing decision if he/she is unfamiliar with this brand of clothing, I thought I'd type out some general information about Icebreaker clothing and my personal impressions of it, based on my experience of their products from 2000 to early 2013.Note that my review is quite long and usually only the first half of it is shown on this page. If this happens on your screen and you wish to read the second half, all you have to do is press the ""read more"" button at the bottom of the review and Amazon will show you the rest of it. :-)----------------------OVERALL IMPRESSIONIcebreaker's marino wool items are generally made well, last a long time, are easy to care for, feel fantastic on the skin, are ""natural"", don't get smelly easily like polarfleece does, let the skin breathe, etc.Many of my Icebreaker items have been worn and washed several hundred times and are still holding up much better than would be expected.I am a BIG fan of this company's products. For my overall experience of them from around 2000-2010, I would give them a solid ""5 stars""!However, I regret to say that my opinion of the items I bought from Icebreaker in 2012 was not as high. In late 2012 I bought 7 different Icebreaker items (most of them in various sizes) and decided to return all of them because they were not as well-cut as the very ""same"" items that I bought in the 2000s (which I still have and wear, so I can make like-for-like comparisons easily).Based solely on my 2012 experience of Icebreaker products, I would give them 3 stars, meaning ""it's ok"". For me, this is not good enough to command prices of $50 - $100+ for quite simple items, even if the basic wool material itself is outstanding and long-lasting.For my star-rating on this review, I will average the ""5"" I give Icebreaker historically and the ""3"" that I would have given Icebreaker in 2012, and give them a ""4"" now.As of November 2013: Soon I plan to buy a few items from this year's production, which I hope will work out better for me.---------------------MY EXPERIENCE WITH ICEBREAKERI bought my first Icebreaker clothing about 13 years ago when I needed some long underwear for skiing.Up until about 6 years ago, I had been buying Icebreaker items very sparingly, due to the eye-watering prices at London UK sporting goods shops . Then, I discovered that Sierratradingpost sells various Icebreaker styles (usually discontinued items from years past) on their site for a discount. Fortunately, for a couple of years after I discovered this, they had a large selection of women's Icebreaker stuff, so I bought quite a few things for great prices. (These days, Sierra's Icebreaker selection for women appears to be smaller, and the prices comparatively higher, than before. I expect that there are more discounters they have to compete with now, to get that kind of stock.)In addition to bricks-and-mortar sports shops and Sierratradingpost, I have also bought Icebreaker items from several sporting goods online retailers, Amazon, and the Icebreaker website.I still have almost every Icebreaker item I've bought. Even the discounted items have been somewhat pricey, but the quality and longevity were worth the initial investment.----------------------CAVEATWhat I have written below is based on my current knowledge about their products, but it is possible that I have misunderstood some aspects of the brand.If you wish to better understand their product offerings, I would absolutely recommend that you have a look at the Icebreaker official site to view their entire range and gain more clarity about what items are for what purposes, what the wool weights are about, what the quality levels of the different clothing collections are, etc.(Unfortunately, their website, while snazzy, does not fully explain these things, leaving it up to the customer to piece some of the puzzle together.)----------------------ICEBREAKER WOOL WEIGHTS:Icebreaker's marino wool items generally come in four weights of fabric: 150, 200, 260, or 320. This is ""grams per square meter"".150 is quite thin.It provides light warmth.The material is generally see-through. (I wouldn't wear items of this weight out and about in public without anything over them, but some reviewers have said that they do.)It's good for a first base layer, for strenuous exercise, or for sleeping in.Their items of this weight, especially in the ranges intended for athletic use, tend to be really form-fitting in one's typical size.All Icebreaker material seems VERY resilient and long-lasting to me, but because the 150 wool weight is pretty thin, it is the likeliest to be torn, develop holes, get ""runs"" (like pantyhose). I don't think this happens too much with it, but I've seen some reviewers mention it (most often talking about how they accidentally poked holes in it with long fingernails), and three of my 150-weight leggings have developed runs in them after several years of heavy use.200 is slightly thicker, but still on the thin side.It's pretty warm.The lighter colors are definitely see-through, such as grey and cream. My older black and brown items made out of 200 weight wool don't seem to be see-through, but some of the newer dark-colored ones might be.It's good for a base layer or mid-weight layer, for exercise, and sleeping in.Especially in the ranges intended for athletic situations, their items of this weight tend to be form-fitting in one's typical size.260 is on the thicker side.It's definitely warm, a cozy weight.None of my 260 items are see-through. I can wear tops made out of this weight on their own (without anything over them) and not worry that my underwear or too many lumps&bumps will show through.It's good for a mid-layer or top-layer, and sleeping in (if you get cold at night, like I do).Items of this weight tend to fit looser than items of the same size in the 150/200 weights do. This may have something to do with how much naturally-stretchier the thicker fabric is, but it also seems that they cut these 260-weight items bigger because this weight is often worn as a top-layer or middle-layer, instead of as a base-layer.I like this weight the best. I think that the company says that this is their most popular weight across the board.320 is thickest, of course.It is quite warm, very toasty and sturdy.This weight is generally a top-layer, so items made out of this material are relatively loosely-cut.--------------------------ICEBREAKER LINES / RANGES / ""COLLECTIONS"" OF CLOTHING:Icebreaker makes different ranges - some intended for wearing as normal underwear (like panties and sports bras and tank tops), some intended for wearing as thermal/long underwear, some intended for wearing as everyday clothing, and some intended for wearing as athletic wear.Even though at first glance most of their items appear VERY similar to each other, there are different feelings to the fabrics (even in fabrics of the same wool weight), different quality levels, different cuts, and different design details amongst these different lines, so it is good to check their website about the particular Icebreaker item you are thinking of buying to make sure that it is intended for the activity you want it for.Two of the popular ranges at the lower end of the Icebreaker price scale are:BodyfitThe Bodyfit range seems to be for athletic situations, but also casual-wear and sleeping-in. The knit of this range's wool is usually flatter and less stretchy than the knit of the ranges that are for underwear or purely casual wear. Items in this range are usually cut to fit relatively snugly.EverydayThis range is made of a looser, thicker, stretchier knit than the Bodyfit, and is more for general sleeping-in and casual long-underwear needs, not so much for athletic situations. (However, I'm sure that they would be okay in many athletic situations, and I have worn them skiing and hiking.) Everyday items tend to be made of a stretchier knit and cut to fit more loosely than the Bodyfit items. I wear a size below my ordinary size in this range.Other rangesTheir other ranges appear to include: Black Sheep Collection, RealFleece Collection, Pure Plus Collection, Journeys Travel Collection, Premium Underwear Collection, GT Technical Sports Collection, GT Bike Collection, Technical Base Layers Collection, and Technical Mid Layers Collection. Please see the Icebreaker site for more information on their ranges.Frankly, I feel that they've made this aspect of their brand over-complicated and too confusing for the average customer, and I have not been able to locate any overview of the various collections on their site or on their product packaging materials.-----------------------ICEBREAKER COLORS:Icebreaker tends to make most items in black, as their basic universal color.Many items are offered in about 2 to 8 other colors, as well. There is often some version of blue, red, grey, and green - sometimes a pink, sometimes a brown or purple, etc. Often the colors are skewed towards the cool end of the spectrum (which I notice because my coloring is on the warm end of the spectrum and cool tones look awful on me).The different weights of wool and/or different ranges (e.g., Bodyfit, Everyday, Journeys Travel Collection, etc.) will tend to have their own mini-set of color options. (For example, the current grey color in the 200 Bodyfit is a medium-grey and is called ""blizzard"" and the current grey color in the 260 Bodyfit is a dark-grey and called ""metro"", and they don't offer those particular colors in other weights of wool or other ranges, as far as I know.)They change their colors every year or so (I think), and some colors tend to sell out mid-way through a season and are not restocked, so if you see an item in a color that you love, or there is a matching set (of long underwear or something) and you want both pieces in the same color, you probably should get it at the time, because it's not guaranteed that it will be available in the future.---------------------EXTRA DESIGN FLOURISHES:A couple of their ranges, mainly the more athletic lines, feature ""pops"" of contrasting color in a certain part of the garment, such as a stripe running down the sleeves or down the sides, or a triangle of bright material at the ankle. Most internet retailers' photographs of the garments do show these features because the areas of differing colors are pretty obvious, but it pays to read the item descriptions (and check out the manufacturer's site for confirmation) if this kind of thing is not what you are looking for.In a couple of their clothing ranges, mainly the underwear, 150-weight, and casual-wear lines, some of the tops and bottoms have printed patterns (like floral motifs or abstract swirls - sometimes in contrasting colors) on the sleeves or in the hip-region. This *can* escape your notice when the only images of the item you have available to you are the tiny product photographs that most internet retailers provide, so do double-check the customer reviews of the item, and maybe the Icebreaker site's own full description of the item, if you want to know for sure if the item comes with a printed pattern on a section of it.---------------------ICEBREAKER SIZING:Sizing and fit are so variable from person to person and from brand to brand, but in case it may help, I'll talk about my experiences with Icebreaker clothing.For reference, generally I am usually a women's size 4 or 6 in US sizing, a women's size 8 or 10 in UK sizing, and a small when it comes to small/medium/large sizing. This goes for both tops and bottoms.---Sizing of TopsAlmost all of my Icebreaker tops from the last 13 years -- crew tops, long-underwear tops, turtlenecks, and zip-up jackets -- are women's size small.The only tops I have in size extra-small are from the Skin range (which they phased out in 2006, but the sizing and type of material used for the Skin range appear to be very similar to those of the current range called Everyday).Generally, I know that an Icebreaker small top is probably going to fit me.The main issue that I've had with their tops is sleeve length (too long). This is not uncommon for me, because I do have arms that are on the petite side: most suit jackets I buy have to be shortened a little in the sleeves, and I often have to turn up sweaters one turn at the cuff. And one feature of some Icebreaker tops is a thumb loop which necessitates that the sleeves are meant to be about three inches longer than the wrist - I understand this, and just roll those tops up a turn or two. However, I've read quite a few reviewers' comments that mention that Icebreaker sleeves tend to be long, and I do think that their sleeves are longer than normal. [""Normal"" being subjective, of course! ...the only women I've met from New Zealand actually did happen to be tall, lithe, and willowy, so maybe that's normal there. :-) ] Last week, I bought a 2012-made Icebreaker ""Oasis"" top in a size small, and while it was too tight in the chest area (which is normally NOT a problem for me with Icebreaker), the sleeves were a crazy four or five inches past my wrist, even though they didn't have thumb holes and therefore were meant to end at the wrist. I had to return it.---Sizing of Leggings:I have run into inconsistency in Icebreaker legging sizes. I have some in extra-small, some in small, and some in medium. (And in one 2012 collection, the extra-smalls are a little too big for me but there isn't a smaller size to go to.)I have not found Icebreaker's official sizing chart (available on their site) to be terribly accurate for leggings.For the leggings, it seems to me that one must experiment in each Icebreaker clothing range and wool weight to discover the best size and fit for oneself.I will spell out below the ones that I have tried. Because the sizing of the ""same"" leggings sometimes has varied across the years, I will mention what year I got them.1. BODYFIT range1a. Bodyfit 150 leggings2006 or 2007 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize medium.

"I wear Icebreaker garments year-round, and really love the ones that I have.  Their Oasis range of items, however, is not my favorite of their ranges.  I find that they are too long in the sleeves and too tight in the bust for me -- they would probably suit women who have longish arms and a small-to-medium bust area.  When it is fully zipped up, the mock-turtleneck area in this top is a little too tight around the neck for my comfort.Since some listing descriptions for Icebreaker items offer few details about the products, making it difficult for the online customer to make an informed purchasing decision if he/she is unfamiliar with this brand of clothing, I thought I'd type out some general information about Icebreaker clothing and my personal impressions of it, based on my experience of their products from 2000 to early 2013.Note that my review is quite long and usually only the first half of it is shown on this page.

For me, this is not good enough to command prices of $50 - $100+ for quite simple items, even if the basic wool material itself is outstanding and long-lasting.For my star-rating on this review, I will average the ""5"" I give Icebreaker historically and the ""3"" that I would have given Icebreaker in 2012, and give them a ""4"" now.As of November 2013: Soon I plan to buy a few items from this year's production, which I hope will work out better for me.---------------------MY EXPERIENCE WITH ICEBREAKERI bought my first Icebreaker clothing about 13 years ago when I needed some long underwear for skiing.Up until about 6 years ago, I had been buying Icebreaker items very sparingly, due to the eye-watering prices at London UK sporting goods shops . Then, I discovered that Sierratradingpost sells various Icebreaker styles (usually discontinued items from years past) on their site for a discount. Fortunately, for a couple of years after I discovered this, they had a large selection of women's Icebreaker stuff, so I bought quite a few things for great prices. (These days, Sierra's Icebreaker selection for women appears to be smaller, and the prices comparatively higher, than before. I expect that there are more discounters they have to compete with now, to get that kind of stock.)In addition to bricks-and-mortar sports shops and Sierratradingpost, I have also bought Icebreaker items from several sporting goods online retailers, Amazon, and the Icebreaker website.I still have almost every Icebreaker item I've bought. Even the discounted items have been somewhat pricey, but the quality and longevity were worth the initial investment.----------------------CAVEATWhat I have written below is based on my current knowledge about their products, but it is possible that I have misunderstood some aspects of the brand.If you wish to better understand their product offerings, I would absolutely recommend that you have a look at the Icebreaker official site to view their entire range and gain more clarity about what items are for what purposes, what the wool weights are about, what the quality levels of the different clothing collections are, etc.(Unfortunately, their website, while snazzy, does not fully explain these things, leaving it up to the customer to piece some of the puzzle together.)----------------------ICEBREAKER WOOL WEIGHTS:Icebreaker's marino wool items generally come in four weights of fabric: 150, 200, 260, or 320. This is ""grams per square meter"".150 is quite thin.It provides light warmth.The material is generally see-through. (I wouldn't wear items of this weight out and about in public without anything over them, but some reviewers have said that they do.)It's good for a first base layer, for strenuous exercise, or for sleeping in.Their items of this weight, especially in the ranges intended for athletic use, tend to be really form-fitting in one's typical size.All Icebreaker material seems VERY resilient and long-lasting to me, but because the 150 wool weight is pretty thin, it is the likeliest to be torn, develop holes, get ""runs"" (like pantyhose). I don't think this happens too much with it, but I've seen some reviewers mention it (most often talking about how they accidentally poked holes in it with long fingernails), and three of my 150-weight leggings have developed runs in them after several years of heavy use.200 is slightly thicker, but still on the thin side.It's pretty warm.The lighter colors are definitely see-through, such as grey and cream. My older black and brown items made out of 200 weight wool don't seem to be see-through, but some of the newer dark-colored ones might be.It's good for a base layer or mid-weight layer, for exercise, and sleeping in.Especially in the ranges intended for athletic situations, their items of this weight tend to be form-fitting in one's typical size.260 is on the thicker side.It's definitely warm, a cozy weight.None of my 260 items are see-through. I can wear tops made out of this weight on their own (without anything over them) and not worry that my underwear or too many lumps&bumps will show through.It's good for a mid-layer or top-layer, and sleeping in (if you get cold at night, like I do).Items of this weight tend to fit looser than items of the same size in the 150/200 weights do. This may have something to do with how much naturally-stretchier the thicker fabric is, but it also seems that they cut these 260-weight items bigger because this weight is often worn as a top-layer or middle-layer, instead of as a base-layer.I like this weight the best. I think that the company says that this is their most popular weight across the board.320 is thickest, of course.It is quite warm, very toasty and sturdy.This weight is generally a top-layer, so items made out of this material are relatively loosely-cut.--------------------------ICEBREAKER LINES / RANGES / ""COLLECTIONS"" OF CLOTHING:Icebreaker makes different ranges - some intended for wearing as normal underwear (like panties and sports bras and tank tops), some intended for wearing as thermal/long underwear, some intended for wearing as everyday clothing, and some intended for wearing as athletic wear.Even though at first glance most of their items appear VERY similar to each other, there are different feelings to the fabrics (even in fabrics of the same wool weight), different quality levels, different cuts, and different design details amongst these different lines, so it is good to check their website about the particular Icebreaker item you are thinking of buying to make sure that it is intended for the activity you want it for.Two of the popular ranges at the lower end of the Icebreaker price scale are:BodyfitThe Bodyfit range seems to be for athletic situations, but also casual-wear and sleeping-in. The knit of this range's wool is usually flatter and less stretchy than the knit of the ranges that are for underwear or purely casual wear. Items in this range are usually cut to fit relatively snugly.EverydayThis range is made of a looser, thicker, stretchier knit than the Bodyfit, and is more for general sleeping-in and casual long-underwear needs, not so much for athletic situations. (However, I'm sure that they would be okay in many athletic situations, and I have worn them skiing and hiking.) Everyday items tend to be made of a stretchier knit and cut to fit more loosely than the Bodyfit items. I wear a size below my ordinary size in this range.Other rangesTheir other ranges appear to include: Black Sheep Collection, RealFleece Collection, Pure Plus Collection, Journeys Travel Collection, Premium Underwear Collection, GT Technical Sports Collection, GT Bike Collection, Technical Base Layers Collection, and Technical Mid Layers Collection. Please see the Icebreaker site for more information on their ranges.Frankly, I feel that they've made this aspect of their brand over-complicated and too confusing for the average customer, and I have not been able to locate any overview of the various collections on their site or on their product packaging materials.-----------------------ICEBREAKER COLORS:Icebreaker tends to make most items in black, as their basic universal color.Many items are offered in about 2 to 8 other colors, as well. There is often some version of blue, red, grey, and green - sometimes a pink, sometimes a brown or purple, etc. Often the colors are skewed towards the cool end of the spectrum (which I notice because my coloring is on the warm end of the spectrum and cool tones look awful on me).The different weights of wool and/or different ranges (e.g., Bodyfit, Everyday, Journeys Travel Collection, etc.) will tend to have their own mini-set of color options. (For example, the current grey color in the 200 Bodyfit is a medium-grey and is called ""blizzard"" and the current grey color in the 260 Bodyfit is a dark-grey and called ""metro"", and they don't offer those particular colors in other weights of wool or other ranges, as far as I know.)They change their colors every year or so (I think), and some colors tend to sell out mid-way through a season and are not restocked, so if you see an item in a color that you love, or there is a matching set (of long underwear or something) and you want both pieces in the same color, you probably should get it at the time, because it's not guaranteed that it will be available in the future.---------------------EXTRA DESIGN FLOURISHES:A couple of their ranges, mainly the more athletic lines, feature ""pops"" of contrasting color in a certain part of the garment, such as a stripe running down the sleeves or down the sides, or a triangle of bright material at the ankle. Most internet retailers' photographs of the garments do show these features because the areas of differing colors are pretty obvious, but it pays to read the item descriptions (and check out the manufacturer's site for confirmation) if this kind of thing is not what you are looking for.In a couple of their clothing ranges, mainly the underwear, 150-weight, and casual-wear lines, some of the tops and bottoms have printed patterns (like floral motifs or abstract swirls - sometimes in contrasting colors) on the sleeves or in the hip-region. This *can* escape your notice when the only images of the item you have available to you are the tiny product photographs that most internet retailers provide, so do double-check the customer reviews of the item, and maybe the Icebreaker site's own full description of the item, if you want to know for sure if the item comes with a printed pattern on a section of it.---------------------ICEBREAKER SIZING:Sizing and fit are so variable from person to person and from brand to brand, but in case it may help, I'll talk about my experiences with Icebreaker clothing.For reference, generally I am usually a women's size 4 or 6 in US sizing, a women's size 8 or 10 in UK sizing, and a small when it comes to small/medium/large sizing. This goes for both tops and bottoms.---Sizing of TopsAlmost all of my Icebreaker tops from the last 13 years -- crew tops, long-underwear tops, turtlenecks, and zip-up jackets -- are women's size small.The only tops I have in size extra-small are from the Skin range (which they phased out in 2006, but the sizing and type of material used for the Skin range appear to be very similar to those of the current range called Everyday).Generally, I know that an Icebreaker small top is probably going to fit me.The main issue that I've had with their tops is sleeve length (too long). This is not uncommon for me, because I do have arms that are on the petite side: most suit jackets I buy have to be shortened a little in the sleeves, and I often have to turn up sweaters one turn at the cuff. And one feature of some Icebreaker tops is a thumb loop which necessitates that the sleeves are meant to be about three inches longer than the wrist - I understand this, and just roll those tops up a turn or two. However, I've read quite a few reviewers' comments that mention that Icebreaker sleeves tend to be long, and I do think that their sleeves are longer than normal. [""Normal"" being subjective, of course! ...the only women I've met from New Zealand actually did happen to be tall, lithe, and willowy, so maybe that's normal there. :-) ] Last week, I bought a 2012-made Icebreaker ""Oasis"" top in a size small, and while it was too tight in the chest area (which is normally NOT a problem for me with Icebreaker), the sleeves were a crazy four or five inches past my wrist, even though they didn't have thumb holes and therefore were meant to end at the wrist. I had to return it.---Sizing of Leggings:I have run into inconsistency in Icebreaker legging sizes. I have some in extra-small, some in small, and some in medium. (And in one 2012 collection, the extra-smalls are a little too big for me but there isn't a smaller size to go to.)I have not found Icebreaker's official sizing chart (available on their site) to be terribly accurate for leggings.For the leggings, it seems to me that one must experiment in each Icebreaker clothing range and wool weight to discover the best size and fit for oneself.I will spell out below the ones that I have tried. Because the sizing of the ""same"" leggings sometimes has varied across the years, I will mention what year I got them.1. BODYFIT range1a. Bodyfit 150 leggings2006 or 2007 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize medium. The label says ""slim fit"" (possibly back then they had different ""fits"" within the Bodyfit range, but they don't seem to now).Fit me snugly, but well.Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2008 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize small.Are a bit too small for me this winter - they fit me when I'm about 5-to-8 pounds less than I am at the moment.Waistband hits 1 inch below the belly button, feels okay.2012 Bodyfit 150 leggingsI decided not to buy new 150-weight leggings in 2012 because after a few years of heavy use, my old Bodyfit 150 leggings developed some un-mendable ""runs""/""ladders"". I still wear them and love them, but they are slowly self-destructing. It is comparatively easy to snag them on a rough surface or to poke a fingernail through them when pulling them on or off.Actually, I've just looked on the Icebreaker site (December 2012) and they don't list ANY Bodyfit 150 leggings. The only 150 weight leggings they list are the ""Sprite"" leggings from the Premium Underwear Collection. Also, I think that the ""Nature"" leggings (which are a discontinued style) were of 150 weight, and I have seen these still on sale on a few websites.1b. Bodyfit 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around eighty (discounted price of around sixty).2008 Bodyfit 200 leggingsSize medium.Fit me, and there is extra room in them - I probably could go up 5 to 8 pounds and they would still fit. When I purchased those mediums, I tried on the small size and found it to be way too small, especially along the tight and narrow waistband that these leggings were made with at the time. (I think it was a reaction to the consumer response to that waistband that they made the newer waistbands really wide and soft.)Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2012 Bodyfit 200 leggingsAt first, based on the Icebreaker official size chart, I ordered a medium in these. They were too big, so I exchanged them for a size small.The small fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 or even 3 inches below the belly button. This is a more ""modern"" position for a waistband, of course, compared to coming up to the true waist, but I prefer ""athletic"" base layers to cover my entire body - neck to ankle, to enable the base layer shirts to be securely tucked inside the base layer pants, and to feel really secure when I'm moving around -- but this waistband was so low on me, and so wide and stretchy that it felt like it was about to slide down to my hips at any moment because the elastic wasn't very tight.Not only from the practical side was this low waistband a problem, but MAN, the whole cut of the upper part of these leggings seemed to be designed to make my tummy area look as flabby and unattractive as possible! I tried my old leggings on when I took these off -- just to check that it wasn't bad lighting or post-Thanksgiving excess weight that was to blame for how these made me look, but my older Icebreaker Bodyfit 200 leggings looked a lot better on me than these leggings did.I had to return them. I have decided to wait until next year's production, to see if they alter the cut of the waist area.1c. Bodyfit 260 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around ninety (discounted price around seventy-five).2012 Bodyfit 260 leggingsSize small.Fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 inches below the belly button. They had the same issues as the 2012 Bodyfit 200 leggings did - waistband too low, too loose, too wide, and quite unattractive in the belly region!I also had to return these. I hope next year's will be cut higher on the waist.2. EVERYDAY range2a. Skin 200 leggings (discontinued 2006) - the Skin range was probably similar to Everyday.2005 Skin 200 leggingsSize extra-small, yet are the largest I own - I could gain 15 pounds and they would still feel okay. But they fit me nicely when I'm at any weight - 10 pounds less or more than my present size - they are simply the coziest and softest that I own.Waistband comes to about 1 inch higher than belly button, feels secure.2b. Everyday 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around sixty (discounted price of around forty-five).2012 Everyday 200 leggingsTwo weeks ago, I bought them in size small which were too big, so I exchanged them for an extra-small. Even the extra-smalls had extra material in places on the legs, which is unusual because my legs are not toothpicks (this kind of legging is not supposed to be baggy, so the cut of these must have been off).Worse, the upper part of the extra-small leggings was cut strangely - the waistband was in a deep V, so that the middle was 3 inches below my belly-button (which is way too low for me), but the sides rose up 3 inches higher than that (it wasn't a curve, it was a visible V). Yet the waistband elastic wasn't tight enough, so the tall sides wanted to sag down and bunch up around my hips -- strange. (And that was not the way the smalls I tried on the week before had fit my waist area! In fact, I think the smalls of last week fit me better generally than the extra-smalls of this week.) I don't have the energy to go through the rigamarole of ordering a different pair of extra-smalls, but maybe I just got a bad apple.I had to return the extra-smalls.I was very disappointed because they were the 7th Icebreaker product I've tried in the last 2 weeks. This Icebreaker shopping quest has taken up a fair bit of my time lately, but I have nothing new to show for it. I've given up trying to get anything now and will wait a year and see how their 2013 production fits me.3. OTHER rangesTheir other legging types are more expensive than the Everyday and Bodyfit, and seem to be geared towards high-tech athletic use, or constructed to be worn on their own as pants/trousers. Some have Lycra in them. Check out Icebreaker's site for more info.--------------------------------OTHER TIPSThe other main retailers of this kind of product sometimes offer free shipping on their Amazon listings of an item but don't offer free shipping on the exact same item when sold through their own site (even when the price of the item itself is the same on both sites), so it can save you money if you pay attention to that.The best selection BY FAR is available from the manufacturer's site, but the prices there are generally higher. However, they have discounts from time to time, such as their ""Black Friday"" sale when they offer 30% off all items that are black in color (at least they have done so in prior years).Amazon sometimes calls the Icebreaker Bodyfit range ""BF"" and sometimes ""Bodyfit"", so if you are searching here for Icebreaker's Bodyfit range, do a separate search under each of the two search terms to get the most accurate results.In terms of merino wool socks, I prefer Smartwool socks over Icebreaker's. Sierratradingpost is one retailer which often carries a large selection of them at good prices. Those socks last a really long time. I wear them almost year-round because the lightweight ones breathe really well even when it's warm out.The Smartwool women's small size is the only sock I can find that truly fits my feet (which aren't even that small, all things considered!) without bunching up inside my shoes.If you have a smaller foot (size 7 or less) and are female, note that the Smartwool unisex socks in the small size are bigger than the smalls made just for women, even though that company's size guide says that both sizes are meant to fit the same range of women's shoe size.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7EEZ0WE6I68C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I538WH2#wasThisHelpful","R7EEZ0WE6I68C","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Oasis Long Sleeve Top by Icebreaker appears to only come with a bold pattern in/on the material.  Icebreaker also makes a version of this top that is solid-colored -- and they offer it in a multitude of colors.  (I would expect the two versions to be pretty similar in other ways, so if you would like to read some customer reviews on that version of the top, check out Amazon's main listing page for: ""Icebreaker Women's Oasis Long Sleeve Crewe Top"", where there are over 40 reviews.)I wear Icebreaker garments year-round, and really love the ones that I have. Since some listing descriptions for Icebreaker items offer few details about the products, making it difficult for the online customer to make an informed purchasing decision if he/she is unfamiliar with this brand of clothing, I thought I'd type out some general information about Icebreaker clothing and my personal impressions of it, based on my experience of their products from 2000 to early 2013.Note that my review is quite long and usually only the first half of it is shown on this page. If this happens on your screen and you wish to read the second half, all you have to do is press the ""read more"" button at the bottom of the review and Amazon will show you the rest of it. :-)----------------------OVERALL IMPRESSIONIcebreaker's marino wool items are generally made well, last a long time, are easy to care for, feel fantastic on the skin, are ""natural"", don't get smelly easily like polarfleece does, let the skin breathe, etc.Many of my Icebreaker items have been worn and washed several hundred times and are still holding up much better than would be expected.I am a BIG fan of this company's products. For my overall experience of them from around 2000-2010, I would give them a solid ""5 stars""!However, I regret to say that my opinion of the items I bought from Icebreaker in 2012 was not as high.

[""Normal"" being subjective, of course! ...the only women I've met from New Zealand actually did happen to be tall, lithe, and willowy, so maybe that's normal there. :-) ] Last week, I bought a 2012-made Icebreaker ""Oasis"" top in a size small, and while it was too tight in the chest area (which is normally NOT a problem for me with Icebreaker), the sleeves were a crazy four or five inches past my wrist, even though they didn't have thumb holes and therefore were meant to end at the wrist. I had to return it.---Sizing of Leggings:I have run into inconsistency in Icebreaker legging sizes. I have some in extra-small, some in small, and some in medium. (And in one 2012 collection, the extra-smalls are a little too big for me but there isn't a smaller size to go to.)I have not found Icebreaker's official sizing chart (available on their site) to be terribly accurate for leggings.For the leggings, it seems to me that one must experiment in each Icebreaker clothing range and wool weight to discover the best size and fit for oneself.I will spell out below the ones that I have tried. Because the sizing of the ""same"" leggings sometimes has varied across the years, I will mention what year I got them.1. BODYFIT range1a. Bodyfit 150 leggings2006 or 2007 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize medium. The label says ""slim fit"" (possibly back then they had different ""fits"" within the Bodyfit range, but they don't seem to now).Fit me snugly, but well.Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2008 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize small.Are a bit too small for me this winter - they fit me when I'm about 5-to-8 pounds less than I am at the moment.Waistband hits 1 inch below the belly button, feels okay.2012 Bodyfit 150 leggingsI decided not to buy new 150-weight leggings in 2012 because after a few years of heavy use, my old Bodyfit 150 leggings developed some un-mendable ""runs""/""ladders"". I still wear them and love them, but they are slowly self-destructing. It is comparatively easy to snag them on a rough surface or to poke a fingernail through them when pulling them on or off.Actually, I've just looked on the Icebreaker site (December 2012) and they don't list ANY Bodyfit 150 leggings. The only 150 weight leggings they list are the ""Sprite"" leggings from the Premium Underwear Collection. Also, I think that the ""Nature"" leggings (which are a discontinued style) were of 150 weight, and I have seen these still on sale on a few websites.1b. Bodyfit 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around eighty (discounted price of around sixty).2008 Bodyfit 200 leggingsSize medium.Fit me, and there is extra room in them - I probably could go up 5 to 8 pounds and they would still fit. When I purchased those mediums, I tried on the small size and found it to be way too small, especially along the tight and narrow waistband that these leggings were made with at the time. (I think it was a reaction to the consumer response to that waistband that they made the newer waistbands really wide and soft.)Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2012 Bodyfit 200 leggingsAt first, based on the Icebreaker official size chart, I ordered a medium in these. They were too big, so I exchanged them for a size small.The small fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 or even 3 inches below the belly button. This is a more ""modern"" position for a waistband, of course, compared to coming up to the true waist, but I prefer ""athletic"" base layers to cover my entire body - neck to ankle, to enable the base layer shirts to be securely tucked inside the base layer pants, and to feel really secure when I'm moving around -- but this waistband was so low on me, and so wide and stretchy that it felt like it was about to slide down to my hips at any moment because the elastic wasn't very tight.Not only from the practical side was this low waistband a problem, but MAN, the whole cut of the upper part of these leggings seemed to be designed to make my tummy area look as flabby and unattractive as possible! I tried my old leggings on when I took these off -- just to check that it wasn't bad lighting or post-Thanksgiving excess weight that was to blame for how these made me look, but my older Icebreaker Bodyfit 200 leggings looked a lot better on me than these leggings did.I had to return them. I have decided to wait until next year's production, to see if they alter the cut of the waist area.1c. Bodyfit 260 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around ninety (discounted price around seventy-five).2012 Bodyfit 260 leggingsSize small.Fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 inches below the belly button. They had the same issues as the 2012 Bodyfit 200 leggings did - waistband too low, too loose, too wide, and quite unattractive in the belly region!I also had to return these. I hope next year's will be cut higher on the waist.2. EVERYDAY range2a. Skin 200 leggings (discontinued 2006) - the Skin range was probably similar to Everyday.2005 Skin 200 leggingsSize extra-small, yet are the largest I own - I could gain 15 pounds and they would still feel okay. But they fit me nicely when I'm at any weight - 10 pounds less or more than my present size - they are simply the coziest and softest that I own.Waistband comes to about 1 inch higher than belly button, feels secure.2b. Everyday 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around sixty (discounted price of around forty-five).2012 Everyday 200 leggingsTwo weeks ago, I bought them in size small which were too big, so I exchanged them for an extra-small. Even the extra-smalls had extra material in places on the legs, which is unusual because my legs are not toothpicks (this kind of legging is not supposed to be baggy, so the cut of these must have been off).Worse, the upper part of the extra-small leggings was cut strangely - the waistband was in a deep V, so that the middle was 3 inches below my belly-button (which is way too low for me), but the sides rose up 3 inches higher than that (it wasn't a curve, it was a visible V). Yet the waistband elastic wasn't tight enough, so the tall sides wanted to sag down and bunch up around my hips -- strange. (And that was not the way the smalls I tried on the week before had fit my waist area! In fact, I think the smalls of last week fit me better generally than the extra-smalls of this week.) I don't have the energy to go through the rigamarole of ordering a different pair of extra-smalls, but maybe I just got a bad apple.I had to return the extra-smalls.I was very disappointed because they were the 7th Icebreaker product I've tried in the last 2 weeks. This Icebreaker shopping quest has taken up a fair bit of my time lately, but I have nothing new to show for it. I've given up trying to get anything now and will wait a year and see how their 2013 production fits me.3. OTHER rangesTheir other legging types are more expensive than the Everyday and Bodyfit, and seem to be geared towards high-tech athletic use, or constructed to be worn on their own as pants/trousers. Some have Lycra in them. Check out Icebreaker's site for more info.--------------------------------OTHER TIPSThe other main retailers of this kind of product sometimes offer free shipping on their Amazon listings of an item but don't offer free shipping on the exact same item when sold through their own site (even when the price of the item itself is the same on both sites), so it can save you money if you pay attention to that.The best selection BY FAR is available from the manufacturer's site, but the prices there are generally higher. However, they have discounts from time to time, such as their ""Black Friday"" sale when they offer 30% off all items that are black in color (at least they have done so in prior years).Amazon sometimes calls the Icebreaker Bodyfit range ""BF"" and sometimes ""Bodyfit"", so if you are searching here for Icebreaker's Bodyfit range, do a separate search under each of the two search terms to get the most accurate results.In terms of merino wool socks, I prefer Smartwool socks over Icebreaker's. Sierratradingpost is one retailer which often carries a large selection of them at good prices. Those socks last a really long time. I wear them almost year-round because the lightweight ones breathe really well even when it's warm out.The Smartwool women's small size is the only sock I can find that truly fits my feet (which aren't even that small, all things considered!) without bunching up inside my shoes.If you have a smaller foot (size 7 or less) and are female, note that the Smartwool unisex socks in the small size are bigger than the smalls made just for women, even though that company's size guide says that both sizes are meant to fit the same range of women's shoe size.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YZGS8KWM44JN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AFQ94KQ#wasThisHelpful","R2YZGS8KWM44JN","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This v-neck version of the Oasis top might be a recent addition to their line-up - it is the first time I've seen it.  If you would like to read some customer reviews on the crew-neck version of this top, there are many reviews on Amazon's main listing page for:  ""Icebreaker Women's Oasis Long Sleeve Crewe Top"".I wear Icebreaker garments year-round, and really love the ones that I have. Since some listing descriptions for Icebreaker items offer few details about the products, making it difficult for the online customer to make an informed purchasing decision if he/she is unfamiliar with this brand of clothing, I thought I'd type out some general information about Icebreaker clothing and my personal impressions of it, based on my experience of their products from 2000 to early 2013.Note that my review is quite long and usually only the first half of it is shown on this page. If this happens on your screen and you wish to read the second half, all you have to do is press the ""read more"" button at the bottom of the review and Amazon will show you the rest of it. :-)----------------------OVERALL IMPRESSIONIcebreaker's marino wool items are generally made well, last a long time, are easy to care for, feel fantastic on the skin, are ""natural"", don't get smelly easily like polarfleece does, let the skin breathe, etc.Many of my Icebreaker items have been worn and washed several hundred times and are still holding up much better than would be expected.I am a BIG fan of this company's products. For my overall experience of them from around 2000-2010, I would give them a solid ""5 stars""!However, I regret to say that my opinion of the items I bought from Icebreaker in 2012 was not as high. In late 2012 I bought 7 different Icebreaker items (most of them in various sizes) and decided to return all of them because they were not as well-cut as the very ""same"" items that I bought in the 2000s (which I still have and wear, so I can make like-for-like comparisons easily).Based solely on my 2012 experience of Icebreaker products, I would give them 3 stars, meaning ""it's ok"". For me, this is not good enough to command prices of $50 - $100+ for quite simple items, even if the basic wool material itself is outstanding and long-lasting.For my star-rating on this review, I will average the ""5"" I give Icebreaker historically and the ""3"" that I would have given Icebreaker in 2012, and give them a ""4"" now.As of November 2013: Soon I plan to buy a few items from this year's production, which I hope will work out better for me.---------------------MY EXPERIENCE WITH ICEBREAKERI bought my first Icebreaker clothing about 13 years ago when I needed some long underwear for skiing.Up until about 6 years ago, I had been buying Icebreaker items very sparingly, due to the eye-watering prices at London UK sporting goods shops . Then, I discovered that Sierratradingpost sells various Icebreaker styles (usually discontinued items from years past) on their site for a discount. Fortunately, for a couple of years after I discovered this, they had a large selection of women's Icebreaker stuff, so I bought quite a few things for great prices. (These days, Sierra's Icebreaker selection for women appears to be smaller, and the prices comparatively higher, than before. I expect that there are more discounters they have to compete with now, to get that kind of stock.)In addition to bricks-and-mortar sports shops and Sierratradingpost, I have also bought Icebreaker items from several sporting goods online retailers, Amazon, and the Icebreaker website.I still have almost every Icebreaker item I've bought. Even the discounted items have been somewhat pricey, but the quality and longevity were worth the initial investment.----------------------CAVEATWhat I have written below is based on my current knowledge about their products, but it is possible that I have misunderstood some aspects of the brand.If you wish to better understand their product offerings, I would absolutely recommend that you have a look at the Icebreaker official site to view their entire range and gain more clarity about what items are for what purposes, what the wool weights are about, what the quality levels of the different clothing collections are, etc.(Unfortunately, their website, while snazzy, does not fully explain these things, leaving it up to the customer to piece some of the puzzle together.)----------------------ICEBREAKER WOOL WEIGHTS:Icebreaker's marino wool items generally come in four weights of fabric: 150, 200, 260, or 320. This is ""grams per square meter"".150 is quite thin.It provides light warmth.The material is generally see-through. (I wouldn't wear items of this weight out and about in public without anything over them, but some reviewers have said that they do.)It's good for a first base layer, for strenuous exercise, or for sleeping in.Their items of this weight, especially in the ranges intended for athletic use, tend to be really form-fitting in one's typical size.All Icebreaker material seems VERY resilient and long-lasting to me, but because the 150 wool weight is pretty thin, it is the likeliest to be torn, develop holes, get ""runs"" (like pantyhose). I don't think this happens too much with it, but I've seen some reviewers mention it (most often talking about how they accidentally poked holes in it with long fingernails), and three of my 150-weight leggings have developed runs in them after several years of heavy use.200 is slightly thicker, but still on the thin side.It's pretty warm.The lighter colors are definitely see-through, such as grey and cream. My older black and brown items made out of 200 weight wool don't seem to be see-through, but some of the newer dark-colored ones might be.It's good for a base layer or mid-weight layer, for exercise, and sleeping in.Especially in the ranges intended for athletic situations, their items of this weight tend to be form-fitting in one's typical size.260 is on the thicker side.It's definitely warm, a cozy weight.None of my 260 items are see-through. I can wear tops made out of this weight on their own (without anything over them) and not worry that my underwear or too many lumps&bumps will show through.It's good for a mid-layer or top-layer, and sleeping in (if you get cold at night, like I do).Items of this weight tend to fit looser than items of the same size in the 150/200 weights do. This may have something to do with how much naturally-stretchier the thicker fabric is, but it also seems that they cut these 260-weight items bigger because this weight is often worn as a top-layer or middle-layer, instead of as a base-layer.I like this weight the best. I think that the company says that this is their most popular weight across the board.320 is thickest, of course.It is quite warm, very toasty and sturdy.This weight is generally a top-layer, so items made out of this material are relatively loosely-cut.--------------------------ICEBREAKER LINES / RANGES / ""COLLECTIONS"" OF CLOTHING:Icebreaker makes different ranges - some intended for wearing as normal underwear (like panties and sports bras and tank tops), some intended for wearing as thermal/long underwear, some intended for wearing as everyday clothing, and some intended for wearing as athletic wear.Even though at first glance most of their items appear VERY similar to each other, there are different feelings to the fabrics (even in fabrics of the same wool weight), different quality levels, different cuts, and different design details amongst these different lines, so it is good to check their website about the particular Icebreaker item you are thinking of buying to make sure that it is intended for the activity you want it for.Two of the popular ranges at the lower end of the Icebreaker price scale are:BodyfitThe Bodyfit range seems to be for athletic situations, but also casual-wear and sleeping-in. The knit of this range's wool is usually flatter and less stretchy than the knit of the ranges that are for underwear or purely casual wear. Items in this range are usually cut to fit relatively snugly.EverydayThis range is made of a looser, thicker, stretchier knit than the Bodyfit, and is more for general sleeping-in and casual long-underwear needs, not so much for athletic situations. (However, I'm sure that they would be okay in many athletic situations, and I have worn them skiing and hiking.) Everyday items tend to be made of a stretchier knit and cut to fit more loosely than the Bodyfit items. I wear a size below my ordinary size in this range.Other rangesTheir other ranges appear to include: Black Sheep Collection, RealFleece Collection, Pure Plus Collection, Journeys Travel Collection, Premium Underwear Collection, GT Technical Sports Collection, GT Bike Collection, Technical Base Layers Collection, and Technical Mid Layers Collection. Please see the Icebreaker site for more information on their ranges.Frankly, I feel that they've made this aspect of their brand over-complicated and too confusing for the average customer, and I have not been able to locate any overview of the various collections on their site or on their product packaging materials.-----------------------ICEBREAKER COLORS:Icebreaker tends to make most items in black, as their basic universal color.Many items are offered in about 2 to 8 other colors, as well. There is often some version of blue, red, grey, and green - sometimes a pink, sometimes a brown or purple, etc. Often the colors are skewed towards the cool end of the spectrum (which I notice because my coloring is on the warm end of the spectrum and cool tones look awful on me).The different weights of wool and/or different ranges (e.g., Bodyfit, Everyday, Journeys Travel Collection, etc.) will tend to have their own mini-set of color options. (For example, the current grey color in the 200 Bodyfit is a medium-grey and is called ""blizzard"" and the current grey color in the 260 Bodyfit is a dark-grey and called ""metro"", and they don't offer those particular colors in other weights of wool or other ranges, as far as I know.)They change their colors every year or so (I think), and some colors tend to sell out mid-way through a season and are not restocked, so if you see an item in a color that you love, or there is a matching set (of long underwear or something) and you want both pieces in the same color, you probably should get it at the time, because it's not guaranteed that it will be available in the future.---------------------EXTRA DESIGN FLOURISHES:A couple of their ranges, mainly the more athletic lines, feature ""pops"" of contrasting color in a certain part of the garment, such as a stripe running down the sleeves or down the sides, or a triangle of bright material at the ankle. Most internet retailers' photographs of the garments do show these features because the areas of differing colors are pretty obvious, but it pays to read the item descriptions (and check out the manufacturer's site for confirmation) if this kind of thing is not what you are looking for.In a couple of their clothing ranges, mainly the underwear, 150-weight, and casual-wear lines, some of the tops and bottoms have printed patterns (like floral motifs or abstract swirls - sometimes in contrasting colors) on the sleeves or in the hip-region. This *can* escape your notice when the only images of the item you have available to you are the tiny product photographs that most internet retailers provide, so do double-check the customer reviews of the item, and maybe the Icebreaker site's own full description of the item, if you want to know for sure if the item comes with a printed pattern on a section of it.---------------------ICEBREAKER SIZING:Sizing and fit are so variable from person to person and from brand to brand, but in case it may help, I'll talk about my experiences with Icebreaker clothing.For reference, generally I am usually a women's size 4 or 6 in US sizing, a women's size 8 or 10 in UK sizing, and a small when it comes to small/medium/large sizing. This goes for both tops and bottoms.---Sizing of TopsAlmost all of my Icebreaker tops from the last 13 years -- crew tops, long-underwear tops, turtlenecks, and zip-up jackets -- are women's size small.The only tops I have in size extra-small are from the Skin range (which they phased out in 2006, but the sizing and type of material used for the Skin range appear to be very similar to those of the current range called Everyday).Generally, I know that an Icebreaker small top is probably going to fit me.The main issue that I've had with their tops is sleeve length (too long). This is not uncommon for me, because I do have arms that are on the petite side: most suit jackets I buy have to be shortened a little in the sleeves, and I often have to turn up sweaters one turn at the cuff. And one feature of some Icebreaker tops is a thumb loop which necessitates that the sleeves are meant to be about three inches longer than the wrist - I understand this, and just roll those tops up a turn or two. However, I've read quite a few reviewers' comments that mention that Icebreaker sleeves tend to be long, and I do think that their sleeves are longer than normal. [""Normal"" being subjective, of course! ...the only women I've met from New Zealand actually did happen to be tall, lithe, and willowy, so maybe that's normal there. :-) ] Last week, I bought a 2012-made Icebreaker ""Oasis"" top in a size small, and while it was too tight in the chest area (which is normally NOT a problem for me with Icebreaker), the sleeves were a crazy four or five inches past my wrist, even though they didn't have thumb holes and therefore were meant to end at the wrist. I had to return it.---Sizing of Leggings:I have run into inconsistency in Icebreaker legging sizes. I have some in extra-small, some in small, and some in medium.

"Having owned an Icebreaker zip-up jacket for many years, I have always wished I could have a vest version of it.  This one comes close (though it has more pockets than my jacket).

If this happens on your screen and you wish to read the second half, all you have to do is press the ""read more"" button at the bottom of the review and Amazon will show you the rest of it. :-)----------------------OVERALL IMPRESSIONIcebreaker's marino wool items are generally made well, last a long time, are easy to care for, feel fantastic on the skin, are ""natural"", don't get smelly easily like polarfleece does, let the skin breathe, etc.Many of my Icebreaker items have been worn and washed several hundred times and are still holding up much better than would be expected.I am a BIG fan of this company's products. For my overall experience of them from around 2000-2010, I would give them a solid ""5 stars""!However, I regret to say that my opinion of the items I bought from Icebreaker in 2012 was not as high. In late 2012 I bought 7 different Icebreaker items (most of them in various sizes) and decided to return all of them because they were not as well-cut as the very ""same"" items that I bought in the 2000s (which I still have and wear, so I can make like-for-like comparisons easily).Based solely on my 2012 experience of Icebreaker products, I would give them 3 stars, meaning ""it's ok"". For me, this is not good enough to command prices of $50 - $100+ for quite simple items, even if the basic wool material itself is outstanding and long-lasting.For my star-rating on this review, I will average the ""5"" I give Icebreaker historically and the ""3"" that I would have given Icebreaker in 2012, and give them a ""4"" now.As of November 2013: Soon I plan to buy a few items from this year's production, which I hope will work out better for me.---------------------MY EXPERIENCE WITH ICEBREAKERI bought my first Icebreaker clothing about 13 years ago when I needed some long underwear for skiing.Up until about 6 years ago, I had been buying Icebreaker items very sparingly, due to the eye-watering prices at London UK sporting goods shops . Then, I discovered that Sierratradingpost sells various Icebreaker styles (usually discontinued items from years past) on their site for a discount. Fortunately, for a couple of years after I discovered this, they had a large selection of women's Icebreaker stuff, so I bought quite a few things for great prices. (These days, Sierra's Icebreaker selection for women appears to be smaller, and the prices comparatively higher, than before. I expect that there are more discounters they have to compete with now, to get that kind of stock.)In addition to bricks-and-mortar sports shops and Sierratradingpost, I have also bought Icebreaker items from several sporting goods online retailers, Amazon, and the Icebreaker website.I still have almost every Icebreaker item I've bought. Even the discounted items have been somewhat pricey, but the quality and longevity were worth the initial investment.----------------------CAVEATWhat I have written below is based on my current knowledge about their products, but it is possible that I have misunderstood some aspects of the brand.If you wish to better understand their product offerings, I would absolutely recommend that you have a look at the Icebreaker official site to view their entire range and gain more clarity about what items are for what purposes, what the wool weights are about, what the quality levels of the different clothing collections are, etc.(Unfortunately, their website, while snazzy, does not fully explain these things, leaving it up to the customer to piece some of the puzzle together.)----------------------ICEBREAKER WOOL WEIGHTS:Icebreaker's marino wool items generally come in four weights of fabric: 150, 200, 260, or 320. This is ""grams per square meter"".150 is quite thin.It provides light warmth.The material is generally see-through. (I wouldn't wear items of this weight out and about in public without anything over them, but some reviewers have said that they do.)It's good for a first base layer, for strenuous exercise, or for sleeping in.Their items of this weight, especially in the ranges intended for athletic use, tend to be really form-fitting in one's typical size.All Icebreaker material seems VERY resilient and long-lasting to me, but because the 150 wool weight is pretty thin, it is the likeliest to be torn, develop holes, get ""runs"" (like pantyhose). I don't think this happens too much with it, but I've seen some reviewers mention it (most often talking about how they accidentally poked holes in it with long fingernails), and three of my 150-weight leggings have developed runs in them after several years of heavy use.200 is slightly thicker, but still on the thin side.It's pretty warm.The lighter colors are definitely see-through, such as grey and cream. My older black and brown items made out of 200 weight wool don't seem to be see-through, but some of the newer dark-colored ones might be.It's good for a base layer or mid-weight layer, for exercise, and sleeping in.Especially in the ranges intended for athletic situations, their items of this weight tend to be form-fitting in one's typical size.260 is on the thicker side.It's definitely warm, a cozy weight.None of my 260 items are see-through. I can wear tops made out of this weight on their own (without anything over them) and not worry that my underwear or too many lumps&bumps will show through.It's good for a mid-layer or top-layer, and sleeping in (if you get cold at night, like I do).Items of this weight tend to fit looser than items of the same size in the 150/200 weights do. This may have something to do with how much naturally-stretchier the thicker fabric is, but it also seems that they cut these 260-weight items bigger because this weight is often worn as a top-layer or middle-layer, instead of as a base-layer.I like this weight the best. I think that the company says that this is their most popular weight across the board.320 is thickest, of course.It is quite warm, very toasty and sturdy.This weight is generally a top-layer, so items made out of this material are relatively loosely-cut.--------------------------ICEBREAKER LINES / RANGES / ""COLLECTIONS"" OF CLOTHING:Icebreaker makes different ranges - some intended for wearing as normal underwear (like panties and sports bras and tank tops), some intended for wearing as thermal/long underwear, some intended for wearing as everyday clothing, and some intended for wearing as athletic wear.Even though at first glance most of their items appear VERY similar to each other, there are different feelings to the fabrics (even in fabrics of the same wool weight), different quality levels, different cuts, and different design details amongst these different lines, so it is good to check their website about the particular Icebreaker item you are thinking of buying to make sure that it is intended for the activity you want it for.Two of the popular ranges at the lower end of the Icebreaker price scale are:BodyfitThe Bodyfit range seems to be for athletic situations, but also casual-wear and sleeping-in. The knit of this range's wool is usually flatter and less stretchy than the knit of the ranges that are for underwear or purely casual wear. Items in this range are usually cut to fit relatively snugly.EverydayThis range is made of a looser, thicker, stretchier knit than the Bodyfit, and is more for general sleeping-in and casual long-underwear needs, not so much for athletic situations. (However, I'm sure that they would be okay in many athletic situations, and I have worn them skiing and hiking.) Everyday items tend to be made of a stretchier knit and cut to fit more loosely than the Bodyfit items. I wear a size below my ordinary size in this range.Other rangesTheir other ranges appear to include: Black Sheep Collection, RealFleece Collection, Pure Plus Collection, Journeys Travel Collection, Premium Underwear Collection, GT Technical Sports Collection, GT Bike Collection, Technical Base Layers Collection, and Technical Mid Layers Collection. Please see the Icebreaker site for more information on their ranges.Frankly, I feel that they've made this aspect of their brand over-complicated and too confusing for the average customer, and I have not been able to locate any overview of the various collections on their site or on their product packaging materials.-----------------------ICEBREAKER COLORS:Icebreaker tends to make most items in black, as their basic universal color.Many items are offered in about 2 to 8 other colors, as well. There is often some version of blue, red, grey, and green - sometimes a pink, sometimes a brown or purple, etc. Often the colors are skewed towards the cool end of the spectrum (which I notice because my coloring is on the warm end of the spectrum and cool tones look awful on me).The different weights of wool and/or different ranges (e.g., Bodyfit, Everyday, Journeys Travel Collection, etc.) will tend to have their own mini-set of color options. (For example, the current grey color in the 200 Bodyfit is a medium-grey and is called ""blizzard"" and the current grey color in the 260 Bodyfit is a dark-grey and called ""metro"", and they don't offer those particular colors in other weights of wool or other ranges, as far as I know.)They change their colors every year or so (I think), and some colors tend to sell out mid-way through a season and are not restocked, so if you see an item in a color that you love, or there is a matching set (of long underwear or something) and you want both pieces in the same color, you probably should get it at the time, because it's not guaranteed that it will be available in the future.---------------------EXTRA DESIGN FLOURISHES:A couple of their ranges, mainly the more athletic lines, feature ""pops"" of contrasting color in a certain part of the garment, such as a stripe running down the sleeves or down the sides, or a triangle of bright material at the ankle. Most internet retailers' photographs of the garments do show these features because the areas of differing colors are pretty obvious, but it pays to read the item descriptions (and check out the manufacturer's site for confirmation) if this kind of thing is not what you are looking for.In a couple of their clothing ranges, mainly the underwear, 150-weight, and casual-wear lines, some of the tops and bottoms have printed patterns (like floral motifs or abstract swirls - sometimes in contrasting colors) on the sleeves or in the hip-region. This *can* escape your notice when the only images of the item you have available to you are the tiny product photographs that most internet retailers provide, so do double-check the customer reviews of the item, and maybe the Icebreaker site's own full description of the item, if you want to know for sure if the item comes with a printed pattern on a section of it.---------------------ICEBREAKER SIZING:Sizing and fit are so variable from person to person and from brand to brand, but in case it may help, I'll talk about my experiences with Icebreaker clothing.For reference, generally I am usually a women's size 4 or 6 in US sizing, a women's size 8 or 10 in UK sizing, and a small when it comes to small/medium/large sizing. This goes for both tops and bottoms.---Sizing of TopsAlmost all of my Icebreaker tops from the last 13 years -- crew tops, long-underwear tops, turtlenecks, and zip-up jackets -- are women's size small.The only tops I have in size extra-small are from the Skin range (which they phased out in 2006, but the sizing and type of material used for the Skin range appear to be very similar to those of the current range called Everyday).Generally, I know that an Icebreaker small top is probably going to fit me.The main issue that I've had with their tops is sleeve length (too long). This is not uncommon for me, because I do have arms that are on the petite side: most suit jackets I buy have to be shortened a little in the sleeves, and I often have to turn up sweaters one turn at the cuff. And one feature of some Icebreaker tops is a thumb loop which necessitates that the sleeves are meant to be about three inches longer than the wrist - I understand this, and just roll those tops up a turn or two. However, I've read quite a few reviewers' comments that mention that Icebreaker sleeves tend to be long, and I do think that their sleeves are longer than normal. [""Normal"" being subjective, of course! ...the only women I've met from New Zealand actually did happen to be tall, lithe, and willowy, so maybe that's normal there. :-) ] Last week, I bought a 2012-made Icebreaker ""Oasis"" top in a size small, and while it was too tight in the chest area (which is normally NOT a problem for me with Icebreaker), the sleeves were a crazy four or five inches past my wrist, even though they didn't have thumb holes and therefore were meant to end at the wrist. I had to return it.---Sizing of Leggings:I have run into inconsistency in Icebreaker legging sizes. I have some in extra-small, some in small, and some in medium. (And in one 2012 collection, the extra-smalls are a little too big for me but there isn't a smaller size to go to.)I have not found Icebreaker's official sizing chart (available on their site) to be terribly accurate for leggings.For the leggings, it seems to me that one must experiment in each Icebreaker clothing range and wool weight to discover the best size and fit for oneself.I will spell out below the ones that I have tried. Because the sizing of the ""same"" leggings sometimes has varied across the years, I will mention what year I got them.1. BODYFIT range1a. Bodyfit 150 leggings2006 or 2007 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize medium. The label says ""slim fit"" (possibly back then they had different ""fits"" within the Bodyfit range, but they don't seem to now).Fit me snugly, but well.Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2008 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize small.Are a bit too small for me this winter - they fit me when I'm about 5-to-8 pounds less than I am at the moment.Waistband hits 1 inch below the belly button, feels okay.2012 Bodyfit 150 leggingsI decided not to buy new 150-weight leggings in 2012 because after a few years of heavy use, my old Bodyfit 150 leggings developed some un-mendable ""runs""/""ladders"". I still wear them and love them, but they are slowly self-destructing. It is comparatively easy to snag them on a rough surface or to poke a fingernail through them when pulling them on or off.Actually, I've just looked on the Icebreaker site (December 2012) and they don't list ANY Bodyfit 150 leggings. The only 150 weight leggings they list are the ""Sprite"" leggings from the Premium Underwear Collection. Also, I think that the ""Nature"" leggings (which are a discontinued style) were of 150 weight, and I have seen these still on sale on a few websites.1b. Bodyfit 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around eighty (discounted price of around sixty).2008 Bodyfit 200 leggingsSize medium.Fit me, and there is extra room in them - I probably could go up 5 to 8 pounds and they would still fit. When I purchased those mediums, I tried on the small size and found it to be way too small, especially along the tight and narrow waistband that these leggings were made with at the time. (I think it was a reaction to the consumer response to that waistband that they made the newer waistbands really wide and soft.)Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2012 Bodyfit 200 leggingsAt first, based on the Icebreaker official size chart, I ordered a medium in these. They were too big, so I exchanged them for a size small.The small fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 or even 3 inches below the belly button. This is a more ""modern"" position for a waistband, of course, compared to coming up to the true waist, but I prefer ""athletic"" base layers to cover my entire body - neck to ankle, to enable the base layer shirts to be securely tucked inside the base layer pants, and to feel really secure when I'm moving around -- but this waistband was so low on me, and so wide and stretchy that it felt like it was about to slide down to my hips at any moment because the elastic wasn't very tight.Not only from the practical side was this low waistband a problem, but MAN, the whole cut of the upper part of these leggings seemed to be designed to make my tummy area look as flabby and unattractive as possible! I tried my old leggings on when I took these off -- just to check that it wasn't bad lighting or post-Thanksgiving excess weight that was to blame for how these made me look, but my older Icebreaker Bodyfit 200 leggings looked a lot better on me than these leggings did.I had to return them. I have decided to wait until next year's production, to see if they alter the cut of the waist area.1c. Bodyfit 260 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around ninety (discounted price around seventy-five).2012 Bodyfit 260 leggingsSize small.Fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 inches below the belly button. They had the same issues as the 2012 Bodyfit 200 leggings did - waistband too low, too loose, too wide, and quite unattractive in the belly region!I also had to return these. I hope next year's will be cut higher on the waist.2. EVERYDAY range2a. Skin 200 leggings (discontinued 2006) - the Skin range was probably similar to Everyday.2005 Skin 200 leggingsSize extra-small, yet are the largest I own - I could gain 15 pounds and they would still feel okay. But they fit me nicely when I'm at any weight - 10 pounds less or more than my present size - they are simply the coziest and softest that I own.Waistband comes to about 1 inch higher than belly button, feels secure.2b. Everyday 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around sixty (discounted price of around forty-five).2012 Everyday 200 leggingsTwo weeks ago, I bought them in size small which were too big, so I exchanged them for an extra-small. Even the extra-smalls had extra material in places on the legs, which is unusual because my legs are not toothpicks (this kind of legging is not supposed to be baggy, so the cut of these must have been off).Worse, the upper part of the extra-small leggings was cut strangely - the waistband was in a deep V, so that the middle was 3 inches below my belly-button (which is way too low for me), but the sides rose up 3 inches higher than that (it wasn't a curve, it was a visible V). Yet the waistband elastic wasn't tight enough, so the tall sides wanted to sag down and bunch up around my hips -- strange. (And that was not the way the smalls I tried on the week before had fit my waist area! In fact, I think the smalls of last week fit me better generally than the extra-smalls of this week.) I don't have the energy to go through the rigamarole of ordering a different pair of extra-smalls, but maybe I just got a bad apple.I had to return the extra-smalls.I was very disappointed because they were the 7th Icebreaker product I've tried in the last 2 weeks. This Icebreaker shopping quest has taken up a fair bit of my time lately, but I have nothing new to show for it. I've given up trying to get anything now and will wait a year and see how their 2013 production fits me.3. OTHER rangesTheir other legging types are more expensive than the Everyday and Bodyfit, and seem to be geared towards high-tech athletic use, or constructed to be worn on their own as pants/trousers. Some have Lycra in them. Check out Icebreaker's site for more info.--------------------------------OTHER TIPSThe other main retailers of this kind of product sometimes offer free shipping on their Amazon listings of an item but don't offer free shipping on the exact same item when sold through their own site (even when the price of the item itself is the same on both sites), so it can save you money if you pay attention to that.The best selection BY FAR is available from the manufacturer's site, but the prices there are generally higher. However, they have discounts from time to time, such as their ""Black Friday"" sale when they offer 30% off all items that are black in color (at least they have done so in prior years).Amazon sometimes calls the Icebreaker Bodyfit range ""BF"" and sometimes ""Bodyfit"", so if you are searching here for Icebreaker's Bodyfit range, do a separate search under each of the two search terms to get the most accurate results.In terms of merino wool socks, I prefer Smartwool socks over Icebreaker's. Sierratradingpost is one retailer which often carries a large selection of them at good prices. Those socks last a really long time. I wear them almost year-round because the lightweight ones breathe really well even when it's warm out.The Smartwool women's small size is the only sock I can find that truly fits my feet (which aren't even that small, all things considered!) without bunching up inside my shoes.If you have a smaller foot (size 7 or less) and are female, note that the Smartwool unisex socks in the small size are bigger than the smalls made just for women, even though that company's size guide says that both sizes are meant to fit the same range of women's shoe sizes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR1DAGJ4GZ8D6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AFRZ5CQ#wasThisHelpful","RR1DAGJ4GZ8D6","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Icebreaker's long-sleeve Express technical top is geared towards cool-weather sporty/outdoorsy activities. At 260 grams, this top is made out of one of the heavier weights of Icebreaker wool. That wool weight is generally not see-through (in terms of showing the lines and colors of one's underwear) and is warm and durable.  The cut is trim and athletic, and the percentage of elastane in this top is higher than in some other Icebreaker styles, so I find it to be a bit taut, especially in the bust area, but the fit and feeling will vary from person to person, of course.  Also, I'm not a fan of the contrasting stitching and the little side triangles in a second color, although they do make the top look ""sporty"", because they make the top less versatile than the plainer Icebreaker tops are, in terms of the occasions on which they can be worn.I wear Icebreaker garments year-round, and really love the ones that I have.  Since some listing descriptions for Icebreaker items offer few details about the products, making it difficult for the online customer to make an informed purchasing decision if he/she is unfamiliar with this brand of clothing, I thought I'd type out some general information about Icebreaker clothing and my personal impressions of it, based on my experience of their products from 2000 to early 2013.Note that my review is quite long and usually only the first half of it is shown on this page.

Most internet retailers' photographs of the garments do show these features because the areas of differing colors are pretty obvious, but it pays to read the item descriptions (and check out the manufacturer's site for confirmation) if this kind of thing is not what you are looking for.In a couple of their clothing ranges, mainly the underwear, 150-weight, and casual-wear lines, some of the tops and bottoms have printed patterns (like floral motifs or abstract swirls - sometimes in contrasting colors) on the sleeves or in the hip-region. This *can* escape your notice when the only images of the item you have available to you are the tiny product photographs that most internet retailers provide, so do double-check the customer reviews of the item, and maybe the Icebreaker site's own full description of the item, if you want to know for sure if the item comes with a printed pattern on a section of it.---------------------ICEBREAKER SIZING:Sizing and fit are so variable from person to person and from brand to brand, but in case it may help, I'll talk about my experiences with Icebreaker clothing.For reference, generally I am usually a women's size 4 or 6 in US sizing, a women's size 8 or 10 in UK sizing, and a small when it comes to small/medium/large sizing.  This goes for both tops and bottoms.---Sizing of TopsAlmost all of my Icebreaker tops from the last 13 years -- crew tops, long-underwear tops, turtlenecks, and zip-up jackets -- are women's size small.The only tops I have in size extra-small are from the Skin range (which they phased out in 2006, but the sizing and type of material used for the Skin range appear to be very similar to those of the current range called Everyday).Generally, I know that an Icebreaker small top is probably going to fit me.The main issue that I've had with their tops is sleeve length (too long).  This is not uncommon for me, because I do have arms that are on the petite side:  most suit jackets I buy have to be shortened a little in the sleeves, and I often have to turn up sweaters one turn at the cuff.  And one feature of some Icebreaker tops is a thumb loop which necessitates that the sleeves are meant to be about three inches longer than the wrist - I understand this, and just roll those tops up a turn or two.  However, I've read quite a few reviewers' comments that mention that Icebreaker sleeves tend to be long, and I do think that their sleeves are longer than normal.  [""Normal"" being subjective, of course!  ...the only women I've met from New Zealand actually did happen to be tall, lithe, and willowy, so maybe that's normal there.  :-) ]  Last week, I bought a 2012-made Icebreaker ""Oasis"" top in a size small, and while it was too tight in the chest area (which is normally NOT a problem for me with Icebreaker), the sleeves were a crazy four or five inches past my wrist, even though they didn't have thumb holes and therefore were meant to end at the wrist. I had to return it.---Sizing of Leggings:I have run into inconsistency in Icebreaker legging sizes. I have some in extra-small, some in small, and some in medium.  (And in one 2012 collection, the extra-smalls are a little too big for me but there isn't a smaller size to go to.)I have not found Icebreaker's official sizing chart (available on their site) to be terribly accurate for leggings.For the leggings, it seems to me that one must experiment in each Icebreaker clothing range and wool weight to discover the best size and fit for oneself.I will spell out below the ones that I have tried.  Because the sizing of the ""same"" leggings sometimes has varied across the years, I will mention what year I got them.1.  BODYFIT range1a. Bodyfit 150 leggings2006 or 2007 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize medium. The label says ""slim fit"" (possibly back then they had different ""fits"" within the Bodyfit range, but they don't seem to now).Fit me snugly, but well.Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2008 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize small.Are a bit too small for me this winter - they fit me when I'm about 5-to-8 pounds less than I am at the moment.Waistband hits 1 inch below the belly button, feels okay.2012 Bodyfit 150 leggingsI decided not to buy new 150-weight leggings in 2012 because after a few years of heavy use, my old Bodyfit 150 leggings developed some un-mendable ""runs""/""ladders"". I still wear them and love them, but they are slowly self-destructing. It is comparatively easy to snag them on a rough surface or to poke a fingernail through them when pulling them on or off.Actually, I've just looked on the Icebreaker site (December 2012) and they don't list ANY Bodyfit 150 leggings.  The only 150 weight leggings they list are the ""Sprite"" leggings from the Premium Underwear Collection.  Also, I think that the ""Nature"" leggings (which are a discontinued style) were of 150 weight, and I have seen these still on sale on a few websites.1b. Bodyfit 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around eighty (discounted price of around sixty).2008 Bodyfit 200 leggingsSize medium.Fit me, and there is extra room in them - I probably could go up 5 to 8 pounds and they would still fit. When I purchased those mediums, I tried on the small size and found it to be way too small, especially along the tight and narrow waistband that these leggings were made with at the time.  (I think it was a reaction to the consumer response to that waistband that they made the newer waistbands really wide and soft.)Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2012 Bodyfit 200 leggingsAt first, based on the Icebreaker official size chart, I ordered a medium in these.  They were too big, so I exchanged them for a size small.The small fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 or even 3 inches below the belly button. This is a more ""modern"" position for a waistband, of course, compared to coming up to the true waist, but I prefer ""athletic"" base layers to cover my entire body - neck to ankle, to enable the base layer shirts to be securely tucked inside the base layer pants, and to feel really secure when I'm moving around -- but this waistband was so low on me, and so wide and stretchy that it felt like it was about to slide down to my hips at any moment because the elastic wasn't very tight.Not only from the practical side was this low waistband a problem, but MAN, the whole cut of the upper part of these leggings seemed to be designed to make my tummy area look as flabby and unattractive as possible!  I tried my old leggings on when I took these off -- just to check that it wasn't bad lighting or post-Thanksgiving excess weight that was to blame for how these made me look, but my older Icebreaker Bodyfit 200 leggings looked a lot better on me than these leggings did.I had to return them.  I have decided to wait until next year's production, to see if they alter the cut of the waist area.1c. Bodyfit 260 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around ninety (discounted price around seventy-five).2012 Bodyfit 260 leggingsSize small.Fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 inches below the belly button. They had the same issues as the 2012 Bodyfit 200 leggings did - waistband too low, too loose, too wide, and quite unattractive in the belly region!I also had to return these.  I hope next year's will be cut higher on the waist.2.  EVERYDAY range2a. Skin 200 leggings (discontinued 2006) - the Skin range was probably similar to Everyday.2005 Skin 200 leggingsSize extra-small, yet are the largest I own - I could gain 15 pounds and they would still feel okay. But they fit me nicely when I'm at any weight - 10 pounds less or more than my present size - they are simply the coziest and softest that I own.Waistband comes to about 1 inch higher than belly button, feels secure.2b. Everyday 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around sixty (discounted price of around forty-five).2012 Everyday 200 leggingsTwo weeks ago, I bought them in size small which were too big, so I exchanged them for an extra-small.  Even the extra-smalls had extra material in places on the legs, which is unusual because my legs are not toothpicks (this kind of legging is not supposed to be baggy, so the cut of these must have been off).Worse, the upper part of the extra-small leggings was cut strangely - the waistband was in a deep V, so that the middle was 3 inches below my belly-button (which is way too low for me), but the sides rose up 3 inches higher than that (it wasn't a curve, it was a visible V).  Yet the waistband elastic wasn't tight enough, so the tall sides wanted to sag down and bunch up around my hips -- strange.  (And that was not the way the smalls I tried on the week before had fit my waist area!  In fact, I think the smalls of last week fit me better generally than the extra-smalls of this week.)  I don't have the energy to go through the rigamarole of ordering a different pair of extra-smalls, but maybe I just got a bad apple.I had to return the extra-smalls.I was very disappointed because they were the 7th Icebreaker product I've tried in the last 2 weeks.  This Icebreaker shopping quest has taken up a fair bit of my time lately, but I have nothing new to show for it.  I've given up trying to get anything now and will wait a year and see how their 2013 production fits me.3.  OTHER rangesTheir other legging types are more expensive than the Everyday and Bodyfit, and seem to be geared towards high-tech athletic use, or constructed to be worn on their own as pants/trousers. Some have Lycra in them. Check out Icebreaker's site for more info.--------------------------------OTHER TIPSThe other main retailers of this kind of product sometimes offer free shipping on their Amazon listings of an item but don't offer free shipping on the exact same item when sold through their own site (even when the price of the item itself is the same on both sites), so it can save you money if you pay attention to that.The best selection BY FAR is available from the manufacturer's site, but the prices there are generally higher. However, they have discounts from time to time, such as their ""Black Friday"" sale when they offer 30% off all items that are black in color (at least they have done so in prior years).Amazon sometimes calls the Icebreaker Bodyfit range ""BF"" and sometimes ""Bodyfit"", so if you are searching here for Icebreaker's Bodyfit range, do a separate search under each of the two search terms to get the most accurate results.In terms of merino wool socks, I prefer Smartwool socks over Icebreaker's. Sierratradingpost is one retailer which often carries a large selection of them at good prices. Those socks last a really long time. I wear them almost year-round because the lightweight ones breathe really well even when it's warm out.The Smartwool women's small size is the only sock I can find that truly fits my feet (which aren't even that small, all things considered!) without bunching up inside my shoes.If you have a smaller foot (size 7 or less) and are female, note that the Smartwool unisex socks in the small size are bigger than the smalls made just for women, even though that company's size guide says that both sizes are meant to fit the same range of women's shoe sizes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K0AXVZFQB1YY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJ9A7Q6#wasThisHelpful","R2K0AXVZFQB1YY","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Pace long-sleeve crew top is geared towards athletic use.  At 200 grams, it is made out of their second lightest weight of wool, which provides a great balance of breathability, warmth, and durability.  Although the fabric isn't their thinnest, your bra probably would be visible underneath this top.  With a higher percentage of elastane than the basic Icebreaker styles have, this technical top's fabric is a little bit taut for me personally.  Additionally, Icebreaker's trim-fit styles that are meant for sporty endeavours tend to be too tight for me in the bust area (I'm an average size there) and way too long for the arms (my arms are on the petite side), but this proportion is good for many other folks.  I'd recommend ordering several styles and sizes of their tops so you can try them on and get the best fit for the sporting activity you want to wear it for.I wear Icebreaker garments year-round, and really love the ones that I have.  Since some listing descriptions for Icebreaker items offer few details about the products, making it difficult for the online customer to make an informed purchasing decision if he/she is unfamiliar with this brand of clothing, I thought I'd type out some general information about Icebreaker clothing and my personal impressions of it, based on my experience of their products from 2000 to early 2013.Note that my review is quite long and usually only the first half of it is shown on this page. If this happens on your screen and you wish to read the second half, all you have to do is press the ""read more"" button at the bottom of the review and Amazon will show you the rest of it.  :-)----------------------OVERALL IMPRESSIONIcebreaker's marino wool items are generally made well, last a long time, are easy to care for, feel fantastic on the skin, are ""natural"", don't get smelly easily like polarfleece does, let the skin breathe, etc.Many of my Icebreaker items have been worn and washed several hundred times and are still holding up much better than would be expected.I am a BIG fan of this company's products.  For my overall experience of them from around 2000-2010, I would give them a solid ""5 stars""!However, I regret to say that my opinion of the items I bought from Icebreaker in 2012 was not as high.  In late 2012 I bought 7 different Icebreaker items (most of them in various sizes) and decided to return all of them because they were not as well-cut as the very ""same"" items that I bought in the 2000s (which I still have and wear, so I can make like-for-like comparisons easily).Based solely on my 2012 experience of Icebreaker products, I would give them 3 stars, meaning ""it's ok"".  For me, this is not good enough to command prices of $50 - $100+ for quite simple items, even if the basic wool material itself is outstanding and long-lasting.For my star-rating on this review, I will average the ""5"" I give Icebreaker historically and the ""3"" that I would have given Icebreaker in 2012, and give them a ""4"" now.As of November 2013:  Soon I plan to buy a few items from this year's production, which I hope will work out better for me.---------------------MY EXPERIENCE WITH ICEBREAKERI bought my first Icebreaker clothing about 13 years ago when I needed some long underwear for skiing.Up until about 6 years ago, I had been buying Icebreaker items very sparingly, due to the eye-watering prices at London UK sporting goods shops .  Then, I discovered that Sierratradingpost sells various Icebreaker styles (usually discontinued items from years past) on their site for a discount. Fortunately, for a couple of years after I discovered this, they had a large selection of women's Icebreaker stuff, so I bought quite a few things for great prices. (These days, Sierra's Icebreaker selection for women appears to be smaller, and the prices comparatively higher, than before.  I expect that there are more discounters they have to compete with now, to get that kind of stock.)In addition to bricks-and-mortar sports shops and Sierratradingpost, I have also bought Icebreaker items from several sporting goods online retailers, Amazon, and the Icebreaker website.I still have almost every Icebreaker item I've bought.  Even the discounted items have been somewhat pricey, but the quality and longevity were worth the initial investment.----------------------CAVEATWhat I have written below is based on my current knowledge about their products, but it is possible that I have misunderstood some aspects of the brand.If you wish to better understand their product offerings, I would absolutely recommend that you have a look at the Icebreaker official site to view their entire range and gain more clarity about what items are for what purposes, what the wool weights are about, what the quality levels of the different clothing collections are, etc.(Unfortunately, their website, while snazzy, does not fully explain these things, leaving it up to the customer to piece some of the puzzle together.)----------------------ICEBREAKER WOOL WEIGHTS:Icebreaker's marino wool items generally come in four weights of fabric: 150, 200, 260, or 320. This is ""grams per square meter"".150 is quite thin.It provides light warmth.The material is generally see-through.  (I wouldn't wear items of this weight out and about in public without anything over them, but some reviewers have said that they do.)It's good for a first base layer, for strenuous exercise, or for sleeping in.Their items of this weight, especially in the ranges intended for athletic use, tend to be really form-fitting in one's typical size.All Icebreaker material seems VERY resilient and long-lasting to me, but because the 150 wool weight is pretty thin, it is the likeliest to be torn, develop holes, get ""runs"" (like pantyhose).  I don't think this happens too much with it, but I've seen some reviewers mention it (most often talking about how they accidentally poked holes in it with long fingernails), and three of my 150-weight leggings have developed runs in them after several years of heavy use.200 is slightly thicker, but still on the thin side.It's pretty warm.The lighter colors are definitely see-through, such as grey and cream. My older black and brown items made out of 200 weight wool don't seem to be see-through, but some of the newer dark-colored ones might be.It's good for a base layer or mid-weight layer, for exercise, and sleeping in.Especially in the ranges intended for athletic situations, their items of this weight tend to be form-fitting in one's typical size.260 is on the thicker side.It's definitely warm, a cozy weight.None of my 260 items are see-through. I can wear tops made out of this weight on their own (without anything over them) and not worry that my underwear or too many lumps&bumps will show through.It's good for a mid-layer or top-layer, and sleeping in (if you get cold at night, like I do).Items of this weight tend to fit looser than items of the same size in the 150/200 weights do. This may have something to do with how much naturally-stretchier the thicker fabric is, but it also seems that they cut these 260-weight items bigger because this weight is often worn as a top-layer or middle-layer, instead of as a base-layer.I like this weight the best.  I think that the company says that this is their most popular weight across the board.320 is thickest, of course.It is quite warm, very toasty and sturdy.This weight is generally a top-layer, so items made out of this material are relatively loosely-cut.--------------------------ICEBREAKER LINES / RANGES / ""COLLECTIONS"" OF CLOTHING:Icebreaker makes different ranges - some intended for wearing as normal underwear (like panties and sports bras and tank tops), some intended for wearing as thermal/long underwear, some intended for wearing as everyday clothing, and some intended for wearing as athletic wear.Even though at first glance most of their items appear VERY similar to each other, there are different feelings to the fabrics (even in fabrics of the same wool weight), different quality levels, different cuts, and different design details amongst these different lines, so it is good to check their website about the particular Icebreaker item you are thinking of buying to make sure that it is intended for the activity you want it for.Two of the popular ranges at the lower end of the Icebreaker price scale are:BodyfitThe Bodyfit range seems to be for athletic situations, but also casual-wear and sleeping-in. The knit of this range's wool is usually flatter and less stretchy than the knit of the ranges that are for underwear or purely casual wear. Items in this range are usually cut to fit relatively snugly.EverydayThis range is made of a looser, thicker, stretchier knit than the Bodyfit, and is more for general sleeping-in and casual long-underwear needs, not so much for athletic situations. (However, I'm sure that they would be okay in many athletic situations, and I have worn them skiing and hiking.) Everyday items tend to be made of a stretchier knit and cut to fit more loosely than the Bodyfit items. I wear a size below my ordinary size in this range.Other rangesTheir other ranges appear to include: Black Sheep Collection, RealFleece Collection, Pure Plus Collection, Journeys Travel Collection, Premium Underwear Collection, GT Technical Sports Collection, GT Bike Collection, Technical Base Layers Collection, and Technical Mid Layers Collection. Please see the Icebreaker site for more information on their ranges.Frankly, I feel that they've made this aspect of their brand over-complicated and too confusing for the average customer, and I have not been able to locate any overview of the various collections on their site or on their product packaging materials.-----------------------ICEBREAKER COLORS:Icebreaker tends to make most items in black, as their basic universal color.Many items are offered in about 2 to 8 other colors, as well.  There is often some version of blue, red, grey, and green - sometimes a pink, sometimes a brown or purple, etc. Often the colors are skewed towards the cool end of the spectrum (which I notice because my coloring is on the warm end of the spectrum and cool tones look awful on me).The different weights of wool and/or different ranges (e.g., Bodyfit, Everyday, Journeys Travel Collection, etc.) will tend to have their own mini-set of color options.  (For example, the current grey color in the 200 Bodyfit is a medium-grey and is called ""blizzard"" and the current grey color in the 260 Bodyfit is a dark-grey and called ""metro"", and they don't offer those particular colors in other weights of wool or other ranges, as far as I know.)They change their colors every year or so (I think), and some colors tend to sell out mid-way through a season and are not restocked, so if you see an item in a color that you love, or there is a matching set (of long underwear or something) and you want both pieces in the same color, you probably should get it at the time, because it's not guaranteed that it will be available in the future.---------------------EXTRA DESIGN FLOURISHES:A couple of their ranges, mainly the more athletic lines, feature ""pops"" of contrasting color in a certain part of the garment, such as a stripe running down the sleeves or down the sides, or a triangle of bright material at the ankle.

I don't have the energy to go through the rigamarole of ordering a different pair of extra-smalls, but maybe I just got a bad apple.I had to return the extra-smalls.I was very disappointed because they were the 7th Icebreaker product I've tried in the last 2 weeks.  This Icebreaker shopping quest has taken up a fair bit of my time lately, but I have nothing new to show for it.  I've given up trying to get anything now and will wait a year and see how their 2013 production fits me.3.  OTHER rangesTheir other legging types are more expensive than the Everyday and Bodyfit, and seem to be geared towards high-tech athletic use, or constructed to be worn on their own as pants/trousers. Some have Lycra in them. Check out Icebreaker's site for more info.--------------------------------OTHER TIPSThe other main retailers of this kind of product sometimes offer free shipping on their Amazon listings of an item but don't offer free shipping on the exact same item when sold through their own site (even when the price of the item itself is the same on both sites), so it can save you money if you pay attention to that.The best selection BY FAR is available from the manufacturer's site, but the prices there are generally higher. However, they have discounts from time to time, such as their ""Black Friday"" sale when they offer 30% off all items that are black in color (at least they have done so in prior years).Amazon sometimes calls the Icebreaker Bodyfit range ""BF"" and sometimes ""Bodyfit"", so if you are searching here for Icebreaker's Bodyfit range, do a separate search under each of the two search terms to get the most accurate results.In terms of merino wool socks, I prefer Smartwool socks over Icebreaker's. Sierratradingpost is one retailer which often carries a large selection of them at good prices. Those socks last a really long time. I wear them almost year-round because the lightweight ones breathe really well even when it's warm out.The Smartwool women's small size is the only sock I can find that truly fits my feet (which aren't even that small, all things considered!) without bunching up inside my shoes.If you have a smaller foot (size 7 or less) and are female, note that the Smartwool unisex socks in the small size are bigger than the smalls made just for women, even though that company's size guide says that both sizes are meant to fit the same range of women's shoe sizes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VBDALFN49KVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJ9A7OS#wasThisHelpful","R1VBDALFN49KVW","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Because some of Amazon's listing descriptions for Icebreaker items have very few details about the products, making it difficult for the customer to make an informed purchasing decision if he/she is unfamiliar with this brand of clothing, below I'll type some general information about Icebreaker clothing and some personal impressions of it, based on my experience of their products from 2000 to early 2013.Note that my review is quite long and usually only the first half of it is shown on this page. If this happens on your screen and you wish to read the second half, all you have to do is press the ""read more"" button at the bottom of the review and Amazon will show you the rest of it.  :-)----------------------OVERALL IMPRESSIONIcebreaker's marino wool items are generally made well, last a long time, are easy to care for, feel fantastic on the skin, are ""natural"", don't get smelly easily like polarfleece does, let the skin breathe, etc.Many of my Icebreaker items have been worn and washed several hundred times and are still holding up much better than would be expected.I am a BIG fan of this company's products.  For my overall experience of them from around 2000-2010, I would give them a solid ""5 stars""!However, I regret to say that my opinion of the items I bought from Icebreaker in 2012 was not as high.  In late 2012 I bought 7 different Icebreaker items (most of them in various sizes) and decided to return all of them because they were not as well-cut as the very ""same"" items that I bought in the 2000s (which I still have and wear, so I can make like-for-like comparisons easily).Based solely on my 2012 experience of Icebreaker products, I would give them 3 stars, meaning ""it's ok"".  For me, this is not good enough to command prices of $50 - $100+ for quite simple items, even if the basic wool material itself is outstanding and long-lasting.For my star-rating on this review, I will average the ""5"" I give Icebreaker historically and the ""3"" that I would have given Icebreaker in 2012, and give them a ""4"" now.As of November 2013:  I plan to buy a few items of (presumably) this year's production, which I hope will work out better for me.---------------------MY EXPERIENCE WITH ICEBREAKERI bought my first Icebreaker clothing about 13 years ago when I needed some long underwear for skiing.Up until about 6 years ago, I had been buying Icebreaker items very sparingly, due to the eye-watering prices at London UK sporting goods shops .  Then, I discovered that Sierratradingpost sells various Icebreaker styles (usually discontinued items from years past) on their site for a discount. Fortunately, for a couple of years after I discovered this, they had a large selection of women's Icebreaker stuff, so I bought quite a few things for great prices. (These days, Sierra's Icebreaker selection for women appears to be smaller, and the prices comparatively higher, than before.  I expect that there are more discounters they have to compete with now, to get that kind of stock.)In addition to bricks-and-mortar sports shops and Sierratradingpost, I have also bought Icebreaker items from several sporting goods online retailers, Amazon, and the Icebreaker website.I still have almost every Icebreaker item I've bought.  Even the discounted items have been somewhat pricey, but the quality and longevity were worth the initial investment.----------------------CAVEATWhat I have written below is based on my current knowledge about their products, but it is possible that I have misunderstood some aspects of the brand.If you wish to better understand their product offerings, I would absolutely recommend that you have a look at the Icebreaker official site to view their entire range and gain more clarity about what items are for what purposes, what the wool weights are about, what the quality levels of the different clothing collections are, etc.(Unfortunately, their website, while snazzy, does not fully explain these things, leaving it up to the customer to piece some of the puzzle together.)----------------------ICEBREAKER WOOL WEIGHTS:Icebreaker's marino wool items generally come in four weights of fabric: 150, 200, 260, or 320. This is ""grams per square meter"".150 is quite thin.It provides light warmth.The material is generally see-through.  (I wouldn't wear items of this weight out and about in public without anything over them, but some reviewers have said that they do.)It's good for a first base layer, for strenuous exercise, or for sleeping in.Their items of this weight, especially in the ranges intended for athletic use, tend to be really form-fitting in one's typical size.All Icebreaker material seems VERY resilient and long-lasting to me, but because the 150 wool weight is pretty thin, it is the likeliest to be torn, develop holes, get ""runs"" (like pantyhose).  I don't think this happens too much with it, but I've seen some reviewers mention it (most often talking about how they accidentally poked holes in it with long fingernails), and three of my 150-weight leggings have developed runs in them after several years of heavy use.200 is slightly thicker, but still on the thin side.It's pretty warm.The lighter colors are definitely see-through, such as grey and cream. My older black and brown items made out of 200 weight wool don't seem to be see-through, but some of the newer dark-colored ones might be.It's good for a base layer or mid-weight layer, for exercise, and sleeping in.Especially in the ranges intended for athletic situations, their items of this weight tend to be form-fitting in one's typical size.260 is on the thicker side.It's definitely warm, a cozy weight.None of my 260 items are see-through. I can wear tops made out of this weight on their own (without anything over them) and not worry that my underwear or too many lumps&bumps will show through.It's good for a mid-layer or top-layer, and sleeping in (if you get cold at night, like I do).Items of this weight tend to fit looser than items of the same size in the 150/200 weights do. This may have something to do with how much naturally-stretchier the thicker fabric is, but it also seems that they cut these 260-weight items bigger because this weight is often worn as a top-layer or middle-layer, instead of as a base-layer.I like this weight the best.  I think that the company says that this is their most popular weight across the board.320 is thickest, of course.It is quite warm, very toasty and sturdy.This weight is generally a top-layer, so items made out of this material are relatively loosely-cut.--------------------------ICEBREAKER LINES / RANGES / ""COLLECTIONS"" OF CLOTHING:Icebreaker makes different ranges - some intended for wearing as normal underwear (like panties and sports bras and tank tops), some intended for wearing as thermal/long underwear, some intended for wearing as everyday clothing, and some intended for wearing as athletic wear.Even though at first glance most of their items appear VERY similar to each other, there are different feelings to the fabrics (even in fabrics of the same wool weight), different quality levels, different cuts, and different design details amongst these different lines, so it is good to check their website about the particular Icebreaker item you are thinking of buying to make sure that it is intended for the activity you want it for.Two of the popular ranges at the lower end of the Icebreaker price scale are:BodyfitThe Bodyfit range seems to be for athletic situations, but also casual-wear and sleeping-in. The knit of this range's wool is usually flatter and less stretchy than the knit of the ranges that are for underwear or purely casual wear. Items in this range are usually cut to fit relatively snugly.EverydayThis range is made of a looser, thicker, stretchier knit than the Bodyfit, and is more for general sleeping-in and casual long-underwear needs, not so much for athletic situations. (However, I'm sure that they would be okay in many athletic situations, and I have worn them skiing and hiking.) Everyday items tend to be made of a stretchier knit and cut to fit more loosely than the Bodyfit items. I wear a size below my ordinary size in this range.Other rangesTheir other ranges appear to include: Black Sheep Collection, RealFleece Collection, Pure Plus Collection, Journeys Travel Collection, Premium Underwear Collection, GT Technical Sports Collection, GT Bike Collection, Technical Base Layers Collection, and Technical Mid Layers Collection. Please see the Icebreaker site for more information on their ranges.Frankly, I feel that they've made this aspect of their brand over-complicated and too confusing for the average customer, and I have not been able to locate any overview of the various collections on their site or on their product packaging materials.-----------------------ICEBREAKER COLORS:Icebreaker tends to make most items in black, as their basic universal color.Many items are offered in about 2 to 8 other colors, as well.  There is often some version of blue, red, grey, and green - sometimes a pink, sometimes a brown or purple, etc. Often the colors are skewed towards the cool end of the spectrum (which I notice because my coloring is on the warm end of the spectrum and cool tones look awful on me).The different weights of wool and/or different ranges (e.g., Bodyfit, Everyday, Journeys Travel Collection, etc.) will tend to have their own mini-set of color options.  (For example, the current grey color in the 200 Bodyfit is a medium-grey and is called ""blizzard"" and the current grey color in the 260 Bodyfit is a dark-grey and called ""metro"", and they don't offer those particular colors in other weights of wool or other ranges, as far as I know.)They change their colors every year or so (I think), and some colors tend to sell out mid-way through a season and are not restocked, so if you see an item in a color that you love, or there is a matching set (of long underwear or something) and you want both pieces in the same color, you probably should get it at the time, because it's not guaranteed that it will be available in the future.---------------------EXTRA DESIGN FLOURISHES:A couple of their ranges, mainly the more athletic lines, feature ""pops"" of contrasting color in a certain part of the garment, such as a stripe running down the sleeves or down the sides, or a triangle of bright material at the ankle. Most internet retailers' photographs of the garments do show these features because the areas of differing colors are pretty obvious, but it pays to read the item descriptions (and check out the manufacturer's site for confirmation) if this kind of thing is not what you are looking for.In a couple of their clothing ranges, mainly the underwear, 150-weight, and casual-wear lines, some of the tops and bottoms have printed patterns (like floral motifs or abstract swirls - sometimes in contrasting colors) on the sleeves or in the hip-region. This *can* escape your notice when the only images of the item you have available to you are the tiny product photographs that most internet retailers provide, so do double-check the customer reviews of the item, and maybe the Icebreaker site's own full description of the item, if you want to know for sure if the item comes with a printed pattern on a section of it.---------------------ICEBREAKER SIZING:Sizing and fit are so variable from person to person and from brand to brand, but in case it may help, I'll talk about my experiences with Icebreaker clothing.For reference, generally I am usually a women's size 4 or 6 in US sizing, a women's size 8 or 10 in UK sizing, and a small when it comes to small/medium/large sizing.  This goes for both tops and bottoms.---Sizing of TopsAlmost all of my Icebreaker tops from the last 13 years -- crew tops, long-underwear tops, turtlenecks, and zip-up jackets -- are women's size small.The only tops I have in size extra-small are from the Skin range (which they phased out in 2006, but the sizing and type of material used for the Skin range appear to be very similar to those of the current range called Everyday).Generally, I know that an Icebreaker small top is probably going to fit me.The main issue that I've had with their tops is sleeve length (too long).  This is not uncommon for me, because I do have arms that are on the petite side:  most suit jackets I buy have to be shortened a little in the sleeves, and I often have to turn up sweaters one turn at the cuff.  And one feature of some Icebreaker tops is a thumb loop which necessitates that the sleeves are meant to be about three inches longer than the wrist - I understand this, and just roll those tops up a turn or two.  However, I've read quite a few reviewers' comments that mention that Icebreaker sleeves tend to be long, and I do think that their sleeves are longer than normal.  [""Normal"" being subjective, of course!  ...the only women I've met from New Zealand actually did happen to be tall, lithe, and willowy, so maybe that's normal there.  :-) ]  Last week, I bought a 2012-made Icebreaker ""Oasis"" top in a size small, and while it was too tight in the chest area (which is normally NOT a problem for me with Icebreaker), the sleeves were a crazy four or five inches past my wrist, even though they didn't have thumb holes and therefore were meant to end at the wrist. I had to return it.---Sizing of Leggings:I have run into inconsistency in Icebreaker legging sizes. I have some in extra-small, some in small, and some in medium.  (And in one 2012 collection, the extra-smalls are a little too big for me but there isn't a smaller size to go to.)I have not found Icebreaker's official sizing chart (available on their site) to be terribly accurate for leggings.For the leggings, it seems to me that one must experiment in each Icebreaker clothing range and wool weight to discover the best size and fit for oneself.I will spell out below the ones that I have tried.  Because the sizing of the ""same"" leggings sometimes has varied across the years, I will mention what year I got them.1.  BODYFIT range1a. Bodyfit 150 leggings2006 or 2007 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize medium. The label says ""slim fit"" (possibly back then they had different ""fits"" within the Bodyfit range, but they don't seem to now).Fit me snugly, but well.Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2008 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize small.Are a bit too small for me this winter - they fit me when I'm about 5-to-8 pounds less than I am at the moment.Waistband hits 1 inch below the belly button, feels okay.2012 Bodyfit 150 leggingsI decided not to buy new 150-weight leggings in 2012 because after a few years of heavy use, my old Bodyfit 150 leggings developed some un-mendable ""runs""/""ladders"". I still wear them and love them, but they are slowly self-destructing. It is comparatively easy to snag them on a rough surface or to poke a fingernail through them when pulling them on or off.Actually, I've just looked on the Icebreaker site (December 2012) and they don't list ANY Bodyfit 150 leggings.  The only 150 weight leggings they list are the ""Sprite"" leggings from the Premium Underwear Collection.  Also, I think that the ""Nature"" leggings (which are a discontinued style) were of 150 weight, and I have seen these still on sale on a few websites.1b. Bodyfit 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around eighty (discounted price of around sixty).2008 Bodyfit 200 leggingsSize medium.Fit me, and there is extra room in them - I probably could go up 5 to 8 pounds and they would still fit. When I purchased those mediums, I tried on the small size and found it to be way too small, especially along the tight and narrow waistband that these leggings were made with at the time.  (I think it was a reaction to the consumer response to that waistband that they made the newer waistbands really wide and soft.)Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2012 Bodyfit 200 leggingsAt first, based on the Icebreaker official size chart, I ordered a medium in these.  They were too big, so I exchanged them for a size small.The small fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 or even 3 inches below the belly button. This is a more ""modern"" position for a waistband, of course, compared to coming up to the true waist, but I prefer ""athletic"" base layers to cover my entire body - neck to ankle, to enable the base layer shirts to be securely tucked inside the base layer pants, and to feel really secure when I'm moving around -- but this waistband was so low on me, and so wide and stretchy that it felt like it was about to slide down to my hips at any moment because the elastic wasn't very tight.Not only from the practical side was this low waistband a problem, but MAN, the whole cut of the upper part of these leggings seemed to be designed to make my tummy area look as flabby and unattractive as possible!  I tried my old leggings on when I took these off -- just to check that it wasn't bad lighting or post-Thanksgiving excess weight that was to blame for how these made me look, but my older Icebreaker Bodyfit 200 leggings looked a lot better on me than these leggings did.I had to return them.  I have decided to wait until next year's production, to see if they alter the cut of the waist area.1c. Bodyfit 260 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around ninety (discounted price around seventy-five).2012 Bodyfit 260 leggingsSize small.Fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 inches below the belly button. They had the same issues as the 2012 Bodyfit 200 leggings did - waistband too low, too loose, too wide, and quite unattractive in the belly region!I also had to return these.  I hope next year's will be cut higher on the waist.2.  EVERYDAY range2a. Skin 200 leggings (discontinued 2006) - the Skin range was probably similar to Everyday.2005 Skin 200 leggingsSize extra-small, yet are the largest I own - I could gain 15 pounds and they would still feel okay. But they fit me nicely when I'm at any weight - 10 pounds less or more than my present size - they are simply the coziest and softest that I own.Waistband comes to about 1 inch higher than belly button, feels secure.2b. Everyday 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around sixty (discounted price of around forty-five).2012 Everyday 200 leggingsTwo weeks ago, I bought them in size small which were too big, so I exchanged them for an extra-small.  Even the extra-smalls had extra material in places on the legs, which is unusual because my legs are not toothpicks (this kind of legging is not supposed to be baggy, so the cut of these must have been off).Worse, the upper part of the extra-small leggings was cut strangely - the waistband was in a deep V, so that the middle was 3 inches below my belly-button (which is way too low for me), but the sides rose up 3 inches higher than that (it wasn't a curve, it was a visible V).  Yet the waistband elastic wasn't tight enough, so the tall sides wanted to sag down and bunch up around my hips -- strange.  (And that was not the way the smalls I tried on the week before had fit my waist area!  In fact, I think the smalls of last week fit me better generally than the extra-smalls of this week.)  I don't have the energy to go through the rigamarole of ordering a different pair of extra-smalls, but maybe I just got a bad apple.I had to return the extra-smalls.I was very disappointed because they were the 7th Icebreaker product I've tried in the last 2 weeks.  This Icebreaker shopping quest has taken up a fair bit of my time lately, but I have nothing new to show for it.  I've given up trying to get anything now and will wait a year and see how their 2013 production fits me.3.

"The Express technical top has a good combination of features for cool-weather athletic/outdoorsy wear.  I like the half-turtleneck style because it provides warmth without feeling constricting near my jawline, which some of Icebreaker's full turtlenecks do.  The thumbholes are handy (as long as the sleeves are the right length for your arms, which I find is hit-and-miss on Icebreaker tops).  The half-zip style makes the top easy to get on and off, and provides adjustable ventilation if you start to get hot and sweaty.  At 260 grams, this top is made out of one of the heavier weights of Icebreaker wool.  This wool weight is generally not see-through (in terms of showing the lines and colors of one's underwear) and is quite warm and extra-durable.  Although they do make it look ""sporty"", I'm not a fan of the contrasting stitching and the little side triangles in a second color, because they make the top less versatile than plainer Icebreaker tops are, in terms of the occasions on which it can be worn.I wear Icebreaker garments year-round, and really love the ones that I have.  Since some listing descriptions for Icebreaker items offer few details about the products, making it difficult for the online customer to make an informed purchasing decision if he/she is unfamiliar with this brand of clothing, I thought I'd type out some general information about Icebreaker clothing and my personal impressions of it, based on my experience of their products from 2000 to early 2013.Note that my review is quite long and usually only the first half of it is shown on this page.

I think that the company says that this is their most popular weight across the board.320 is thickest, of course.It is quite warm, very toasty and sturdy.This weight is generally a top-layer, so items made out of this material are relatively loosely-cut.--------------------------ICEBREAKER LINES / RANGES / ""COLLECTIONS"" OF CLOTHING:Icebreaker makes different ranges - some intended for wearing as normal underwear (like panties and sports bras and tank tops), some intended for wearing as thermal/long underwear, some intended for wearing as everyday clothing, and some intended for wearing as athletic wear.Even though at first glance most of their items appear VERY similar to each other, there are different feelings to the fabrics (even in fabrics of the same wool weight), different quality levels, different cuts, and different design details amongst these different lines, so it is good to check their website about the particular Icebreaker item you are thinking of buying to make sure that it is intended for the activity you want it for.Two of the popular ranges at the lower end of the Icebreaker price scale are:BodyfitThe Bodyfit range seems to be for athletic situations, but also casual-wear and sleeping-in. The knit of this range's wool is usually flatter and less stretchy than the knit of the ranges that are for underwear or purely casual wear. Items in this range are usually cut to fit relatively snugly.EverydayThis range is made of a looser, thicker, stretchier knit than the Bodyfit, and is more for general sleeping-in and casual long-underwear needs, not so much for athletic situations. (However, I'm sure that they would be okay in many athletic situations, and I have worn them skiing and hiking.) Everyday items tend to be made of a stretchier knit and cut to fit more loosely than the Bodyfit items. I wear a size below my ordinary size in this range.Other rangesTheir other ranges appear to include: Black Sheep Collection, RealFleece Collection, Pure Plus Collection, Journeys Travel Collection, Premium Underwear Collection, GT Technical Sports Collection, GT Bike Collection, Technical Base Layers Collection, and Technical Mid Layers Collection. Please see the Icebreaker site for more information on their ranges.Frankly, I feel that they've made this aspect of their brand over-complicated and too confusing for the average customer, and I have not been able to locate any overview of the various collections on their site or on their product packaging materials.-----------------------ICEBREAKER COLORS:Icebreaker tends to make most items in black, as their basic universal color.Many items are offered in about 2 to 8 other colors, as well.  There is often some version of blue, red, grey, and green - sometimes a pink, sometimes a brown or purple, etc. Often the colors are skewed towards the cool end of the spectrum (which I notice because my coloring is on the warm end of the spectrum and cool tones look awful on me).The different weights of wool and/or different ranges (e.g., Bodyfit, Everyday, Journeys Travel Collection, etc.) will tend to have their own mini-set of color options.  (For example, the current grey color in the 200 Bodyfit is a medium-grey and is called ""blizzard"" and the current grey color in the 260 Bodyfit is a dark-grey and called ""metro"", and they don't offer those particular colors in other weights of wool or other ranges, as far as I know.)They change their colors every year or so (I think), and some colors tend to sell out mid-way through a season and are not restocked, so if you see an item in a color that you love, or there is a matching set (of long underwear or something) and you want both pieces in the same color, you probably should get it at the time, because it's not guaranteed that it will be available in the future.---------------------EXTRA DESIGN FLOURISHES:A couple of their ranges, mainly the more athletic lines, feature ""pops"" of contrasting color in a certain part of the garment, such as a stripe running down the sleeves or down the sides, or a triangle of bright material at the ankle. Most internet retailers' photographs of the garments do show these features because the areas of differing colors are pretty obvious, but it pays to read the item descriptions (and check out the manufacturer's site for confirmation) if this kind of thing is not what you are looking for.In a couple of their clothing ranges, mainly the underwear, 150-weight, and casual-wear lines, some of the tops and bottoms have printed patterns (like floral motifs or abstract swirls - sometimes in contrasting colors) on the sleeves or in the hip-region. This *can* escape your notice when the only images of the item you have available to you are the tiny product photographs that most internet retailers provide, so do double-check the customer reviews of the item, and maybe the Icebreaker site's own full description of the item, if you want to know for sure if the item comes with a printed pattern on a section of it.---------------------ICEBREAKER SIZING:Sizing and fit are so variable from person to person and from brand to brand, but in case it may help, I'll talk about my experiences with Icebreaker clothing.For reference, generally I am usually a women's size 4 or 6 in US sizing, a women's size 8 or 10 in UK sizing, and a small when it comes to small/medium/large sizing.  This goes for both tops and bottoms.---Sizing of TopsAlmost all of my Icebreaker tops from the last 13 years -- crew tops, long-underwear tops, turtlenecks, and zip-up jackets -- are women's size small.The only tops I have in size extra-small are from the Skin range (which they phased out in 2006, but the sizing and type of material used for the Skin range appear to be very similar to those of the current range called Everyday).Generally, I know that an Icebreaker small top is probably going to fit me.The main issue that I've had with their tops is sleeve length (too long).  This is not uncommon for me, because I do have arms that are on the petite side:  most suit jackets I buy have to be shortened a little in the sleeves, and I often have to turn up sweaters one turn at the cuff.  And one feature of some Icebreaker tops is a thumb loop which necessitates that the sleeves are meant to be about three inches longer than the wrist - I understand this, and just roll those tops up a turn or two.  However, I've read quite a few reviewers' comments that mention that Icebreaker sleeves tend to be long, and I do think that their sleeves are longer than normal.  [""Normal"" being subjective, of course!  ...the only women I've met from New Zealand actually did happen to be tall, lithe, and willowy, so maybe that's normal there.  :-) ]  Last week, I bought a 2012-made Icebreaker ""Oasis"" top in a size small, and while it was too tight in the chest area (which is normally NOT a problem for me with Icebreaker), the sleeves were a crazy four or five inches past my wrist, even though they didn't have thumb holes and therefore were meant to end at the wrist. I had to return it.---Sizing of Leggings:I have run into inconsistency in Icebreaker legging sizes. I have some in extra-small, some in small, and some in medium.  (And in one 2012 collection, the extra-smalls are a little too big for me but there isn't a smaller size to go to.)I have not found Icebreaker's official sizing chart (available on their site) to be terribly accurate for leggings.For the leggings, it seems to me that one must experiment in each Icebreaker clothing range and wool weight to discover the best size and fit for oneself.I will spell out below the ones that I have tried.  Because the sizing of the ""same"" leggings sometimes has varied across the years, I will mention what year I got them.1.  BODYFIT range1a. Bodyfit 150 leggings2006 or 2007 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize medium. The label says ""slim fit"" (possibly back then they had different ""fits"" within the Bodyfit range, but they don't seem to now).Fit me snugly, but well.Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2008 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize small.Are a bit too small for me this winter - they fit me when I'm about 5-to-8 pounds less than I am at the moment.Waistband hits 1 inch below the belly button, feels okay.2012 Bodyfit 150 leggingsI decided not to buy new 150-weight leggings in 2012 because after a few years of heavy use, my old Bodyfit 150 leggings developed some un-mendable ""runs""/""ladders"". I still wear them and love them, but they are slowly self-destructing. It is comparatively easy to snag them on a rough surface or to poke a fingernail through them when pulling them on or off.Actually, I've just looked on the Icebreaker site (December 2012) and they don't list ANY Bodyfit 150 leggings.  The only 150 weight leggings they list are the ""Sprite"" leggings from the Premium Underwear Collection.  Also, I think that the ""Nature"" leggings (which are a discontinued style) were of 150 weight, and I have seen these still on sale on a few websites.1b. Bodyfit 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around eighty (discounted price of around sixty).2008 Bodyfit 200 leggingsSize medium.Fit me, and there is extra room in them - I probably could go up 5 to 8 pounds and they would still fit. When I purchased those mediums, I tried on the small size and found it to be way too small, especially along the tight and narrow waistband that these leggings were made with at the time.  (I think it was a reaction to the consumer response to that waistband that they made the newer waistbands really wide and soft.)Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2012 Bodyfit 200 leggingsAt first, based on the Icebreaker official size chart, I ordered a medium in these.  They were too big, so I exchanged them for a size small.The small fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 or even 3 inches below the belly button. This is a more ""modern"" position for a waistband, of course, compared to coming up to the true waist, but I prefer ""athletic"" base layers to cover my entire body - neck to ankle, to enable the base layer shirts to be securely tucked inside the base layer pants, and to feel really secure when I'm moving around -- but this waistband was so low on me, and so wide and stretchy that it felt like it was about to slide down to my hips at any moment because the elastic wasn't very tight.Not only from the practical side was this low waistband a problem, but MAN, the whole cut of the upper part of these leggings seemed to be designed to make my tummy area look as flabby and unattractive as possible!  I tried my old leggings on when I took these off -- just to check that it wasn't bad lighting or post-Thanksgiving excess weight that was to blame for how these made me look, but my older Icebreaker Bodyfit 200 leggings looked a lot better on me than these leggings did.I had to return them.  I have decided to wait until next year's production, to see if they alter the cut of the waist area.1c. Bodyfit 260 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around ninety (discounted price around seventy-five).2012 Bodyfit 260 leggingsSize small.Fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 inches below the belly button. They had the same issues as the 2012 Bodyfit 200 leggings did - waistband too low, too loose, too wide, and quite unattractive in the belly region!I also had to return these.  I hope next year's will be cut higher on the waist.2.  EVERYDAY range2a. Skin 200 leggings (discontinued 2006) - the Skin range was probably similar to Everyday.2005 Skin 200 leggingsSize extra-small, yet are the largest I own - I could gain 15 pounds and they would still feel okay. But they fit me nicely when I'm at any weight - 10 pounds less or more than my present size - they are simply the coziest and softest that I own.Waistband comes to about 1 inch higher than belly button, feels secure.2b. Everyday 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around sixty (discounted price of around forty-five).2012 Everyday 200 leggingsTwo weeks ago, I bought them in size small which were too big, so I exchanged them for an extra-small.  Even the extra-smalls had extra material in places on the legs, which is unusual because my legs are not toothpicks (this kind of legging is not supposed to be baggy, so the cut of these must have been off).Worse, the upper part of the extra-small leggings was cut strangely - the waistband was in a deep V, so that the middle was 3 inches below my belly-button (which is way too low for me), but the sides rose up 3 inches higher than that (it wasn't a curve, it was a visible V).  Yet the waistband elastic wasn't tight enough, so the tall sides wanted to sag down and bunch up around my hips -- strange.  (And that was not the way the smalls I tried on the week before had fit my waist area!  In fact, I think the smalls of last week fit me better generally than the extra-smalls of this week.)  I don't have the energy to go through the rigamarole of ordering a different pair of extra-smalls, but maybe I just got a bad apple.I had to return the extra-smalls.I was very disappointed because they were the 7th Icebreaker product I've tried in the last 2 weeks.  This Icebreaker shopping quest has taken up a fair bit of my time lately, but I have nothing new to show for it.  I've given up trying to get anything now and will wait a year and see how their 2013 production fits me.3.  OTHER rangesTheir other legging types are more expensive than the Everyday and Bodyfit, and seem to be geared towards high-tech athletic use, or constructed to be worn on their own as pants/trousers. Some have Lycra in them. Check out Icebreaker's site for more info.--------------------------------OTHER TIPSThe other main retailers of this kind of product sometimes offer free shipping on their Amazon listings of an item but don't offer free shipping on the exact same item when sold through their own site (even when the price of the item itself is the same on both sites), so it can save you money if you pay attention to that.The best selection BY FAR is available from the manufacturer's site, but the prices there are generally higher. However, they have discounts from time to time, such as their ""Black Friday"" sale when they offer 30% off all items that are black in color (at least they have done so in prior years).Amazon sometimes calls the Icebreaker Bodyfit range ""BF"" and sometimes ""Bodyfit"", so if you are searching here for Icebreaker's Bodyfit range, do a separate search under each of the two search terms to get the most accurate results.In terms of merino wool socks, I prefer Smartwool socks over Icebreaker's. Sierratradingpost is one retailer which often carries a large selection of them at good prices. Those socks last a really long time. I wear them almost year-round because the lightweight ones breathe really well even when it's warm out.The Smartwool women's small size is the only sock I can find that truly fits my feet (which aren't even that small, all things considered!) without bunching up inside my shoes.If you have a smaller foot (size 7 or less) and are female, note that the Smartwool unisex socks in the small size are bigger than the smalls made just for women, even though that company's size guide says that both sizes are meant to fit the same range of women's shoe","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTO4L2S123XO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJ9AAGI#wasThisHelpful","RTO4L2S123XO5","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Because some of Amazon's listing descriptions for Icebreaker items have very few details about the products, making it difficult for the customer to make an informed purchasing decision if he/she is unfamiliar with this brand of clothing, below I'll type some general information about Icebreaker clothing and some personal impressions of it, based on my experience of their products from 2000 to early 2013.Note that my review is quite long and usually only the first half of it is shown on this page. If this happens on your screen and you wish to read the second half, all you have to do is press the ""read more"" button at the bottom of the review and Amazon will show you the rest of it.  :-)----------------------OVERALL IMPRESSIONIcebreaker's marino wool items are generally made well, last a long time, are easy to care for, feel fantastic on the skin, are ""natural"", don't get smelly easily like polarfleece does, let the skin breathe, etc.Many of my Icebreaker items have been worn and washed several hundred times and are still holding up much better than would be expected.I am a BIG fan of this company's products.  For my overall experience of them from around 2000-2010, I would give them a solid ""5 stars""!However, I regret to say that my opinion of the items I bought from Icebreaker in 2012 was not as high.  In late 2012 I bought 7 different Icebreaker items (most of them in various sizes) and decided to return all of them because they were not as well-cut as the very ""same"" items that I bought in the 2000s (which I still have and wear, so I can make like-for-like comparisons easily).Based solely on my 2012 experience of Icebreaker products, I would give them 3 stars, meaning ""it's ok"".  For me, this is not good enough to command prices of $50 - $100+ for quite simple items, even if the basic wool material itself is outstanding and long-lasting.For my star-rating on this review, I will average the ""5"" I give Icebreaker historically and the ""3"" that I would have given Icebreaker in 2012, and give them a ""4"" now.As of November 2013:  I plan to buy a few items of (presumably) this year's production, which I hope will work out better for me.---------------------MY EXPERIENCE WITH ICEBREAKERI bought my first Icebreaker clothing about 13 years ago when I needed some long underwear for skiing.Up until about 6 years ago, I had been buying Icebreaker items very sparingly, due to the eye-watering prices at London UK sporting goods shops .  Then, I discovered that Sierratradingpost sells various Icebreaker styles (usually discontinued items from years past) on their site for a discount. Fortunately, for a couple of years after I discovered this, they had a large selection of women's Icebreaker stuff, so I bought quite a few things for great prices. (These days, Sierra's Icebreaker selection for women appears to be smaller, and the prices comparatively higher, than before.  I expect that there are more discounters they have to compete with now, to get that kind of stock.)In addition to bricks-and-mortar sports shops and Sierratradingpost, I have also bought Icebreaker items from several sporting goods online retailers, Amazon, and the Icebreaker website.I still have almost every Icebreaker item I've bought.  Even the discounted items have been somewhat pricey, but the quality and longevity were worth the initial investment.----------------------CAVEATWhat I have written below is based on my current knowledge about their products, but it is possible that I have misunderstood some aspects of the brand.If you wish to better understand their product offerings, I would absolutely recommend that you have a look at the Icebreaker official site to view their entire range and gain more clarity about what items are for what purposes, what the wool weights are about, what the quality levels of the different clothing collections are, etc.(Unfortunately, their website, while snazzy, does not fully explain these things, leaving it up to the customer to piece some of the puzzle together.)----------------------ICEBREAKER WOOL WEIGHTS:Icebreaker's marino wool items generally come in four weights of fabric: 150, 200, 260, or 320. This is ""grams per square meter"".150 is quite thin.It provides light warmth.The material is generally see-through.  (I wouldn't wear items of this weight out and about in public without anything over them, but some reviewers have said that they do.)It's good for a first base layer, for strenuous exercise, or for sleeping in.Their items of this weight, especially in the ranges intended for athletic use, tend to be really form-fitting in one's typical size.All Icebreaker material seems VERY resilient and long-lasting to me, but because the 150 wool weight is pretty thin, it is the likeliest to be torn, develop holes, get ""runs"" (like pantyhose).  I don't think this happens too much with it, but I've seen some reviewers mention it (most often talking about how they accidentally poked holes in it with long fingernails), and three of my 150-weight leggings have developed runs in them after several years of heavy use.200 is slightly thicker, but still on the thin side.It's pretty warm.The lighter colors are definitely see-through, such as grey and cream. My older black and brown items made out of 200 weight wool don't seem to be see-through, but some of the newer dark-colored ones might be.It's good for a base layer or mid-weight layer, for exercise, and sleeping in.Especially in the ranges intended for athletic situations, their items of this weight tend to be form-fitting in one's typical size.260 is on the thicker side.It's definitely warm, a cozy weight.None of my 260 items are see-through. I can wear tops made out of this weight on their own (without anything over them) and not worry that my underwear or too many lumps&bumps will show through.It's good for a mid-layer or top-layer, and sleeping in (if you get cold at night, like I do).Items of this weight tend to fit looser than items of the same size in the 150/200 weights do.

Bodyfit 260 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around ninety (discounted price around seventy-five).2012 Bodyfit 260 leggingsSize small.Fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 inches below the belly button. They had the same issues as the 2012 Bodyfit 200 leggings did - waistband too low, too loose, too wide, and quite unattractive in the belly region!I also had to return these.  I hope next year's will be cut higher on the waist.2.  EVERYDAY range2a. Skin 200 leggings (discontinued 2006) - the Skin range was probably similar to Everyday.2005 Skin 200 leggingsSize extra-small, yet are the largest I own - I could gain 15 pounds and they would still feel okay. But they fit me nicely when I'm at any weight - 10 pounds less or more than my present size - they are simply the coziest and softest that I own.Waistband comes to about 1 inch higher than belly button, feels secure.2b. Everyday 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around sixty (discounted price of around forty-five).2012 Everyday 200 leggingsTwo weeks ago, I bought them in size small which were too big, so I exchanged them for an extra-small.  Even the extra-smalls had extra material in places on the legs, which is unusual because my legs are not toothpicks (this kind of legging is not supposed to be baggy, so the cut of these must have been off).Worse, the upper part of the extra-small leggings was cut strangely - the waistband was in a deep V, so that the middle was 3 inches below my belly-button (which is way too low for me), but the sides rose up 3 inches higher than that (it wasn't a curve, it was a visible V).  Yet the waistband elastic wasn't tight enough, so the tall sides wanted to sag down and bunch up around my hips -- strange.  (And that was not the way the smalls I tried on the week before had fit my waist area!  In fact, I think the smalls of last week fit me better generally than the extra-smalls of this week.)  I don't have the energy to go through the rigamarole of ordering a different pair of extra-smalls, but maybe I just got a bad apple.I had to return the extra-smalls.I was very disappointed because they were the 7th Icebreaker product I've tried in the last 2 weeks.  This Icebreaker shopping quest has taken up a fair bit of my time lately, but I have nothing new to show for it.  I've given up trying to get anything now and will wait a year and see how their 2013 production fits me.3.  OTHER rangesTheir other legging types are more expensive than the Everyday and Bodyfit, and seem to be geared towards high-tech athletic use, or constructed to be worn on their own as pants/trousers. Some have Lycra in them. Check out Icebreaker's site for more info.--------------------------------OTHER TIPSThe other main retailers of this kind of product sometimes offer free shipping on their Amazon listings of an item but don't offer free shipping on the exact same item when sold through their own site (even when the price of the item itself is the same on both sites), so it can save you money if you pay attention to that.The best selection BY FAR is available from the manufacturer's site, but the prices there are generally higher. However, they have discounts from time to time, such as their ""Black Friday"" sale when they offer 30% off all items that are black in color (at least they have done so in prior years).Amazon sometimes calls the Icebreaker Bodyfit range ""BF"" and sometimes ""Bodyfit"", so if you are searching here for Icebreaker's Bodyfit range, do a separate search under each of the two search terms to get the most accurate results.In terms of merino wool socks, I prefer Smartwool socks over Icebreaker's. Sierratradingpost is one retailer which often carries a large selection of them at good prices. Those socks last a really long time. I wear them almost year-round because the lightweight ones breathe really well even when it's warm out.The Smartwool women's small size is the only sock I can find that truly fits my feet (which aren't even that small, all things considered!) without bunching up inside my shoes.If you have a smaller foot (size 7 or less) and are female, note that the Smartwool unisex socks in the small size are bigger than the smalls made just for women, even though that company's size guide says that they both are meant to fit the same range of women's shoe sizes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OK16KF6A7H8N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJ9A7P2#wasThisHelpful","R1OK16KF6A7H8N","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Icebreaker's Oasis range and I do not have the best history together.  Compared to their other knit ranges, the Oasis knit seems to me to be flat and taut (and therefore less flexible and comfortable to me as some of their other knits), and the cut in the Oasis tops seems to be too long in the arms but too tight in the bust for my particular shape.  However, I'm sure it's great for women of other shapes!I wear Icebreaker garments year-round, and really love the ones that I have.  Since some listing descriptions for Icebreaker items offer few details about the products, making it difficult for the online customer to make an informed purchasing decision if he/she is unfamiliar with this brand of clothing, I thought I'd type out some general information about Icebreaker clothing and my personal impressions of it, based on my experience of their products from 2000 to early 2013.Note that my review is quite long and usually only the first half of it is shown on this page. If this happens on your screen and you wish to read the second half, all you have to do is press the ""read more"" button at the bottom of the review and Amazon will show you the rest of it.  :-)----------------------OVERALL IMPRESSIONIcebreaker's marino wool items are generally made well, last a long time, are easy to care for, feel fantastic on the skin, are ""natural"", don't get smelly easily like polarfleece does, let the skin breathe, etc.Many of my Icebreaker items have been worn and washed several hundred times and are still holding up much better than would be expected.I am a BIG fan of this company's products.  For my overall experience of them from around 2000-2010, I would give them a solid ""5 stars""!However, I regret to say that my opinion of the items I bought from Icebreaker in 2012 was not as high.  In late 2012 I bought 7 different Icebreaker items (most of them in various sizes) and decided to return all of them because they were not as well-cut as the very ""same"" items that I bought in the 2000s (which I still have and wear, so I can make like-for-like comparisons easily).Based solely on my 2012 experience of Icebreaker products, I would give them 3 stars, meaning ""it's ok"".  For me, this is not good enough to command prices of $50 - $100+ for quite simple items, even if the basic wool material itself is outstanding and long-lasting.For my star-rating on this review, I will average the ""5"" I give Icebreaker historically and the ""3"" that I would have given Icebreaker in 2012, and give them a ""4"" now.As of November 2013:  Soon I plan to buy a few items from this year's production, which I hope will work out better for me.---------------------MY EXPERIENCE WITH ICEBREAKERI bought my first Icebreaker clothing about 13 years ago when I needed some long underwear for skiing.Up until about 6 years ago, I had been buying Icebreaker items very sparingly, due to the eye-watering prices at London UK sporting goods shops .  Then, I discovered that Sierratradingpost sells various Icebreaker styles (usually discontinued items from years past) on their site for a discount. Fortunately, for a couple of years after I discovered this, they had a large selection of women's Icebreaker stuff, so I bought quite a few things for great prices. (These days, Sierra's Icebreaker selection for women appears to be smaller, and the prices comparatively higher, than before.  I expect that there are more discounters they have to compete with now, to get that kind of stock.)In addition to bricks-and-mortar sports shops and Sierratradingpost, I have also bought Icebreaker items from several sporting goods online retailers, Amazon, and the Icebreaker website.I still have almost every Icebreaker item I've bought.  Even the discounted items have been somewhat pricey, but the quality and longevity were worth the initial investment.----------------------CAVEATWhat I have written below is based on my current knowledge about their products, but it is possible that I have misunderstood some aspects of the brand.If you wish to better understand their product offerings, I would absolutely recommend that you have a look at the Icebreaker official site to view their entire range and gain more clarity about what items are for what purposes, what the wool weights are about, what the quality levels of the different clothing collections are, etc.(Unfortunately, their website, while snazzy, does not fully explain these things, leaving it up to the customer to piece some of the puzzle together.)----------------------ICEBREAKER WOOL WEIGHTS:Icebreaker's marino wool items generally come in four weights of fabric: 150, 200, 260, or 320. This is ""grams per square meter"".150 is quite thin.It provides light warmth.The material is generally see-through.  (I wouldn't wear items of this weight out and about in public without anything over them, but some reviewers have said that they do.)It's good for a first base layer, for strenuous exercise, or for sleeping in.Their items of this weight, especially in the ranges intended for athletic use, tend to be really form-fitting in one's typical size.All Icebreaker material seems VERY resilient and long-lasting to me, but because the 150 wool weight is pretty thin, it is the likeliest to be torn, develop holes, get ""runs"" (like pantyhose).  I don't think this happens too much with it, but I've seen some reviewers mention it (most often talking about how they accidentally poked holes in it with long fingernails), and three of my 150-weight leggings have developed runs in them after several years of heavy use.200 is slightly thicker, but still on the thin side.It's pretty warm.The lighter colors are definitely see-through, such as grey and cream. My older black and brown items made out of 200 weight wool don't seem to be see-through, but some of the newer dark-colored ones might be.It's good for a base layer or mid-weight layer, for exercise, and sleeping in.Especially in the ranges intended for athletic situations, their items of this weight tend to be form-fitting in one's typical size.260 is on the thicker side.It's definitely warm, a cozy weight.None of my 260 items are see-through. I can wear tops made out of this weight on their own (without anything over them) and not worry that my underwear or too many lumps&bumps will show through.It's good for a mid-layer or top-layer, and sleeping in (if you get cold at night, like I do).Items of this weight tend to fit looser than items of the same size in the 150/200 weights do. This may have something to do with how much naturally-stretchier the thicker fabric is, but it also seems that they cut these 260-weight items bigger because this weight is often worn as a top-layer or middle-layer, instead of as a base-layer.I like this weight the best.  I think that the company says that this is their most popular weight across the board.320 is thickest, of course.It is quite warm, very toasty and sturdy.This weight is generally a top-layer, so items made out of this material are relatively loosely-cut.--------------------------ICEBREAKER LINES / RANGES / ""COLLECTIONS"" OF CLOTHING:Icebreaker makes different ranges - some intended for wearing as normal underwear (like panties and sports bras and tank tops), some intended for wearing as thermal/long underwear, some intended for wearing as everyday clothing, and some intended for wearing as athletic wear.Even though at first glance most of their items appear VERY similar to each other, there are different feelings to the fabrics (even in fabrics of the same wool weight), different quality levels, different cuts, and different design details amongst these different lines, so it is good to check their website about the particular Icebreaker item you are thinking of buying to make sure that it is intended for the activity you want it for.Two of the popular ranges at the lower end of the Icebreaker price scale are:BodyfitThe Bodyfit range seems to be for athletic situations, but also casual-wear and sleeping-in. The knit of this range's wool is usually flatter and less stretchy than the knit of the ranges that are for underwear or purely casual wear. Items in this range are usually cut to fit relatively snugly.EverydayThis range is made of a looser, thicker, stretchier knit than the Bodyfit, and is more for general sleeping-in and casual long-underwear needs, not so much for athletic situations. (However, I'm sure that they would be okay in many athletic situations, and I have worn them skiing and hiking.) Everyday items tend to be made of a stretchier knit and cut to fit more loosely than the Bodyfit items. I wear a size below my ordinary size in this range.Other rangesTheir other ranges appear to include: Black Sheep Collection, RealFleece Collection, Pure Plus Collection, Journeys Travel Collection, Premium Underwear Collection, GT Technical Sports Collection, GT Bike Collection, Technical Base Layers Collection, and Technical Mid Layers Collection. Please see the Icebreaker site for more information on their ranges.Frankly, I feel that they've made this aspect of their brand over-complicated and too confusing for the average customer, and I have not been able to locate any overview of the various collections on their site or on their product packaging materials.-----------------------ICEBREAKER COLORS:Icebreaker tends to make most items in black, as their basic universal color.Many items are offered in about 2 to 8 other colors, as well.  There is often some version of blue, red, grey, and green - sometimes a pink, sometimes a brown or purple, etc. Often the colors are skewed towards the cool end of the spectrum (which I notice because my coloring is on the warm end of the spectrum and cool tones look awful on me).The different weights of wool and/or different ranges (e.g., Bodyfit, Everyday, Journeys Travel Collection, etc.) will tend to have their own mini-set of color options.  (For example, the current grey color in the 200 Bodyfit is a medium-grey and is called ""blizzard"" and the current grey color in the 260 Bodyfit is a dark-grey and called ""metro"", and they don't offer those particular colors in other weights of wool or other ranges, as far as I know.)They change their colors every year or so (I think), and some colors tend to sell out mid-way through a season and are not restocked, so if you see an item in a color that you love, or there is a matching set (of long underwear or something) and you want both pieces in the same color, you probably should get it at the time, because it's not guaranteed that it will be available in the future.---------------------EXTRA DESIGN FLOURISHES:A couple of their ranges, mainly the more athletic lines, feature ""pops"" of contrasting color in a certain part of the garment, such as a stripe running down the sleeves or down the sides, or a triangle of bright material at the ankle. Most internet retailers' photographs of the garments do show these features because the areas of differing colors are pretty obvious, but it pays to read the item descriptions (and check out the manufacturer's site for confirmation) if this kind of thing is not what you are looking for.In a couple of their clothing ranges, mainly the underwear, 150-weight, and casual-wear lines, some of the tops and bottoms have printed patterns (like floral motifs or abstract swirls - sometimes in contrasting colors) on the sleeves or in the hip-region. This *can* escape your notice when the only images of the item you have available to you are the tiny product photographs that most internet retailers provide, so do double-check the customer reviews of the item, and maybe the Icebreaker site's own full description of the item, if you want to know for sure if the item comes with a printed pattern on a section of it.---------------------ICEBREAKER SIZING:Sizing and fit are so variable from person to person and from brand to brand, but in case it may help, I'll talk about my experiences with Icebreaker clothing.For reference, generally I am usually a women's size 4 or 6 in US sizing, a women's size 8 or 10 in UK sizing, and a small when it comes to small/medium/large sizing.  This goes for both tops and bottoms.---Sizing of TopsAlmost all of my Icebreaker tops from the last 13 years -- crew tops, long-underwear tops, turtlenecks, and zip-up jackets -- are women's size small.The only tops I have in size extra-small are from the Skin range (which they phased out in 2006, but the sizing and type of material used for the Skin range appear to be very similar to those of the current range called Everyday).Generally, I know that an Icebreaker small top is probably going to fit me.The main issue that I've had with their tops is sleeve length (too long).  This is not uncommon for me, because I do have arms that are on the petite side:  most suit jackets I buy have to be shortened a little in the sleeves, and I often have to turn up sweaters one turn at the cuff.  And one feature of some Icebreaker tops is a thumb loop which necessitates that the sleeves are meant to be about three inches longer than the wrist - I understand this, and just roll those tops up a turn or two.  However, I've read quite a few reviewers' comments that mention that Icebreaker sleeves tend to be long, and I do think that their sleeves are longer than normal.  [""Normal"" being subjective, of course!  ...the only women I've met from New Zealand actually did happen to be tall, lithe, and willowy, so maybe that's normal there.  :-) ]  Last week, I bought a 2012-made Icebreaker ""Oasis"" top in a size small, and while it was too tight in the chest area (which is normally NOT a problem for me with Icebreaker), the sleeves were a crazy four or five inches past my wrist, even though they didn't have thumb holes and therefore were meant to end at the wrist. I had to return it.---Sizing of Leggings:I have run into inconsistency in Icebreaker legging sizes. I have some in extra-small, some in small, and some in medium.  (And in one 2012 collection, the extra-smalls are a little too big for me but there isn't a smaller size to go to.)I have not found Icebreaker's official sizing chart (available on their site) to be terribly accurate for leggings.For the leggings, it seems to me that one must experiment in each Icebreaker clothing range and wool weight to discover the best size and fit for oneself.I will spell out below the ones that I have tried.  Because the sizing of the ""same"" leggings sometimes has varied across the years, I will mention what year I got them.1.  BODYFIT range1a. Bodyfit 150 leggings2006 or 2007 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize medium. The label says ""slim fit"" (possibly back then they had different ""fits"" within the Bodyfit range, but they don't seem to now).Fit me snugly, but well.Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2008 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize small.Are a bit too small for me this winter - they fit me when I'm about 5-to-8 pounds less than I am at the moment.Waistband hits 1 inch below the belly button, feels okay.2012 Bodyfit 150 leggingsI decided not to buy new 150-weight leggings in 2012 because after a few years of heavy use, my old Bodyfit 150 leggings developed some un-mendable ""runs""/""ladders"". I still wear them and love them, but they are slowly self-destructing. It is comparatively easy to snag them on a rough surface or to poke a fingernail through them when pulling them on or off.Actually, I've just looked on the Icebreaker site (December 2012) and they don't list ANY Bodyfit 150 leggings.  The only 150 weight leggings they list are the ""Sprite"" leggings from the Premium Underwear Collection.  Also, I think that the ""Nature"" leggings (which are a discontinued style) were of 150 weight, and I have seen these still on sale on a few websites.1b. Bodyfit 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around eighty (discounted price of around sixty).2008 Bodyfit 200 leggingsSize medium.Fit me, and there is extra room in them - I probably could go up 5 to 8 pounds and they would still fit. When I purchased those mediums, I tried on the small size and found it to be way too small, especially along the tight and narrow waistband that these leggings were made with at the time.  (I think it was a reaction to the consumer response to that waistband that they made the newer waistbands really wide and soft.)Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2012 Bodyfit 200 leggingsAt first, based on the Icebreaker official size chart, I ordered a medium in these.  They were too big, so I exchanged them for a size small.The small fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 or even 3 inches below the belly button. This is a more ""modern"" position for a waistband, of course, compared to coming up to the true waist, but I prefer ""athletic"" base layers to cover my entire body - neck to ankle, to enable the base layer shirts to be securely tucked inside the base layer pants, and to feel really secure when I'm moving around -- but this waistband was so low on me, and so wide and stretchy that it felt like it was about to slide down to my hips at any moment because the elastic wasn't very tight.Not only from the practical side was this low waistband a problem, but MAN, the whole cut of the upper part of these leggings seemed to be designed to make my tummy area look as flabby and unattractive as possible!  I tried my old leggings on when I took these off -- just to check that it wasn't bad lighting or post-Thanksgiving excess weight that was to blame for how these made me look, but my older Icebreaker Bodyfit 200 leggings looked a lot better on me than these leggings did.I had to return them.  I have decided to wait until next year's production, to see if they alter the cut of the waist area.1c. Bodyfit 260 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around ninety (discounted price around seventy-five).2012 Bodyfit 260 leggingsSize small.Fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 inches below the belly button. They had the same issues as the 2012 Bodyfit 200 leggings did - waistband too low, too loose, too wide, and quite unattractive in the belly region!I also had to return these.  I hope next year's will be cut higher on the waist.2.  EVERYDAY range2a. Skin 200 leggings (discontinued 2006) - the Skin range was probably similar to Everyday.2005 Skin 200 leggingsSize extra-small, yet are the largest I own - I could gain 15 pounds and they would still feel okay. But they fit me nicely when I'm at any weight - 10 pounds less or more than my present size - they are simply the coziest and softest that I own.Waistband comes to about 1 inch higher than belly button, feels secure.2b. Everyday 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around sixty (discounted price of around forty-five).2012 Everyday 200 leggingsTwo weeks ago, I bought them in size small which were too big, so I exchanged them for an extra-small.  Even the extra-smalls had extra material in places on the legs, which is unusual because my legs are not toothpicks (this kind of legging is not supposed to be baggy, so the cut of these must have been off).Worse, the upper part of the extra-small leggings was cut strangely - the waistband was in a deep V, so that the middle was 3 inches below my belly-button (which is way too low for me), but the sides rose up 3 inches higher than that (it wasn't a curve, it was a visible V).

"This ""tech top"" with the half-zip is one of my favorite styles of Icebreaker clothing.  It's always the first thing I put in my suitcase, no matter what time of year or where I'm going!  Originally I bought one in black about 6 years ago, and then when I found them on sale, I bought two more (also in black) to have as back-ups!  However, I bought one of these in grey from Amazon earlier this year, but it didn't the same fit or look as my previous black ones, and I sent it back.

I don't think this happens too much with it, but I've seen some reviewers mention it (most often talking about how they accidentally poked holes in it with long fingernails), and three of my 150-weight leggings have developed runs in them after several years of heavy use.200 is slightly thicker, but still on the thin side.It's pretty warm.The lighter colors are definitely see-through, such as grey and cream. My older black and brown items made out of 200 weight wool don't seem to be see-through, but some of the newer dark-colored ones might be.It's good for a base layer or mid-weight layer, for exercise, and sleeping in.Especially in the ranges intended for athletic situations, their items of this weight tend to be form-fitting in one's typical size.260 is on the thicker side.It's definitely warm, a cozy weight.None of my 260 items are see-through. I can wear tops made out of this weight on their own (without anything over them) and not worry that my underwear or too many lumps&bumps will show through.It's good for a mid-layer or top-layer, and sleeping in (if you get cold at night, like I do).Items of this weight tend to fit looser than items of the same size in the 150/200 weights do. This may have something to do with how much naturally-stretchier the thicker fabric is, but it also seems that they cut these 260-weight items bigger because this weight is often worn as a top-layer or middle-layer, instead of as a base-layer.I like this weight the best.  I think that the company says that this is their most popular weight across the board.320 is thickest, of course.It is quite warm, very toasty and sturdy.This weight is generally a top-layer, so items made out of this material are relatively loosely-cut.--------------------------ICEBREAKER LINES / RANGES / ""COLLECTIONS"" OF CLOTHING:Icebreaker makes different ranges - some intended for wearing as normal underwear (like panties and sports bras and tank tops), some intended for wearing as thermal/long underwear, some intended for wearing as everyday clothing, and some intended for wearing as athletic wear.Even though at first glance most of their items appear VERY similar to each other, there are different feelings to the fabrics (even in fabrics of the same wool weight), different quality levels, different cuts, and different design details amongst these different lines, so it is good to check their website about the particular Icebreaker item you are thinking of buying to make sure that it is intended for the activity you want it for.Two of the popular ranges at the lower end of the Icebreaker price scale are:BodyfitThe Bodyfit range seems to be for athletic situations, but also casual-wear and sleeping-in. The knit of this range's wool is usually flatter and less stretchy than the knit of the ranges that are for underwear or purely casual wear. Items in this range are usually cut to fit relatively snugly.EverydayThis range is made of a looser, thicker, stretchier knit than the Bodyfit, and is more for general sleeping-in and casual long-underwear needs, not so much for athletic situations. (However, I'm sure that they would be okay in many athletic situations, and I have worn them skiing and hiking.) Everyday items tend to be made of a stretchier knit and cut to fit more loosely than the Bodyfit items. I wear a size below my ordinary size in this range.Other rangesTheir other ranges appear to include: Black Sheep Collection, RealFleece Collection, Pure Plus Collection, Journeys Travel Collection, Premium Underwear Collection, GT Technical Sports Collection, GT Bike Collection, Technical Base Layers Collection, and Technical Mid Layers Collection. Please see the Icebreaker site for more information on their ranges.Frankly, I feel that they've made this aspect of their brand over-complicated and too confusing for the average customer, and I have not been able to locate any overview of the various collections on their site or on their product packaging materials.-----------------------ICEBREAKER COLORS:Icebreaker tends to make most items in black, as their basic universal color.Many items are offered in about 2 to 8 other colors, as well.  There is often some version of blue, red, grey, and green - sometimes a pink, sometimes a brown or purple, etc. Often the colors are skewed towards the cool end of the spectrum (which I notice because my coloring is on the warm end of the spectrum and cool tones look awful on me).The different weights of wool and/or different ranges (e.g., Bodyfit, Everyday, Journeys Travel Collection, etc.) will tend to have their own mini-set of color options.  (For example, the current grey color in the 200 Bodyfit is a medium-grey and is called ""blizzard"" and the current grey color in the 260 Bodyfit is a dark-grey and called ""metro"", and they don't offer those particular colors in other weights of wool or other ranges, as far as I know.)They change their colors every year or so (I think), and some colors tend to sell out mid-way through a season and are not restocked, so if you see an item in a color that you love, or there is a matching set (of long underwear or something) and you want both pieces in the same color, you probably should get it at the time, because it's not guaranteed that it will be available in the future.---------------------EXTRA DESIGN FLOURISHES:A couple of their ranges, mainly the more athletic lines, feature ""pops"" of contrasting color in a certain part of the garment, such as a stripe running down the sleeves or down the sides, or a triangle of bright material at the ankle. Most internet retailers' photographs of the garments do show these features because the areas of differing colors are pretty obvious, but it pays to read the item descriptions (and check out the manufacturer's site for confirmation) if this kind of thing is not what you are looking for.In a couple of their clothing ranges, mainly the underwear, 150-weight, and casual-wear lines, some of the tops and bottoms have printed patterns (like floral motifs or abstract swirls - sometimes in contrasting colors) on the sleeves or in the hip-region. This *can* escape your notice when the only images of the item you have available to you are the tiny product photographs that most internet retailers provide, so do double-check the customer reviews of the item, and maybe the Icebreaker site's own full description of the item, if you want to know for sure if the item comes with a printed pattern on a section of it.---------------------ICEBREAKER SIZING:Sizing and fit are so variable from person to person and from brand to brand, but in case it may help, I'll talk about my experiences with Icebreaker clothing.For reference, generally I am usually a women's size 4 or 6 in US sizing, a women's size 8 or 10 in UK sizing, and a small when it comes to small/medium/large sizing.  This goes for both tops and bottoms.---Sizing of TopsAlmost all of my Icebreaker tops from the last 13 years -- crew tops, long-underwear tops, turtlenecks, and zip-up jackets -- are women's size small.The only tops I have in size extra-small are from the Skin range (which they phased out in 2006, but the sizing and type of material used for the Skin range appear to be very similar to those of the current range called Everyday).Generally, I know that an Icebreaker small top is probably going to fit me.The main issue that I've had with their tops is sleeve length (too long).  This is not uncommon for me, because I do have arms that are on the petite side:  most suit jackets I buy have to be shortened a little in the sleeves, and I often have to turn up sweaters one turn at the cuff.  And one feature of some Icebreaker tops is a thumb loop which necessitates that the sleeves are meant to be about three inches longer than the wrist - I understand this, and just roll those tops up a turn or two.  However, I've read quite a few reviewers' comments that mention that Icebreaker sleeves tend to be long, and I do think that their sleeves are longer than normal.  [""Normal"" being subjective, of course!  ...the only women I've met from New Zealand actually did happen to be tall, lithe, and willowy, so maybe that's normal there.  :-) ]  Last week, I bought a 2012-made Icebreaker ""Oasis"" top in a size small, and while it was too tight in the chest area (which is normally NOT a problem for me with Icebreaker), the sleeves were a crazy four or five inches past my wrist, even though they didn't have thumb holes and therefore were meant to end at the wrist. I had to return it.---Sizing of Leggings:I have run into inconsistency in Icebreaker legging sizes. I have some in extra-small, some in small, and some in medium.  (And in one 2012 collection, the extra-smalls are a little too big for me but there isn't a smaller size to go to.)I have not found Icebreaker's official sizing chart (available on their site) to be terribly accurate for leggings.For the leggings, it seems to me that one must experiment in each Icebreaker clothing range and wool weight to discover the best size and fit for oneself.I will spell out below the ones that I have tried.  Because the sizing of the ""same"" leggings sometimes has varied across the years, I will mention what year I got them.1.  BODYFIT range1a. Bodyfit 150 leggings2006 or 2007 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize medium. The label says ""slim fit"" (possibly back then they had different ""fits"" within the Bodyfit range, but they don't seem to now).Fit me snugly, but well.Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2008 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize small.Are a bit too small for me this winter - they fit me when I'm about 5-to-8 pounds less than I am at the moment.Waistband hits 1 inch below the belly button, feels okay.2012 Bodyfit 150 leggingsI decided not to buy new 150-weight leggings in 2012 because after a few years of heavy use, my old Bodyfit 150 leggings developed some un-mendable ""runs""/""ladders"". I still wear them and love them, but they are slowly self-destructing. It is comparatively easy to snag them on a rough surface or to poke a fingernail through them when pulling them on or off.Actually, I've just looked on the Icebreaker site (December 2012) and they don't list ANY Bodyfit 150 leggings.  The only 150 weight leggings they list are the ""Sprite"" leggings from the Premium Underwear Collection.  Also, I think that the ""Nature"" leggings (which are a discontinued style) were of 150 weight, and I have seen these still on sale on a few websites.1b. Bodyfit 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around eighty (discounted price of around sixty).2008 Bodyfit 200 leggingsSize medium.Fit me, and there is extra room in them - I probably could go up 5 to 8 pounds and they would still fit. When I purchased those mediums, I tried on the small size and found it to be way too small, especially along the tight and narrow waistband that these leggings were made with at the time.  (I think it was a reaction to the consumer response to that waistband that they made the newer waistbands really wide and soft.)Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2012 Bodyfit 200 leggingsAt first, based on the Icebreaker official size chart, I ordered a medium in these.  They were too big, so I exchanged them for a size small.The small fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 or even 3 inches below the belly button. This is a more ""modern"" position for a waistband, of course, compared to coming up to the true waist, but I prefer ""athletic"" base layers to cover my entire body - neck to ankle, to enable the base layer shirts to be securely tucked inside the base layer pants, and to feel really secure when I'm moving around -- but this waistband was so low on me, and so wide and stretchy that it felt like it was about to slide down to my hips at any moment because the elastic wasn't very tight.Not only from the practical side was this low waistband a problem, but MAN, the whole cut of the upper part of these leggings seemed to be designed to make my tummy area look as flabby and unattractive as possible!  I tried my old leggings on when I took these off -- just to check that it wasn't bad lighting or post-Thanksgiving excess weight that was to blame for how these made me look, but my older Icebreaker Bodyfit 200 leggings looked a lot better on me than these leggings did.I had to return them.  I have decided to wait until next year's production, to see if they alter the cut of the waist area.1c. Bodyfit 260 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around ninety (discounted price around seventy-five).2012 Bodyfit 260 leggingsSize small.Fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 inches below the belly button. They had the same issues as the 2012 Bodyfit 200 leggings did - waistband too low, too loose, too wide, and quite unattractive in the belly region!I also had to return these.  I hope next year's will be cut higher on the waist.2.  EVERYDAY range2a. Skin 200 leggings (discontinued 2006) - the Skin range was probably similar to Everyday.2005 Skin 200 leggingsSize extra-small, yet are the largest I own - I could gain 15 pounds and they would still feel okay. But they fit me nicely when I'm at any weight - 10 pounds less or more than my present size - they are simply the coziest and softest that I own.Waistband comes to about 1 inch higher than belly button, feels secure.2b. Everyday 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around sixty (discounted price of around forty-five).2012 Everyday 200 leggingsTwo weeks ago, I bought them in size small which were too big, so I exchanged them for an extra-small.  Even the extra-smalls had extra material in places on the legs, which is unusual because my legs are not toothpicks (this kind of legging is not supposed to be baggy, so the cut of these must have been off).Worse, the upper part of the extra-small leggings was cut strangely - the waistband was in a deep V, so that the middle was 3 inches below my belly-button (which is way too low for me), but the sides rose up 3 inches higher than that (it wasn't a curve, it was a visible V).  Yet the waistband elastic wasn't tight enough, so the tall sides wanted to sag down and bunch up around my hips -- strange.  (And that was not the way the smalls I tried on the week before had fit my waist area!  In fact, I think the smalls of last week fit me better generally than the extra-smalls of this week.)  I don't have the energy to go through the rigamarole of ordering a different pair of extra-smalls, but maybe I just got a bad apple.I had to return the extra-smalls.I was very disappointed because they were the 7th Icebreaker product I've tried in the last 2 weeks.  This Icebreaker shopping quest has taken up a fair bit of my time lately, but I have nothing new to show for it.  I've given up trying to get anything now and will wait a year and see how their 2013 production fits me.3.  OTHER rangesTheir other legging types are more expensive than the Everyday and Bodyfit, and seem to be geared towards high-tech athletic use, or constructed to be worn on their own as pants/trousers. Some have Lycra in them. Check out Icebreaker's site for more info.--------------------------------OTHER TIPSThe other main retailers of this kind of product sometimes offer free shipping on their Amazon listings of an item but don't offer free shipping on the exact same item when sold through their own site (even when the price of the item itself is the same on both sites), so it can save you money if you pay attention to that.The best selection BY FAR is available from the manufacturer's site, but the prices there are generally higher. However, they have discounts from time to time, such as their ""Black Friday"" sale when they offer 30% off all items that are black in color (at least they have done so in prior years).Amazon sometimes calls the Icebreaker Bodyfit range ""BF"" and sometimes ""Bodyfit"", so if you are searching here for Icebreaker's Bodyfit range, do a separate search under each of the two search terms to get the most accurate results.In terms of merino wool socks, I prefer Smartwool socks over Icebreaker's. Sierratradingpost is one retailer which often carries a large selection of them at good prices. Those socks last a really long time. I wear them almost year-round because the lightweight ones breathe really well even when it's warm out.The Smartwool women's small size is the only sock I can find that truly fits my feet (which aren't even that small, all things considered!) without bunching up inside my shoes.If you have a smaller foot (size 7 or less) and are female, note that the Smartwool unisex socks in the small size are bigger than the smalls made just for women, even though that company's size guide says that both sizes are meant to fit the same range of women's shoe sizes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EV2SC1ZHV9IS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJ9A2DY#wasThisHelpful","R3EV2SC1ZHV9IS","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Because some of Amazon's listing descriptions for Icebreaker items have very few details about the products, making it difficult for the customer to make an informed purchasing decision if he/she is unfamiliar with this brand of clothing, below I'll type some general information about Icebreaker clothing and some personal impressions of it, based on my experience of their products from 2000 to early 2013.Note that my review is quite long and usually only the first half of it is shown on this page. If this happens on your screen and you wish to read the second half, all you have to do is press the ""read more"" button at the bottom of the review and Amazon will show you the rest of it.  :-)----------------------OVERALL IMPRESSIONIcebreaker's marino wool items are generally made well, last a long time, are easy to care for, feel fantastic on the skin, are ""natural"", don't get smelly easily like polarfleece does, let the skin breathe, etc.Many of my Icebreaker items have been worn and washed several hundred times and are still holding up much better than would be expected.I am a BIG fan of this company's products.  For my overall experience of them from around 2000-2010, I would give them a solid ""5 stars""!However, I regret to say that my opinion of the items I bought from Icebreaker in 2012 was not as high.  In late 2012 I bought 7 different Icebreaker items (most of them in various sizes) and decided to return all of them because they were not as well-cut as the very ""same"" items that I bought in the 2000s (which I still have and wear, so I can make like-for-like comparisons easily).Based solely on my 2012 experience of Icebreaker products, I would give them 3 stars, meaning ""it's ok"".  For me, this is not good enough to command prices of $50 - $100+ for quite simple items, even if the basic wool material itself is outstanding and long-lasting.For my star-rating on this review, I will average the ""5"" I give Icebreaker historically and the ""3"" that I would have given Icebreaker in 2012, and give them a ""4"" now.As of November 2013:  I plan to buy a few items of (presumably) this year's production, which I hope will work out better for me.---------------------MY EXPERIENCE WITH ICEBREAKERI bought my first Icebreaker clothing about 13 years ago when I needed some long underwear for skiing.Up until about 6 years ago, I had been buying Icebreaker items very sparingly, due to the eye-watering prices at London UK sporting goods shops .  Then, I discovered that Sierratradingpost sells various Icebreaker styles (usually discontinued items from years past) on their site for a discount. Fortunately, for a couple of years after I discovered this, they had a large selection of women's Icebreaker stuff, so I bought quite a few things for great prices. (These days, Sierra's Icebreaker selection for women appears to be smaller, and the prices comparatively higher, than before.  I expect that there are more discounters they have to compete with now, to get that kind of stock.)In addition to bricks-and-mortar sports shops and Sierratradingpost, I have also bought Icebreaker items from several sporting goods online retailers, Amazon, and the Icebreaker website.I still have almost every Icebreaker item I've bought.  Even the discounted items have been somewhat pricey, but the quality and longevity were worth the initial investment.----------------------CAVEATWhat I have written below is based on my current knowledge about their products, but it is possible that I have misunderstood some aspects of the brand.If you wish to better understand their product offerings, I would absolutely recommend that you have a look at the Icebreaker official site to view their entire range and gain more clarity about what items are for what purposes, what the wool weights are about, what the quality levels of the different clothing collections are, etc.(Unfortunately, their website, while snazzy, does not fully explain these things, leaving it up to the customer to piece some of the puzzle together.)----------------------ICEBREAKER WOOL WEIGHTS:Icebreaker's marino wool items generally come in four weights of fabric: 150, 200, 260, or 320. This is ""grams per square meter"".150 is quite thin.It provides light warmth.The material is generally see-through.  (I wouldn't wear items of this weight out and about in public without anything over them, but some reviewers have said that they do.)It's good for a first base layer, for strenuous exercise, or for sleeping in.Their items of this weight, especially in the ranges intended for athletic use, tend to be really form-fitting in one's typical size.All Icebreaker material seems VERY resilient and long-lasting to me, but because the 150 wool weight is pretty thin, it is the likeliest to be torn, develop holes, get ""runs"" (like pantyhose).

(I think it was a reaction to the consumer response to that waistband that they made the newer waistbands really wide and soft.)Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2012 Bodyfit 200 leggingsAt first, based on the Icebreaker official size chart, I ordered a medium in these.  They were too big, so I exchanged them for a size small.The small fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 or even 3 inches below the belly button. This is a more ""modern"" position for a waistband, of course, compared to coming up to the true waist, but I prefer ""athletic"" base layers to cover my entire body - neck to ankle, to enable the base layer shirts to be securely tucked inside the base layer pants, and to feel really secure when I'm moving around -- but this waistband was so low on me, and so wide and stretchy that it felt like it was about to slide down to my hips at any moment because the elastic wasn't very tight.Not only from the practical side was this low waistband a problem, but MAN, the whole cut of the upper part of these leggings seemed to be designed to make my tummy area look as flabby and unattractive as possible!  I tried my old leggings on when I took these off -- just to check that it wasn't bad lighting or post-Thanksgiving excess weight that was to blame for how these made me look, but my older Icebreaker Bodyfit 200 leggings looked a lot better on me than these leggings did.I had to return them.  I have decided to wait until next year's production, to see if they alter the cut of the waist area.1c.

They had the same issues as the 2012 Bodyfit 200 leggings did - waistband too low, too loose, too wide, and quite unattractive in the belly region!I also had to return these.  I hope next year's will be cut higher on the waist.2.  EVERYDAY range2a. Skin 200 leggings (discontinued 2006) - the Skin range was probably similar to Everyday.2005 Skin 200 leggingsSize extra-small, yet are the largest I own - I could gain 15 pounds and they would still feel okay. But they fit me nicely when I'm at any weight - 10 pounds less or more than my present size - they are simply the coziest and softest that I own.Waistband comes to about 1 inch higher than belly button, feels secure.2b. Everyday 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around sixty (discounted price of around forty-five).2012 Everyday 200 leggingsTwo weeks ago, I bought them in size small which were too big, so I exchanged them for an extra-small.  Even the extra-smalls had extra material in places on the legs, which is unusual because my legs are not toothpicks (this kind of legging is not supposed to be baggy, so the cut of these must have been off).Worse, the upper part of the extra-small leggings was cut strangely - the waistband was in a deep V, so that the middle was 3 inches below my belly-button (which is way too low for me), but the sides rose up 3 inches higher than that (it wasn't a curve, it was a visible V).  Yet the waistband elastic wasn't tight enough, so the tall sides wanted to sag down and bunch up around my hips -- strange.  (And that was not the way the smalls I tried on the week before had fit my waist area!  In fact, I think the smalls of last week fit me better generally than the extra-smalls of this week.)  I don't have the energy to go through the rigamarole of ordering a different pair of extra-smalls, but maybe I just got a bad apple.I had to return the extra-smalls.I was very disappointed because they were the 7th Icebreaker product I've tried in the last 2 weeks.  This Icebreaker shopping quest has taken up a fair bit of my time lately, but I have nothing new to show for it.  I've given up trying to get anything now and will wait a year and see how their 2013 production fits me.3.  OTHER rangesTheir other legging types are more expensive than the Everyday and Bodyfit, and seem to be geared towards high-tech athletic use, or constructed to be worn on their own as pants/trousers. Some have Lycra in them. Check out Icebreaker's site for more info.--------------------------------OTHER TIPSThe other main retailers of this kind of product sometimes offer free shipping on their Amazon listings of an item but don't offer free shipping on the exact same item when sold through their own site (even when the price of the item itself is the same on both sites), so it can save you money if you pay attention to that.The best selection BY FAR is available from the manufacturer's site, but the prices there are generally higher. However, they have discounts from time to time, such as their ""Black Friday"" sale when they offer 30% off all items that are black in color (at least they have done so in prior years).Amazon sometimes calls the Icebreaker Bodyfit range ""BF"" and sometimes ""Bodyfit"", so if you are searching here for Icebreaker's Bodyfit range, do a separate search under each of the two search terms to get the most accurate results.In terms of merino wool socks, I prefer Smartwool socks over Icebreaker's. Sierratradingpost is one retailer which often carries a large selection of them at good prices. Those socks last a really long time. I wear them almost year-round because the lightweight ones breathe really well even when it's warm out.The Smartwool women's small size is the only sock I can find that truly fits my feet (which aren't even that small, all things considered!) without bunching up inside my shoes.If you have a smaller foot (size 7 or less) and are female, note that the Smartwool unisex socks in the small size are bigger than the smalls made just for women, even though that company's size guide says that they both are meant to fit the same range of women's shoe sizes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IUHM7DBYFL1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJ9E7CG#wasThisHelpful","R2IUHM7DBYFL1H","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This hooded version of the Oasis top might be a recent addition to their line-up - it is the first time I've seen it.  If you would like to read some customer reviews on the crew-neck version of this top, there are over 40 reviews on Amazon's listing page for: ""Icebreaker Women's Oasis Long Sleeve Crewe Top"".I wear Icebreaker garments year-round, and really love the ones that I have. Since some listing descriptions for Icebreaker items offer few details about the products, making it difficult for the online customer to make an informed purchasing decision if he/she is unfamiliar with this brand of clothing, I thought I'd type out some general information about Icebreaker clothing and my personal impressions of it, based on my experience of their products from 2000 to early 2013.Note that my review is quite long and usually only the first half of it is shown on this page. If this happens on your screen and you wish to read the second half, all you have to do is press the ""read more"" button at the bottom of the review and Amazon will show you the rest of it. :-)----------------------OVERALL IMPRESSIONIcebreaker's marino wool items are generally made well, last a long time, are easy to care for, feel fantastic on the skin, are ""natural"", don't get smelly easily like polarfleece does, let the skin breathe, etc.Many of my Icebreaker items have been worn and washed several hundred times and are still holding up much better than would be expected.I am a BIG fan of this company's products. For my overall experience of them from around 2000-2010, I would give them a solid ""5 stars""!However, I regret to say that my opinion of the items I bought from Icebreaker in 2012 was not as high. In late 2012 I bought 7 different Icebreaker items (most of them in various sizes) and decided to return all of them because they were not as well-cut as the very ""same"" items that I bought in the 2000s (which I still have and wear, so I can make like-for-like comparisons easily).Based solely on my 2012 experience of Icebreaker products, I would give them 3 stars, meaning ""it's ok"". For me, this is not good enough to command prices of $50 - $100+ for quite simple items, even if the basic wool material itself is outstanding and long-lasting.For my star-rating on this review, I will average the ""5"" I give Icebreaker historically and the ""3"" that I would have given Icebreaker in 2012, and give them a ""4"" now.As of November 2013: Soon I plan to buy a few items from this year's production, which I hope will work out better for me.---------------------MY EXPERIENCE WITH ICEBREAKERI bought my first Icebreaker clothing about 13 years ago when I needed some long underwear for skiing.Up until about 6 years ago, I had been buying Icebreaker items very sparingly, due to the eye-watering prices at London UK sporting goods shops . Then, I discovered that Sierratradingpost sells various Icebreaker styles (usually discontinued items from years past) on their site for a discount. Fortunately, for a couple of years after I discovered this, they had a large selection of women's Icebreaker stuff, so I bought quite a few things for great prices. (These days, Sierra's Icebreaker selection for women appears to be smaller, and the prices comparatively higher, than before. I expect that there are more discounters they have to compete with now, to get that kind of stock.)In addition to bricks-and-mortar sports shops and Sierratradingpost, I have also bought Icebreaker items from several sporting goods online retailers, Amazon, and the Icebreaker website.I still have almost every Icebreaker item I've bought. Even the discounted items have been somewhat pricey, but the quality and longevity were worth the initial investment.----------------------CAVEATWhat I have written below is based on my current knowledge about their products, but it is possible that I have misunderstood some aspects of the brand.If you wish to better understand their product offerings, I would absolutely recommend that you have a look at the Icebreaker official site to view their entire range and gain more clarity about what items are for what purposes, what the wool weights are about, what the quality levels of the different clothing collections are, etc.(Unfortunately, their website, while snazzy, does not fully explain these things, leaving it up to the customer to piece some of the puzzle together.)----------------------ICEBREAKER WOOL WEIGHTS:Icebreaker's marino wool items generally come in four weights of fabric: 150, 200, 260, or 320. This is ""grams per square meter"".150 is quite thin.It provides light warmth.The material is generally see-through. (I wouldn't wear items of this weight out and about in public without anything over them, but some reviewers have said that they do.)It's good for a first base layer, for strenuous exercise, or for sleeping in.Their items of this weight, especially in the ranges intended for athletic use, tend to be really form-fitting in one's typical size.All Icebreaker material seems VERY resilient and long-lasting to me, but because the 150 wool weight is pretty thin, it is the likeliest to be torn, develop holes, get ""runs"" (like pantyhose). I don't think this happens too much with it, but I've seen some reviewers mention it (most often talking about how they accidentally poked holes in it with long fingernails), and three of my 150-weight leggings have developed runs in them after several years of heavy use.200 is slightly thicker, but still on the thin side.It's pretty warm.The lighter colors are definitely see-through, such as grey and cream. My older black and brown items made out of 200 weight wool don't seem to be see-through, but some of the newer dark-colored ones might be.It's good for a base layer or mid-weight layer, for exercise, and sleeping in.Especially in the ranges intended for athletic situations, their items of this weight tend to be form-fitting in one's typical size.260 is on the thicker side.It's definitely warm, a cozy weight.None of my 260 items are see-through. I can wear tops made out of this weight on their own (without anything over them) and not worry that my underwear or too many lumps&bumps will show through.It's good for a mid-layer or top-layer, and sleeping in (if you get cold at night, like I do).Items of this weight tend to fit looser than items of the same size in the 150/200 weights do. This may have something to do with how much naturally-stretchier the thicker fabric is, but it also seems that they cut these 260-weight items bigger because this weight is often worn as a top-layer or middle-layer, instead of as a base-layer.I like this weight the best. I think that the company says that this is their most popular weight across the board.320 is thickest, of course.It is quite warm, very toasty and sturdy.This weight is generally a top-layer, so items made out of this material are relatively loosely-cut.--------------------------ICEBREAKER LINES / RANGES / ""COLLECTIONS"" OF CLOTHING:Icebreaker makes different ranges - some intended for wearing as normal underwear (like panties and sports bras and tank tops), some intended for wearing as thermal/long underwear, some intended for wearing as everyday clothing, and some intended for wearing as athletic wear.Even though at first glance most of their items appear VERY similar to each other, there are different feelings to the fabrics (even in fabrics of the same wool weight), different quality levels, different cuts, and different design details amongst these different lines, so it is good to check their website about the particular Icebreaker item you are thinking of buying to make sure that it is intended for the activity you want it for.Two of the popular ranges at the lower end of the Icebreaker price scale are:BodyfitThe Bodyfit range seems to be for athletic situations, but also casual-wear and sleeping-in. The knit of this range's wool is usually flatter and less stretchy than the knit of the ranges that are for underwear or purely casual wear. Items in this range are usually cut to fit relatively snugly.EverydayThis range is made of a looser, thicker, stretchier knit than the Bodyfit, and is more for general sleeping-in and casual long-underwear needs, not so much for athletic situations. (However, I'm sure that they would be okay in many athletic situations, and I have worn them skiing and hiking.) Everyday items tend to be made of a stretchier knit and cut to fit more loosely than the Bodyfit items. I wear a size below my ordinary size in this range.Other rangesTheir other ranges appear to include: Black Sheep Collection, RealFleece Collection, Pure Plus Collection, Journeys Travel Collection, Premium Underwear Collection, GT Technical Sports Collection, GT Bike Collection, Technical Base Layers Collection, and Technical Mid Layers Collection. Please see the Icebreaker site for more information on their ranges.Frankly, I feel that they've made this aspect of their brand over-complicated and too confusing for the average customer, and I have not been able to locate any overview of the various collections on their site or on their product packaging materials.-----------------------ICEBREAKER COLORS:Icebreaker tends to make most items in black, as their basic universal color.Many items are offered in about 2 to 8 other colors, as well. There is often some version of blue, red, grey, and green - sometimes a pink, sometimes a brown or purple, etc. Often the colors are skewed towards the cool end of the spectrum (which I notice because my coloring is on the warm end of the spectrum and cool tones look awful on me).The different weights of wool and/or different ranges (e.g., Bodyfit, Everyday, Journeys Travel Collection, etc.) will tend to have their own mini-set of color options. (For example, the current grey color in the 200 Bodyfit is a medium-grey and is called ""blizzard"" and the current grey color in the 260 Bodyfit is a dark-grey and called ""metro"", and they don't offer those particular colors in other weights of wool or other ranges, as far as I know.)They change their colors every year or so (I think), and some colors tend to sell out mid-way through a season and are not restocked, so if you see an item in a color that you love, or there is a matching set (of long underwear or something) and you want both pieces in the same color, you probably should get it at the time, because it's not guaranteed that it will be available in the future.---------------------EXTRA DESIGN FLOURISHES:A couple of their ranges, mainly the more athletic lines, feature ""pops"" of contrasting color in a certain part of the garment, such as a stripe running down the sleeves or down the sides, or a triangle of bright material at the ankle. Most internet retailers' photographs of the garments do show these features because the areas of differing colors are pretty obvious, but it pays to read the item descriptions (and check out the manufacturer's site for confirmation) if this kind of thing is not what you are looking for.In a couple of their clothing ranges, mainly the underwear, 150-weight, and casual-wear lines, some of the tops and bottoms have printed patterns (like floral motifs or abstract swirls - sometimes in contrasting colors) on the sleeves or in the hip-region. This *can* escape your notice when the only images of the item you have available to you are the tiny product photographs that most internet retailers provide, so do double-check the customer reviews of the item, and maybe the Icebreaker site's own full description of the item, if you want to know for sure if the item comes with a printed pattern on a section of it.---------------------ICEBREAKER SIZING:Sizing and fit are so variable from person to person and from brand to brand, but in case it may help, I'll talk about my experiences with Icebreaker clothing.For reference, generally I am usually a women's size 4 or 6 in US sizing, a women's size 8 or 10 in UK sizing, and a small when it comes to small/medium/large sizing. This goes for both tops and bottoms.---Sizing of TopsAlmost all of my Icebreaker tops from the last 13 years -- crew tops, long-underwear tops, turtlenecks, and zip-up jackets -- are women's size small.The only tops I have in size extra-small are from the Skin range (which they phased out in 2006, but the sizing and type of material used for the Skin range appear to be very similar to those of the current range called Everyday).Generally, I know that an Icebreaker small top is probably going to fit me.The main issue that I've had with their tops is sleeve length (too long). This is not uncommon for me, because I do have arms that are on the petite side: most suit jackets I buy have to be shortened a little in the sleeves, and I often have to turn up sweaters one turn at the cuff. And one feature of some Icebreaker tops is a thumb loop which necessitates that the sleeves are meant to be about three inches longer than the wrist - I understand this, and just roll those tops up a turn or two. However, I've read quite a few reviewers' comments that mention that Icebreaker sleeves tend to be long, and I do think that their sleeves are longer than normal. [""Normal"" being subjective, of course! ...the only women I've met from New Zealand actually did happen to be tall, lithe, and willowy, so maybe that's normal there. :-) ] Last week, I bought a 2012-made Icebreaker ""Oasis"" top in a size small, and while it was too tight in the chest area (which is normally NOT a problem for me with Icebreaker), the sleeves were a crazy four or five inches past my wrist, even though they didn't have thumb holes and therefore were meant to end at the wrist. I had to return it.---Sizing of Leggings:I have run into inconsistency in Icebreaker legging sizes. I have some in extra-small, some in small, and some in medium. (And in one 2012 collection, the extra-smalls are a little too big for me but there isn't a smaller size to go to.)I have not found Icebreaker's official sizing chart (available on their site) to be terribly accurate for leggings.For the leggings, it seems to me that one must experiment in each Icebreaker clothing range and wool weight to discover the best size and fit for oneself.I will spell out below the ones that I have tried. Because the sizing of the ""same"" leggings sometimes has varied across the years, I will mention what year I got them.1. BODYFIT range1a. Bodyfit 150 leggings2006 or 2007 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize medium. The label says ""slim fit"" (possibly back then they had different ""fits"" within the Bodyfit range, but they don't seem to now).Fit me snugly, but well.Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2008 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize small.Are a bit too small for me this winter - they fit me when I'm about 5-to-8 pounds less than I am at the moment.Waistband hits 1 inch below the belly button, feels okay.2012 Bodyfit 150 leggingsI decided not to buy new 150-weight leggings in 2012 because after a few years of heavy use, my old Bodyfit 150 leggings developed some un-mendable ""runs""/""ladders"". I still wear them and love them, but they are slowly self-destructing. It is comparatively easy to snag them on a rough surface or to poke a fingernail through them when pulling them on or off.Actually, I've just looked on the Icebreaker site (December 2012) and they don't list ANY Bodyfit 150 leggings. The only 150 weight leggings they list are the ""Sprite"" leggings from the Premium Underwear Collection. Also, I think that the ""Nature"" leggings (which are a discontinued style) were of 150 weight, and I have seen these still on sale on a few websites.1b.

"At 260 grams, the Tech top long-sleeve turtleneck is made out of one of the heavier weights of Icebreaker wool.  It is a versatile weight that allows the top to be a base layer under something else in cold conditions, or to be worn on its own in cool-to-mild conditions.  This thickness is generally not see-through (in terms of showing the lines and colors of one's underwear) and is quite warm and extra-durable.  The shoulder-area zipper of this turtleneck offers a comfortable way to get this top on over your head, but the feeling of having a zipper in an unusual spot might be a little bothersome to some people.  I am a fan of turtleneck tops and don't feel claustrophobic in them like some people do, but the Icebreaker turtlenecks of recent years have been too tall and too stiff for me (whereas my neck seems to be an average size for a woman, not long or short, and neither on the thin side or the thick side).  This is one that you might want to plan on trying on and maybe exchanging for another style (like a crew-neck) if the turtleneck area feels too binding.I wear Icebreaker garments year-round, and really love the ones that I have.

I expect that there are more discounters they have to compete with now, to get that kind of stock.)In addition to bricks-and-mortar sports shops and Sierratradingpost, I have also bought Icebreaker items from several sporting goods online retailers, Amazon, and the Icebreaker website.I still have almost every Icebreaker item I've bought.  Even the discounted items have been somewhat pricey, but the quality and longevity were worth the initial investment.----------------------CAVEATWhat I have written below is based on my current knowledge about their products, but it is possible that I have misunderstood some aspects of the brand.If you wish to better understand their product offerings, I would absolutely recommend that you have a look at the Icebreaker official site to view their entire range and gain more clarity about what items are for what purposes, what the wool weights are about, what the quality levels of the different clothing collections are, etc.(Unfortunately, their website, while snazzy, does not fully explain these things, leaving it up to the customer to piece some of the puzzle together.)----------------------ICEBREAKER WOOL WEIGHTS:Icebreaker's marino wool items generally come in four weights of fabric: 150, 200, 260, or 320. This is ""grams per square meter"".150 is quite thin.It provides light warmth.The material is generally see-through.  (I wouldn't wear items of this weight out and about in public without anything over them, but some reviewers have said that they do.)It's good for a first base layer, for strenuous exercise, or for sleeping in.Their items of this weight, especially in the ranges intended for athletic use, tend to be really form-fitting in one's typical size.All Icebreaker material seems VERY resilient and long-lasting to me, but because the 150 wool weight is pretty thin, it is the likeliest to be torn, develop holes, get ""runs"" (like pantyhose).  I don't think this happens too much with it, but I've seen some reviewers mention it (most often talking about how they accidentally poked holes in it with long fingernails), and three of my 150-weight leggings have developed runs in them after several years of heavy use.200 is slightly thicker, but still on the thin side.It's pretty warm.The lighter colors are definitely see-through, such as grey and cream. My older black and brown items made out of 200 weight wool don't seem to be see-through, but some of the newer dark-colored ones might be.It's good for a base layer or mid-weight layer, for exercise, and sleeping in.Especially in the ranges intended for athletic situations, their items of this weight tend to be form-fitting in one's typical size.260 is on the thicker side.It's definitely warm, a cozy weight.None of my 260 items are see-through. I can wear tops made out of this weight on their own (without anything over them) and not worry that my underwear or too many lumps&bumps will show through.It's good for a mid-layer or top-layer, and sleeping in (if you get cold at night, like I do).Items of this weight tend to fit looser than items of the same size in the 150/200 weights do. This may have something to do with how much naturally-stretchier the thicker fabric is, but it also seems that they cut these 260-weight items bigger because this weight is often worn as a top-layer or middle-layer, instead of as a base-layer.I like this weight the best.  I think that the company says that this is their most popular weight across the board.320 is thickest, of course.It is quite warm, very toasty and sturdy.This weight is generally a top-layer, so items made out of this material are relatively loosely-cut.--------------------------ICEBREAKER LINES / RANGES / ""COLLECTIONS"" OF CLOTHING:Icebreaker makes different ranges - some intended for wearing as normal underwear (like panties and sports bras and tank tops), some intended for wearing as thermal/long underwear, some intended for wearing as everyday clothing, and some intended for wearing as athletic wear.Even though at first glance most of their items appear VERY similar to each other, there are different feelings to the fabrics (even in fabrics of the same wool weight), different quality levels, different cuts, and different design details amongst these different lines, so it is good to check their website about the particular Icebreaker item you are thinking of buying to make sure that it is intended for the activity you want it for.Two of the popular ranges at the lower end of the Icebreaker price scale are:BodyfitThe Bodyfit range seems to be for athletic situations, but also casual-wear and sleeping-in. The knit of this range's wool is usually flatter and less stretchy than the knit of the ranges that are for underwear or purely casual wear. Items in this range are usually cut to fit relatively snugly.EverydayThis range is made of a looser, thicker, stretchier knit than the Bodyfit, and is more for general sleeping-in and casual long-underwear needs, not so much for athletic situations. (However, I'm sure that they would be okay in many athletic situations, and I have worn them skiing and hiking.) Everyday items tend to be made of a stretchier knit and cut to fit more loosely than the Bodyfit items. I wear a size below my ordinary size in this range.Other rangesTheir other ranges appear to include: Black Sheep Collection, RealFleece Collection, Pure Plus Collection, Journeys Travel Collection, Premium Underwear Collection, GT Technical Sports Collection, GT Bike Collection, Technical Base Layers Collection, and Technical Mid Layers Collection. Please see the Icebreaker site for more information on their ranges.Frankly, I feel that they've made this aspect of their brand over-complicated and too confusing for the average customer, and I have not been able to locate any overview of the various collections on their site or on their product packaging materials.-----------------------ICEBREAKER COLORS:Icebreaker tends to make most items in black, as their basic universal color.Many items are offered in about 2 to 8 other colors, as well.  There is often some version of blue, red, grey, and green - sometimes a pink, sometimes a brown or purple, etc. Often the colors are skewed towards the cool end of the spectrum (which I notice because my coloring is on the warm end of the spectrum and cool tones look awful on me).The different weights of wool and/or different ranges (e.g., Bodyfit, Everyday, Journeys Travel Collection, etc.) will tend to have their own mini-set of color options.  (For example, the current grey color in the 200 Bodyfit is a medium-grey and is called ""blizzard"" and the current grey color in the 260 Bodyfit is a dark-grey and called ""metro"", and they don't offer those particular colors in other weights of wool or other ranges, as far as I know.)They change their colors every year or so (I think), and some colors tend to sell out mid-way through a season and are not restocked, so if you see an item in a color that you love, or there is a matching set (of long underwear or something) and you want both pieces in the same color, you probably should get it at the time, because it's not guaranteed that it will be available in the future.---------------------EXTRA DESIGN FLOURISHES:A couple of their ranges, mainly the more athletic lines, feature ""pops"" of contrasting color in a certain part of the garment, such as a stripe running down the sleeves or down the sides, or a triangle of bright material at the ankle. Most internet retailers' photographs of the garments do show these features because the areas of differing colors are pretty obvious, but it pays to read the item descriptions (and check out the manufacturer's site for confirmation) if this kind of thing is not what you are looking for.In a couple of their clothing ranges, mainly the underwear, 150-weight, and casual-wear lines, some of the tops and bottoms have printed patterns (like floral motifs or abstract swirls - sometimes in contrasting colors) on the sleeves or in the hip-region. This *can* escape your notice when the only images of the item you have available to you are the tiny product photographs that most internet retailers provide, so do double-check the customer reviews of the item, and maybe the Icebreaker site's own full description of the item, if you want to know for sure if the item comes with a printed pattern on a section of it.---------------------ICEBREAKER SIZING:Sizing and fit are so variable from person to person and from brand to brand, but in case it may help, I'll talk about my experiences with Icebreaker clothing.For reference, generally I am usually a women's size 4 or 6 in US sizing, a women's size 8 or 10 in UK sizing, and a small when it comes to small/medium/large sizing.  This goes for both tops and bottoms.---Sizing of TopsAlmost all of my Icebreaker tops from the last 13 years -- crew tops, long-underwear tops, turtlenecks, and zip-up jackets -- are women's size small.The only tops I have in size extra-small are from the Skin range (which they phased out in 2006, but the sizing and type of material used for the Skin range appear to be very similar to those of the current range called Everyday).Generally, I know that an Icebreaker small top is probably going to fit me.The main issue that I've had with their tops is sleeve length (too long).  This is not uncommon for me, because I do have arms that are on the petite side:  most suit jackets I buy have to be shortened a little in the sleeves, and I often have to turn up sweaters one turn at the cuff.  And one feature of some Icebreaker tops is a thumb loop which necessitates that the sleeves are meant to be about three inches longer than the wrist - I understand this, and just roll those tops up a turn or two.  However, I've read quite a few reviewers' comments that mention that Icebreaker sleeves tend to be long, and I do think that their sleeves are longer than normal.  [""Normal"" being subjective, of course!  ...the only women I've met from New Zealand actually did happen to be tall, lithe, and willowy, so maybe that's normal there.  :-) ]  Last week, I bought a 2012-made Icebreaker ""Oasis"" top in a size small, and while it was too tight in the chest area (which is normally NOT a problem for me with Icebreaker), the sleeves were a crazy four or five inches past my wrist, even though they didn't have thumb holes and therefore were meant to end at the wrist. I had to return it.---Sizing of Leggings:I have run into inconsistency in Icebreaker legging sizes. I have some in extra-small, some in small, and some in medium.  (And in one 2012 collection, the extra-smalls are a little too big for me but there isn't a smaller size to go to.)I have not found Icebreaker's official sizing chart (available on their site) to be terribly accurate for leggings.For the leggings, it seems to me that one must experiment in each Icebreaker clothing range and wool weight to discover the best size and fit for oneself.I will spell out below the ones that I have tried.  Because the sizing of the ""same"" leggings sometimes has varied across the years, I will mention what year I got them.1.  BODYFIT range1a. Bodyfit 150 leggings2006 or 2007 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize medium. The label says ""slim fit"" (possibly back then they had different ""fits"" within the Bodyfit range, but they don't seem to now).Fit me snugly, but well.Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2008 Bodyfit 150 leggingsSize small.Are a bit too small for me this winter - they fit me when I'm about 5-to-8 pounds less than I am at the moment.Waistband hits 1 inch below the belly button, feels okay.2012 Bodyfit 150 leggingsI decided not to buy new 150-weight leggings in 2012 because after a few years of heavy use, my old Bodyfit 150 leggings developed some un-mendable ""runs""/""ladders"". I still wear them and love them, but they are slowly self-destructing. It is comparatively easy to snag them on a rough surface or to poke a fingernail through them when pulling them on or off.Actually, I've just looked on the Icebreaker site (December 2012) and they don't list ANY Bodyfit 150 leggings.  The only 150 weight leggings they list are the ""Sprite"" leggings from the Premium Underwear Collection.  Also, I think that the ""Nature"" leggings (which are a discontinued style) were of 150 weight, and I have seen these still on sale on a few websites.1b. Bodyfit 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around eighty (discounted price of around sixty).2008 Bodyfit 200 leggingsSize medium.Fit me, and there is extra room in them - I probably could go up 5 to 8 pounds and they would still fit. When I purchased those mediums, I tried on the small size and found it to be way too small, especially along the tight and narrow waistband that these leggings were made with at the time.  (I think it was a reaction to the consumer response to that waistband that they made the newer waistbands really wide and soft.)Waistband comes up to the belly button, feels secure.2012 Bodyfit 200 leggingsAt first, based on the Icebreaker official size chart, I ordered a medium in these.  They were too big, so I exchanged them for a size small.The small fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 or even 3 inches below the belly button. This is a more ""modern"" position for a waistband, of course, compared to coming up to the true waist, but I prefer ""athletic"" base layers to cover my entire body - neck to ankle, to enable the base layer shirts to be securely tucked inside the base layer pants, and to feel really secure when I'm moving around -- but this waistband was so low on me, and so wide and stretchy that it felt like it was about to slide down to my hips at any moment because the elastic wasn't very tight.Not only from the practical side was this low waistband a problem, but MAN, the whole cut of the upper part of these leggings seemed to be designed to make my tummy area look as flabby and unattractive as possible!  I tried my old leggings on when I took these off -- just to check that it wasn't bad lighting or post-Thanksgiving excess weight that was to blame for how these made me look, but my older Icebreaker Bodyfit 200 leggings looked a lot better on me than these leggings did.I had to return them.  I have decided to wait until next year's production, to see if they alter the cut of the waist area.1c. Bodyfit 260 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around ninety (discounted price around seventy-five).2012 Bodyfit 260 leggingsSize small.Fit relatively well - snug, but acceptably so.Waistband came up to 2 inches below the belly button. They had the same issues as the 2012 Bodyfit 200 leggings did - waistband too low, too loose, too wide, and quite unattractive in the belly region!I also had to return these.  I hope next year's will be cut higher on the waist.2.  EVERYDAY range2a. Skin 200 leggings (discontinued 2006) - the Skin range was probably similar to Everyday.2005 Skin 200 leggingsSize extra-small, yet are the largest I own - I could gain 15 pounds and they would still feel okay. But they fit me nicely when I'm at any weight - 10 pounds less or more than my present size - they are simply the coziest and softest that I own.Waistband comes to about 1 inch higher than belly button, feels secure.2b. Everyday 200 leggingsCurrent suggested retail price of around sixty (discounted price of around forty-five).2012 Everyday 200 leggingsTwo weeks ago, I bought them in size small which were too big, so I exchanged them for an extra-small.  Even the extra-smalls had extra material in places on the legs, which is unusual because my legs are not toothpicks (this kind of legging is not supposed to be baggy, so the cut of these must have been off).Worse, the upper part of the extra-small leggings was cut strangely - the waistband was in a deep V, so that the middle was 3 inches below my belly-button (which is way too low for me), but the sides rose up 3 inches higher than that (it wasn't a curve, it was a visible V).  Yet the waistband elastic wasn't tight enough, so the tall sides wanted to sag down and bunch up around my hips -- strange.  (And that was not the way the smalls I tried on the week before had fit my waist area!  In fact, I think the smalls of last week fit me better generally than the extra-smalls of this week.)  I don't have the energy to go through the rigamarole of ordering a different pair of extra-smalls, but maybe I just got a bad apple.I had to return the extra-smalls.I was very disappointed because they were the 7th Icebreaker product I've tried in the last 2 weeks.  This Icebreaker shopping quest has taken up a fair bit of my time lately, but I have nothing new to show for it.  I've given up trying to get anything now and will wait a year and see how their 2013 production fits me.3.  OTHER rangesTheir other legging types are more expensive than the Everyday and Bodyfit, and seem to be geared towards high-tech athletic use, or constructed to be worn on their own as pants/trousers. Some have Lycra in them. Check out Icebreaker's site for more info.--------------------------------OTHER TIPSThe other main retailers of this kind of product sometimes offer free shipping on their Amazon listings of an item but don't offer free shipping on the exact same item when sold through their own site (even when the price of the item itself is the same on both sites), so it can save you money if you pay attention to that.The best selection BY FAR is available from the manufacturer's site, but the prices there are generally higher. However, they have discounts from time to time, such as their ""Black Friday"" sale when they offer 30% off all items that are black in color (at least they have done so in prior years).Amazon sometimes calls the Icebreaker Bodyfit range ""BF"" and sometimes ""Bodyfit"", so if you are searching here for Icebreaker's Bodyfit range, do a separate search under each of the two search terms to get the most accurate results.In terms of merino wool socks, I prefer Smartwool socks over Icebreaker's. Sierratradingpost is one retailer which often carries a large selection of them at good prices. Those socks last a really long time. I wear them almost year-round because the lightweight ones breathe really well even when it's warm out.The Smartwool women's small size is the only sock I can find that truly fits my feet (which aren't even that small, all things considered!) without bunching up inside my shoes.If you have a smaller foot (size 7 or less) and are female, note that the Smartwool unisex socks in the small size are bigger than the smalls made just for women, even though that company's size guide says that both sizes are meant to fit the same range of women's shoe sizes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XGMMUQEQ036Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJ9A2AW#wasThisHelpful","R2XGMMUQEQ036Z","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used Natracare and Seventh Generation organic-cotton applicator tampons for more than 4 years.---AbsorbencyBoth brands offer applicator tampons in regular and super sizes.For both brands, I have noticed that the regular size is a bit on the light-absorbency side. Because the amount of flow varies unpredictably throughout my period, I use the super size on all but the lightest days.The super-plus size seems to be offered by Seventh Generation but not Natracare. This is a good option if you have quite a heavy flow and/or need extra insurance that you'll have protection when you need it.---Ease of insertionThe cardboard applicators of these two brands can be tricky to hold securely while pushing up on them, when one is ""in position"".Pushing the tampon out about 1/8th of an inch beyond the end of the applicator (while holding it up in the air in front of you) before you are ready to insert it, then making an effort to hold tightly onto the ridged area of the applicator while you are inserting it, helps.It just takes a little time to develop a technique that works for you, and then you won't have difficulties.---LeakageI think both brands do quite a good job, yet both do leak occasionally for me.

Because the amount of flow varies unpredictably throughout my period, I use the super size on all but the lightest days.The super-plus size seems to be offered by Seventh Generation but not Natracare. This is a good option if you have quite a heavy flow and/or need extra insurance that you'll have protection when you need it.---Ease of insertionThe cardboard applicators of these two brands can be tricky to hold securely while pushing up on them, when one is ""in position"".Pushing the tampon out about 1/8th of an inch beyond the end of the applicator (while holding it up in the air in front of you) before you are ready to insert it, then making an effort to hold tightly onto the ridged area of the applicator while you are inserting it, helps.It just takes a little time to develop a technique that works for you, and then you won't have difficulties.---LeakageI think both brands do quite a good job, yet both do leak occasionally for me. However, any tampon can leak, and it's my thought that it's better for a full or nearly-full tampon to leak a little than to seal the canal so tightly that the accumulated flow backs up into the uterus.Once in a while (maybe 1 out of 20), I will find that one of these tampons hardly absorbs anything, even though there is fluid there to be absorbed.

"Summary:Unfortunately, after about nine months of diligently practicing her oral health routine, I needed to stop following Dr. Ellie's system because of some negative outcomes.  (If you wish to skip to them now, I describe them at the very end of this review.)I do not expect that most people would have the same problematic issues with the program as I did.  I think that Dr. Ellie's system can be helpful to many people, and I am glad that I tried it out.  I learned a lot about oral hygiene by reading her writings.  I feel that her program improved my gum pockets and nerve sensitivity during the time that I employed it.Below are:My initial reviewMy three-month updateMy nine-month update==========================================================Initial review:  5 starsKudos to Dr. Ellie, who created a simple (and relatively inexpensive) process that improved her patients' health, and then published the entire process online, for free.  I am grateful to her.It is odd that there aren't very many dentists out there in the US (at least as far as I am aware) who speak to the general public in so honest and freely a fashion as Dr Ellie does about what they think does work and does NOT work in their area of expertise.---My review here is mainly about her program.In the comments section under my review, I will post the website address for Dr. Ellie's free pdf overview of her program.---A note about the book - it seems as if the book does not contain all the pertinent information that it could have, because greater detail (often quite helpful detail) on several of the key points is introduced piecemeal in the author's blog.  It takes a lot of time and patience to sift through the blog archives to find topics of interest to oneself to see if there is any further information on the process that might be important.Perhaps if a second edition is published, it could be rounded out with a lot of this extra information from Dr. Ellie's various websites.---The processI gleaned the following steps from the online information that is freely-offered by Dr. Ellie.  It is an accurate reflection of her current procedure (summer 2012), as far as I know, but I *have* found some conflicting information that was written by her at different points of time, so possibly this isn't the exact procedure anymore.1.  rinse 60 seconds with Closys antiseptic oral rinse (she recommends NOT adding the optional flavor drops to the Closys), making sure to bathe any areas of gum problems well with the liquid2.  brush for 2 minutes with Crest Original Cavity Protection Regular Paste using a soft toothbrush and a good brushing technique3.  rinse with Listerine original formula (or a diluted form of it if the full-strength is too strong for you; even a couple of drops in water is okay to start off with) for 30 seconds4.  rinse with ACT original alcohol-free anticavity fluoride rinse (she recommends the green one/mint flavor) for anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes (she said in one blog post that for whiter teeth, 60 seconds seems to be ideal for the ACT rinse - perhaps longer than this might impart a slight stain to the teeth).At no time in those steps are you supposed to rinse your mouth out with water.  (A lot of people seem to be rinsing with water between some of the steps, but that will lessen the effectiveness.)Do this process in the morning and the evening - the ideal time span is at 12 hour intervals.If you can, leave the mouth undisturbed for an hour afterwards so the ACT has time to work on the teeth.  (Dr. Ellie says that she actually does her morning routine after she's been awake for quite a while and has had a few cups of coffee first.)Additionally, expose mouth to xylitol 5 times a day.  This can be by xylitol mints, gum, dry xylitol powder/crystals (1/4th teaspoon each time) mixed with one's saliva, or a xylitol powder/crystals + water solution.  You don't have to swallow the xylitol if you don't want to, but for most people it doesn't cause any harm if they do swallow it.  The best time for xylitol exposure is after eating or drinking.If you don't have access to xylitol after meals or drinking acidic beverages, one thing you can to do to help the teeth recover is to eat a little bit of a dairy product like cheese or yogurt.On her blog, she has recently written that you can floss if you want to, if you feel that you are good at flossing and are not cutting into the gums.  Her initial recommendation not to floss was based on many of her patients who first came to her *already having bad oral health* and she discovered that if they did floss, they were flossing so awkwardly that they were doing more damage to their gums than was worth it, and she told them to stop doing it.---My main concern before starting Ellie's system:I've had sensitive teeth for about 15 years and have been using sensitive toothpaste (Sensodyne Extra Whitening, which does not have sodium lauryl sulfate, is the best I've tried) for all that time on the recommendation of dentists, and I was afraid to let go of the Sensodyne to switch to Ellie's old-school Crest, because of the pain that surely would be lurking just beyond the analgesic-sort of magic that the potassium nitrate does on the nerves.  Even if Ellie's process lived up to the hype of reversing the tooth sensitivity, it seemed logical that there might be an interim period during which time the Sensodyne numbing would taper off before the new process' healing would reach a threshold of potency.[Update after 3 months:  I have not had even one tiny problem with sensitivity after stopping the Sensodyne and starting Ellie's system.  Amazing!]My secondary concern:I'd like to naturally whiten my teeth if possible (simply by following Dr. Ellie's process), because my love of hot tea (which is non-negotiable!) has stained them.  If any whitening happened, it would be a great bonus.[Update after 3 months:  My teeth are lighter and smoother.  People have started to ask me if I have used something to lighten my teeth.  They are still a bit yellower than I would like, but are whiter than they've been in 15 years.]Dr. Ellie says to just give her system a try for a short while, even just for a month, and see for oneself if there is any improvement or worsening.  I am glad I did.---Notes on purchasing the products:XylitolThe research into the power of xylitol shows beyond a doubt that it's worth using the gum/mints and rinsing with the powder occasionally.I looked into the available xylitol gums which don't have aspartame and other unnecessary chemicals, and I settled on Xylichew gum and mints which are made in Norway out of birch wood.  The peppermint is a nice flavor and the gum lasts for the 15 minutes that I chew it.  The spearmint flavor is also fine.  Their products are available on Amazon.I ordered a 16-ounce package of powdered/crystal xylitol from Swanson Vitamins because their large package is made out of birch in the USA and is a good price.  (Note that Swanson's other xylitol product, individual serving-size packets, is made from corn, I think, and I don't recall whether the xylitol in those little packets is imported from China or not.)  This item is available on Amazon, and also on the company's own website.Dr. Ellie also sells her own line of xylitol mints and gum.  She sources her xylitol from Finland birch.  I had a look at these items on her retail site, but in the end I decided to go with the Xylichew products.  Update:  I have noticed recently that her xylitol products are listed directly on Amazon too.ClosysThe Closys website offers a $1 off coupon (it had been $2 before September) for purchasing Closys from a bricks-and-mortar store, and you can print it twice per month.Closys isn't stocked at a lot of typical American bricks and mortar retailers, but it is at most CVS and Walgreen's, apparently.I found Closys online prices to be much more than I could get it for at local stores, considering store discounts like CVS' frequent 25%-off-everything and the Closys printable coupons.However, I found that the packages of Closys rinse at all of my local stores were really old (even though the rinse bottles don't have expiration dates on them - which I think they should, the free sample of toothpaste that is included inside the packages of rinse expired over a year ago, so those products were manufactured quite a long time ago, since toothpaste has a shelf life of a couple of years.  You can read more about that on my customer review on the Closys listing here at Amazon.)  Anyway, I decided I'd rather get fresh Closys by ordering it from Amazon.If you just want to try it for a few days and/or want to have a handy travel-size of Closys, a mini-bottle of it is an Amazon ""add on"" product now for only a couple of dollars.ACT, Listerine, CrestThese are available at most general retail shops, supermarkets and drugstores in the US.The manufacturers' sites don't seem to have coupons at the moment, but there are coupons once in a while in the coupon booklets that come in Sunday newspapers.Usually these products on sale at one store or the other, so it's worth checking around if you need to buy a new supply.  (I got my first bottle of the Listerine for ninety-nine cents at CVS, on sale from three ninety-nine.)Per ounce, the very large bottles of Listerine are a much better deal than the smaller ones.  If the very large bottle is unwieldy to use with your daily Dr. Ellie routine, you can buy one small bottle of it to keep with your toothbrush etc., and periodically refill it from the large bottle that you keep stored away.Usage rateI find that I need to use less of all the rinses than is indicated on the bottles' instructions.  In order not to swig directly from the bottles (to keep things sanitary), I use a little cup that I pour a small amount into for each rinsing step, and rinsing with about 1/3rd of the quantities recommended seems to be adequate for me.At the risk of sounding pretty nerdy-- after 2 months of doing the procedure twice a day, I checked out the quantities I had left of the 4 items. I had used:about 1.5 ounces of Crest (25% of a 6.4 ounce tube)about 28 ounces of Clo-sys (90% of a 32 ounce container)about 500 ml/17 ounces of Listerine (an entire 500 ml/17 ounce bottle)about 400 ml/14 ounces of Act (75% of a 532 ml/18 ounce bottle)I do try to measure out the same amount of each liquid, but obviously have used them up at different rates.  If they all had the nifty built-in dosing device that the Act bottle does, it would be easier to pour out less of the others.  The unwieldy nature of the large Closys bottle encourages over-pouring.Because of various sales and coupons, I got my first supply of the 4 products for about fifteen dollars total.  So, if they lasted for 2 to 3 months, that wasn't too bad.The Xylichew gum and mints are kind of expensive, so I use the Swanson xylitol powder for most of my daily xylitol exposures, and have 1 or 2 pieces of gum and/or 1 or 2 mints per day.---Other infoApparently she's not a working dentist now - she lectures, sells her product line, writes, and helps run her family's restaurant in New York state -- I learned this in an online article about her from her local newspaper which came up tonight when I did a yahoo search for ""Dr Ellie review"".-The complaint posed by some reviewers here that she has not researched the effects of this system experimentally/scientifically is perhaps a bit naive about just how expensive and difficult such an undertaking is, even for university professors, unless it's supported by government or corporate research grants. It would require a lot of money, time, willing patients, and paid research assistants. Dr. Ellie (even though she used to be a professor at the University of Rochester, apparently) is just a lone dentist and would presumably not have at her disposal the resources to do such testing.  This dental process, even if it worked amazingly well, would not provide the kind of profit streams to corporations to justify their funding proper studies into it.  It might behoove the government to fund research into this kind of inexpensive, low-tech process, if it could dramatically improve the health of millions of citizens, but there are probably hundreds of promising ingredients/procedures/exercises that are in the same boat:  unfortunately, that's the way our modern health system/society works.-One interesting negative review that I read about her system by an actual dentist (it seems surprisingly hard to find online other dentist's comments on her ideas) was by a Florida dentist who says on his website that he is the personal dentist of one of Dr. Ellie's parents, and that he had met Dr. Ellie personally and spoken with her about her system. In his blog post, he said that he was not very happy with parts of her system, and spelled out what he would advise patients to do instead, if they want to remineralize their teeth. (Do an internet search for Mark Kraver at Cape Dental in Florida, then do a search on his site for ""Ellie"", and the post I mention here will come up.)-If you don't live in the US and can't find the exact products she recommends, Ellie sells the supplies for the entire program on her site and will ship internationally.  When I checked to see how much it was, the set of 3 rinses + toothpaste that I got for 15 dollars (admittedly, on sale and using coupons) was I think about 45 dollars on her site, but if it's your best way to access them, it's probably worth it.=============================================================Update after three months on the program:  5 starsIt has been great - the results far exceed my expectations!*  My teeth are noticably lighter in color.  They look less yellow, less stained now.  Relatives (who don't know about my new mouthcare routine) have started mentioning that my teeth look whiter.*  I have not had any tooth sensitivity since the moment 3 months ago that I stopped using Sensodyne and started using Dr. Ellie's system, which is amazing since I *needed* to use Sensodyne for the previous 12 or so years (and during that time, I still had some sensitivity that the Sensodyne did not take care of).*  I have not had a dental checkup since I started this, so I don't know about any changes to the condition of my gums and tooth surfaces, but they seem to me to be healthier than before.*  I would encourage anyone to give this inexpensive, easy, free-to-learn-about program at least a one-month trial.============================================================Update after nine months on the program:  3 starsUnfortunately, after diligently practicing Dr. Ellie's system for about nine months, I needed to stop doing it because of three negatives that I was experiencing:1.  The first negative was that my teeth were starting to look darker in color - I think this was probably due to the Listerine rinse and/or the Act rinse.2.  The second negative was that I developed stubborn and embarrassing perioral dermatitis, which I suspect was triggered by the mint flavor of the green ACT rinse (mint flavor is a known trigger for perioral dermatitis).  I then switched to the red ACT rinse with a cinnamon flavor, but that made the rash/scaling/bumps worse.  I had to stop using any flavored rinse in order to allow the dermatitis to heal.  (Although I know that some people are sensitive to sodium lauryl sulfate in toothpaste, that was not the cause of my dermatitis, because using toothpaste without it didn't have any effect.)3.  The third and main negative was that the black-line sort of tooth staining that began to develop on my teeth around the five-month mark.  When learning about her program, I had found various statements by Dr. Ellie that this black-line stain might develop around the six-month point, and that it could be cleaned off easily by a dental hygienist, and would not return.  Therefore, I was not worried when I saw it forming on my teeth, and I booked a cleaning with a dentist.  The stains were moderately bad, and I was embarrassed by them, but I thought they would be eliminated by one dental cleaning and then not return.  Unfortunately, the black plaque re-appeared two weeks after my dental visit, and continued to get worse and spread farther around my teeth.  The visible black plaque spider-web type lines made it appear to strangers as if I did not take care of my oral hygiene in the slightest.  I was self-conscious about opening my mouth in public.  I even tried to gently scrape the lines off myself with a dental pick from the drugstore, but it would grow right back.I researched the black-line stain more, and found a few internet mentions of it by other dental professionals -- it may be a type of dark-colored plaque that can grow in mouths (especially children's and women's) which are paradoxically too clean and too well-taken-care-of!  It can occur when the balance in the mouth is altered by killing too many of the good bacteria along with the bad bacteria.  A lack of good bacteria can give this tenacious dark plaque free rein.--For these three reasons, after about 9 months on the system I decided to stop using it and just to use the Crest toothpaste, original flavor, on its own, twice a day.  My teeth began to look whiter in color.  Even better, the black-line stain/plaque disappeared after about 2 weeks (even without having a second dental cleaning and without any further scraping at home with the dental pick) and I have not seen any hint of that dark plaque since.After giving up the Listerine, ACT, and Clo-sys rinses, I worried that my breath might get worse again, or that maybe my tooth sensitivity that I had felt for so many years before trying Dr. Ellie's system might return, but fortunately I have not had any trouble so far with just using the Crest by itself.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DT9C07K90NKS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009LPLMRU#wasThisHelpful","R3DT9C07K90NKS","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note:  This review is about one of the three products in this kit, the Glytone Acne Treatment Gel--Glytone Acne Treatment Gel, 10% benzoyl peroxide, is one of the better benzoyl peroxide creams that I have tried in the past 5 years.The positives:a.  In terms of reducing and preventing acne, it is one of the most effective 10% benzoyl peroxide creams that I have ever used.  It's probably the second-best I've used in terms of sheer power.b.

This product is relatively expensive, given that it's a pretty basic product.  Before I starting using it, I had been using a b.p. cream that was at most six dollars.  When I used this for a couple of years, it would run me about eighteen to twenty.  After I stopped using it in late 2010 because I found a product that worked even better for me, the new b.p. cream was at most six dollars.b.  I went through a number of bottles of this, and the cream in all of them had a noticably gritty texture that caused a tiny bit of pain when I applied it. After applying, I could see the clear, hard, sand-like pieces on my skin and could brush them off my face once the cream had dried.  I have never experienced this with any other benzoyl peroxide product I've ever tried in my 30 years of using this stuff nightly.[I had reviewed this cream here on Amazon two years ago (but that product listing has entirely disappeared from Amazon in the last year or so, which makes me wonder if they have stopped making this product now...), and someone made a comment on my review that if I found this Glytone gel gritty, it was clear to them that I was using way too much of it per application, but I replied that even the tiniest amount of this cream swiped across a wide area of my face would produce those mildly-uncomfortable, sand-like effects, and would leave a gritty residue that I could see and brush away.]c.  This b.p. cream was the most drying one that I've ever used.  Of course, a drying effect can be a good thing for really oily skin, and you can adjust how much cream you use in order to lessen this effect.  You just need to respect how strong this is, especially if you are new to this product or your face is momentarily sensitized for any reason (sunburn, rash, recently-exfoliated, or whatever).d.  Prior to this, I had used a benzoyl peroxide cream that was slightly tinted and basically vanished into my skin, but the Glytone gel left white swirls that stayed white instead of soaking in or turning translucent.  That was not much of a problem for me because I only use benzoyl peroxide while I'm sleeping.  If I were using it in the daytime, I think the visibility of it when dried on my skin would have been an annoyance.---As I mentioned above, two years ago I found a benzoyl peroxide 10% cream that worked even better for me than the Glytone gel.  It was only about 4 or 5 dollars, it didn't have such big gritty particles in it, it dried a little more translucent, it wasn't quite as harsh/drying, yet it was just as effective against acne.

"I love this EO Peppermint & Tea Tree soap - I've used it for about 4 years.It's not only suitable for hands - I use it as my daily face wash, and it does a great job.I don't know if the tea tree oil in this product is killing any acne bacteria and therefore reducing facial breakouts, but I think it might be helping me a little in that regard.A few months ago, I wondered if my facial skin would do any better if I returned to using a liquid soap that was specifically branded as a ""face wash"", so I tried several that were recommended by the customer reviewers on makeupalley, skinstore, sephora, and the like, as well as recommended by the skincare/cosmetics expert Paula Begoun on her beautypedia website.  None of them left my skin in as good a condition as this EO Peppermint & Tea Tree hand soap, so I went back to using it!My skin is pretty sensitive as well as breakout-prone, and is ""combination skin"" with an oily t-zone and ""normal"" cheeks (which become dry cheeks in the winter), but the EO Peppermint & Tea Tree soap has not caused any adverse reactions to my skin.  It does not dry my skin out like many face washes do (even those that are marketed as being gentle on sensitive skin).Unlike some organic soaps, this soap is quite sudsy, and one bottle lasts a long time (if you can get the hang of pressing down on the pump only partially, so just the amount you need comes out).---Also, I love and regularly use a few varieties of the EO shower gels and bubble bath formulas (on my body skin only) -- for example, the Eucalyptus is lovely and warming in cooler weather, and the Tangerine Vanilla (I think it's called) is nice in warmer weather.However, I did not have a favorable impression of their hand / body lotions, though (too oily and didn't absorb well for me), and their peppermint sanitizing spray caused a rash on the backs of my hands.FYI, most stores only carry a few of the items/""flavors"" made by EO, but their entire range of products is described on (and sold via) the manufacturer's website.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18D7RVZQR0ELC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001ZZ7WK#wasThisHelpful","R18D7RVZQR0ELC","A21YC6U1S1DPDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21YC6U1S1DPDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Behind the Computer is an amazing read! FL is constantly outdoing herself and every book gets better and better. This book grabbed my attention from the beginning and never let it go. I devoured this book in one sitting. I loved Behind the Computer and it’s unique story line.Sawyer is a best selling indie author. She sees Caleb at the gym and approaches him about being on her cover. The chemistry between Caleb and Sawyer is off the charts. There’s just one little problem…Liam, Sawyer’s boyfriend. I will say that I was team Caleb. Liam was a bit of a workaholic and not the most attentive to Sawyer. So who will Sawyer end up with?The characters are so well written and engaging. I loved Sawyer; she was strong and independent. I was a little surprised that she was settling (or so it seemed) for the life and relationship she had with Liam. Liam was a bit hard to get a read on. He was always working and didn’t seem to support Sawyer (or so it seemed). This set the stage for me to be completely team Caleb. Caleb was absolutely perfect. He was handsome, talented, sweet, caring and always there when Sawyer needed him.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a romance story with a modern twist. The ending was perfect and tied up all the loose ends but it did leave me feeling a little guilty for judging Liam so harshly.  I adored this book and I’m so hoping that we get Liam’s story next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T61SBG8TR349/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0170HI0ZM#wasThisHelpful","R2T61SBG8TR349","A24ZVEGQ47AOP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZVEGQ47AOP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was pleasantly surprised with this book. Seeing it was about a politician I thought it would be about a slime ball man whore changed by love but I was WRONG!!!Drake Prescott is not your typical politician he is strong, smart, caring and honest. Drake is also completely devoted to his family and his country. He is just the perfect man!!Lucy Washburn is a quite, sweet school teacher and her best friend Mason is the only family she has. But Lucy has a secret in her past that she is ashamed of and no one can know it! Being involved with a man that is constantly in the spotlight is not something she wants to deal with. It could be bad for both of them if the secret comes out.I just totally fell in love with this couple!! It warmed my heart to see a man with such patience and gentlemanly ways. His family welcomed her as their own immediately. When push comes to shove and secrets are revealed they rally around her and show her a love she has never known!I am excited to see this is the start of a series a few of the Prescott siblings have me curious and I definitely want to know more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA4HUC7GEG0ZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017GASVRK#wasThisHelpful","RA4HUC7GEG0ZE","A24ZVEGQ47AOP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZVEGQ47AOP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.25This was my first Rebecca Brooke book so I had nothing to compare it to. The synopsis sounded like the book could be slightly dark and could quite possibly be about a subject that some people would find hard to read about.From the synopsis I went in to the book slightly angry because I was thinking who in there right mind would ever trade up their wife, regardless of problems they have in the marriage of outside of the marriage. You just don't trade a person, so it did make me quite angry but I wanted to read the book to find out the reasoning behind everything and not make initial judgements based on the synopsis alone.Elena's character just made me want to reach in and save her, but tell her how inspirational she is and so strong. Her character was outstanding after what she went through.She was abused verbally and mentally for so long. Elena felt useless, ugly, nothing she did was good enough all because of her husband.It was almost like being traded because of her husband and meeting her captor would be worse than being with her husband, but sometimes God has other plans for great people and Elena was getting her bit of good she deserved finally, although it took time to happen.The author handled really hard subjects very well. She wrote them sensitively and with care, plus researched about the topic so she had all her information correct.I cant praise her enough for writing so carefully about a difficult subject.The story was full of dreams, hope and wishes. Elena never gave up. She was pushed further down each day, but she never lost her true self through dreaming, hoping and wishing and everything came true for her. It was very inspiring and heartbreaking, but beautiful.I really enjoyed the journey Elena went on through the book and that's what kept me glued to the pages.I'll defiantly read more of Rebecca's books now I've read Traded as her writing was captivating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXOJEMN1KHY1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017EKHROA#wasThisHelpful","RXOJEMN1KHY1B","A24ZVEGQ47AOP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZVEGQ47AOP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He was warned by her big brother to keep his HANDS OFF! Their attraction was too strong they couldn't resist.I was rooting for this couple. I wanted them together! They struggled through a lot of BS, misunderstandings and meddling. Gosh they are both so stubborn!!! I got frustrated wanted to throw my Kindle. I honestly wasn't sure they were going to stay together, wasn't sure they could overcome some of the obstacles thrown in the way. I still sit here and question it?

"If I could give this book more than 5 stars, I totally would!!! Finn and Harlow's story was witty, smart, SEXY, sweet, loving, SEXY, need I go on!!After Harlow surprised Finn by showing up at his home in Canada with nothing on but a trench coat and then rocking each other's worlds, she hasn't heard from him. Not a text, call, email....nothing. So she is very surprised when she tries a new Starbucks and sees him in line there. Now to ignore or engage....well..Harlow being the strong willed, determined woman that she is..engages. But after they both decide that it's just a fun fling while Finn is in town and to get their minds off of what's wrong in their life, Harlow is starting to realize that maybe, just maybe Finn is more than a fling.Finn came to San Diego in hopes to save his family fishing business but he was also hoping to run into Harlow, not that he would tell anyone else that!! Running into her at a Starbucks was too easy and they fell into a hook up only relationship, but now Finn is starting to think more about Harlow and how he can see her more and not what he actually came to San Diego to do.When misunderstandings start to ruin what they have, one runs but will the other follow?LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Finn was sooooooo DIRTY!!! I loved his dirty talk in bed! Definitely has some GREAT bedside manner that I wouldn't mind having in my life!! I also loved reading about Mia and Ansel and a glimpse into Oliver and Lola..I'm pretty excited to read their story as well!!

"4.5 StarsWalking Among the Cherry Trees was the first book I had read by this author and I was blown away at how well written it was. I love second chance love stories and add in that this was a second chance with her first love; I was hooked from the blurb.I fell in love with the characters. Morgan was a great heroine and her story tugged at my heart strings. She was a strong, independant woman; her one weakness was Taylor. She fell in love with him as a teenager; everything with him was perfect until he fell out of love with her and ripped her heart out. From that point on she put all her energy into her career. When her grandmother dies and she has to go back to Cherryville, running into Taylor is inevitable. Will she be able to handle all the emotions and survive the secrets?Even the secondary characters were well written and easy to connect with. For me they added to the feel of the story and added extra charm. I loved the differences between the small town of Cherryville and New York; Morgan was completely different in Cherryville. I think that it was because she felt at home there. New York was more about her work than her personal life.This book was full of emotions; I felt like I went through everything the characters did and at times this story had me crying and had my heart aching. Taylor’s secrets kept my interest from the beginning to the end. I was on pins and needles waiting to find out how their story would end. I cannot wait to read the next book in this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO3VHKO0GDPLF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NBDSPO#wasThisHelpful","RO3VHKO0GDPLF","A24ZVEGQ47AOP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZVEGQ47AOP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved this book!I am a big baseball fan and this book was written for and by a true fan. I loved the game refrences, the team refrences and especially the part about All Star game being in Cincinnati. I live in Cincinnati and saw the excitement of this game first hand. This is a baseball book but there is a sweet romance story building through the sport theme.The love story between Ethan and Daisy was a slow building attraction that we watch develop into love.The game brought them together she a fan and he a player. Like in any relationship they stumble and get back up but there is a big secret she holds that could end them for good.I have loved all of Heidi's books but I do think this might be favorite! A simple sweet story that made me smile, a bit of angst, some steamy scenes, and some emotional moments that brought tears. I fell in love with the story and the characters and could not put it down!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NF7A8SZQCUSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017IZSDW6#wasThisHelpful","R3NF7A8SZQCUSB","A24ZVEGQ47AOP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZVEGQ47AOP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hard Beat is very different from the other books in the series. There’s more story behind it and a deeper meaning. We get to explore a type of life we would not usually get to discover. The amount of research into the topic is very evident. K Bromberg brought us into the life of an oversees investigative reporter, show us what they experience, how they are always in danger searching for the hard beat, and makes the reader feel an extreme amount of emotion.I really did love Tanner and Beaux together. They shared a connection that most never experience. Their relationship happened with rocket speed because of the situation they were in. However there are doubts, pasts issues, and secrets that stand between the two. I fell in love right along with them and felt every emotion that the characters did. Their relationship didn’t happen in the conventional way but I thing that’s what made it so strong and special.This review was hard for me to write. It took me awhile to really get into the book and connect fully with the characters. There are huge secrets happening and it makes it to where you don’t totally get to know and experience the characters. BUT there is a huge turning point in the book that drew me and wouldn’t let me out. The second half of the book was easily a five star read for me. I went through a roller coaster of emotions right along with the characters. I was yelling at my Kindle and was trying to figure out what piece of the puzzle I was missing. All is revealed in the end and helps to put all the pieces together. It’s the type were you want to re-read and see if you can discover the hints and foreshadowing of what was to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DZE7QHIBQQ0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI02BRY#wasThisHelpful","R2DZE7QHIBQQ0X","A24ZVEGQ47AOP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZVEGQ47AOP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 StarsThis book surprised me. I was pulled into the story and couldn't put it down. I absolutely loved it. I have not read the first book in the series and did not feel lost at all. We do get a little bit of the couple from book one and it left me one clicking their book immediately. This book had highly emotional parts that will have you hurting and breaking right along with the the characters. There are twists, turns, and secrets that you aren't expecting, that you so involved in the story.The characters are written so you can easily connect to them and fall In love with them. I loved both Rogan and Katie's characters. Both have had difficult pasts, that seem to bring them together and help them understand each other more. Katie, ahh she's been through A LOT and has become a shell of herself, not fully living. Rogan has been living but wants more and that more is Katie. The connection between the two was off the charts. I loved Rogans's persistence. I had a huge a smile on my face every time he had a surprise for Katie. However the past has a way of coming back and haunting you and it does in a big way for Rogan and Katie.This book left me wanting more. I wanted more Rogan and Katie because they were such amazing characters. There were a few parts of the book that I felt skipped over situations and I wished that we had a little more. However this book is easily one of my favorites of 2015 and I can't wait for more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19TMP46GMESNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI025ZW#wasThisHelpful","R19TMP46GMESNK","A24ZVEGQ47AOP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZVEGQ47AOP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"ith Every Breath is the first book in the River Bend Series. Jaden left River Bend six years ago and vowed to never return but when her best friend, Mia, sounds like she is having a break down Jaden returns to check on her. Jaden had a crush on Mia’s older brother but when they started to get close Cole’s ex-girlfriend shows up and she’s pregnant. So he does the right thing for their child and marries her.  When Jaden returns to town her car breaks down and Mia sends Cole to rescue her. Will they be given a second chance at love or will or will history repeat itself?I fell in love with Cole from the beginning; he is handsome, witty, and an all around good guy. Jaden seems to have everything in place in her life with her career but she still hasn’t made her apartment hers by adding personal touches. I felt like maybe it was because she didn’t really consider it home yet and maybe she was longing for her hometown and friends of River Bend. I know how she felt about wanting to leave her small hometown, I think everyone from a small town feels the same way but no matter what that small town will also be home. I loved this cast of characters from the main characters to the supporting characters. They are all well written and add so much to the story.This is a group of people that I can imagine myself being friends with.  I loved the banter between them and I look forward to reading more about them in the next installment of this series.With Every Breath was another home run for Ms Roy. It is a great second chance at love story and an awesome start to her new series. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a sweet love story with great characters. I cannot wait for the next book in this series to release.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SRS6K0270Z55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01786HOXO#wasThisHelpful","R3SRS6K0270Z55","A24ZVEGQ47AOP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZVEGQ47AOP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was so sad this series ended!! I enjoyed the ride! This story was one I was intrigued by from the first inklings we got in the previous book, I loved Ivy!!!Ivy was the perfect badass heroine!! Ivy doesn't stay in be place too long and is always in the move. Sebastian is in town on business... Seems innocent enough, but their paths were made to cross in more ways than one.The twist of this book was so shocking!! I didn't see it coming!! I loved the ending of this story, it was perfect for the couple. I will miss the characters in this series!!! While I really liked Ivy an Sebastian's story I will always love Burying Water the most.

"Since I've started reading CA Harm's books I've learned a few things. One, she loves making me cry :) and two, I always finish her books with a big dopey grin on my face.I loved this book. I finished it in one sitting because I just didn't want to put it down.  Jackson is your typical sweet alpha man who suffers such a sad tragedy at the beginning of the story, but when Bailey needed him (even though she didn't know it, he was there)I loved Bailey and after learning her back story my heart hurt for her and even though it had happened so long ago it still effected her. She was such a strong character because even with the past she was dealing with it didn't stop her from living.I don't want to give a lot of the plot away, but you could feel the chemistry these two characters had from the get go and how they both were there for each other when they both needed it most. There, as always, are great supporting characters and I just have two words.... NOAH's BOOK!!!!!!!I messaged CA after I finished and said I needed to know about Noah, but not really *:) happy I want to be surprised.YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28HVA2V31T9HV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015F1DB5O#wasThisHelpful","R28HVA2V31T9HV","A24ZVEGQ47AOP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZVEGQ47AOP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another great Mafia book by Rachel.When starting to read this book, I wasn’t really sure what the book was going to be about or what genre it was based on as the synopsis didn’t give much away, so when starting this book I was going in completely blind.Wow what a great surprise read it was.I was sucked in to the story and characters within the first few pages and then just couldn’t put it down.As always with a book from this author it had great detail, suspense, love, great character development, twists and turns and unpredictability.I absolutely loved Nikolai and he made the story for me.He’s rich, good looking, bossy, mysterious and completely smoking hot! You can’t help but failed for his dark, dangerous, murderous personality, he just had something about him that made you forget his bad ways and fall in love with him.I love Rachel’s Mafia books. You can’t find a better author to write about this genre in my opinion. This is another to add to her great list.A must read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WFX3APAJ4ER6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016CU7PEA#wasThisHelpful","R1WFX3APAJ4ER6","A24ZVEGQ47AOP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZVEGQ47AOP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Blue Horizons isn’t just a story about music and love, it is so much more. It was an emotional read for me; which I love. The emotions that Ms Andrews made me experience only heightened my connection to these amazing characters. Will is a successful musician but he is learning that fame and success come with a price and he isn’t willing to give up his integrity in the process. When he started it was all about the music but now he isn’t feeling it any more. So he escapes to the Blue Ridge Mountains to regroup. Ava is also a musician and has had a very troubled past. Even though the physical scars have healed she is left with huge emotional scars that keep her closed off to people. When they meet they both hide their true identities from the other but the more they are around each other the more they start to reveal about who they are and their pasts. These two really are perfect for each other even if they don’t see it right away, especially Ava.This book has plenty of angst and emotions that literally took my breath away and left me a sobbing mess. I was reduced to tears on several occasions while reading about Ava and her trying to come to terms with her insecurities and pain from her past. Will is absolutely perfect for Ava and I loved how he tried so hard to win the girl he had fallen in love with. He seemed to find his passion for life again when he met Ava. I also loved the humor that was added by Clay, Will’s foster brother and also a member of his band. I would love to read more about Clay.Once again Ms Andrews has hit a homerun with Blue Horizons. It has everything I have come to love about her novels and she is quickly becoming one of my favorite new to me authors. I look forward to reading more from her. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes musicians and love stories filled with emotion and angst.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A8G97EE1CVZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0124ES786#wasThisHelpful","R1A8G97EE1CVZW","A24ZVEGQ47AOP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZVEGQ47AOP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Nina is carrying it around like a badge of honor and refuses to let anyone to close.Jake is having an awful streak of horrible dates and can't seem to meet a girl that he can be with.They met under some funny circumstances! I loved Jakes persistence, he was going to get the girl, no matter how many times she turned him away. I love reading a book and watching someone break through and bring their walls down.

"This was a wonderful story. I loved it from the beginning. I loved the storyline and all of the characters. Echo and Malachi were amazingly written characters.I really liked the alternating POV. I love getting to see the story from both sides. I don’t read a lot of paranormal, but I really loved this book and it’s unique storyline.The relationship between Echo and Malachi is wonderful. The author did a wonderful job developing the relationship between the main characters. And all the characters are very well done and they really draw you into the story. I couldn’t put this book down from the beginning.After reading this I will definitely be trying more paranormal stories, especially ghost stories!!I can’t wait for more in this series. And I will definitely be reading more from DelSheree Gladden. This book is a must read, even if paranormal is not one of your normal go to genres.

"This story really shocked me as it is set in 1957. I never thought I'd like reading a book based in that ere so I'm glad I never knew beforehand.The story being set back in that time made for a real difference though and stood out from other books.The author must of done a lot of research as she had set the story in 1957 and the Korean war. The lives of how people lived in that era played a big impact in the story and so did The weather and the hot summer's day t gat changed everything.This book does have a love story, but I did feel so many real, honest and true emotions from all 3 characters.I did enjoy the story as a whole but I did find it hard to read as I'm not someone who has ever read a book like this before or based so far in the past.The writing and descriptions of the characters, story and past were very good but unfortunately due to the age differences between myself and when the story was told, I found it hard. I found parts interesting it not like I normally find the authors books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REN344CZZEV61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015Z5WZM0#wasThisHelpful","REN344CZZEV61","A24ZVEGQ47AOP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZVEGQ47AOP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Always is the debut novel for Randa Lynn but you would never know it. This story is well written and captivating. I was pulled in from the beginning and this story never let go of my attention until the end. I simply couldn’t put it down; I kept telling myself just one more chapter.The characters were well written and very realistic. Lenni was a broken women because of all she endured in her relationship with Ryan. Wes was a single father, who was charming and handsome. He was an amazing father to Elli. Elli was adorable and stole every scene she was in. This was a great love story between these three characters. This story is not just about love but also about learning to appreciate what you have.The secondary characters were fun to read about also. Lenni and Wes had an amazing group of friends. I felt like they added so much to the story and I couldn’t wait to learn more about them. This is definitely a group of people I could see myself being friends with.Always is an exceptionally well written book.

"Have your tissues ready for this book as you are going to need a box or 2 of them when you read this book. It is pull at your heartstrings sad.I honestly never knew what to expect when I started reading this book. I’d not read a book by the author before, but I had heard great things about her previous books and what a great writer she is, so I had every confidence that the book would be wrote very well and the rest I’d find out when reading the book.The biggest shock I had when reading this book was that it had some difficult subjects that were hard to read. I wasn’t expecting that at all.Aiden is a Hollywood playboy who is very cocky and arrogant. He has everything and everything he could ever want. However he is just playing a character to everyone all the time. No one really knows who the real Aiden is.Haley is a great girl. She is sweet and charitable. She loves to be in the country and rescue and re home horses. Her life is good until tragedy strikes and leaves Haley so hurt and in a dark place.Aidan had some very serious demons and this really effected his personality and didn’t make things easy with Haley either, especially as Haley is also dealing with her own demons. Sometimes I wasn’t sure if I liked Aiden as he could be very nasty and rude. I needed to keep reminding myself that Aiden acted like that though through hurt and he doesn’t no how to act any other way, until he finally lets Haley in and she can help him.Both of the characters were very lovable despite their faults and both characters were easy to relate. Both of the characters are very complex and have a lot of different sides to them. Learning about all the sides of both their personalities and their individual stories was interesting and it kept me very interested in the story.This was a story about loss and sadness, but also getting the strength and pulling yourself up and out of the darkness and living again. Aiden and Haley needed each other and they saved each other and made each other stronger.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EJNPCS0PPT6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015V0AKSK#wasThisHelpful","R3EJNPCS0PPT6M","A24ZVEGQ47AOP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZVEGQ47AOP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Reviewer: NicoleRating: 4.5 StarsI have been waiting for this book and was not disappointed!! I loved it! It starts off right where Naughty King left off with Margo and Alex waking up married. Alcohol plus sexual chemistry plus a friend like Yamada can only lead to trouble, in the form of an unplanned spouse. It’s crazy how short these installments are yet we get so much story.Of course there is a lot of bickering and fighting between Margo and Alex but we also get to see them start discover other sides of each other. Then there is the sexual connection the two have its off the charts and HOT. We get a lot of shocks towards the end and are left with wanting more….more Alex and Margo…more Yamada….and more of Diem and her possible love interest!!! I’m hooked and can’t wait to see what happens next.Reviewer: TammiRating: 4.5 Groupie StarsPerfect follow up to Naughty King!Totally loved this book! It has sexy times, funny times, and even some touching moments. It is the whole package!We got to see their feelings this time!!!

"This story was perfectly written. I finished this book in one day!! It grabs your attention from the beginning and doesn't let go. I loved Kelsey and Ethan. And the supporting characters were great, too.Ethan and Kelsey shared a moment a long time ago, but neither have forgotten. When Ethan comes back into the picture, they both feel an attraction. Unfortunately, there are circumstances that might stand in the way.This story has lies and deceit, and it also has romance and steam.  This book will keep you reading to see what will happen.  Ethan is a hot book boyfriend that is struggling between what he wants and what he thinks he needs to do.  Kelsey is a strong girl who has been wronged and just wants to stick to her plan.I loved everything about this story. I liked that there was some drama and lies mixed in with the romance and attraction.  The supporting characters really brought a lot to the story.

"Only You is a standalone novel in the Second Chances Series. Only You is a great second chance love story. This is the second book in this series that I have read and I loved them both. I am a huge fan of second chance love stories and this series defiantly doesn't disappoint.Only You had me on an emotional roller coaster from the beginning. I knew from the prologue that this book would wreck me and it did at times, but it was also inspiring. It dealt with real issues that everyone might face at one time or another. In the end, I felt like my heart was put back together from all the heartache I endured reading this story.I loved the characters. Like I said before everything about this book was so real, including the characters. I connected with them immediately. I felt every emotion and pain that they endured.  Evan was pretty near perfect. He was strong, loyal,loving, kind and handsome. Paige always had a knack of picking the wrong guys. She was pretty, smart, and a great friend. I loved that all of the characters were connected. The supporting characters were also amazing and I loved the glimpses into their lives.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a second chance love story full of emotions and an HEA ending. I cannot wait to read more from this author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XVDF0IK27LTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016IWS6Q8#wasThisHelpful","R2XVDF0IK27LTV","A24ZVEGQ47AOP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZVEGQ47AOP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Aleatha has done it again! When I read her books I get lost in them, they don't read like a typical romance I feel like I am reading a piece of classical literature.Betrayal definitely kept me guessing and wanting to know more about the intriguing Alexandria/ Alex/ Charli. I loved how she ""reinvented"" herself trying to find her true self. I feel she won't be happy until she mixes the three but I fear she may lose them all in the end. She has always had follow the family ""rules"" but now she is cutting the cord. She thought she was finally taking control of her life, making all her own decisions and no longer answering to anyone but the step she took may have one man from the past controlling everything.I was left with so many questions. What will the future bring her? I really want to know her past! What is behind the smoke and mirrors? Loved this book and cannot wait for the next one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MF0PGKRJ69VU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016J2HJMY#wasThisHelpful","R1MF0PGKRJ69VU","A24ZVEGQ47AOP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZVEGQ47AOP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Slaying the Dragon is book two in the Deception Duet. I have read every book by T.K. Leigh and this was another perfectly written book by her. She does such an amazing job pulling you into the story and making you invested in the characters. I have been anxiously awaiting this story ever since I finished Chasing the Dragon. This is an incredibly done story full of suspense, drama, twists and turns, and of course lots of hot and steamy scenes.Tyler is still a hot, dominating, take charge guy. And of course Mackenzie is still a hardheaded, and hurting woman. They both need each other. But will they be able to figure out what the truth is behind all the lies and deception so that they can make sure their future is safe?This book will keep you drawn in from the very first page. This was a definite 5 star read. If I could give it 10 stars I would!!! Absolutely love Tyler. He is a drool-worthy book boyfriend. T.K. Leigh writes the best characters I really loved everyone in this story. I felt like I was right there with them and I was just hoping for everything to work out for Tyler and Mackenzie.This book is a 5-star, must read book. If you like hot dominating, protective book boyfriends and stories with suspense and drama, you will love this story. I can’t wait to read more from T.K. Leigh. I am anxiously awaiting her next book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KGSY3YJ7BY3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015YDZ4XA#wasThisHelpful","R3KGSY3YJ7BY3K","A24ZVEGQ47AOP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZVEGQ47AOP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sarah O'Rourke is FAST becoming a favorite of mine!!! Definitely a one-clicker!!!Patience McKinnon has had enough drama in her life to have a tv show but it's not like she can stop it from happening..I mean she has 3 sisters!! It's bound to happen!! Patience is the sister with the mouth. The one that will take down anyone with it and makes most grown men cry. Except for one, Abel Turner, the one man that won't back down, no matter what she says! He just doesn't seem to get that what happened three years ago WILL NEVER happen again. This is HER life and she will NEVER let a man close to her again. He had his chance and he ruined it worse than a burnt cake on your birthday and all the bakeries are closed! But her life is never easy and obstacles are always showing up to change all of her plans!Abel has been trying hard for the last three years to prove to Patience that he is sorry for what happened and wants a do over, even if she did tell the whole town how bad he ""performs."" He can't get her out of his head and he knows that there is more than just sex involved after he finally wears her down one night but convincing her of that it is a WHOLE different story! Not mention that someone is leaving them threatening notes and God decided to open a can of whoop ass on Abel by giving something to Patience that will take nine months to ""get rid of."" What's a man to do?This book was beyond hilarious!! I laughed out loud soooo many times with the things that would come out of Patience and her sisters' mouths! I would have to say though that the dialogue could get kind of lengthy at times. Sometimes I just wanted to tape Patience's mouth closed and tell her stop talking but I think Abel handled it well! There was definitely some drama and tears in this book and I was soooo nervous towards the end!! I think I bit off all of my nails at least twice!! I'm pretty excited about the next book, but have to love Abel and Patience for awhile first!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JS412JJYUCPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CW9VTQ#wasThisHelpful","R3JS412JJYUCPE","A24ZVEGQ47AOP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZVEGQ47AOP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I can still here that hot english accent in my head!!Elizabeth had something precious stolen from her in the worst possible way but still seems to think that it was partly her fault. Now two years later at college, she gets around great with men. Her motto: find the least likely player, but decent enough looking, for a one night stand at HER place and never see/call them again. It has worked so far and her heart never has to get involved. Dragged to Frat party one night, she is on the prowl for her next conquest when meets Dax and then is equally hot brother Declan. TOTALLY not what she usually goes for but there is something about Declan that she just can't stay away from.Declan has a future plan and has every intention of opening a gym and getting into UFC. Elizabeth is definitely not his type but there is just something about her. When Declan finally tells Elizabeth how he feels, she runs. Can he prove to her that he isn't her past, but her future?I have to say that is the first book I have ever read by this author, but it definitely will NOT be my last!!

"I love books that deal with anything out of the box and this book didn't disappoint!!Lucy has a wonderful life up until she almost died 4 years ago. Now she lives in the shadows and barely exists. But she likes it that way, it's safe, comfortable, and she doesn't have to worry about having ""episodes"" and freaking people out. But when she Ellis out on the beach that she will never step foot on again, her heart starts beating a little harder and it isn't from anxiety. Can he be the one to pull her from her darkness and bring her floating to the top?Ellis is enjoying his last summer before he has to get a ""real"" job after college. He decides to stay at his parent's place on the beach with his two friends and party the summer away before obligations start and he as to be an adult. The moment he saw Lucy on her deck, he knew it was over for him. He had met the one. Now if he could just get her name..after some searching(slight stalking) he finally meets her and is even more blown away by her. He knows that she fights an inner demon but wants to be her knight in shining armor to slay the dragon for her. One problem, her ex...why can't that guy just give it up already?!This was a great heartwarming story. Ellis really was the man that could take all of Lucy's insecurities away and help her becoming stronger in herself. He didn't want her to become needy of him, he wanted her to overcome her demon's with his help and come out the strong, independent woman she once was. Great story and one I couldn't put down.

"Jake Part One was a short, sexy read. This book has some of the hottest sex scenes I’ve ever read. The writing is flawless. This strut flows so fast that I read it in one sitting.Jake is sexy, talented tattoo artist and a man whore. He never seems to run out of women who want him. He had one simple rule…it’s just sex, nothing more. He never takes women to his home and they never stay after the sex is over. His twin brother Jax is back in town and had opened a bar. Jax’s business partner is Addi. From the first time Jake sees her he is taken back. There is something about her that gets to him. But will she risk a chance with her business partner's brother? Hopefully volume two will answer this question.

"Easily one of my top 10 books of 2015. I loved everything about this book. I’ve read a majority of Meghan Quinn’s books and each series is so different from the others and unique to itself. Yes Repentance is part of the Jett Girl Series but it is so different from Jett and Goldie’s books. I could not put it down and I needed to know what was going to happen next and if Kace was going to find forgiveness and forgive himself.Repentance is a highly emotional book that will break your heart, as you experience the pain and regret that Kace is going through. You feel his emotions and experience his lows right along with him. We really get to know and understand Kace in this book. You can’t help but fall in love with him despite his past sins and his outlook to his future.Kace and Lyla are amazing together, when Kace actually lets her in. The sexual chemistry between them is HOT!!! Lyla seems to bring out the best in Kace. She helps to lessen the pain and to have him live a little. Things are not easy for the two, both have difficult pasts and lives that were drastically changed by one event in their life. Lyla is a strong and confident woman who when she sets her eyes on someone she fights for them and isn’t easily pushed away and she’s in for one heck of a fight when it comes to Kace.This is a must read book and can easily be read without read the other Jett Girls books. There are chapters that flashback to the past (which I usually don’t like but they it was done in a way that benefitted the story) so you are not lost. WE also get more Jett, Goldie, and the rest of the gang. Goldie is of course Goldie spouting hilarious nonsense. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book….GO ONE CLICK IMMEDIATELY!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36UX2LPB7FOU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015GQ8LEY#wasThisHelpful","R36UX2LPB7FOU5","A24ZVEGQ47AOP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZVEGQ47AOP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dark reads have hit a new high with this book. Clarissa Wild is by far the best writer of dark reads I've ever read. Her books have always been twisted and read between your fingers scary. However with Twenty One everything became more intense, captivating and just so wrong that you can't out it down.I was drawn instantly in to the book. The secrets, lies and betrayal were ruthless and emotional. You was taken on a roller coaster of a million emotions and never knew if you was up or down or where you was. So much was going on I just couldn't stop reading until the end.You need to read the story to understand its brilliance. There wasn't just the intense journey, it was a love story too.Sky was fierce and hard character. I couldn't help but feel sorry for her though. She goes through so much hell not knowing if she's going to live or die. Her character was inspiring. She went through so much with the kidnapping and torture she was put through.Angel is someone you should really hate and not want to like because he's so dark and twisted, but I couldn't help but like him. He fought internally about what was right and writing through the whole book,Both characters had a intense connection that shouldn't ever be but ends up feeling right. I could understand there inner struggles and was really immersed in to the story.Clarissa Wild yet again has wrote a mind blowing book that with leave you reeling long after you've finished it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCJ83WHPPDSA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0165XCG8Y#wasThisHelpful","RCJ83WHPPDSA2","A24ZVEGQ47AOP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24ZVEGQ47AOP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know where to start. This book was amazing, to say I loved it doesn't begin to describe it. There are so many things that made me devour this book. I was honestly hooked on the first page.First off it has all my favorite romance storylines friends to lovers, second chance at love but it is second chance at first love which is just perfection for me.Second it is a military story and they always just break my heart. The whole ultimate sacrifice gets me everytime. Reading and knowing a soldier took part in writing made it very real, we got to actually look at what happens in war. We are in the soldiers head, just amazing.And last but not least it was an emotional read. I laughed because Katie was a funny little smart as# at times. I cried quite a few times. I even held my breath through a few scenes.Just a wonderful, beautiful story.

"She Part 2 is the perfect follow up to She. Logan and Gemima are vacationing on the French Riviera. It’s the perfect combination of sightseeing, relaxing and sex. The only problem seems to be Gemima having to meet Logan’s parents and his brother.I fell in love with Logan and Gemima in She and that love has grown deeper in She Part 2. These characters are so well written, I couldn’t help but to fall in love with them. Logan is handsome, kind, rich, and all around perfect guy. Gemima is beautiful, full of life and has a tendency to speak her mind. Logan’s brother on the other hand is a bit of a jerk. The chemistry and passion between Logan and Gemima is off the charts. This leads to some pretty hot sex scenes. Their love knows no bounds and is a dream of a relationship. I loved reading more about their relationship and watching it grow.She Part 2 is an amazing read and the perfect ending to She. This story is a great love story and I truly believe that Logan and Gemima are soulmates. Logan waited for two years to get his girl. It is absolutely beautifully written. I felt like I was there with them and was wishing Logan was mine. Ms Fanning is quickly becoming a favorite author of mine. Her writing is flawless and near perfection. I would recommend She Part 2 to anyone who read She Part 1 and likes a epic love story with lots of hot sex scenes.

"Terrible product. If I went into detail, it would be a novel. The firmware has far too many bugs in it. The worst is if you set the NVR to record over the oldest video when the drive becomes full, the system goes bonkers when there's still hundreds of gigs left, and puts messages on the screen saying the hard drive is full. It beeps like crazy, stops recording, and won't work again until you format the hard drive. Almost 6 months since this thing came out. I reported like 45 bugs to them. They haven't release a firmware update still, even though I was told 5 months ago that it would be ""soon"".Once their support department realized how serious I was, they all stopped responding.

"I love Apple mobile products, but this device is just a bigger iPad, and nothing more. There really isn't anything special here. Sure, you can do split screen apps, and a bit of multitasking, but that's about where the advantages stop, aside from the screen being bigger.I've had an iPad since the first one was released. I've had the iPad 1, 3, 4, and Air 1. I greatly enjoy my iPad air, and actually prefer it over my Windows 10 laptop with a touch screen I love it so much I decided to buy an iPad pro because I wanted the bigger screen. Why did I want a bigger screen? Not because I'm 700 years old, or because my eyesight is 8799324/20, and I need my text to be bigger, but because I want more resolution space. I want text to appear on the iPad Pro as the same size, or even smaller, than it appears on my iPad Air, giving me more space to see more stuff all on one screen. What did I get? an iPad that displays stuff on the screen EXACTLY THE SAME WAY as on EVERY OTHER IPAD IN EXISTENCE. Instead of text being the same size as on the Air, it's bigger. It takes up the same amount of space, therefore making the bigger screen not worth it for me. Text settings are set all the way to smallest, on both of my iPads. It's a super disappointment, and therefore I am returning the THOUSAND DOLLAR giant iPad Air.Now, let's get into the issues I had within the first 24 hours of ownership. TouchID is SLOW SLOW SLOW. Sometimes I'd put my finger on the home button, the lock screen would start to unlock, and 20 seconds later the iPad would actually unlock. This would differ, depending on how long the iPad had been sitting idle. If I woke it up over and over again, it would take the typical 1-2 seconds for touchID to work. On my iPhone 6s, it takes only milliseconds of my finger being in the home button, for it to unlock.The device completely died when it reached 100% charge, 7 out of the 8 times I got it charged to 100%. Every time I would have to hold the power/home buttons for 10 seconds, forcing a reset. I'd drain it a few percent, plug it back in and when I'd come back, it would be dead. It's being reported in many other places, and Apple is zero help. This issue is being reported on many forums all over the place. Apple is aware, but has no idea how to solve the issue.The hardware is beautiful. It's a great weight. It's nice to hold. The screen looks as good as the rest of the iPads I've had. It's really fast, and gaming is amazing on the A9X processor. But iOS 9 is awful, which essentially ruins this iPad.Save your cash, and wait until Apple gets their crap together with iOS 9.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVAQKUGI00S9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0155OCLWK#wasThisHelpful","RVAQKUGI00S9C","A7HKGNXQD7LVP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7HKGNXQD7LVP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm impressed with this scanner. It's so tiny, but works like the big boys. I do wish it had slightly larger input/output trays, but other than that it's awesome.The software is a tad buggy. The CaptureOnTouch software has a bug where you choose job #1 on the scanner and hit start, and it doesn't choose job #1, and therefore job #1 in the software us useless unless you specifically choose job #1 in the software. #2-9 work exactly how they're supposed to. I've also had it crash on me like 15 different times at all stages. After the scan, during a scan, etc. It's frustrating that it crashes, which means you have to start the scan job over completely.One small wish I have for the software is for it to read barcodes off of ONLY the first page in the batch, in order to determine how to name the file. This would save us a ton of time, as we scan hundreds upon hundreds of pieces of paper every day. The problem is, almost every single piece of paper we scan, also has a barcode on it.

"Bought two of these. One for my son's quad (90cc Polaris), and another for my dirt bike (WR450). In the quad it's in the upright position, and in the bike it's laying on its side. It took me a good 10 minutes to get the screws on in my bike, and I had to put it up on a stand, and I had to use a screwdriver to push the nut into the right position for the screw. On the quad, it was WAY easier. Regardless of the PITA install, both batteries came with a 12.7v charge in them, which is definitely a little low. However after a trickle charge, both were up to a bit over 13v. The Yuasa battery in my bike was almost 3 years old, and sat in a crate as new for 2+ years before I bought the bike. It absolutely will not show voltage over 12.6v, even after being on a float charger for the entire winter. It was either spent $80 for each battery, or spend $24 for these guys, and take a gamble.

"Less than two months old, and the system has died. It will start up, it refuses to connect to any cameras, it stays booted for about a minute, then shuts down and reboots. I've disconnected all hard drives, and tested the power supply. This thing is a steaming pile of junk. DO NOT BUY IT. Even worse is that I know when I contact Grandstream about it, they will refuse to replace it, since they don't honor any kind of warranty.I contacted Grandstream, and as usual, they told me to contact my reseller. I contacted Amazon, even though it was sold by the VOIPMart. Amazon instantly refunded my money, and told me to throw the product away. Apparently they are already aware of a high number of issues with this product. I don't like being the guinnea pig, but hopefully I save some people some time.Grandstream products DO NOT HAVE A WARRANTY! Thankfully, Amazon refunded my money for this purchase.-----------------------------------------------------------HARDWAREI was a bit shocked by the size of this thing. Seems like they could have made it a tad more compact, especially considering that the main board is absolutely tiny, and doesn't take up the whole space in the back. If the board were redesigned, the box could lose a good 3-4"" in depth. It's rack mountable and the hard drives go up front, putting the weight in the proper position for mounting on a 2-post rack, as in my case. However, what I find strange is how unbelievably difficult it is to get into this box. From the factory there's 8 screws which must be removed in order to open it up. 4 on the back, then 2 on each side towards the front. However, add the rack mounts, and suddenly you've added another 6 screws that must be removed. If you add the rear mounts for some 4-post racks, that's another 6 screws. If you have to replace a hard drive, you're looking at 20 screws to be removed just to access the hard drives, and it doesn't include the 4 screws to remove the hard drive. Aside from that, the chassis is so unbelievably simple. It's easy to mount hard drives, and the cost is kept down through the use of all those screws.The dumbest thing is that this only has two USB ports. The manual suggests connecting keyboard and mouse to the rear one. You can connect a keyboard OR mouse to this, but not both. I connected a small 4 port USB hub, and that allowed me to have both connected, which is good. Really though, it should just have 2 USB ports in back, and 2 up front for storage.Audio input and output are RCA plugs, and not standard 3.5mm headphone jacks. This means it's compatible with almost nothing, since nothing utilizes RCA jacks these days. You must purchase adapters in order to connect the system to regular computer speakers or anything similar.There is ONE little TINY 1.5"" fan in the back of this unit. Nowhere near proper cooling for 4 hard drives. I'm worried about thermal issues once the system has 4 hard drives in it.No batteries were included with the remote control (requires 2 AAA)SOFTWAREThis is where this product starts to go downhill. I really love Grandstream products, but the #1 problem with their stuff is that it's written by someone who doesn't speak English, and is never double-checked by someone who does. Instructions are worded in odd ways, and tool tips for options always have weird wording that often doesn't make sense.  Tips don't actually match the option in some cases. As an example, on the SMTP config page, the option is ""Receiver 1"", but the help hint says ""Set the email address of sender 1"".When you choose DHCP (default) the screen does not show what the IP configuration is. For me to figure out what its IP address was, I had to go to my DHCP server and compare the MAC address. It looks as if it doesn't pull DNS addresses from DHCP, because the option to specify DNS servers is NOT grayed out when DHCP is selected. Once you go to the status screen and view network info, you can see that it did correctly grab DNS, but the system shows that my primary DNS server shows the default DNS suffix, and the secondary DNS server shows the address of the primary DNS server. Buggy buggy buggy.The configuration of this device was really easy. The interface is relatively intuitive. But it's when you start getting into more finite settings that it gets worse.You can't configure a no authentication SMTP setup. Your SMTP server must allow authentication, because the GVR requires that you provide the username and password. In my case, we don't need that info, but I'm able to supply it. I don't like doing so. It only allows up to 3 email addresses to send to, rather than an endless list of them. When I ran a test to send an email, it said it sent successfully but there was nothing on the SMTP server showing that the GVR had tried in any way. I have been unable to get email notifications to work.Setting up recording is weird. You have 3 options. Closed, All Day, or Schedule. I chose all day for the 2 cameras I added, but then it literally records all day, 24/7. When choosing to disable (closed) recording, it makes you think that nothing will get recorded. I only want to record when there's an alarm, like from motion or something external. You can manage ""Camera events"", but on the camera event page, you have to know what camera number you want to configure, because Grandstream provided no way to name a camera. You can't call camera 1 ""Lobby"" and camera 2 ""Front Door"", so that you can reference that name everywhere else in the software. So you're forced to remember which camera number you're wanting to use. Sometimes this requires going back to the config page to figure that out. Once you figure out which camera, it's easy enough to set up recording for an alarm. What's awesome is that when you get motion on one camera, you can force any other camera to record as well. In my case I have a camera pointing at our front door from outside, and from inside. When motion is sensed from outside, I can record on both cameras and get every bit of the action before it even starts on the inside.Now we'll get to the absolute worst part of this device, and that's the playback. It's absolutely terrible, and uncontrollable. I'm unsure how to even begin to list all the problems with playback. There is no scrubbing, so you can't go back and forth. You can only change the forward speed, and only when ONE camera is being shown. Going in reverse is almost impossible to watch. It skips backwards in 2-3 second increments. Moving the slider to try to get to a specific point in time, is not worth it, because it's impossible. It doesn't matter if you're using the web player or are on the server itself. You can't increase playback speed while viewing more than one camera at a time, which is dumb. Even two pictures can't be displayed at 2x speeds.I've had constant issues getting the browser plugin to work on one of my computers with Chrome.

Does not work in Chrome, but works great in Firefox.Bringing up the Live View page to view the cameras, comes up with a completely blank screen. You are then forced to double click each camera you want to show. If you show 24 cameras at a time, you will click 48 times to load all those cameras into a view. Then, OOPS, I forgot to change that one setting on that one camera, so you go and change that setting, only to come back to the live view and realize that you have 48 more clicks to load all your cameras. The Live View page needs to save the last view, or something.There's no browser or other type of instant alert for motion. At this time we're constantly monitoring our lobby camera in our new office, as we don't have a receptionist there yet. Since we moved in, I've been using iSpy which causes an instant balloon popup in the taskbar to notify you which camera has movement. It would be a nice feature to get those instant alerts, and not have them be sound based (at the server) or email based. I don't need an email every time an employee walks out the front door.The Live view page utilizes the secondary stream of the camera. In the case of our grandstream cameras, the resolution was 320x240, and made the preview very grainy until you went full screen, at which point it starts using the primary camera stream. I'm having a difficult time fully determining when it's using which stream, and how it's analyzing the stream in order to determine motion.So far, it's really not bad, especially considering the price. I am thinking about ordering one for home, but I wish it were physically smaller.-----UPDATE: 6/15/2015-----Endless issues with this thing. We stopped buying Grandstream products, because Grandstream warranty and support are worthless, so I started buying several cameras to test out. After 4 different cameras, here are my results:-First camera would log me out when I added it. Talked to support, they blame the camera, end of story. Works perfectly within the ONVIF device manager software from sourceforge.-Second camera simply does not work. It sees the camera, adds the camera, but then doesn't connect to the streams. Works perfectly within ONVIF device manager.-Third and fourth cameras are relatively similar, and they work great, except that the NVR refuses to detect motion from anything from grandstream cameras. Also, when I do a full-time record of either camera, the bottom 15% of the image gets blurred on playback. I am unable to see motion within the playback screen on either camera.In addition to that, today the hard drive had completely lost its configuration. When I tried to recreate the volume, it said it failed. When I went back to try it again, there was the successfully created volume. 2 months worth of recordings lost. System says HDD is in good condition with no SMART errors. It was a brand new HD, so who knows where the problem lies.After all that, I'm playing with cameras, and trying to get it to record, but it won't unless the camera is made by grandstream. I would love to contact support, but they really are horrible. So, I'm adding and removing cameras, and suddenly am logged out. Then I try to log back in and it says that the user ""admin"" doesn't exist. WTF? I was literally just logged in. I try another browser, and same thing. I use the DNS name rather than the IP, and it lets me in. So I play around for a few minutes, and it logs me out AGAIN, and says the admin user doesn't exist. WTFFFFFF? I try the other user I created, and it also doesn't exist. What a pile of junk.I'm glad We only spent $200 on this thing, because it's probably going to either go in the trash, or to my house to record video from a single camera. It's not AT ALL high enough quality for business use. I should not have been so naive.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8RIGVRGYL5V8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q2TN6L8#wasThisHelpful","R8RIGVRGYL5V8","A7HKGNXQD7LVP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7HKGNXQD7LVP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Because it comes straight out of the plug, and it's the first thing to hit the wall, people are constantly pushing the machine to the wall, and kinking the hose, causing the Keurig to run out of water.

"First, download the Aquatec ERP1000 instructions.They contain the diagram for removing the shut-off switch, which makes a huge difference.The reason this works so well is that it uses the drain water to turn a pump which pushes more pressure into the storage tank. It's also pulling from the membrane so it's generating more water, more quickly. The tank pressure will be closer to water inlet pressure. It's pretty much the hydraulics version of a turbocharger in a car.In my case, I installed a system in our new office building. The fridge and coffee machine are on the opposite side of the room. 52PSI from the city inlet, which is awful. The fridge barely had a trickle of water. It was making tiny ice cubes. I had no outlet under the sink for a demand pump. I took videos of before, during, and after, of the speed of filling a cup. ~40 seconds before, and ~20 seconds after. That's a huge improvement. It also makes properly sized ice cubes now. Not quite as good as the demand pump I have on the same RO system at home, but I'm considering adding the permeate pump simply because it increases the capacity of the storage tank via higher pressures. This is why the shut-off valve must be removed. The Watts manual did not include this.I didn't use any of the included parts, except for the tubing. Plenty of stuff in there if you need it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2779QAZ65MLJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ILIJR2#wasThisHelpful","R2779QAZ65MLJR","A7HKGNXQD7LVP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7HKGNXQD7LVP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since Grandstream refuses to honor their warranty for many of the products we have purchased from them, I have changed by rating of all of their products to 1 star. When Grandstream decides to honor their warranty, I'll restore my 4 star rating. Here is a response I received from Grandstream: ""This product was purchased from amazon, so from legal point of view you have to contact amazon first not going after the manufacturer. If you buy an Apple product from Bestbuy and Bestbuy return policy doesn't allow you to return the item are you going after Apple?First, as was pointed out by another reviewer, this camera is not black. It's white. For me that was ok, but some might want what's in the picture.I absolutely love this camera so far, but it's missing a couple important items compared to other grandstream cameras. Most notably is its inability to adjust time based on daylight savings. Our GXV3611 has settings for when DST starts and ends, but this camera does not. So, when you set time/date via NTP, it sets it an hour behind as of right now. The only other option is to change the time manually. I expect any device that has NTP capabilities to have DST settings in this day and age.It's only been installed for a few hours, but I really like the quality and adjustability of the housing, and that it's all metal.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20N3BIT8MZZ0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I84TBO6#wasThisHelpful","R20N3BIT8MZZ0P","A7HKGNXQD7LVP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7HKGNXQD7LVP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Started with the HM1300, and liked the headset so much that I decided to grab this HM1900 for the noise cancelling, A2DP bluetooth profile capabilities, and being able to have 2 devices connected at the same time. There are a few issues with this headset:1. Battery life is not as good as the HM13002. Volume level and sound quality of the earpiece is not as good as the HM13003. While this cancels out the background noise, my voice doesn't sound as good to the caller on the other end, as it did on the HM1300. It's a toss-up whether or not this trade-off is worth it. Callers can still hear me clickety-clacketing away at my keyboard, and every mouse click.4. Charging port cover is next to impossible to remove without having long fingernails. I have to use a pen to open it up every night for charging.5. While it connects to my computer and my desk phone without issue, occasionally it will completely lose itself. Sometimes my desk phone ends a call, and the headset doesn't recognize it, and refuses to switch back to the computer. Sometimes the headset will not connect to my computer, even though it was just playing sound several seconds earlier. This requires me turning the headset off and back on for it to reconnect.I got 2 of these. One for myself, and one for our receptionist. While our receptionist only connects it to her phone, she has many of the same issues I do with the phone randomly all of a sudden not recognizing that the headset is connected. Easily solved by turning the headset off and back on.

Second, it's nearly impossible to open, and even worse because I have hardly any fingernails. I hate fingernail open knives. But, that was solved by adding a drop of lube to the center, and I bent back the friction arm which keep the blade open.

"Since it seems some people don't like lengthy reviews, here's my review overview:-Spent over $1400 on the i5 w/8GB memory and 256SSD, plus the type cover keyboard.-Out-of-box issues which took a couple hours to resolve.-LCD has yellowed whites, grayed blacks, and text is not very sharp.-LCD touch is somewhat inaccurate compared to other touch screens I use-Graphical capabilities bottlenecked by internal hardware.-i5 processor bottlenecked by internal hardware.-SSD runs slowly. Comparable to SATA III spinning drive performance. About half of how today's SSDs perform.-Windows touch button unreliable.-MicroSD card slot means you must carry around an SD card reader if you want to pull images off a camera.-Bad price:value ratio.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FULL REVIEW:Bought one of these yesterday at a local Microsoft store. I was so excited. Spent over $1400 on the i5 w/8GB memory and 256GB SSD, plus the type cover keyboard.Got home, booted it up, it took almost 30 minutes for it to go through its setup processes. I swore it was hung, but I waited it out. Finally it came to a desktop screen where nothing would happen. Couldn't touch the start button, the hardware button would work every few presses, and the screen would flicker on and off. Rebooted it, and it fixed nothing. Finally had to do a full reset by holding power and volume up, which finally made it come back to life and I could start using it.First, the LCD screen is a joke. My iPad air has a far brighter screen, the text is WAY sharper, and overall the Surface screen just doesn't look as good as the iPad or my NINE year old laptop with a 17"" screen. Whites on the Surface look completely yellowed, where on the iPad air they are bright white, and black text is dark black. The Surface has text that is pushing into darker shades of gray.I started browsing the internet and noticed a few web pages that were awfully slow, so I started comparing with my nine year old laptop, and iPad. In every page I tested, the Surface was so slow... We're not talking about molasses, but scrolling was terribly choppy, zooming in and out caused several graphical artifacts as the machine had to keep up and display the video. Sometimes zooming out would tape upwards of 2-3 seconds to complete the zoom. My iPad never acts that way.I ran an IO test on the SSD, and what a joke! Read speeds of under 300MB/sec, and write speeds closer to 200MB/sec. This is just barely faster than most SATA III spinning hard drives. My old laptop, with a SATA I SSD gets around 140MB read, and 90MB write speeds. For a 9 year age difference, the performance difference should be astounding. The 2 year old SSD in my desktop computer, on a SATA II controller, gets well over 400MB/sec red speeds, with 300MB/sec write speeds. My work computer with SATA III SSD gets well over 600MB/sec read and 500MB/sec write speeds. A colleague of mine has an original Surface, and his SSD gets 423MB/sec read and 263MB/sec Write, blowing away the Surface 3. Microsoft cheapened components of these machines in areas they thought most people wouldn't notice, and it shows. for $1,400, I expected WAY more than this.Then we get into the touch screen. It's absolutely terrible and inaccurate. Every touch registers lower than where my finger actually is. I tested this literally hundreds of times, and even wrote a quick program to show exact positioning of the mouse cursor with a touch. It was always registering several pixels away from the center of the finger touch. This caused me to constantly select items that were one down in a drop-list. It was thoroughly annoying.The windows logo touch ""button"" was terrible. When in standby, there were times I'd tap it 10 times before it'd finally register that touch. When on, not every touch would cause a reaction. Simply not reliable in any way.One annoying thing is the microSD card reader slot. These days, there are still a ton of cameras which use SD cards. Most notably, pretty much ANY SLR camera. This means you must carry around an additional USB card reader in order to pull pictures off your camera, or you have to hook up to the camera via cable. But then... I guess this could go the other way around. If you have a camera which uses MicroSD, and you have no microSD slot. At least in that case all you need is one of those tiny adapters for micro/mini SD cards.Aside from all these issues, it's a nice device. Looks good, isn't THAT heavy, and would be great for a traveling professional, but the lack of ability to upgrade, and the lack of performance, means that a cheaper laptop is a far better option, and brings better performance.The price:value ratio just isn't there. I will be returning this and getting a regular old laptop.UPDATE: I returned the Surface and the guys at the Microsoft store swear that I got bad hardware, or that the firmware was old and needed to be updated.UPDATE 3-16-2015: Bought a Dell Inspiron 13 7000, which is a 2-in-1 laptop. While it's slightly heavier than the Surface, it blows the Surface away in literally every single other aspect. Battery life is better, CPU performance is better, SSD performance is better, windows button is physical and reliable, LCD quality is FAR better, has a standard SD slot, has passive stylus w/storage spot, and it was more than $400 less expensive. Also compared the performance of it to a friend's Surface Pro 3, which works better than the one I bought, and it still blows it away. Sorry Microsoft, but the Surface just doesn't meet the price:value ratio.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16SGX3QTMM656/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHR4T8U#wasThisHelpful","R16SGX3QTMM656","A7HKGNXQD7LVP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7HKGNXQD7LVP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm extremely impressed. I was ready to throw this thing back in the box and return it, after having nothing but problems with it. I have an old Linksys WAP we're been using for a couple years, and I was testing this out to replace it, and add a couple repeaters in our new office building. I was getting 1-3Mbps throughput from it on the down side, and 10Mbps on the up side. So confused... I came to find that having the SSID the same name for both frequencies (2.4GHz and 5GHz) was causing a problem. Once I created SSIDs for each frequency, problems disappeared, and I was seeing 100Mbps on several devices, which is exactly the speed of our internet connection. Impressive, being that the Linksys could only produce about 47Mbps, even on 5GHz N wireless. I replaced our Linksys and mirrored the SSIDs and passwords from it. Nobody has made any complaints about connectivity, which is awesome. I'm curious to see how it works once I add another as a repeater.The other beautiful thing about these is that they are PoE, so they are easily mountable in office ceiling tiles, and look very clean. I believe I'll be ordering a couple of these for my home, as we have signal issues there. I have conduit running from my basement to my attic, so I can place one on the upper floors with just one cat5 cable. No power run necessary.I wish they were a little bit cheaper, but they are still reasonably priced for what they can do, especially considering I spent $180 on my current access point at home.I only have one complaint. When setting each radio to automatically select a frequency channel, it would almost always select the most congested channel. I used its channel usage monitor tool, and it would show all the APs around, and what channels they are using. In our current building, 11, 6 and 1 are very congested. This Zyxel would rarely auto-select a channel that was least congested. It almost seems like ""auto"" is synonymous with ""completely random"".Support is the best you can get. Zyxel has great support, and it's always free.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY0BKVRASVGJ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I0F0I8Q#wasThisHelpful","RY0BKVRASVGJ4","A7HKGNXQD7LVP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7HKGNXQD7LVP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This device, and its companion TC-TP1 probe, have a price:features issue. I bought this with the TC-TP1 for work. At home I have a cheap VicTsing toner/tester, and it's more capable than this setup for what I'm doing.PROS:-The transmitter is capable of testing a cable plugged into itself, or at the other end of the remote terminator.-Better built than the VicTsing. Definitely of higher quality-Can stop on a single wire for troubleshooting, or will continuously test all 8, one after another. VicTsing can not stop on a single wire.-Comes with adapters for testing/toning BNC cables-TC-TP1 has non-conductive probe tip for insulation from electrical currentsCONS:-This tester does not come with an RJ11 to alligator clip adapter, for attaching directly to wires. This becomes an issue when attempting to trace a cable that you do not intend to terminate with RJxx plug or jack. The VicTsing comes with it.-This device is more than the VicTsing, and doesn't include the toning probe.-This comes with a carrying case, the TC-TP1 probe does not. The VicTsing is only 2 pieces, and comes with a case that fits everything, and the two pieces attach to each other without a case.-2.5mm headphone jack. VicTsing has standard 3.5mm. 2.5mm seriously limits your options.-You have to flip a switch to go from speaker to headphones. Why the headset plug doesn't have this capability built in, is confusing.-Only generates one tone type which generates no tones in the higher frequencies, which makes the tone harder to hear (at least, for some). VicTsing has two different tones, one being the standard high/low alternating frequency tone used on many other tone generators.-No light on the TC-TP1. VicTsing has an LED.-Must continually press the trace button on the TC-TP1. VicTsing has the option to press button, or switch on constant.The transmitter has two completely different button styles. It really looks like it was designed in the 90's. To me, it's just weird.for this and the TC-TP1 probe, it's almost 3 times as expensive as the VicTsing. I'm pretty sure I'll return these and get the VicTsing.

"Grandstream products DO NOT have a manufacturer's warranty. Here I am about 9 months after purchase, and the camera has crapped out. I can no longer load the web interface or the video feed. It's unfortunate, because this camera had a GREAT picture, and awesome features.I've spent a little bit playing with this camera, and it's pretty sweet. SIP stuff works great. I love how you can trigger a SIP call from a number of different events. It can then be hooked to an access control system to trigger the release of a door from a SIP phone.The reason I'm taking a star off is because you can't face the camera lens upward enough. Even on a 9' ceiling, 22' away from our front door, I can only catch the bottom 2' of the door itself. No way to see people's faces.  Now, at a 9' height, 8' away from the door, it's easy to see a 6' person walk in the door. The microphone and speaker also seem to be designed for exactly that distance. Speaker isn't very loud, and microphone hears people perfectly at the 8' mark. Any farther away and it's hard to hear them.Unfortunately, I don't think this camera is going to work for us for our lobby. I'd totally order one for home use.

"There's a serious issue with these. I bought a set about 3 years ago. I cut my hair once a month. I'm simple... just a #1 all the way around. So, based on their claim, right there on the box, that it will hold a charge for up to a year, I figured I could charge them after I use them, then unplug and store. Oh, no... that's not at all how it works. It doesn't hold a charge for very long at all. So I'd leave them plugged in all the time. Then about 14 months after I bought them, I cut my hair, left them unplugged, and came back almost 2 months later to cut my hair. They weren't just dead, they were DEAD. Would not charge, charge light would not come on. Completely dead. Wahl has a 5 year warranty, but I can't wait for that. I'm a shaggy, terrorist look-a-like. I need to cut my hair. So I went and bought another one, with the intent of having two, and returning the other one for repair. I forgot to send the other ones for repair. So, here I am about a year and a half later and the second clipper set is also dead. EXACT same issues. Wouldn't hold a charge, and once it was completely dead, that was the end. 2 dead clippers.There's something ALWAYS draining the battery.

"I have yet to sleep on this mattress, since it's winter time, but I spent a bit of time on it. It's very comfortable, though I think the top needs a bit more cushion, and that's what I expected. It's a pretty firm mattress, but there's no reason to deduct stars because of it. The pocketed coils do exactly what they're supposed to do, and don't transfer motion to the other side of the bed. I do plan to add a memory foam topper, which should make this a great mattress.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF6J65PWJL29X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JRHI1LM#wasThisHelpful","RF6J65PWJL29X","A7HKGNXQD7LVP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7HKGNXQD7LVP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've made a lot of bad decisions in my lifetime, but purchasing an Xbox One is definitely at the top of that list of bad decisions.First, my xbox had a VERY noisy fan. Then 2 days later the Kinect sensor died. Asked Microsoft to replace both. They sent me a new xbox, but not a new Kinect sensor. After a bit of complaining, Microsoft sent out another Kinect sensor. By that point, I was already at my 30 day mark, so I couldn't return this pile of junk, because I undoubtedly would have.Since I purchased mine on release day, I noticed that Microsoft did a terrible job at making sure the xbox dashboard had what I like to call ""features"". This platform came out as if this were the first xbox ever made. It lacked features the original xbox had. It lacked the majority of features that the xbox 360 had. Things as stupid as a lack of controller battery level. The inability to do almost anything DLNA. The inability to set an auto-sign-in profile. Inability to disable controller vibration. Inability to set inverted look for game defaults. Inability to do one-on-one chat sessions. Inability to have friends in a party playing different games. Lack of dashboard themes. Inability to get a notification when a friend comes online. That's just the beginning. I could go on endlessly about the stuff this system was lacking from the start.Now to a year later, the thing locks up all the time. A running game in the background often causes choppy TV video and audio. Still lacks features the 360 had. It's much better than on release day, thanks to Microsoft's regular updates. Original controller died about 2 days after the warranty expired, and Microsoft refused to replace it. I've played EXACTLY 3 games, start to finish, on that controller. That means that literally every piece of hardware in my box was defective in some way.The Kinect sensor is a freaking joke. I develop software which uses the original Kinect sensor, and it's really a lot of fun. The speech recognition is great, for a first generation product, and overall it just works. But this new kinect sensor is junk. It NEVER hears me correctly. My daughter's first word EVER, was ""xbox"" because we'd sit there saying ""xbox. xbox. xbox. xbox. xbox. xbox."", trying to get it to understand commands to just stop listening or to change the channel, mute the volume, you name it. We said it so often that it was the first word she picked up. What's funny is that half the time she'd say ""xbox"", it would recognize it, but for the rest of us it would get it far less often. It would take 5-10 times saying ""xbox on"" before the xbox would turn on. But hey, let's just keep going about this junk kinect sensor. I don't even plug it in anymore. My wife and I would be talking to each other, making hand animations while talking about our day, and suddenly the channel would change. Microsoft added a feature to disable gestures while watching ""video"", but some moron at Microsoft didn't include ""TV"" in ""video"". So, you can't stop it. The controller could be bumped off a chair, while on, and one trigger would get pressed, the video would fast forward, and sometimes change the channel. No way to disable that either. Often the kinect itself would lock up, then cause the xbox to stop responding. It's just so much better to leave it unplugged. But even when unplugged, if you touch a controller trigger while watching TV, it comes up with the OSD showing that it's trying to FF/Rew, even though the system should be engineered to recognize that the kinect sensor isn't there, and therefore not make any attempts to send IR commands, nor show the IR OSD. It's as if there's a bunch of monkeys in a barrel, and that's Xbox Engineering. Then there's a box of monkeys which makes up Xbox QA. Once again, I could go on and on about how poorly thought out and planned this system is.Now, let me get to the games. They are great. I enjoy playing the games. I'm glad I get to play the great games available on the system. I love the TV passthrough. I like knowing a friend comes online while watching TV. There are some really great advantages over the 360, in that sense. But, sadly, I use my 360 far more often. It's just a better system, when you look away from the improved graphics and other capabilities like TV.We have 3 of these systems in our house, and they are all the same. Remember how Windows 8 was a feature-lacking joke? This is the Windows 8 of the gaming world. Microsoft will come back during the next round, but they really screwed things over this time around.This system is, without even the slightest doubt, the worst piece of technology I've ever purchased. The biggest waste of $500. I seriously considered, at one point, finding an attorney to force Microsoft to take this worthless pile of junk off my hands, since I couldn't return it after the 30 day mark. I will NEVER again purchase another generation of Xbox consoles. I'm done.One last thing worth mentioning... The Xbox One utilizes about 80 watts when at idle, watching TV. In my case, I'm running a 58"" Plasma TV which uses about 550 watts. An equivalent LED LCD would use 100 watts or fewer. This means that if you own an LCD TV, you are literally doubling your power consumption just to watch TV. In my case, it's an increase of 15%. If the TV is on 8 hours every day, times 30 average days, that's 240 watt hours, which is just over 19Kwh. This is relatively minimal, but it can add up. In my case, at 12 cents per Kwh, it's $2.28 every month just to run the xbox while watching TV, since there's no way to pass TV through while the xbox is off.It increases the average cost of watching TV from $15.84/mo., to $18.12. It would be great to have an option to turn off the xbox, and let it be just a passthrough.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VT8CI713FDGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFXOQW2#wasThisHelpful","R1VT8CI713FDGL","A7HKGNXQD7LVP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7HKGNXQD7LVP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No way does this thing deserve 5 stars. It's a $100 camera. Far better than the $30 cheap-o camera I came from. I don't need the best camera in the world, but I do want something that takes good video. This camera takes pretty good video, though sadly my old $30 piece-o-junk took better video at night. The main problem with this camera is that every street light and car brake light creates a massive light-blur sphere. In some cases, so big that brake lights will cover the license plate of the car in front of you. It's not the best at night, but aside from the light issues, it takes pretty good video.The biggest problem with this thing, is that it's base is designed for a right-hand drive car. What I did is took out the two little screws on the connector that connects the camera to the base. I then turned the connector on the camera 180 degrees, trimmed off some unnecessary plastic underneath to make it fit right, and now the base faces the same direction as the camera. I'm not really sure whose bright idea it was to put so much strain on the camera and base. Now the whole assembly is much more compact, the power plug on the base faces towards the rear-view mirror, which is where power comes from. I tried so many other ways to mount it, but the mount is very poorly thought out. You can't flip the mount around in its stock form and twist to adjust the camera. The camera won't twist that far. The camera really needs to be able to twist 270 degrees at a minimum, but the best you get is 100 degrees or so. It's just hard to get right. I have mine mounted about 8"" to the left of the rear-view mirror at the very top of the windshield. It catches everything. I like that this has all the capabilities of GPS and video, but it's still pretty cheap. I guess we'll see how it does in the summer. For now, it's cold here in Colorado. Overall, the mount sucks. Having to stick it to the windshield is stupid, but it is nice and compact. I do like that I don't ever have to unplug it. I think eventually I will epoxy the base to a proper suction cup mount.The audio is fine. Better than my old camera. I can hear my daughter from the back seat if the stereo isn't up.The blue LED light is extremely annoying at night. Too bright. Had to cover it with a piece of electrical tape.It takes a good 30 seconds to get a GPS fix, first thing in the morning.The interface is cheap. Pretty much identical to my old camera.I'm sure it's going to lock up one day, and there is no reset button. Even my old one has a reset button.It's exactly what I want out of a $100 camera. I'm not trying to make feature film in my car.UPDATE 3/16/2015: I've been using this thing for 3 months now, and while I have yet to catch any accidents or injuries, I have caught many police breaking the law, which have resulted in citations being issued. I also got a recording of a police officer misinforming me of a reckless driving law on private property, which resulted in a formal complaint being filed against that officer. Audio is crystal clear, and the video is great. I'm happy with this camera, but we'll see how it goes when it starts to get hotter outside, since there are so many complaints about issues with heat.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSVPN0AS8VHAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JIPRKO2#wasThisHelpful","RSVPN0AS8VHAI","A7HKGNXQD7LVP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7HKGNXQD7LVP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There's 8 of us in the office. Not everyone drinks coffee every day. Maybe averaging 3-6 cups of coffee made every day, M-F. I literally never use it.I just ordered our third one of these. Bought the first in Feb of 2011. By April, it had already crapped out. Heater died, would no longer brew. Keurig sent us a new one. That one lasted until just a week ago. Brew pump pretty much failed and would not give enough pressure to brew when a k-cup was in. I'm guessing we ran around 3,000 - 4,000 k-cups through it (I'm probably high), but it seems like these things should be more reliable. We always use bottled water, and clean it on a regular basis.This is actually our 7th Keurig brewer in 6 years. The first were lower-end brewers, but they died within a few months or a year. Keurig replaced a few of them. I was not surprised when our first K155 died after only 2 months of use. Hoping this third one lasts a lot longer than the rest. It really is the best bang-for-your-buck k-cup brewer for a small office, plus it supports a dedicated water line with an accessory tank replacement.Straight up, Keurig brewers just aren't very reliable. I bought one for home a few years ago, it died within a few months. Only made like a dozen cups of coffee. Keurig replaced it, that lasted a few more months. Keurig replaced it, and that one worked great for like a year, then got to the point where it would never start brewing until I literally smacked the very top of the unit, and INSTANTLY it would start brewing. Worked for a couple more years with seldom use, then finally died. I own a Starbucks Verismo at home, and it's the most reliable thing I've ever used. My wife and I use it every day, and we religiously each run 2 pods (2 espresso shots) each. 2.5 years later, we're nearing 4k pods run through it. It has never once given us a single issue, EVER. Heats up in less than 10 seconds, and just works... always. Problem is, Starbucks has absolutely no variety of coffee/espresso, and nobody else will make Verismo pods. It's very limited, but they have my favorite bean in the world, Antigua Guatemala, in espresso and coffee pods. The rest of their coffees suck. Keurig really does have this market relatively cornered, and that's the only reason we keep buying these machines with their endless problems.Buy it if you dare...","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWLIYTXC8L55W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DWKEHU4#wasThisHelpful","RWLIYTXC8L55W","A7HKGNXQD7LVP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7HKGNXQD7LVP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The songs in this generous compilation fall into two distinct categories, to the extent that it’s difficult to see at which audience it’s been targeted. On the one hand there are songs that featured in his Great American Songbook series, and secondly those he would have heard contemporaneously. Whilst no great enthusiast for Rod Stewart, I recognise that in applying his granulated tones to the standards, he introduced a lot of his fans to that wonderful galaxy of compositions, many of which were written for, and featured in, plays and films of the thirties (although you will not glean that from the basic tracklist). I hope this concept will attract some of those beguiled by Rod’s efforts to discover the delights of the originals, although a few versions, like “Manhattan” and “I Get a Kick Out of You”, have dated. On the other hand, the inclusion of more modern artists such as Sonny Boy Williamson, Arthur Crudup, and Howlin’ Wolf seem somewhat incongruous in such company.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RA5UBQDHTI1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GZ3DKNK#wasThisHelpful","R2RA5UBQDHTI1E","AI4MUD97FH6G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI4MUD97FH6G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Nevertheless, it’s an interesting compilation, which includes some selections from the outfield, including Dick Robertson with Angelo Ferdinando & his Hotel Great Northern Orchestra, and the original recordings of “Fever” and “Kansas City” by Little Willie John and Little Willie Littlefield respectively.

"Apart from 2-CD sets, I can think of only one earlier multiple release, namely the 2003 3-CD Avid set, unless you count the 1995 3-CD Claves set (strictly speaking, a tribute to Lew Stone). So this 4-CD budget-priced set is a welcome addition to the catalogue. It’s not really surprising that it’s weighted in favour of Lew Stone (31), Ray Noble (20), Roy Fox (11), and Monia Liter (7), but since it offers 100 songs, in broadly chronological order,  that still leaves room for some less well-known recordings. For example, “Goodnight Sweetheart”, “Love is the Sweetest Thing”, and “The Very Thought of You”, the NMDO versions of which are practically de rigueur for reissues, are included here in alternative versions. The vocals are most extensive on the studio orchestra sides, and some with Monia Liter show Al to have been no mean guitarist. On the down side, prospective purchasers may wish to be aware that the volume varies depending on the recording. Also, Elizalde’s “If I Had You” was recorded at less than 78 rpm, so it needs to be slowed down to achieve the correct pitch, but that has not been catered for in the remastering process, with the result that it’s been reproduced too fast. Against that, the compilation has been selected with care, and includes definitive versions of some of the best popular songs ever written on either side of the Atlantic, which have never been surpassed. Allowing for age and rarity, sound quality is bright and generally very good, the US air check being an exception. It includes a booklet with a detailed tracklist, and a 6-page biography.

"Somewhat unusually for Avid, these four albums appear in the order in which they were recorded. A 19-piece orchestra (which included Bernie Glow, Ernie Royal, Bob Brookmeyer, Urbie Green, Al Cohn, Terry Pollard, and Osie Johnson) was deployed in October 1956 for “Swingin’”, an album which fully justifies its title. In contrast, a quartet was used for the February 1958 album “Terry Gibbs Plays The Duke”, with Pete Jolly on accordion (shades of Cornell Smelser), Leroy Vinnegar on bass and Gary Frommer on drums. This may be small group jazz, but it’s amazing how much depth of sound and variety of tone was created. “More Vibes on Velvet” followed in November, and the 9-piece band was conducted by Mel Lewis on drums, who also provided the arrangements for ten standards. I hesitate to describe this as smooth jazz, because nowadays that term denotes bland, which it’s not. Finally, a quintet including Herb Ellis on guitar, Frank Strazzieri on piano, Al McKibbon on bass and Frank Capp on drums produced the 1960 album “Music from Cole Porter’s Can Can”.

"The oldest of the four albums here is ""Dancing on the Ceiling"" which was recorded for Decca over four sessions between July 1952 and April 1953. To begin with the trio comprised Red Mitchell on bass and Tal Farlow on guitar, but the latter was replaced midway by Jimmy Raney. ""Music to Listen to Red Norvo by"" was recorded in early 1957, with a sextet that included Buddy Collette on flute, Bill Smith on clarinet, Barney Kessel on guitar, Red Mitchell, and Shelly Manne on drums. ""Red Plays the Blues"" was the product of two sessions; the first in January 1957, the second twelve months later, and ""Red Norvo in Stereo"" was recorded in March 1958. with a 13-piece orchestra.My preference is for the two earlier albums, particularly ""Dancing on the Ceiling"", where the accompaniment provides the perfect setting for his vibes, which he deploys to good effect in a set of standards. The sextet album is ostensibly under Norvo's leadership, but composer/clarinettist Bill Smith is much to the fore, and the album concludes with his complex four-movement Divertimento. I suspect that for some this will be the main attraction. ""Red Plays the Blues"" offers four tracks from the earlier session by a sextet including Harry Edison and Ben Webster, and three by a 13-piece orchestra, with vocals on two by singer Helen Humes. Finally ""Red Norvo in Stereo"" offers 12 standards by a 14-piece orchestra, featuring Helen Humes on 8 tracks. Her vocals have a throaty quality in the middle register, but acquire a harsher tone as she ascends the scale, and it's that stridency which holds me back from a five-star rating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ENVZWP12YPLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HT88XRS#wasThisHelpful","R1ENVZWP12YPLP","AI4MUD97FH6G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI4MUD97FH6G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: Not for the first time I wonder what Amazon is doing, because if you search you'll find this self-same item with a later release date, and considerably cheaper.The oldest recordings in this compilation feature the trio which featured Herb Ellis and Ray Brown. Three tracks, split across the two CDs, were recorded at Carnegie Hall in September 1952, at the beginning of the twelfth national tour by JATP. Next is the B side of the Verve album of the August 1956 Stratford Shakespearean Festival, which is considered by many to be the finest album recorded by that trio. When guitarist Herb Ellis left he was not replaced; instead drummer Gene Gammage, who’s present on the November 1958 recording of “My Fair Lady”, was included.The two later albums were recorded within a month of one another, both with Ed Thigpen on drums. “Porgy and Bess” was recorded in October 1959, and “Swinging Brass” in November. Arrangements for the latter album were produced by Russell Garcia, who also conducted the 11-piece backing orchestra. Oscar Peterson was a stylish pianist, and this quality shines throughout the compilation. He was shrewd in his choice of accompanists, with the result that the trio recordings were more than the sum of their parts. I hadn’t heard “Swinging Brass” before, and was bowled over by the arrangements, which clearly were designed to complement the pianist, rather than render him subservient, as might have been the case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O4MBS3RYQJX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HT88Y04#wasThisHelpful","R2O4MBS3RYQJX2","AI4MUD97FH6G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI4MUD97FH6G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well received by my dogs.  I have one dog who will eat anything edible, and a few items that are not edible.  I have one dog who eats most offerings.  And one dog who will turn up his nose at almost every food option.  I often change up my dogs diet, and have for years.  Most days I cook for my pups and I add the cooked food with a bit of kibble.  When I typically change up their diet I have one base brand I always use and then I mix in the new bits.  I have found adjusting their diet by small changes keeps them rather excited about dinner, I can't imagine eating pizza every day, I can't imagine my dogs enjoy the same dinner every day.  I'll admit, they are somewhat spoiled, but a number of years ago, my oldest dog developed seizures and every since I'm extremely particular on their food.  Since I changed their diet their have been no seizures.So I wanted to see what Nutro had to offer.  I have fed the dogs Nutro before and it went over fairly well.  As long as the first ingredient is meat, I'm willing to try it for my crew.  The kibble looked pretty good and smelled alright.  The dogs were happy to give it a try, and when we rotated to the next bag, they were pretty energetic about the change.  I like that I didn't have to figure out the mix to change their food.  I like that the food all arrives together.  I like the ingredients list, there is nothing to hide.  I like that my dogs enjoy it.  All around I would do this again.  The dogs appreciated the variety, I didn't have to think it through to much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSMYL37KNL2WO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZA2L9XA#wasThisHelpful","RSMYL37KNL2WO","A89ZZKNDFQH23","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A89ZZKNDFQH23?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this brewing cup.  I just do. So here's the scoop.  I happen to have a water cooler in my home that also has a hot water spigot, so for me I do not need to heat water, my water is already very hot.  You get two cups or chambers.  The outer cup is where you put the grounds and the water.  My suggestion, rinse your cup with really hot water before you add your brewing water and coffee, why, your contents will stay hotter longer.  The first brew I did the contents stayed hot for about 3.5 hours and warm only for another 45 after that.  Rinsing with hot water first I got 4.5 hours of hot and another 45 minutes of warm.  Why does it take me so long to drink coffee, it just does, I move around, I don't sit at a desk, I don't always get to it when I want to.  (if you are looking for keeping your coffee hot for up to 8 hours Thermos has an amazing mug that will keep it really hot for 8 to 10 hours, but you can't brew in it.).  So rinse cup and insert with hot water, pour in coarse ground coffee and hot water into outer cup, cover and let it brew for a bit.  Then you take your insert and plunge it down, ala French press and cover your coffee and go about your awesome day.If you are not familiar with a French press, it's the same thing.  Only glass and large enough for several people to have coffee and not at all portable.  The grounds stay beneath the press.I have to say that the metal filter, which I'm sure has a technical name and I can't think of it right now, is extremely fine and very well built.  I have had French Presses in the past or heck even tea balls where I still get grounds or tea in my beverage.  I was expecting some in this cup, but that didn't happen.  The plunger fits very snugly inside the outer cup, as it should, and there is no way the grounds are getting through.I used 4, less than generous tablespoons and about 14 ounces of water in my mug.  The flavor was great.  As for the grounds when you are done, you can compost them, you can put them outside by a plant that needs slightly more acid in the soil, you can pitch them or flush them.  They are easy to dispose of and the mug cleans up really easy and quickly.My only complaint, the mug top is a a rubber top.  The rubber cover that arrived with mine smelled like a strong perfume or air freshner, yeah, that is going to take a while to go away as the rubber top is holding onto that smell with all it's might. So that makes taking a sip a weird experience for me. Hopefully that was just a fluke.  Otherwise I have showed several people my mug and have passed the word around.  I would buy others for my other coffee drinking friends.  It's a great idea, I love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OH7KGTS6EVT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T088TTM#wasThisHelpful","R3OH7KGTS6EVT","A89ZZKNDFQH23","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A89ZZKNDFQH23?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't notice a change within 10 minutes, and I didn't observe my face every few minutes, but about three hours later I didn't notice that my blemish was already improving.  No scent to report on the cream.  You can get a very small controlled amount out of the tube, which is great, it blends into the skin. There was a small amount of skin drying up and flaking next to the blemish, nothing a nightcream couldn't fix.I would still keep this in your beauty arsenal for days when a blemish can wreck the whole day.

"We opted out of aluminum and other metal pans, they are difficult to clean and it's debatable if the cooking is done evenly.  So we have tried glass...still not as easy to clean...porcelain...much easier, and bakes up nice.  The size of the pan is great, it's a 15 x 10 which is perfect for my giant cinnamon rolls and enchiladas.  The cooking is evenly distributed.  The presentation is beautiful.  The clean up is easy.This pan has such a simple charm in appearance.The little recipe booklet had a few really great veggie centered ideas.  I was excited for the ideas.

"I actually just cut off about four inches of hair, because it was so dry and damaged, I am sort of a conditioner junky, I collect them like some ladies collect shoes.  I was not expecting an instant miracle, but this is very honestly the best my hair has felt in months.  Right after I cut all the damaged ends off I expected my hair to feel softer, and it didn't. Apparently my hair was still lacking moisture and prone to frizz, I have fine wavy hair, but the drier it gets, the more it resembles a static electricity experiment.  I tried this conditioner and the first day my hair felt soft and lovely.The conditioner itself is very thick.  A little bit, goes a long way.  The smell is very fresh, not overly perfumey.  And an odd side effect was that even my hands felt softer after I used the conditioner (hands working the conditioner in).  I was pretty pleased.

"I would prefer to buy more natural products when they are a available.  I used to use the deodorant rock, then I got a job that required me to move around a bit more, a deodorant was going to cut it, I needed an antiperspirant.  When given the opportunity to try this I thought it was a great idea.  So it goes on smooth.  That's pretty nice, some natural deodorants are a little rough.  The staying power is good.  No wet armpits after walking dogs, mucking kennels, cleaning house and chasing kids.  My only downside was that the scent, was more medicinal than fresh meadow.  Normally I wouldn't care one way or the other, my underarms are dry, yea!  But my husband was quite turned off by the smell, he said it smelled like I had put eucalyptus and vapor rub on my underarms.I liked how it felt.  I liked how dry I was. The smell was a bummer, since it's my husband I like to snuggle with.

"For using these labels you need to use the Avery website, there is not a downloadable template.  This is not the most awful thing ever as their website is very user friendly.  You just enter your template number and get going. Decide on your tab names before entering them, you can't rearrange once you start, if you need to rearrange you will need to delete and retype.  There are some graphics that you can use, either stock or your own.  This was a fun option, and I spent way too much time looking for the right little graphic only to find that they were really tiny upon printing, so keep your graphic simple and easily recognizeable once shrunk.  I printed a test page first, because old habits die hard, the test peg lined up really well.  Placing the labels was a bit putzy.  To make them look nice your placement really needs to look spot on, and the stick on these labels is incredibly sticky, so if you place them on with all the confidence in the world you might not be able to readjust and get them straight.  I used a heavy tote I have to sit on the folder and use it as a guide on where to stick...but is tuck them lightly at first to leave some wiggle room.I do like the labels, I am pleased with the outcome.  The dividers are heavy duty with reinforced holes.  I didn't like that this was not compatible with my tablet. Not that big a deal, I have a regular computer as well.

"Reviewed by HeatherProduct provided by the manufacturerOriginally posted at Romancing the BookI have had an entire tote full of baby blankets and pillows sitting in my closet for several months. I am so happy that I decided to review the Space Saver Bag Vacuum Compression Seal Bags because they were perfect for what I needed to store away.Obviously I want to keep these blankets and pillows safe because they are my children’s baby items. It never occurred to me to use vacuum seal bags until I received the offer to review the Space Saver Bag Vacuum Compression Seal Bags. I was very skeptical about them. I literally had 12 blankets, a sleeping bag, and 3 pillows I needed to fit into these bags. When I received the bags I was a little disappointed that they didn’t come with instructions. However, they are extremely easy to use. My package came with 3 bags, 3 plugs, and two removable zipper-type sealers to seal the bags before vacuuming out the air. I was able to fit everything I mentioned into only two of the bags, with the exception of the sleeping bag. With one bag left, I was able to fit the sleeping bag and several articles of clothing and seal it with no issues. These bags are huge!I really wish I would have tried the Space Saver Bag Vacuum Compression Seal Bags sooner because they are perfect for putting up seasonal clothing and extra blankets. I am very pleased with the quality of these bags as well. I expected them to be flimsy and tear easily. After vacuuming out the air, my children, ages 7 and 3, jumped all over them and they never tore. As for the anti-leak, I put one of the bags into our garden tub and started filling it. After letting the water drain, I opened the bag and everything was completely dry.I am extremely pleased with the Space Saver Bag Vacuum Compression Seal Bags. I would highly recommend them to anyone. I’ve already told my parents and best friend about them and they are both interested. This is a great product at a decent price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYMYPUFOHE2QP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013ULPCVM#wasThisHelpful","RYMYPUFOHE2QP","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by JenProduct provided by the manufacturerOriginally posted at Romancing the Book I tend to be a bit of a neat freak.  It’s not compulsive, but I do like having things in their place, especially when it comes to my desk.  There’s nothing worse than trying to find something and having to dig through a cluttered drawer.  So, when I was asked to review a desk organizer, how could I say no.20151111_163827The 9 in 1 Multi-functional Mesh Desk Organizer arrived pretty well packaged.  I appreciated that the drawer was twist-tied closed to avoid damage during shipping.  It was easy to get ready for use.The organizer has a drawer, 4 pen holders, 3 smaller trays and then one longer tray.  I decided to take the organizer into my day job since I don’t really have a desk at home.  I was able to get all my pens, highlighters and dry erase markers to fit in the pen holders.  I used the drawer to store a few pieces of candy and then the trays held my ear buds, a USB cord and some other odds and ends.  And there’s still room for more.I like the look of the black mesh.  The mesh allows you to clearly see everything in the organizer, while still looking stylish and clean.  It’s also relatively sturdy.  Unless you’re standing on it, you shouldn’t have any problems with it bending or warping.I like the idea that this organizer can be used in other rooms of the house.  Imagine it in the bathroom with toothbrushes and floss or makeup brushes and eyeliners.  Or how about in the garage to hold loose nails, screws and other tools?  If you’d like a versatile organizer, look no further.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30V4QYB6NCBDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013Q7DJJW#wasThisHelpful","R30V4QYB6NCBDD","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He has the world at his fingertips. He can have whoever he wants, and when he stops a beautiful woman names Lyra. He wants her. Andros thinks woman are only good for one thing and that was sex. Despite Andros’s warped view of women, he has trouble-letting Lyra go. He worries about her in ways he never expected.Lyra Matthews does not see why she needs a man other than one to scratch an itch. She is known as a man eater. She is a beautiful woman on a mission, one she is not telling Andros. She is also very strong, and focused. Nothing with disturb her mission. I loved how forward Lyra is. She is willing to put everything on the line and tell it like it is.Lyra and Andros are perfect for each other. The chemistry between them is blistering. Each of them is so strong and unwilling to give an inch unless they had too. Life between them will always be interesting.I loved this story a lot.

"Reviewed by Amy W.Book provided by the publisher for reviewReview originally posted at Romancing the BookAuthor Karyn Gerrard brings back the characters of her short story, The Riding Crop, giving readers another look into the budding relationship between Olivia Durham and Lord Gideon Broyles.To get the most out of the book, do not treat it as a standalone read. The first installment is a free quickie read on the publisher’s website. I am very glad that I did this before starting the book because there is a lot of important background found in the short story that will enhance the reading experience.A Riding Crop for Two returns the reader to Regency times where two people skilled in aspects of physical pleasure get a crash course in the emotional side of pleasure. Both characters are strong-willed as individuals; together they provide a dynamic connection.There’s also a sense of drama that threatens their relationship. Given that both Olivia and Gideon have trust issues, these barriers are serious. The heat factor is high, with plenty of creative BDSM bedroom play. That is also where the object mentioned in the title comes into play.Can a jaded rake find love with a woman who inflicts pain as a career?

"Reviewed by JoAnneBook provided by the publisher for reviewReview originally posted at Romancing the BookThis was a quick read at just over one hundred pages.  It was a fast paced novella with a lighthearted playfulness to it even though it is a romantic suspense with a crime and two murders.  Serenity, the owner of Mac’s Diner, walked in on a crime scene at her business and then was assaulted herself.  Enter detectives Jason and Noah and things heat up.  Jason and Serenity have instant chemistry and he knows who she is because he eats lunch at Mac’s every Wednesday with his twin sister Violet – who happens to be dating his partner and best friend, Noah.  Watching Jason try to be all business as he protects Serenity at the safe house since she’s the only witness to the crime doesn’t go as planned.  As things heat up in the kitchen and the bedroom I could only root for more.There are family, friends, a bad guy, lots of food, romance and love.  There was also an overlooked detail that caused an almost near fatal error.  There was an anticipated happily ever after with some closure but since there are two more books to the series I can only hope we’ll meet up with all of them again.Kincaid is a new to me author but her books will be added to my always growing TBR pile.  I need to go back and read book one in the series, Love on the Line as well as books three and four, Outside the Lines and Pushing the Line, respectively.  I also will read her full length novels.  At the end of the book there was a recipe for Serenity’s Apple Turnovers that sound yummy so I may just have to give them a try.Favorite Quote:  “It’s all about action and reaction, Ms. Gallagher,” he said, his breath hot as it curved into her ear.  “So what are you going to do?”","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R343KTHKB3KH1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014MVVZOM#wasThisHelpful","R343KTHKB3KH1G","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by JulieBook provided by the author for reviewReview originally posted at Romancing the BookI enjoyed this romantic suspense novel mostly because it was unique. Rissa is a person in a really tight position due to her parents and the kind work she has chosen. Jerah is a detective that was touched by Rissa many years ago, but has believed her to be dead up until now. The woman he knew in the past is certainly not the woman standing before him now. But, he still loves her, and Rissa loves him, but the problem Rissa has with Jerah and pursuing the relationship is one that is nearly impossible to overcome.The story has a few threads going at once as Rissa was assigned the undercover job and has been partnered with a married man who is really dedicated to his family. This makes things a little awkward as Rissa, who is now going by the name “Cindy” will have to make it look like they are having an affair. Rissa gets sucked into Jerah’s mess too. These are dangerous people , members of drug cartels,with hidden agendas and “Cindy” will have to look like a hard partying woman that likes money and sex .As each day passes the tension in the case rises as does the heat between Jerah and Rissa. But, Rissa can’t forget the past and simply can not have a future.. with Jerah or anyone else.One small complaint is that the use of Rissa’s real name and the use of her undercover name got tossed back and forth which made it confusing at times. I thought it was sort of strange that Jerah had known Rissa eight years ago and quickly began using her new name, but then he, or the 3rd person, couldn’t decide which name to use consistently. I guess maybe Jerah used the name “Cindy” so they could stay convincing in the undercover roles they had to play. That makes sense I guess. It was just a little hard to decide which name to latch onto. I finally just went with Rissa.The plot is riveting. By the half way mark I knew I would be up late to finish this one. My goodness! I didn’t know who trust and there are some really wild and crazy times for both Rissa and Jerah. At first the relationship between Rissa and Jerah is in the forefront while the crime is being laid out. There is a lot of baggage and a lot of misunderstandings that will have to be ironed out, but the romance was really great with one very memorable scene most ladies will relate too.I wasn’t sure how things would turn out and this is certainly wasn’t the traditional type of HEA. But, it fits and it worked and even though there was a really high price to pay, Rissa and Jerah are finally free.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBVPUDTNHBIL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KF1FSEW#wasThisHelpful","RBVPUDTNHBIL1","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Amy W.Book purchased by the reviewer for pleasureReview originally posted at Romancing the BookWhen Emily Jacobs decides to start a new life, she knows that her past won’t be far behind. Yet with a solid dose of newly-found self confidence, she moves on. In the first installment of Rachel Carrington’s Discovering Emily series, the focus is on building relationships. With Connecting Strangers, Emily gathers a support network as she fights to keep her past from becoming her future.As a story with roots in an unhealthy relationship, there is plenty of angst. Emily’s emotions, particularly the feeling of helplessness, are well portrayed without being too dramatic. Since every little girl dreams of a knight in shining armor, the fact that she catches the key of a handsome man with a badge only underscores the importance of good being able to triumph over evil.It is part of a series, which means it comes with a bit of a cliffhanger. It’s nothing too dramatic, but it’s enough to serve as an enticement for the next book. Add in the secondary characters, and there is more room for development.Although the storyline has romantic elements, the author has provided a solid sense of suspense leading up to the end of the story. While ending a story with more questions than answers isn’t my choice, the author delivers the surprise plot twist very effectively.Anyone familiar with small town life knows how powerful a family name can be. In Connecting Strangers, the characters may not share a name, but they demonstrate the power of friendship. Those friendships, coupled with the powerful chemistry between Emily and Adam, provide the basis for this interesting series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NR6XWIVHZPH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZEQKHC#wasThisHelpful","R2NR6XWIVHZPH9","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Reviewed by Amy W.Book provided by the publisher for reviewReview originally posted at Romancing the BookOne of the characteristics I have come to associate with author Lily Harlem is versatility. Whether penning solo or in collaboration with author Natalie Dae, this author consistently delivers a panty-melting erotic experience.Rule Breaker is no exception.As a prison nurse, Lacey finds herself drawn to Miller, one of the inmates. He’s about to be released after paying for his crime, which means there’s a chance for her dreams to become a reality. She’s spent her life living by the rules; taking a chance with Miller would be completely unlike her.Packed with plenty of kink, Harlem delivers a raunchy read that is pure naughtiness. Her erotic scenes are well developed without any sense of following a set pattern. The unexpected becomes the expected at the hands of this author. The storyline provides a completely new twist on the “traditional” good girl/bad boy relationship. What happens when the good girl decides to be a little bit bad and the bad boy encourages it? Throw in a secondary storyline featuring Lacey and Shay, her cousin by marriage, to complicate matters.Although there were some challenging aspects of reading a story featuring UK English as opposed to the American version, I chalked it up as a cultural experience. It did take a bit for me to get used to Miller referring to Lacey as “hen.” Because of the setting in England and then in France, there is very much of an international flavor to the story that is rich in detail.Never could I have predicted the ending. The author did a phenomenal job of laying the groundwork to lead readers in a completely different direction. The end result is one that is truly representative of Harlem’s skills as a writer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAE58G1LJBCST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016DUDNJU#wasThisHelpful","RAE58G1LJBCST","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Nadene R.Book provided by NetGalley for reviewReview originally posted at Romancing the BookI was first introduced to Amanda Westwood and Jake Donovan in Against the Ropes. I was not impressed with Amanda at that stage and as such when it came time for me to read her story I must admit I began this story with a preconceived notion. Initially I thought Amanda was selfish and superficial, even so, as the story moved on my initial assessment changed. It became obvious why Amanda behaved the way she did.Amanda had an independent streak that is a mile long. She had abandonment and trust issues which led her to seek love in all the wrong places. She has a phobia when it came to commitment which led to her breaking up with Jake two years ago.Due to unforeseen circumstances, Jake came back into her life and it’s quite obvious that their feelings for each other had not changed. Jake was determined to keep Amanda in his life, no matter what it takes. The only obstacle was Amanda herself.What fascinated me about Amanda is that she is a woman who did not depend on anyone to fight her battles. She knew what she wanted and was not afraid to go after it. She was not the type to back down from a conflict and she is not easily intimidated. She had a kind heart and was always willing to give a helping hand. However, because she was someone who feels she always has to in control of every situation in her life she became an emotional cripple. This contributed to her pushing away people who cared about her.Jake on the other hand is the complete opposite. He too had experienced pain in his past, but he did not allow it to determine how he lived his life. He was willing to give Amanda a second chance, hoping that she would eventually come to trust him.The interaction between these two was conflicting at times. One minute they were hot for each other and the next moment they were cold and distant. It was good to finally see them getting their act together. The love scenes were scorching hot and sweet. These two literally burnt up the pages.I loved he secondary characters. They added to the entertainment value of the story. I found their antics to be amusing and entertaining.In Your Corner is filled with enough drama, romance and totally hot sex to keep readers entertained. It’s a story of love, healing and forgiveness. This is a story that depicts how the power of love can heal the pain of the past. The story touched on several real life issues such as domestic violence and sexual harassment in the workplace.This is a very compelling read that will pull you in and have you rooting for Jake and Amanda in their quest for their happily ever after.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROHW0DLPKANNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I80E5TQ#wasThisHelpful","ROHW0DLPKANNR","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The 1NightStand series is a series that is written by several authors about a mysterious woman who sets up one night stands that ends with the couple having a happily ever after. I chose this book because I have enjoyed each book in the 1NightStand series and enjoy reading Ms. Masters’ books.Zoe Golden is a yoga instructor. She made a life change from a new anchor to a yoga instructor. While she does not make a lot on money, she saved her money up to be matched by Madame Eve.  Ty Hardin the successful owner of a chain of fitness studios. Ty is very bitter about his past from high school. He is very upset at Zoe and how she treated him in high school. To the point he is looking for revenge. He comes across as a bitter obsessed man.The chemistry between Ty and Zoe is blistering however his need for revenge seems to taint everything around him. I enjoyed reading this book a lot. I found it well written with appealing and engaging characters. At 45 pages long, this book as a well-defined beginning, middle, and end. This book is a fabulous quick read. I will be on the lookout for the next book in the 1NightStand series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NI088V84O861/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FFDVOMU#wasThisHelpful","R2NI088V84O861","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by CrystalBook provided by the publisher for reviewReview originally posted at Romancing the BookHeather has been invited to a BBQ. It is mainly only shifters but Heather was raised with a family of leopards and feels more comfortable with them then she does her parents. She wasn’t looking for a man and didn’t want one after what happened to her in college. She was enjoying herself when her friend Dana brings in her date Ben.Ben is just wanting a little fun with Dana and goes to the BBQ with her. He never expected to find his mate when he walked in. He is told that Heather will think that she is trying to take over Dana’s man. He knows he has to have her and there are no options of him leaving her alone. No one knew that his tiger would be so obsessive. When she tries to get away from Ben his tiger see’s red. What happens is really bad and she never wants to see Ben again.At first you wonder if you will like Ben. He wants sex and that is all. He says that a shifter knows what they are doing and it’s just about sex. He changes his mind when he scents Heather. I knew that Ben would be into a hard time getting Heather to trust him when he does what he does to her. As the story went you see each character change for the better. There’s so much of a connection with them and just because she’s a human doesn’t mean anything.By the time I got to the end of the book I was really into the story. I hated to know that I was almost done. I do know that there is another book after this one and after reading the end of this book I really want the other book. I have read several books by this author and when you open the books and start to read you are in for a real treat. Every book is different and you know there will be an alpha that will want to control the female. Good thing that the females can take them and can take care of themselves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R124B76HA2HK3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G2UQE66#wasThisHelpful","R124B76HA2HK3B","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Amy W.Book provided by the publisher for reviewReview originally posted at Romancing the BookIf you are expecting this to be a typical story of a poor girl who gets swept away by a handsome rich man, be prepared to be completely overwhelmed. 30 Days of Syn is a true diamond in the rough featuring complex characters who experience the gamut of human emotion.Just when I thought it was safe to predict what would happen next, author Charlotte Boyett-Compo provided yet another twist and turn to the storyline. The incorporation of New Zealand slang added an interesting element that gave me a real taste of the characters.If there were a contest for broken characters, Synjyn McGregor would be among the nominees. He is a dynamic character who makes me want to smack him one minute and then hug him tightly the next. I was pleased to see that Melina retained a feisty attitude throughout the story without turning into a doormat. The cast of supporting characters is also well developed.From an emotional standpoint, this is a story that fully engages all senses for the reader. There is plenty of laughter and tears to go around. By the time I finished the book, I felt a strong connection to these characters. The heat level is carried out throughout each encounter, moving the intensity meter well beyond the spicy mark.Whether it is the smooth writing style or the way the author chose to spin the storyline, this is one of those unforgettable stories that will have a lasting place on my keeper shelf.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31BGPE5E1DAGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H80MISC#wasThisHelpful","R31BGPE5E1DAGC","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Amy W.Book provided by Edelweiss for reviewReview originally posted at Romancing the BookIn her gripping new release, author Wendy Corsi Staub delivers yet another thriller that will make readers think twice about the faceless people they deal with online. The Perfect Stranger follows a group of breast cancer bloggers, including sections from their blogs at the beginning of each chapter.On one hand, it is a testimony to those who battle cancer. On the other, it is an eye-opening tale of what can happen when you share too much information with the wrong person. It is a storyline full of a see-saw of emotions. Just when you think you have everything figured out, a new twist or turn is introduced. It’s a disturbing story when you consider that it is completely possible that it could actually happen in real life.The story focuses on five main characters, richly detailing their lives. From the start to the finish, this is one storyline that grabs the reader and maintains your attention. Fortunately, the author wraps up all the loose ends in a very unexpected conclusion. If I had to point out anything that distracted from the story, it would be the fact that the switching of characters is abrupt. In spite of this, I found the book to be exceptionally well written and engaging.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5BOTXT0PW5QC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GFZW3WM#wasThisHelpful","R5BOTXT0PW5QC","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by EffyBook provided by the author for reviewReview originally posted at Romancing the BookWind and Shadow by Tori L. Ridgewood was a book that took me pleasantly by surprise. I was a bit hesitant going in, but I’m really glad I took the chance. This is such a wonderfully well-rounded book; I really don’t know how the author managed to pull it all off. No one area really suffered, or lacked. The entire cast of characters are fully fleshed, obviously some more than others, but even the characters you only see once or twice are described wonderfully.Rayvin escaped her hometown years ago, following a super-secret Big Bad Thing that happened. The entire town shunned her, and she decided to hightail it out of there. It was pretty annoying at how long it took for that to be revealed. You knew Rayvin was strong, so you could only guess that it was something really bad, but then you start wondering if maybe she just wasn’t strong enough to handle it. You know she’s a witch, so is it something she couldn’t solve with magic, or is it a moral thing? So many questions.Our heroine Rayvin was kick ass. She was amazing, strong in a way that most other heroines pretend to be, and innocent and vulnerable in ways most other heroines pretend to be, as well. We got more pieces and clues into her character as the story went on. Maybe I’m impatient, but it sort of pissed me off at how slow in coming the “big reveal” was, the reason why she left home so many years ago.As soon as she returns home, the crap hits the fan. Technically I’m not even sure if she technically made it in to her home town, she was on the outskirts of it. This goes to show you just how bad things get. But it was a delicious journey. Then you’re introduced to our hero, Grant. He’s pretty amazing, all male, all strong and brooding, yet seriously sensitive and understanding. Although it takes a bit for that to come to light. The more you get to know him, the more you like him. But at the same time, once you know him you start getting pissed off by some of his more annoying attributes. But again, that’s another one of those crazily appealing things about this book, these people have zero of those normal book character qualities. They’re actually real. Well, except for the magic.The way the author handled the magic, the witchiness, the vampires, (yes, I said vampires,) was just astounding. None of the trite things I’ve come to expect from novels containing vampires. And as the book progresses, it just becomes more involved, more powers are developed and shown, more people are turned. The villain in this piece was seriously despicable. He was just gross, creepy, delusional and plain evil. He really had some plans. You’re always kept guessing, and you’re rooting; you’re annoyed and excited, happy and sad. The prose and descriptive properties in this novel were amazing. The cliffhanger was just… wow. NOT what I was expecting at all. At the end of it, you’re dying to find out more. As soon as I read the last word, I opened up my internet tab and checked to see if the sequel was already available. It was. I’d recommend this to anyone that likes paranormal romance, and likes real characters, magic, betrayals, cheering and crying, and seriously hating the bad guy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG9ECM3OWU0H5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DYCH64Y#wasThisHelpful","RG9ECM3OWU0H5","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by CrystalBook provided by the publisher for reviewReview originally posted at Romancing the BookI really wanted to read this book because I loved the title and the blurb.Terri meet Beorn last year at the Renaissance Faire where she works every year. He always said he would be back but he never comes. She remembers him but she puts him to the back of her mind. Everything changes when his house hob Brokk comes and tells her that Beorn wants to see her. She goes with him and he all of a sudden brings out a glowing wand and she notices that the forest changes but doesn’t say anything. When she see’s Beorn again she knows something is different because he keeps saying that he wants to make her happy. She wants to to leave and he tells her that she can after she stays the weekend.The book started and I liked it but as I read a little more it started to lose my attention. I wanted more out of the book then I was getting and that feeling that you get when you are reading a great book, well I wasn’t getting that feeling. I love shifter books and were bears has really started growing on me. Terri never really got why she couldn’t leave the forest and always ended back at Beorn’s house until the ending of the book. I understand keeping secrets about who you are but to keep it away until the end wasn’t what I would do.Now this is just my thoughts and view. It doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t read it. There were some things in the book that I liked but there were some things I didn’t like. I have read several books by this author and this is the only one that I didn’t like all that much. Now the book did have a great ending. So if this looks like a book you would like to read then give it a try.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7ID38ZQQWECT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1NXKX6#wasThisHelpful","R7ID38ZQQWECT","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by HeatherProduct provided by the manufacturer for reviewReview originally posted at Romancing the BookI am very surprised at the quality and durability of the DBPower Portable Bluetooth Speaker. This speaker is absolutely amazing for the price.First of all, the packaging was amazing. I felt like I had received a top of the line product when I opened the package to find a very nice white box. Everything was very well placed as to not cause any damage during shipping. It came with almost everything I needed, minus the wall plug for the charger. It had the charging cable but not the plug itself. I was a little disappointed by this.The main reason I wanted to review this product is because I love to listen to music throughout the day and I always use my smartphone to do this. The DBPower Portable Bluetooth Speaker was perfect for this. I can listen to music that is stored in my phone, Pandora, and even music from a USB drive. I carry it from room to room as I’m cleaning or working on projects. I love it because I can control the volume and change songs from my phone or the speaker. I also use it when I am bike riding. I keep it in my child’s bike trailer that is pulled behind my bike and the sound is perfect.We live in the country and do not pick up many radio stations on the radio that we bought for our son recently. I was very pleased to find that this product could pick up many more stations than his radio, even when they are sitting side by side.It has fell our hard kitchen floor many times. I also have two very energetic children that like to run around the house with it. I’ve had the speaker for a few weeks now and I am happy to report that it is still in perfect condition despite the abuse it has seen. I have only charged the speaker one time, the day I received it. I use it at least 3-4 times a week for about an hour or so at a time. The battery life is very impressive.I honestly feel like this is a really great product for the price despite the missing wall plug. We had plenty of them laying around the house so it wasn’t a big deal to us. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the marker for a portable bluetooth speaker. I am very happy with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R300IEQ2X0GIRU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WFQ1W7C#wasThisHelpful","R300IEQ2X0GIRU","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by JenProduct provided by the manufacturer for reviewReview originally posted at Romancing the BookMy kitchen has multiple cutting boards.  I have the old school big plastic cutting board.  I have a couple of those smaller flexible plastic ones.  But I’ve always wanted a wood board.  I was excited when I saw this set of three bamboo boards as I could really use the different size boards.The boards were well wrapped and included a set of care instructions.  There weren’t any defects in the boards and so after a quick wash, I put them to work.  I set out making dinner and chopping up chicken and potatoes and all that I needed for my meal.  I put them through the paces and they came through with flying colors.  Outside of a little sliding around on my counter top (and that’s quite normal with that horrid Formica top), I was quite pleased with the cutting boards.After my meal, cleaning the boards was quite easy.  I was excited to see that bamboo is more germ and bacteria resistant and even Googled that to ensure the manufacturer’s claims.  Who wouldn’t like a product that would help in cleanliness and food safety?All in all, I was happy with these boards and can totally see myself getting an even larger one (the largest of the three was a little bigger than a sheet of paper) when I have more room in my kitchen.

"Reviewed by Crystal NBook provided by the publisherOriginally posted at Romancing the BookThis book has a great spin. Werewolves are not allowed to take a mate until they are 21. There is just something about that number and it seems to work out for everyone.Well that is a whole new thing when you talk about Elle. She has tried her best to stay out of the alpha’s way and do her job. She thinks about moving to the city and get away from everything if only her friend would come with her. She even skipped the 21 birthday party that the pack has for everyone. She was just at work one day when she is jerked out of the kitchen to go and see the Alpha. Imagine her surprise when he moves so fast, says that she is his and bites her.Brandon doesn’t think he will ever see his mate and have the love that other couples in the pack has. He has a woman that wants to marry him but he only wants her for one thing and she doesn’t make his life easy. Brandon can’t believe that when he is just in the same restaurant that he suddenly scents his mate and it turns out to be Elle. Seems he had felt something when she was 16, when she first came to town.I love and enjoy every book that this author writes. I will have to say that she is one of my favorite authors. When she writes there is just some magic that she puts in her writing that makes me want to read everything by her and then start all over. This story just seemed so real to me and I didn’t want it to end. I can’t wait to read the rest of the series.If you love books about Alpha males that thinks they know how to handle everything and then find out that they are wrong and admit it then this is the book for you. The love between these two was slow but it needed to be. Neither really knew their true feelings or what the other thought. I will say that there are some vampires and witches in this story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LETZHCU2ZUCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DMNQ66E#wasThisHelpful","R1LETZHCU2ZUCA","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by JulieBook provided by the publisherOriginally posted at Romancing the BookThis book is an absolute classic! Native American interracial/ cultural historical romance that dares touch upon openly voiced and acted upon bigotry and prejudice. Before the days of political correctness, historical romance novelist dared to cross the lines and face up to the facts as they were in this period of time. The message is the same then as it is now. When you open your mind and your heart you can look past the color of someone’s skin and see the person inside, and isn’t that all that really matters?For Caitlyn it is hard to forgive “Indians” because they were responsible for the death of her brothers.  However, she is not about to allow a man to be hanged for a crime he didn’t commit just because of his heritage.Stalking Wolf has had to leave the Cherokee tribe he was raised in because of the machinations of a woman. Because he is part Irish, he deals with the moniker of being a “half-breed”. He vows never to trust a woman again. But, then he finds himself being held for a crime he didn’t commit and is healing on the ranch where Caitlyn and her father live. Almost from the the time Caitlyn lays eyes on Stalking Wolf she is physically attracted to him, but she continually reminds herself that he is an Indian and she hates all Indians.Caitlyn will learn the most valuable of lessons in learning not to judge all people by their looks or heritage. Stalking Wolf was an easy character to like and I could imagine how gorgeous he was. Caitlyn’s character was a little bit more complicated. Naturally, she worried about the reactions of others and what people would think of her. I think that was just a human flaw and even today people can be that way. It takes her awhile to come around, but she eventually matures and lets herself falls in love with Stalking Wolf.  I thought the author did a good job of showing the real fears many would have if they found themselves attracted to and falling in love with someone who is considered her enemy.This was western/ Indian Historical Romance at it’s peak and I for one wish we could see these books come back in style. These books have really stood the test of time and since Ellora’s Cave has re-released these in digital format I hope they will find a new audience.Madeline Baker has written a slew of Native American Historical Romances and for a time it was like a niche for her. I think she is in her best element when writing these historical novels. Many of you may know her as a very popular paranormal romance novelist who writes under a different name and also made a niche for herself in that genre as well. So, you know this is a good writer.Try these titles out through online bookstores – especially if you like western romances. These stories are just as good now as they were then and I think you will enjoy them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FLMWJ89Q4QNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CFNSE80#wasThisHelpful","R1FLMWJ89Q4QNB","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Amy WBook provided by NetGalleyOriginally posted at Romancing the BookWhen you put a career woman determined to fulfill the needs of her biological clock in the same orbit with a man renowned for taking risks and committed to an adventurous lifestyle, there’s bound to be an explosion.All Samantha Evans can focus on is finding the perfect man to father her child. She hasn’t worked out all the details about how she will handle the challenges of motherhood, but as a career woman, she is certain that satisfying her “cheeping” eggs is the right thing to do.Nick Hawke knows better than to get involved with a woman seeking a permanent commitment. He tries his best to help Sam in her search, setting her up with guys based on her listed requirements. He soon finds himself realizing that matchmaking can be risky business.Author Amy Andrews delivers a quirky romance packed with a solid story line and enough one-liners to keep the laughter rolling in Risky Business. The supporting characters, including Sam’s sister and the bookstore customers, add to the overall flavor.You will find yourself cheering for Sam as she navigates through the challenges of walking away from her job, dealing with some downright painful blind dates and then finally coming to the realization that maybe there are some things in life that simply can’t be scripted.These two characters mesh well together, providing plenty of chemistry and some pretty crazy conversations. The off-the-wall dialog adds to the storyline’s impact, creating a sense that the reader has a seat in the bookstore while everything is happening. It’s a fun story that not only captured my interest, but reaffirmed my belief in happy endings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U2NWL09XPMJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQ64YJG#wasThisHelpful","R1U2NWL09XPMJX","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Jack O’Dell unwittingly slips into the role of Nelly O’Malley’s boyfriend during a family visit. As they get to know each other, the sparks continue to fly.In this quick read, there is a ribbon of suspense woven into the story line. An investigation into Nelly’s accident reveals that it was no accident, which forces her to consider Jack as a possible suspect. The only question is whether their budding relationship can withstand the pressure caused by the uncertainty.The characters are well developed, especially Jack. He has had his share of heartache in the past, which drew me to him. By the end of the story, the author had me rooting for the couple, hoping they would have a shot at a happily-ever-after.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10W635SEO26GM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C2BWQIE#wasThisHelpful","R10W635SEO26GM","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Melissa DBook provided by the publisherOriginally posted at Romancing the BookThe Outlaw Stakes His Claim is the fifth book in The Grizzly MC series by Jenika Snow. This book is part of a series but it can be read and enjoyed as a standalone novel. I love reading Ms. Snow’s book and have not found one that I don’t like.Hope Richards has made it through school and has managed to get a job in her chosen field. This has caused her to move to a new town to start her life. On her first night, she meets a man who should scare her, but only seems to fascinate her. Hope has self-image issues but it seems to come toward the end of the story like that author put it in as more of an afterthought.Dallas is a member of The Grizzly motorcycle club. He lost his wife and son in a car accident and is having a hard time moving forward. When he meets Hope, he is attracted to her in a way he does not expect and fights with himself on pursuing her.The sex scenes between Dallas and Hope are scorching. The chemistry between Hope and Dallas is intense. They make a great pair if they can move past the stereotyping they both do to each other.While I enjoyed this book a lot, I wished this book was a bit longer and more detailed. This book seems to gloss over some details (like Dallas’s fighting). The main characters and the secondary characters are appealing and very lifelike. Overall, this was a good book. I have read several book in this series and each book is better than the last.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCKEOWH8BPFAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHUQLSI#wasThisHelpful","RCKEOWH8BPFAU","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Amy WBook provided by the publisherOriginally posted at Romancing the BookThis is one of those rare books highlighting a Domme in a relationship as opposed to the male taking charge.In Collar Me in Paris, author Sidney Bristol writes about the adventures of a married couple who get caught up in a family challenge to find envelopes hidden throughout the city.With the Parisian landscape as a backdrop, the couple battles against family members to see which couple will come out on top. Meanwhile, Bianca and Clay, who have an established relationship where Bianca is the Dominant, find themselves exploring the boundaries of their relationship.The author has put quite a bit of effort into bringing Paris and its beloved landmarks to life. Unfortunately, the Domme story line didn’t quite work for me, especially since there were numerous times throughout the book where Clay had to take the lead outside the bedroom.There is a strong emphasis on pain and its connection to pleasure, as well as some less publicized aspects of the BDSM lifestyle. The heat level is high with plenty of kink.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIRS8ADOBLYPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S96RG72#wasThisHelpful","RIRS8ADOBLYPS","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by LoriBook provided by the publisherReview originally posted at Romancing the BookThis was a fun read, it really was. What I mean when I say this is that the characters really entertained me, kept me on my toes, and I had a couple of good laughs while reading this.I know I usually talk about the main protagonists first but I think I’ll save them for last as they are just delicious.First, I want to talk about Carey’s best friends. They form a band that plays at different venues and have known each other forever. These group of shifters are loyal to Carey and depend on him to help direct them in their day to day lives. He’s their alpha. These dudes tease Carey mercilessly about Broden and it’s just too funny. They want Carey to be happy and love him like a brother. Each of these guys have their own back story and I wonder if more books will be written. I hope so. I want to know more.We also get a glimpse into Carey’s family life and get to meet his father. This guy is military and is all about protecting the things and people he loves and has instilled these morals into his son. Even though his presence is very brief in this book, he really made an impression on me and I feel that he provides a glimpse into Carey and how his personality works.Now I’ll get to the protagonists. Carey was an unusual character. He was a human alpha in a group of shifters. I loved that idea. I never read about that before and it made me happy to see. Most alpha males are some kind of shifter and here we see a human being in charge of a bunch of shifters.  He was unassuming in his nature and the way he carried himself. He wasn’t massive in strength and size. He wasn’t the kind to throw his weight around and talk about how great and fabulous we was. He didn’t need to do that. All one has to do is look at him, at the kindness that he shows other people, the love and kindness he shows his friends in his pack, the work that he does for his job, to see that he’s so much more then meets the eye. He’s been trained as if he’s been in the military and knows all about defending himself. He’s also sexy as sin so that doesn’t hurt either.Broden was such a great character to read about. He was a cat shifter and an alpha to boot and he has some very definite opinions about humans and their fragility and not being able to defend themselves against shifters. He lacks tact, he’s arrogant, and he’s clueless. He’s also an honorable man, he’s loving, and he’s generous. He’s trying to overcome what he thinks he knows about humans but he’s not quick enough. He has unusual strength and stamina and is used to people obeying his every command. He has a lot to work through and deal with. I really liked this guy despite his shortcomings. How could I not? Carey likes him too and that’s good enough for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYQHUJHDA7FXK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AL3IOLI#wasThisHelpful","RYQHUJHDA7FXK","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by MarissaBook provided by NetGalley for reviewReview originally posted at Romancing the BookThis is a nice departure from the TAG books, taking us readers out of college and back into the small rural Pacific Northwest town. Tenino has a way of infusing her characters with that certain something, that it that makes them jump off the page and straight into my heart.I loved that Lucas got lost in his own world quite often. As that’s something I tend to do, I can see that it’s not self-centered (as most people might tend to think) – it’s that his thought process takes precedent over anything else going on at the moment. Given that he’s artistic, he gets away with it. (I’m not so I don’t.)Gabe is a sort of shy, quiet type, but not really. He’s more of a thinker than the loud, gregarious type although he is friendly and personable. He works hard at making his lumber farm a success and is a talented horse trainer.The one thing I wasn’t sure I liked was that both Lucas and Gabe had crushes on each other going back to high school and hadn’t stopped thinking about each other since. I supposed it could happen but how likely is it? On the other hand, it is kind of sweet, two people pining over each other for so long.While this is the seventh Bluewater Bay book of the series, each is a stand-alone novel written by a different author. This is the first I’ve read and I’m hooked. I want to go back and see what other charming couples are out there – and I’m hoping Seth gets his happy ending.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6822RON9I7Q3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W0C1P1E#wasThisHelpful","R6822RON9I7Q3","A26J2TRDPZH7RZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26J2TRDPZH7RZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"'Going Home', Book 1 of the 'Where We Left Off' series is a great quick read! It's really fast-paced and the characters are really well developed so we quickly get to know them so that we can find joy in their happiness and stress at their trials.Khloe is real, she's lovable and she's fun. I love how relatable she is. She's been through some stuff - more than most - and she's ready to kind of put it behind her and move on. As we watch her pick up the pieces and put a life together, Paul steps in... a hottie who's got a special place in her heart.They've both got great family dynamics and I'm absolutely in love with the small-town in which this is set. It seems predictable off the bat but then there are some little twists. The book does end on  - not exactly a cliffhanger  but it completely left me needing more and I eagerly await the release of Book 2!A really fun way to spend a couple hours. I still miss these characters and cannot wait for more.Nice touch, making this avail in the KOLL - a great way to use my monthly library / Prime loan!

"These are - overall, I'd say ""okay"" - hence the rating of 3 stars for ""it's okay"".It took 2 pairs of these to get them all tried out.The first pair absolutely would not pair at all, with any devices. I tried it with 2 iPhones, 3 iPads, a Kindle Fire HD, 2 Macbooks and an Android tablet.I contacted the seller and they overnighted a replacement to me - it was nice to see them back up their product.The second pair, charged up just like the first - within an hour.They paired right away with my iPhone 6.. I tried some of the other previously mentioned devices and they paired with them all.Obviously the first pair was just defective.What I like about these:*The flat cord that doesn't tangle easily.*The magnets!*Came with replacement tips and elastics.What I dislike:They are a little bit bigger than necessary & if I'm gonna wear earbuds, I want them tiny.I could take or leave the Bluetooth feature, depending on what I'm using them for.Most importantly:The sound!The sound isn't spectacular.It isn't terrible.It's just okay.*I received these earbuds for free in exchange for my honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RITLRY1HTVICB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014XM6HXE#wasThisHelpful","RITLRY1HTVICB","A3OQ47ZE3GEI0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OQ47ZE3GEI0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been through a lot of kitchen timers in the last few years and this is my favorite - I think this might be 'the one'.Here's how it works:It's really simple, with just 3 buttons like many timers. M for minutes, S for seconds and your ST/SP for start / stop.Just hit the minute button repeatedly until it lands where you want it. Can repeat with seconds. Hit ST/SP to start and then again to shut it up when it goes off.Major Pro:There's actually a power switch on the side of this. So when not in use, it doesn't need to drain the battery.Also this will eliminate my randomly turning it on and not knowing til it later goes off and startles me! (I've done this with my other timers many times.)Other Pros:Easy to use.Accurate.Very low battery usage.Has a collapsible stand - stand it up or lie it flat.Built in magnet - can just live on the fridge, etc.Cons:It's really really hard to get to the battery. It DID come with the necessary battery which is awesome - but I had to get in there and remove the plastic to activate it. The door to the battery panel doesn't easily slide or snap or fold. I really hurt myself getting to it - still failed, had to get someone to help me and they didn't have it any easier. Once you get past this, you should be set for a long time though since this won't use a lot of battery power.I love that this is a 2-pack. It's handy because I'm always looking for another one. Sometimes I'm multi-tasking in the kitchen and need more than one timer.This last part, is a Con for me, but probably a Pro for many - very subjective:It's REALLY LOUD. Ear-piercing. I can see how that would be good, if you're moving between rooms, etc, you dont want to not hear it / neglect whatever you're cooking/baking and ruin it. For me though, it's a little painful. :)*I received this 2pack of kitchen timers for free in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DS52BXNAV4HL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016M78M2M#wasThisHelpful","R3DS52BXNAV4HL","A3OQ47ZE3GEI0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OQ47ZE3GEI0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This taffy is definitely some of the most fun I've ever had with a product test.For the most part it's great taffy and if Shriver's offers custom orders where you can pick your flavors, I'd consider ordering more.Some little things vary from flavor to flavor ... I'm going to share everything I've noticed/ found here in the hope that it helps someone who's considering this as one of the possibilities for a taffy purchase...First of all -I counted 15 different flavors included in this one pound box.. pretty cool.Secondly -The are ALL soft, chewy and pull apart easily.They are less sticky than any other salt water taffy I've had - so i'd like to think this makes eating it easier on my teeth.You know how when you eat some things - you just feel like it's trying to rip your fillings out? Sticky, rough ? This taffy isn't like that.(I'm sure that it could, it just doesn't seem as imminent.)The flavor inconsistency:Some flavors are really bold! Others are really bland. It's almost like multiple people are involved in making this and someone is stingy with the flavoring while someone is generous. I haven't found a happy medium in this regard. Obviously though, some flavors are more potent than others but that isn't the case here - at least in my opinion and I've made candy before.Flavors!I took pics of many of them & wrote in the flavors of the ones I did.Green:Lime.Really strong, fairly tart and, in my opinion, delicious. Tastes of that candy-flavor-lime, not the fresh fruit.Yellow (solid):Lemon.Much like the lime. Really potent flavor, fairly tart. Tastes like that fake/ candied lemon flavor - not fresh lemons. Really yummy- reminded me of lemonheads off the bat - the smell of it.Purple (solid):Grape.This one is pretty potent, fairly tart. I'm not a huge fan of grape-flavored things. Ate one for evaluation, gave the rest to Hubby who loves grape flavored things and he loves them. He also agrees with my findings of this taffy being way less sticky than others.Black (solid):Licorice.Not a fan of licorice. Hubby who is, loves the licorice flavored taffy that came in this box though!White (solid):Vanilla.This one  was a big of a disappointment but also delicious at the same time if that makes any sense. I loooove vanilla. If I could get a pound of this in all vanilla - and if I could afford it- I would. And I would eat it all day. That said, it's a very mild vanilla flavor. I could stand it a bit less bland if it were up to me :).Pink (solid):StrawberryI put the question mark because  - it's really, really bland. I think it's supposed to be strawberry but it almost just tastes more plain than anything. Yummy, regardless - like the vanilla.White (with red stripe)Peppermint.This one tastes like a chewy candy cane. It's pretty intense. Not like Dentene Ice intense but ... def not mild.White (with green stripe) :Spearmint.I'm a huge fan of spearmint! This one is mild but it works! I like when I can enjoy me some spearmint but not necessarily be left with minty breath.Yellow (with red stripe):Banana (I think).I fully expected this one to be strawberry-banana because of the red stripe but I tasted only 100% banana. Not overly potent like most banana things are so in this case, if you like banana, this company's being stingy with the flavor add-in works! (However if it's trying to be anything other than banana, maybe it doesn't?)Brown (darker, chocolate-colored):Chocolate!I usually hate chocolate flavored things but this is lovely. Seriously - it tastes like chocolate ice cream. I'm a fan. Flavor was well balanced. I only got ONE of this flavor in the box, so that kinda sucks but - delicious.Brown (lighter color):Coffee or mocha?Immediately upon opening this, I smelled coffee. I absolutely hate coffee and the smell nauseated me so I didn't put any of this color in my mouth.Of all the people around me for the past week or so - no one has been willing to try it. There is some debate as to weather it smells like just coffee or mocha... or something else like cappuccino - so it's something coffee-related, is all I can share about this one.  Sadly there were many of this flavor included in my mix! Figures.Coral (solid):Grapefruit?Initially it was unanimous that it smelled like nothing.As soon as I twisted -it wow! The smell was AMAZING. Reminded me of lemon-lime, initially. Taste is a bit tart, citrus-y - I think, (based on the color and the non-specific citrus flavor) that it's supposed to be grapefruit. It's pleasant. Wish I got more than just the one in this box!White (with red & green stripes):Freshmint?My first impression was ""this tastes like toothpaste.""  It's very minty - not wintergreen or spearmint or peppermint. Reminds me of that ""freshmint"" that some institutions do now. Not a fan.Tan (with brown stripe):Rootbeer!!!Pleasant! Reminds me of those rootbeer dumdumbs. Rootbeer flavored taffy- I'd probably not have thought of it but I'm glad someone did.Tan (with green stripe):Mint- chocolateNot a fan of this one at all - it's like a chewy Andes mint. Doesn't work for me. Flavor-wise, it's well flavored. Strong mint, strong flavor of chocolate as well, maybe a dark chocolate flavor.There ya have it. :)I hope this was helpful. Or you can always do the 'sample at your own risk' deal.Good candy  and probably a flavor for everyone in here.Overall - 4 stars.Some of the flavors could be more intense. Others could be less intense.*I received this box of taffy at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R173ADEM1QW0YD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011OAHWPU#wasThisHelpful","R173ADEM1QW0YD","A3OQ47ZE3GEI0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OQ47ZE3GEI0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've fast become a huge fan of this bracelet!It first caught my eye because I love the colors - I've got the deep blue with tones of tan, etc that in the light, often look golden and remind me of a celestial scene.When I first put it on, it was icy cold! Cold burned my wrist. These beads are interesting - the way they quickly adapt to temperature.I pulled the bracelet off and place it against my skin for just a minute and then it almost felt hot ! This made it much more comfortable on my wrist and it's stayed comfortable - or my wrist is adjusted to it . :)It feels lightweight- doesn't flare up my arthritis or my tendinitis - which is awesome because I love looking down and seeing it.I'm thinking it might be pretty stacked with a couple of others, depending on the colors, etc. I've got a few ordered so I'll soon find out.Gifting:Now- as a gift- this would totally work. It's stunning in person. But if you're considering it as a gift, you'll need to ship it to yourself and wrap it up first. I'd pick up some tissue paper and a box or gift bag - it just came in a thick plastic zipper bag with a barcode sticker on it.Some items I'd recommend shipped directly to the recipient as is - (based on presentation) this isn't one. (in case you're wondering).Overall - really pretty bracelet. Love it. 5 stars.*I received this bracelet at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE7OJ3LVTJMIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011DR5BY8#wasThisHelpful","RE7OJ3LVTJMIK","A3OQ47ZE3GEI0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OQ47ZE3GEI0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
