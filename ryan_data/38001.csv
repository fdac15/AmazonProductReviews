"Ken Burns delivers again in this beautifully done documentary of jazz. From its inception to how jazz evolved from the likes of Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and so many more, it offers a most interesting look at all of the legends and their musical styles, personalities, and lifestyles which ultimately shaped jazz, sometimes controversially. This set offers the viewer the opportunity to keep abreast of every musical number featured, as it'll display that info if you'd like. There are also three performances included. All in all, Ken Burns' Jazz will keep you mezmerized for hours.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R472WP4CFZZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BITUEI#wasThisHelpful","R3R472WP4CFZZ0","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There aren't 4 DVDs in this set; there are 2, which are maybe the equivalent of 4 in terms of total running time? I don't know- it doesn't say. Anyway, this cast of comedians is hit or miss; some performances are hilarious (such as Michael Jr's), while others don't deliver or resonate at all. If no profanity in comedy is your thing, then this should suit you. Overall, it's a decent dose of comedy when there aren't better choices available.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R252A3EQTZK7ZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005PUVGEO#wasThisHelpful","R252A3EQTZK7ZZ","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Twin Peaks was a hit television show in the early 90's; it was David Lynch hitting prime time with his signature brand of surreal storytelling. Twin Peaks sort of burst on the scene, arguably because of the stellar and catchy soundtrack by Angelo Badalamenti. His Twin Peaks Theme, as well as Laura Palmer's Theme set the mood and tone for the whole series, and have a uniqueness all their own. There are those who loved the show and its music. Then there are those who were ambivalent about the show, but loved the music. After all these years, I've yet to hear anyone who didn't like the music. This soundtrack is very deep, emotional, dark, hypnotic, and powerful. I recommend this focused soundtrack as something catchy and out of the ordinary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REXF50ZIEQ17A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002LMM#wasThisHelpful","REXF50ZIEQ17A","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This comprehensive compilation of the Twin Peaks saga leaves nothing behind; it contains every episode (including the iconic pilot), plus has the movie (Fire Walk With Me) included. As far as bonus features, it has just about anything a fan (or new fan in the making) wants: hours of interesting commentary and deleted scenes, etc. Of course, this set wouldn't be complete without the pristine Blu Ray mastering, with great sound to match. Set in the pacific northwest, this brooding series is vintage David Lynch: offbeat, dark, surreal, and oftentimes left to ones own interpretation. Of course, the icing is Angelo Badalamenti's signature soundtrack that is mood-setting for sure. I highly recommend this set for old and new fans alike.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ABV8HRYPWUKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KCTG4PO#wasThisHelpful","R2ABV8HRYPWUKB","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This gold pocket watch is indicative of yesteryear, when this was a timekeeper's preferred piece. Yes, to see one use a pocket watch these days is a rarity, or perhaps I'm not paying too much attention? A symbol of charm, elegance and sophistication, this timepiece is, well, timeless. I prefer using this pocket watch because I don't really like wearing a watch or checking my iPhone for the time. This watch is durable, and has the classic accompanying chain that I utilize just in case I'm careless and potentially leave it behind somewhere. If pocket watches aren't your thing on a daily basis, at least try using one the next time you attend an elegant social event; people will love and appreciate the nostalgia. This watch should last a lifetime as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYMAREXMT3UZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EL0YQT6#wasThisHelpful","RYMAREXMT3UZ","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Giant Steps isn't shy- Coltrane leaves nothing in the bag with this very grooving tenor sax extravaganza that is pure immortality. How he's able to play so fast and with such precision is truly amazing. Several Coltrane staples are featured on this legendary album, such as the title track, COUSIN MARY, and NAIMA. Coltrane takes hard bop to another dimension and level with this not to be missed masterpiece. Essential. 10/10","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GVD3FRC1CZ2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002I4S#wasThisHelpful","R2GVD3FRC1CZ2H","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Miles Smiles is, in a lot of ways, the last hurrah of superlative acoustic offerings by Davis; it was the end of an era, and right before Davis started experimenting with electronic sound. Recorded in 1966, it was right before the psychedelic period of that turbulent decade- a period of experimentation. Anyway, this album is absolutely in Miles' top ten of all-time. At times mezmerizing with its fast pace, and at other times deeply intellectual and slower, it has something for everyone in the realm of freebop. The track CIRCLE is piano-driven, and has a BLUE AND GREEN feel to it, (Kind of Blue Album), while definitely keeping its own identity. All in all, Miles Smiles is a cohesive effort that keeps the listeners attention. A must-have for any serious fan. 10/10","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21KU22XFSN9JY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000247P5#wasThisHelpful","R21KU22XFSN9JY","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Trail of the Pink Panther (1982) is somewhat of a comedy within a comedy, as Blake Edwards took unused footage of Peter Sellers' character and injected several sequences into this very mediocre movie. I give Edwards credit for paying tribute to Sellers with this movie, as I think it was done with good intentions. If anything, Edwards' decision to keep Clouseau 'alive' is admirable, and only perpetuates his enthusiasm for the Panther franchise. However, this movie is not without its shortcomings. First, it's sort of ridiculous that so much previously USED footage from the other movies was used, especially for only a 93 minute movie. Second, there's lethargy in this movie, as the supporting actors really lack the energy from previous Panther films. I noticed that the energy was draining in Revenge of the Pink Panther, but this movie has it bottoming out. Even the normally peppy Herbert Lom seems out of sync in this offering; perhaps he was a victim of the script? Whatever the case, this movie borders on unnecessary, but it still has Sellers, and for that I give it a neutral rating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J8GZJS6AFNJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009S4J32#wasThisHelpful","R1J8GZJS6AFNJ","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Supernatural thrillers of the 21st century seem to have one thing in common: the shock element that just isn't that shocking anymore. Something jumps out, and the music intensifies. Oh, and the cheesy special effects add insult to mild injury. As for the plot, it's just the same old same old: trying to overcome evil spirits, and human intervention proves untrustworthy. Thankfully, this movie clocks at only 90 minutes. I just wasn't entertained by this somewhat mindless thriller flick. On a positive note, the acting was much above average, and the music was decent. 4/10","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DEIWWHVW61FP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S0AYSX2#wasThisHelpful","R2DEIWWHVW61FP","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our Nixon offers an intimate look into the Nixon White House, with audio recordings of his comments, as well as super 8 footage previously unreleased. While watching this documentary, it became very clear that the mystery that was Richard Nixon (his privacy, habits, personality, etc.) become even more magnified with sometimes chilling comments by him. A bit foul-mouthed,  he comes across as insensitive and cruel at times. Of course, when one thinks of Nixon, they think of Watergate, which accounts for about half of this documentary. Interesting accounts of what happened are provided by his top aides and officials- even those who went to prison. I wouldn't call this documentary top-notch, but it still manages to depict Nixon as a complicated man during a complicated time in our history.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQXSOZ77U2DA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FO3XRJ4#wasThisHelpful","RQXSOZ77U2DA6","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've tried many different types of portable heaters for my house, mostly gravitating to those that claim they're energy-efficient while still producing robust heat. This particular unit can produce robust heat, but that piece of paper (or email) that arrives each month says otherwise. This unit comes with two heat settings: lo or hi. There is a substantial difference between the two, so much that you're better off staying with the lo setting to prevent sticker shock. Another thing: there isn't anyone out there who hasn't used their portable heater for a quick warmup (hands or feet) once in awhile. Well, this isn't going to happen at ground level, as the heat is emitted toward the top of the unit. What's more, the top of the unit by the handle can get extremely hot, so I don't recommend having it around infants and toddlers. On the plus side, there are 4 timer settings (1,2,4 and 8 hours) that come in handy, a shutoff feature in case the unit is tipped over, as well as a thermostat setting. For the money, this is probably a practical purchase, but with all things considered, you could probably do better for a tad more money.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ4OHTBV52SEX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00826LKTO#wasThisHelpful","RQ4OHTBV52SEX","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Backyardigans dolls have really provided my three year old with amusement and imaginative play. When she watches a Backyardigans DVD, she'll often include these three characters in the experience. She will mimic what the characters do on screen using these dolls. In terms of quality, these dolls are adequate, and should last a very long time, as they're stitched together well and not overstuffed. These are very nice toys for imaginative play.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG23UH78HA1OH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KTH4064#wasThisHelpful","RG23UH78HA1OH","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A Love Supreme is one of John Coltrane's true masterpieces. I can't decide if it's this masterpiece or Giant Steps that takes the crown; I go back and forth. Relatively short in length (32 + minutes) it immediately makes an inpact, delivering a more free jazz sound. This album features a tireless Coltrane hitting the sax with everything he's got, much in the manner of  Giant Steps, though that album is faster. This is Coltrane's most personal album, with a spiritual overtone to it. Every section features something unique; I particularly love the drumming on this album. Coltrane left us much too soon, but not before making an indelible impact on jazz with albums like this. I enthusiastically recommend this essential recording.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AWC43566DK9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000A118M#wasThisHelpful","R3AWC43566DK9P","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These wine glasses provide instant identification of ones drink due to their array of colors to choose from! Yeah, an illuminated wine glass isn't really my thing, but it comes in handy at a big gathering. These glasses are very attractive, and can add atmosphere to your social gatherings.

"Yes' 90125 was a break from the very progressive sound that dominated their catalog throughout  the 1970's. Here, they give it up (for the most part) for more straightforward and accessible tunes, such as the very popular OWNER OF A LONELY a HEART, as well as LEAVE IT. Two other notable tunes are CHANGES and HEARTS, which hint at a progressive sound while maintaining their rock identity. This album was sort of an unexpected release for those who were steeped in their classic epic length tunes. I listened to 90125 with an open mind, and I'm glad to say that it's one of Yes' finest moments. An acquired taste, yes, but still very enjoyable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ3KFF5XZZ46I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009Z570#wasThisHelpful","RJ3KFF5XZZ46I","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This iconic album by the premier jazz saxophonist John Coltrane is probably his most expressive work. While consisting of no songs that were actually penned by Coltrane, he nonetheless makes them his own, with sweet melodies and nifty solos. I'm more a fan of the trumpet (Miles Davis), but John Coltrane and his sax cannot be ignored; this is absolutely essential music for any jazz devotee. The title track alone is worth the price. I also love the elegant cocktail lounge music of EVERYTIME WE SAY GOODBYE. This is one great record that rightly belongs in the top 5 jazz records of all time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RANZ28RKR8YA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002I53#wasThisHelpful","RANZ28RKR8YA6","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This refreshing 2012 release by Warner Bros. and Rankin/Bass is a dipping into the archives, as the 4 specials featured here are a tad more obscure. These specials haven't carried the weight of such classics as Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, or The Year Without a Santa Claus, but are still good in their own right. It's nice to see a product like this in circulation these days, as these classics deserve their due. The Little Drummer Boy Book II is a nice sequel, but inferior to the original. I found The Leprechaun's Christmas Gold to be very interesting, with a nice setting. This set doesn't contain any special features, I will point out, though one can argue that this DVD is in fact a special feature all its own. For the completist, this DVD is essential to your holiday TV special collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O5MYYAGEUKI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008NNY8A4#wasThisHelpful","R3O5MYYAGEUKI4","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, is this album powerful! The Clash's second offering depicts a post-punk sound with abundant guitars and more rockish beats. I will say that this album is grossly underrated, though it gets its due from critics. Fans somehow gobble up the first album and London Calling, and not pay enough  attention to this classic. All of the tracks are stellar, but I particularly like SAFE EUROPEAN HOME, TOMMY GUN, ALL THE YOUNG PUNKS, and STAY FREE, the latter being my favorite. In typical Clash fashion, the songs explore politics and societal problems. Do yourself a favor and get this superlative offering by The Clash.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OQTJRJYA410S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004BZ09#wasThisHelpful","R2OQTJRJYA410S","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beyond the Lighted Stage isn't your typical rock band documentary; it does more than just tell a story. While watching this fantastic documentary, I was in awe at how these guys conduct themselves, either on the stage or off. For those who already know a great deal of their history, there have never been stories of a band member (or members) trashing their hotel room with a sledgehammer, scandals, drug busts, or anything else that is pretty typical of rock stars. Geddy, Alex, and Neil are well-spoken, not arrogant, and just 'regular guys' who love to make music for their fans, who, by the way, are the most loyal you'll ever see. Why does Rush have such a loyal fan base? Perhaps it's because Rush have been slighted by critics and kicked around for 40 years, which doesn't sit well with fans. Or, it could be that fans respect their unwillingness to cave into being something they're not, such as 'selling out' for the record company or to the tune of way more money via chart-topping hits. Even after the very precarious period (1975) of not selling many copies of Caress of Steel, they still stuck to their guns and made another epic-length piece (2112). When this album became successful, people started to realize that these guys are real. Finally, I think that Rush fans are endeared to the band because they're there for the fans. Because of everything I mentioned, it's no mystery as to why they've lasted so long together. Most bands are lucky to log 10 years, but Rush has logged more than 40, and are still going strong. The documentary starts with the early childhood of Geddy, Alex and John (Rutsey), the original drummer. They epitomize the grassroots struggle of a local band finding their way in a market (Canada) that wasn't conducive to being noticed by U.S. Labels. Then, via a radio station in Cleveland, Ohio, they got their first break (because of a DJ's bathroom break) when the song Working Man was played. After this, people wanted to hear Rush. Subsequently, the newly-found attention would be the beginning of the end for John Rutsey, who suffered from diabetes, so touring wasn't an option due to his health. Neil Peart auditioned and was given the job, but his presence and songwriting transformed the band into full-fledged progressive rock. I think of Neil Peart as a symbol of quiet confidence; he gave the image of someone who was above all the rock culture nonsense and criticism that's so prevalent even to this day. I've never known him to say,  ""how come we're not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?"" His band mates had the same attitude. Rush have always wanted to be themselves, which alienated critics. But music is about fans and gold and platinum records- NOT what Rolling Stone magazine says. Rolling Stone has finally given Rush their due, most likely because they don't want to lose fans who like Rush. This documentary also touches on tragic events in Peart's life which sidelined the band indefinitely. Rush is a band of attrition, perseverance, and resilience. When they returned to action, they were bigger than ever, thanks to old fans and new legions of fans. This two CD set is a must-have for anyone who appreciates a great story about a great band. The second disc has concert footage included.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RQQ7DK2GIFYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003J27WFW#wasThisHelpful","R2RQQ7DK2GIFYW","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had joint pain in my knees and a more nagging pain in my legs for as long as I can remember. It has never made me completely immobile, but I've always had a little extra trouble doing simple tasks. Even standing for too long trying to the dishes would wear my legs out. It had also become difficult for me to stand up from a sitting position. I talked to my doctor about using a tennis ball for relief, and then I stumbled upon this gem in my search. Since using the Tennis Ball Self Massage system I have been able to move and walk and even jump with little or no ill effects to speak of. I feel as if it has revitalized the way I move and I've even been going on walks. Before reading this book, I could only walk around the block before the pain in my legs forced me to sit down. Just last week, I walked a full two miles with no joint or muscle pain!I've also rooted around Amazon for some other hidden gems, and I came up with Simple Natural Cures: Cheap & Effective Remedies for Everyday Common Ailments. It's a short, easy read and acts as my go-to guide for treating and curing several familiar illnesses or ailments. Headaches, insomnia, anxiety, and even eczema are on the list of conditions that the book goes over. It offers plenty of unique (and totally natural) treatments for all of these issues, and I have to say that I never knew how easy it was to treat basic problems. I wish I had learned about the Tennis Ball Self Massage and Simple Natural Cures a long time ago because they have helped me immensely.Before I get too far ahead of myself, the relative brevity and ease-of-reading provided by the Tennis Ball Self Massage book is outstanding. It's not a difficult concept to grasp and the author doesn't go on and on about useless details. They get right to the point and they cover all kinds of muscle and joint ailments and how to properly use the tennis ball to treat them. Anyway, if it hadn't been for these two books I'd probably be hobbling around and complaining of head pain, but not anymore!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O3RXNEQHVVB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DY49WY4#wasThisHelpful","R1O3RXNEQHVVB5","A2W37S6VC464WK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W37S6VC464WK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If this necklace is an example of slightly blemished, I don't want to see heavily blemished.I will start with the tag.  It says ""Made in China"".  That strikes me as an odd place to get Tahitian pearls from.  Then the opposite side of the tag says ""D"".  That is the lowest rating for the worst pearls that are still marketable.  Any more blemished and the pearls are destroyed.I have added some pictures of the types of blemishes I found; and every single pearl in the string was similarly marked.  The first two are different views of a round pit in the nacre that went right down to the seed.  That small white circle in the pearl I am holding is not a reflection.  It is the white seed core the pearl is grown around.  The third and fourth are of other blemishes on other pearls, all of them quite deep.Obviously, it isn't practical to show more than a few examples and the luster of the pearls makes it hard to see still photographs of some of the dents and creases because of the reflective surface.  These are not slight blemishes that were concealed by creative drilling and knotting.  The pit that exposed the underlying seed should have been erased by a drill hole if that were the case. Instead, it was dead center on the middle of the pearl.  I can't see paying upwards of $800. for such heavily blemished pearls.On the plus side, the colors were very well matched and the sizing was quite nice.  None of the pearls on this string were oddly shaped like in the pictures that go with the official description.  They were all almost perfectly round and nicely graduated in size.The presentation box for the pearls was extremely well packaged in a tough, well-fitting outer box; but there was nothing inside to pad the pearls from being jostled during shipment.  I provided some bubble wrap for the trip back because I simply had to return them after seeing what a low grade they were.Interestingly enough, the description of the item says the pearls are ""slightly blemished"".  I am pretty much a pearl lover and have several other strings, none of which show blemishes as large or obvious as the ones here.  It's possible I got a bad string; but I have to call it based on what I received.  The pictures give an indication of that.  I probably should have tried to get a motion camera for a video.  That would have displayed the pearl surfaces better, but I do not have the equipment for stabilizing the camera while I handle the pearls.

"Definitely not for older people.  There is a point early in the game where one must follow one of 7 identical cards as they shuffle and spin around one another.  While something like this was no problem for me when in my 20's, as a 60+ person the task is pretty much impossible.  However, without being able to do it, you can't proceed in the game.

"This comes with its own moisture disc with lid storage for keeping brown sugar soft.  The disc has to be removed from the lid, soaked for 15 minutes, and wiped dry on the surface first; but when you put it in contact with the sugar after that, it will keep the sugar soft and lump free for several months, if necessary.I don't bake over the summer and any left over brown sugar has to weather those months.  The natural humidity in the air isn't enough and the apple slice trick gives only limited success.  I keep the damp disk against the sugar and evedrything stays loose.  I check once a month and redampen the disk if necessary.  This method has saved me from throwing out more sugar bricks than I cvare to remember over the years.

"This unit has been able to remove hairs that at least 6 other epilators of various brands couldn't.  That makes it A-1 in my book.As with all epilators, individual tolerances will vary and your comfort level will probably not match mine.  However, this little unit has been able to remove hair shorter than any other brand I tried and did it quickly on the first pass.

"At last Genina's superlative sudoku app comes to Kindle.This app generates its own puzzles on the fly, so you never have to download packets of new puzzles.  They only come in classic sudoku form, though; but I am more than happy with that.The game play features a choice of selecting digit first or cell first.  The digit first option can really cut down on taps when you can see more than one cell at a time where the digit fits.  There is also a pencil switch that allows you to fill in guesses on the fly and then switch back to standard selection.  And all that is displayed on screen.There is also an eraser for removing digits you want to erase.  Sorry, but this puzzle does not erase an entered digit with a second tap (except for penciled in digits).  It does count up the number of times you use a digit and gray it out when all nine possibilites are on the board.  It also highlights all instances of the selected digit on the board to help you line-of-sight locations that can't be used and puts a red border on a cell when you try to enter an ""impossible"" digit.  If you fill in a digit, all penciled in instances of that digit will be removed.  (However, it won't prevent you from penciling in a digit where it shouldn't be.)Off screen, there are lots of options on the pop up menu, including Undo, Redo, an option to fill in possible digits for the entire puzzle at once, a validation function to point out mistakes when you get a conflict, and a way to get some hints.  Even deeper in the menu are options for Settings, solving the entire puzzle (if by some chance, you should ever want to give up), and a Reset command to erase all your selections and start over.The range of difficulty is also pretty wide.About the only thing not to like is that the Welcome Screen was never resized for Kindle tablets.  It is still the same size that fits on cell phone screens, which means it looks tiny on a Kindle Fire 8.9 inch screen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T64O7EZEC3FS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HLYG0I#wasThisHelpful","R3T64O7EZEC3FS","A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The ring, when it arrived was very pretty.  The stones are a light, but bright chartreuse color, not quite as dark looking as pictured.However, the sizing is quite tight.  I normally wear a size 7 ring of late and can sometimes fit into a 6.5, depending on ring design.  This ring was labeled 7, and the vendor was very nice and quickly responded to my email about it; because I couldn't get the ring on.  It was definitely too small.  Just to make sure my fingers hadn't swelled up, I tried on five of my other rings and they all fit as they normally do. So, I sadly had to return it.If you buy the ring, you won't be disappointed in the looks or color; but be sure to consider going half a size up, if possible.  If not, try a full size up; but be aware before buying that sizing should be a consideration.  The manufacturer's sizing guage runs a bit smaller than expected; but the ring itself is absolutely beautiful.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HN33RF68X7WF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OWBPKN0#wasThisHelpful","R3HN33RF68X7WF","A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know that tanzanite is a problematic stone.  It literally photographs a lot darker than it looks in person.  I know because I have tried it myself, and sure enough, the stone looks darker in the photo than it does on my hand.The basic color of tanzanite is a very pale lavendar.  The darker the stone, the more expensive it gets, and that should be considered when buying this ring.  I received a ring with a nice little solitaire stone that is definitely blue-lavendar, clear and quite pale in color.  The nice thing about it is that the blue tint is clearly visible when the stone is viewed straight on,  It's lovely.  However, every stone is different.  It isn't possible for each ring to be identical to the one pictured, but mine was very close and I consider the picture a good representation.The ring size is true and the ring itself would look better on smaller hands because it is a thin ring with a small stone (barely more than 1/4 carat) that will get lost on a larger or broader hand.

"The color is very impressive with a true kaleidescope of mostly turquoise shades,  The sizing is true, and perhaps a tad generous.There are a few things to note, though.  Comfort fit rings like this one all tend to be a bit thick bodied and this is no exception.  If you prefer a close fitting flat ring that can't be felt between the fingers, stick with a traditional setting. Also, there are future considerations, such as how will the ring age?  Opal is a delicate stone and it is set all around the ring.  I will keep an eye on the ring to see if the stone scratches with use, especially when I have to grab something (like a subway pole for balance).As it stands now, I take it off when I have to put my hands in water; but that should be another consideration and opportunity for abuse of the ring and stone.  The tungsten should be able to take it, but again, consideration should be given to care for the opal stones as water may eventually work its way underneath them and either loosen them or cause fading or cracking.If one is willing to treat the ring with care keeping all this in mind, it should be an attention grabber for a long time to come.I think I will be ordering another one sometime soon - as soon as I can decide on what color I want.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17940V2971HU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006UJHM2Y#wasThisHelpful","R17940V2971HU3","A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a rather bright cocktail type ring.  I wouldn't select it for everyday wear as it is rather flashy.  Tanzanites are stones with a wide range of shading.  I already have tanzanite that ranges from pale lavender with barely any color to as dark as a frosted blueberry.  The darker the stone, the more expensive it is; and true blueberry colored stones will cost $1,000 for a clear, flawless 1,2 carat specimen.The ring I received has a pale to medium lavendar stone with great clarity and sparkle.  Also, the ring sizes to a true 7 with maybe being just a tad on the generous side.  This is important because silver rings can't be easily sized like gold ones can.  The set stones on the sides of the ring stop just short of being in an annoying place, which is good news for comfort.  I daresay the pictured ring is the best one of the lot with the darkest stone; but expecting that color for the price of this ring is unrealistic.  The stone I got is true tanzanite color, lavender with some flashes of blue when viewed from the side.  Looking at it straight on won't display that additional color, I'm afraid.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZT3F7GS0VS5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KI14CRI#wasThisHelpful","RZT3F7GS0VS5A","A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had a lot of bubbles form when I applied this cover.  It took about 4 hours of work to get the ones that didn't have dust particles beneath them pushed out to the edges of the cover. The cover itself had a nice semi-matte surface and takes a lot of finger contact and cleaning with alcohol pads in stride.I have applied a lot of different screen covers over the past 16 years and this was by far the hardest to install.

"Everything it is claimed to be, as far as being bubble-free goes.  However, it was not anti-glare.The unit I received was an ultra-clear cover, but it is shiny and almost as mirror-like as the Kindle it protects.  Also, I applied this to the newly released Kindle fire 8.9 with 3G connection capabilities.  There is a slight problem as this new model is ever so slightly smaller than the previous one released in November 2013.  The difference is only about a millimeter, but that is enough to have the edges of the cover flush with the outside edge of the Kindle (as opposed to the end of the screen area).Anyone ordering the new Kindle Fire 8.9 3G should be aware that you may have to wait for i-Blason to cut a new master for the smaller size of this model.That being said, this cover does not actually stick to the surface of the viewing area.  The black border of the cover contains a thick-ish backing that absorbs the bumps from any stray dust particles that may have escaped cleaning and does not form bubbles at all.  So far, so good.  The clear area does not cling to the screen.  That means it is immune to bubbles; but consequently can form rainbow interference patterns as it meets the glass beneath it.  Many people might find these patterns annoying; but they are an alternative to having bubbles and dust bumps on a cover that sticks to the glass with a tacky surface.I deducted one star for not having a truly matte surface because I can't give it half a star.  The mirror finish is ultra clear, which is a plus, and I can't fault a cover I bought for the older Fire 8.9 model for being a millimeter too large for my new Fire.  As long as the lens holes fit in the proper place, this cover will do the job well.I don't know how many times it can be removed and reapplied, or how it should be stored between applications; but I can vouch that I was able to lift and reset it several times before I got the alignment exactly right with no bubble or dust problems.This cover is extremely easy to apply in comparison with every other cover I have used, including the wet application ones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R287UHX6A2G662/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0098PIYTW#wasThisHelpful","R287UHX6A2G662","A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me preface my review with a bit of background.  The story follows 4 teenage friends through their adventures in a self-contained fantasy world.  The four are the pair Talis and Mara, with Nikulo and Rikar making up the other two.  At this point in the story they have broken up into 3 groups with Talis and Mara staying together and the other two going their separate ways.  this is relevant to my review.I had serious issues with this book.  It seemed quite rushed and some passages were clearly wrong.  For example on Page 140 the characters Nikulo and Holoron are talking together.  Suddenly on Page 141, Holoron is talking to Talis, a character who in the story line is about 1,000 miles away at the time. Finally, on Page 143, it is Nikulo and Holoron who are back in the conversation again. It is errors like this, where character names and identities are not checked, that tell me the book was rushed to publication without a decent proof read.My second issue was with the ending, where one character miraculously shows up in the main story line with very little story time in the book before that, while another character who has been followed closely in the plot for nearly the entire book simply disappears from the story line.The book is clearly an interim installment, but the previous books had gone to the trouble of wrapping up the current plot before throwing in a hook for the next installment at the very end.  This book just drops the story in midstream with unresolved plot lines all over the place and no end in sight.  Tune in next week for the sequel.  The previous books did not do this and I am terribly disappointed that this installment did.  Luckily, I had the good sense to borrow it instead of buying it.  At least I can say I didn't throw my money away.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OEHGPAIYJKRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2HQUDY#wasThisHelpful","R3OEHGPAIYJKRW","A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Second favorite case, slim and light.This case adds practically no bulk or weight to the phone.  It is a relatively soft case with precise dimensions that reach the edge of the glass screen and no farther.  This means that it will not interfere with any stick-on screen protectors.  It has a smooth matte finish with cross work embossing on the back for both shock distribution and grip.  It pops right on the phone and is only slightly more difficult to remove.  The key is to start at the bottom corner opposite to the S-Pen slot.The bezels around the screen and the camera lens offer just enough lift to protect from scratches and drops and the edges of the phone have the tiniest bit of air space around them to offer good protection in a drop.  The openings for the ear phone plug and the charger have a tight enough tolerance that larger plugs will have trouble staying plugged in. I have an Amazon USB charging cable that is wide enough at the plug to keep popping out of the phone when I am trying to charge it in this case.  So that might be an issue for some.However, my biggest gripe is the flat button covers.  They make it tough to find the buttons, or avoid them.  So I find myself accidently pushing unwanted buttons all the time.  Other than that, though, it's a great case.My only other choice before this is the heavier Spigen Slim Armor case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29RZ2UE5SC60B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DCIY6HA#wasThisHelpful","R29RZ2UE5SC60B","A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Love this case.It is a little more expensive than other Spigen cases; but well worth it for me.  I like the contrast between the central hard portion and the rubber interior and ends.  This particular case doesn't feel like it leaves any air space around the edges of the phone, unlike the ridged back; but the rubber itself fells pliable enough to absorb the shock of a reasonable fall with no trouble.The case does increase the weight and bulk of the phone a bit; but it feels so solid and sleek that it is forgiveable.  Unlike many others, I don't have headphones with thick plugs.  So that is not an issue with me.  However, I do have USB charging cables with thick plug grips and some of them are a bit snug fitting.  The outer ridge around the phone's screen ends precisely at the groove in the edge of the glass and allows the metal edge of the phone to be seen if viewed at a very shallow angle.  However, the precise cut means that any screen protector can be used with the case without interference as long as it is applied reasonably straight.The extremely smooth hard outer shell may become a problem if one tries to handle the phone with wet or greasy hands; and it tends to pick up smudges and fingerprints way too easily.  I think I will be cleaning it often.  On the other hand, it makes the phone feel almost like it has no case because of the sculpted edges, which are beveled on both sides making them nearly round.  Both the front ridge and the bevel around the camera lens guarantee that neither the screen nor the lens will get scratched on any flat surface.The buttons are raise slightly and easy to press.  That makes them easy to find even when not looking at the phone.  It also makes it easy to accidentally press them when the phone is in a purse or pocket.  Since the front button at the bottom of the screen will also wake the phone from standby and is easier to reach in an enclosed space, I don't consider that to be a negative.Putting the case on was very easy if I started from the bottom.  Taking it off was a little more difficult because of the stiffness of the outer shell; but it was still easier than a lot of cheaper cases to remove.  There is no sensation that a drop or bang will separate the case from the phone and that solidity is all that I ask for.My only real dilemma is whether to use this or the Spigen Bounce case which is all rubber and both slimmer and lighter than this one.  Decisions, decisions.  I will probably go with this since it is smoother and easier to slip into the side pocket of a purse.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q3HEX4YBT81R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DCIZNKO#wasThisHelpful","R3Q3HEX4YBT81R","A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pros:Easier than tacky back PET screen protectors to apply.  Follow the video directions percisely to get very good results.  Add the extra element of going to a bathroom and running the shower steaming hot for 5 minutes beforehand to clear the dust from the air and you can get great results.Extremely clear and virtually bubble free.  Almost totally bubble free after a few days and practically invisible, except when tilted at an angle to the light.Touch sensitivity did not seem to be affected.I have a light touch with pens. So I did not experience the marking issue with the S-pen that others have.Cons:The cover is soft.  It will easily pick up fingernail marks that stay and will develop ridges from the smoothing and squeegee application process.The soft surface will also offer more resistance to swiping/sliding with fingers and to the S-pen point.Extreme care must be taken during the application process to avoid getting the application solution inside the phone.  Wetness and electronics do not mix well.  Try to allow 20-24 hours for the phone to dry before turning it back on and, if possible keep it face down on a microfiber towel or lens cloth the entire time to wick away moisture.Due to its softness, it will probably be more likely to scratch during normal use.  The softness means it is self-healing; but that can only go so far.However, all things considered, this is a much better choice than the harder surfaced dry application protectors.  Both ArmorSuit and Skinomi make very good products and I will take their solution to the screen protection problem any day over the others.  The wet application process means less dust gets caught between the protector and the screen; and what little there may be will not create distorting bubbles like the dry application covers do.The cover loses one star for being so soft, but I wish there was a way to make it 1/2 star because the rest of it is so good.  The previous suggestion to apply with the phone case on has merit.  However, you will have to take into account that some of the liquid will get squeegeed under that cover.  It will be best to remove the case immediately after application to prevent liquid from getting into the phone because of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YKF846FG16EN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ELUMZGW#wasThisHelpful","R2YKF846FG16EN","A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For starters, I ordered blue but got black.  Okay, that's a minor issue; but it goes downhill from there.  The case was nearly impossible to disassemble as I had to use my fingernails to spread the back cover sideways to release the front.  Then it was difficult to put on the phone properly since the sides had to be pushed back into place and of course that meant accidentally activating all the buttons on the sides of the phone in the process.Thankfully, I did not experience the sensor obstruction issue that so many others have complained of, but the clear screen produced some very annoying oil slick effects as it contacted the phones touch screen unevenly.  I cleaned both surfaces several times with microfiber lens cloths and could not stop it.  This also meant removing and reinserting the phone into the case several times, a real pain - literally.The case is stiff and the button covers flush with the rest of the edge.  This may be good to prevent accidental button depression; but that extends to all button use.  On top of that, the buttons are so stiff that I had difficulty pushing them even when not having to hold the phone to my face for a call.  I tried to adjust the volume when making one phone call with the case on and wound up taking 10 pictures of the sidewalk instead.  Bear in mind that others may not have the same issue with stiff buttons flush with the case edge.  At least that design prevents liquid from entering the phone via the button covers.Yes, the case is very inexpensive; but I'm getting something else.On the very plus side, PC Micro is very attentive to customer relations.  I called them and got a live person in under a minute.  We had a long conversation about the design aspects of the case and they made good on their promise of full satisfaction.  So, I give the case design 1 star and customer service 5 stars, for an average of 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R247HWNZDYGT6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LF1FODG#wasThisHelpful","R247HWNZDYGT6U","A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I think I wasted my money.  Not only are the buttons stiff and impossible to tell if they are pushed, but there is a big cut-out in the upper right corner of the case.  That means at least one spot is very vulnerable in a fall.  However, it seems logical to have it there as the only point where one can gain leverage to remove the case without damaging the phone.Yes, the color is very nice (gold in my case) and the case itself fits tightly, once I can get it on; but that is all.  The very process of putting on the case turned the phone on for me after I had been careful to shut it down and not just lock the screen.  The same goes for removing it. The right-side On/Off button is so stiff I can't tell if I have pressed it successfully and more often than not it triggers the ""Shut down"" dialog.  Since I am not about to purposely drop a $620 phone just to test a $17 case, I can't vouch for its protective abilities.Sorry, but this is a throwaway and I will be looking for a better case, maybe one of the Spigen models.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U81G9PJ78C3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J9TBSAE#wasThisHelpful","R3U81G9PJ78C3A","A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 7:33 MinsThis case boasts almost all the protection of Otterbox at 1/4 the price. First, the case comes in a plain-vanilla cardboard box.

"This is the best compromise so far.  The unit is balanced between the ""thin and light"" pretty covers and covers that offer at least some protection.  This cover comes in two pieces: a case for the back of the phone and a shield for the phone's face.  Now for the details.As others have posted, there are absolutely NO instructions how to install this cover, not in the box or on the web site.  There are instructions for related items; but not this specific model.  However, I was able to muddle through based on previous experience with screen shields on other devices.  Matching up the back case was no problem; but finding a start point to peel off the packing adhesive was.  I finally got a fingernail under an edge and pulled with all my strength to get it off.  Succeeded without any scratches to the plastic.  Whew!  The second cover on the outside of the case wasn't as bad.  After that, the case just popped onto the phone when I matched the camera openings to the lens location on the phone back.The case for the phone has a clear polycarbonate back that shows off the Amazon logo and collects all the fingerprints that would have otherwise gone on the phone.  The button extensions are easy to use and the outer edge of the case is rubberized with a nice tactile feel and grip.  It is tapered slightly toward the back of the phone making the phone's profile less square and the edges more rounded.  This reduces fatigue gripping the phone, a plus.  The downside of the case is that even the slightest condensation on the back will be visible as an oil slick-like blemish under the clear cover.  The upside is that the slightest condensation between the case and the phone will be visible.  Since it wasn't difficult to remove the case, taking it off and wiping away the moisture is easy.It would be good to have an eyeglass cleaning cloth to wipe off all those fingerprints at the end of the day, though.Since the case pops over the front edge of the phone, it makes a nice, rubber bumper that lifts the phone face slightly off any surface you put it on.  This provides a surprising amount of protection for the glass.  It might even mean that the second part of the case set, the stick on shield, isn't really necessary.Now that I have reached the shield, I have to preface my review by saying I have learned to *hate* these things.  While it is possible to apply them with no bubbles, the effort required isn't worth the protection they offer.First, both the sticky side of the shield and the phone face should be perfectly clean.  This means dusting off the outside of the adhesive protector on the shield and cleaning the phone with a pad dampened with household rubbing alcohol.  Dry off the phone thoroughly, preferably with a microfiber eyeglass cloth.  Most shields come with such a cloth; but this time you will have to supply your own.Next, find a dust-free area of your home to do the actual application.  The bathroom or kitchen is best because you can either run the shower or boil some water that will condense around dust particles and ""clean"" out the air a bit.Thirdly, you will have to position the shield over the phone glass and find the starting point to pull away the backing on the shield.  The first place to adhere the shield is where the backing first pulls away.  Work down the face of the phone carefully, keeping the shield aligned the way you positioned it and peel away the protective adhesive out from under the shield very close to the glass, smoothing out most of the bubbles as you go.  If the glass was truly clean, there shouldn't be any dust caught in the middle and the bubbles with move sideways as you press down.Finally, get a credit card and pass the edge over the top of the shield to finish smoothing it down, pushing the bubbles toward its edge.  If there is no captured dust, all the bubbles should slide out in front of the card edge and the shield will be almost completely smooth and clear.  Any remaining minor bubbles should flatten out over the next day or two, unless they have dust specks underneath.Whatever you do, don't remove the shield to adjust it.  All that will happen is dust and lint will get caught under it and things will get worse.After doing all that, however, I had a spot in the upper left corner that refused to stick to the phone glass.  There was no dust or dirt under it.  It just refused to adhere for over two days.  Since the edge of the loose section went right over the center of one of the dynamic sensor lenses, I just removed the stupid shield and threw it away.  Somehow, I think the ridge around the edge of the glass will do more good than the shield anyway.Also, each corner of the cover has a curved ridge on the backside that forms a ""foot"" which keeps the clear cover raised off the surface the phone is resting on, a small but welcome feature.  The cutouts for the USB port and the headphones are extra large to accommodate some of the heavier plug bases.  This is important to me because I have had encounters with covers whose access cutouts were too small for the charger.On the whole, this case is a good compromise between the paper thin vanity covers and the extra thick rubber or silicone protective covers.  It is trim and stylish with an innovative display for the phone back and still offers cushioning protection around the vulnerable edge and glass face of the phone.  It isn't perfect, but I like it a lot.  AT $13, it is a very attractive alternative to the $30 plus cases.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HNGZ9KA4YYXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L8T6QRS#wasThisHelpful","R2HNGZ9KA4YYXT","A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you want a pretty case with with a nice textured surface, this is it.But don't expect it to protect the phone.  It is tissue thin, and although hard, doesn't cover enough or provide enough of a ""bumper"" to offer any protection to the phone. As mentioned before, the front lip is so thin that the glass face of the phone will make full contact with every surface as though there was no cover on it at all.It snapped on the phone very easily and came off nearly as easily.  I had to expend very little effort to get a thumbnail under a corner and pop it off.Yes, it looks good, is a great color (gummetal gray for me), and adds little or no weight to the phone.  Yes, it has an easy grip velvety surface that reduces fatigue holding the phone and looks really streamlined.But that isn't why I buy a case for the phone.  Both the front and the back of the phone are supposedly made of gorilla glass 3 and either one can easily shatter in a fall.  That's what the case is meant to prevent.  The case itself barely covers the corners of the phone, but the top and bottom are wide open and that may be just enough to allow the case to pop off in a large enough fall on a hard enough surface.The most vulnerable part of the phone is the glass face. Simply having raised bumpers around the edge can be enough to stop it from contacting a damaging surface that will scratch or crack it.  This case is so thin it is nealy flush with the glass.  While it may look like a sleek design, it will do nothing to keep the glass safe and a broken glass face is a very expensive fix, if it doesn't ""total"" the phone altogether.I want more than a ""feather"" weight case for my phone.  So this is going back.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R108JEF2W9HKYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KTPDL3Y#wasThisHelpful","R108JEF2W9HKYH","A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This measuring set is simply awesome.  It is made of extremely heavy gauge steel and the weighting on the bottom of the cups ensures that they will never tip over and spill your stuff.  They also look like they will last 100 years.  About my only complaint is that I would have loved to get one or two intermediate sizes like I have in my other measuring set.  The rounded corners make it easy to get every last bit of ingredient out of the cups and spoons with nothing left in the non-existent corners.Of course, I outsmarted my self because the tip-proof bottoms took away my ability to indulge in the habit of tipping the cup sideways in a larger vessel to have all of any liquid inside flow to one side and be poured out.

"That being said I have a few issues with the case:The good:  It is fairly thick and well-ribbed, which makes it easy to grip and offers at least a little drop protection (and, no, I did not test that part). It also projects forward above the screen about 1/16-1/8 inch.  That's enough to keep the screen clear of a lot of surfaces and reduces scratch potential.  The stand in back is potentially useful; but only if you want to use the phone in horizontal mode for widescreen video.The bad:  I did not find it at all easy to remove; and in the process, the black outer portion separated from the colored inner portion at the corner.  The two portions do not snap together; so the only possible repair involves glue.  The operating buttons on the phone are covered with pushout buttons on the case.  While they do operate the buttons underneath them, I found the one covering the On/Lock button to be unusually stiff and difficult to operate.  On the other hand, the Camera/Firefly button is unusally soft and easy to press.  This may be due to the location of each on the phone; but the end result is a lot of time spent in battery-draining Firefly mode (since it can be engaged without unlocking the phone screen).  Finally, the openings on the bottom of the phone for the microphone, speaker, and USB port are cutouts with a downside of the USB opening being rather tight fitting for the USB plug.  I was wondering why the phone wasn't charging until I noticed that the thick case was resisting the charging plug and literally pushing it back out of the port.  I was using the Amazon ultra long charging cable with their standard charging adapter.  Even after I spread the opening in the case wider to allow the plug to seat properly, the slightest movement of the phone made the case squeeze the plug out until it stopped charging the phone.  I had to find a much smaller and shorter portable hard drive cable to fit into the case's cut out.The ugly:  I bought the orange case and the color that arrived didn't match the soft orange pictured in the item description at all.  It is more like Safety Neon Orange.  The up side is that I can spot the phone from 50 paces away.  Haha.To sum up, you get what you pay for.  The case has several really good features and a lot of issues; but considering the inexpensive price, the trade-off might be well worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31EDW1GLCDZ2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L48MTNS#wasThisHelpful","R31EDW1GLCDZ2O","A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This boot is made of distressed cowhide, and a fairly good quality at that.  However, there are a few ""gotcha""s that you should know about before buying.  It will save having to return the boots if you know in advance.First, only the toe cap and instep is fully lined, along with the lower part of the heel.  The entire calf and the upper part of the heel are unlined.  This is common in riding boots where thinner leather between the leg and the horse is a good thing; but if you want to do a lot of walking, the rough surface of the interior will prove uncomfortable.Then there is the strap across the ankle.  It makes the boot hard to put on and is difficult to loosen.  On the other hand, the strap across the top of the calf can help make that part fit better and only works because the calf rise is unlined, i.e., a single layer of leather, and very pliable.  Since I happen to have a boot chuck, taking them off was no problem.I wear size 10 and the length of the foot was adequate, to roomy.  However, even with a medium to narrow foot (B width), and virtually no instep to speak of, the boot was too narrow.  Anyone with a wide foot or high instep should take this into consideration before ordering.  It will save a lot of trouble in the long run.  Also, the half-lined heel would be comfortable astride a horse but will definitely rub against the foot during extended walking.I happen to own riding boots, or boots meant exclusively for riding, and they are fitted with canvas loops on the inside of the boot top.  With a pair of boot hooks, the difficult process of putting them on is relatively easy.  I would have loved to see those loops on these boots.  They probably would have slipped on quickly.  The construction of the boots is solid and they should last for several years under normal wear and tear.  The pull-on loops would have been a boon, though.  Also, the sole/heel combination is thick and heavy and should stand up well under use -- for any person with the right foot to fit the boot properly.In summary, if you have a narrow foot and wide calf, these boots should fit well and be comfortable.  Anybody else would be better off trying a different style of boot.  I gave it three stars because the fitting problem is a major issue to me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EFOZNPG7BN5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LGKPNH8#wasThisHelpful","R3EFOZNPG7BN5B","A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If your score climbs above some as yet unidentified cap, the game will revert to negative scores and ultimately crash.Now for the parts that mar the experience:In Scene 6 (particularly), the tambourine icon points to the toy drum object, although it can also point to the right object, namely the tanbourine.  Something similar happened with the handheld mirror and the wall mirror in one of the later scenes.The tap area for some of the objects is either too small, offset somehow, or obscured by the tap area of nearby objects.  Hence, tapping on the object will sometimes incorrectly generate a point deduction.One of the two spiderweb objects is invisible against the icon bar background.  I have reached the ""end"" of several scenes containing the spiderweb with an apparently empty bar and had to tap on the spiderweb to complete the scene even though the icon for it didn't show.Just once so far, an object was in the icon bar that did not seem to exist in the scene.  Even after hitting the Hint button, no part of the scene was highlighted.  I believe this was in one of the later scenes, 16 or 18.Also, since I installed the game, my Kindle Fire HDX (7"") has behaved strangely, freezing even though I quit the game a while before.  I have had to restart the Kindle twice and was able to Force Stop the game a few other times to get things working again.Overall, this game breaks new ground for hidden object ""puzzles"".  However, it will have to work out a few bugs before earning 5 stars from me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LJNJTSSP5OJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KD56NPS#wasThisHelpful","R1LJNJTSSP5OJ0","A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have to say that the previous books in this series left quite an opening for future developments; and that this book surprises because it did not follow any of the obvious courses.Inhuman introduces at least one new villain (you will understand what this means when you read the book) and turns the tables on our previous conceptions of characters we have met in the past.  It goes to a new set of problems and ironically solves what could have been a problem based on the ending of the book 3.  With all the unknowns associated with the creation of the Trans-human, it has surprisingly become a non-issue concerning the potential problems it could have caused.  The focus instead has become the mystery surrounding reports of character appearances and on the newly revealed biggest threat to not only humanity's survival but the existence of the entire cosmos.The stage expands and events from way back in the first book come back into the plot in new, sinister ways.  Never a dull moment here.Simpson masterfully tells a nail-biting, fast paced story that moves relentlessly from one player to another in a way that makes it hard to put the book down.  It is the longest single book in the series so far and still had me relentlessly turning page after page to see what would happen next, and root for new friends that were once enemies and boo enemies that were once friends.  He has turned his universe topsy turvy and dealt quite a few surprises, both happy and sad, as we learn more about the players we have already met and the ripples that have spread out to all corners of existence.I doubt that anyone who reads this will be disappointed; but to get the full impact you should be sure to read the previous four books first.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19M3C5GHVITYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYLX4R4#wasThisHelpful","R19M3C5GHVITYW","A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The game is visually beautiful; but I have two issues with it.The first is the sound control.  There is none.  The only way to turn off the sound is to turn the volume of the device all the way down.  Then I have to remember to turn it back up after playing.  An in-game control for that from the menu would be nice for those of us who want to quietly catch a few minutes of play during a work or meal break; or who don't want to hear the sound track repeat..The second, which is minor, is the Hint system.  It keeps pointing to items I have already found.  I ask for a hint to find items I can't locate, not the ones already marked.The game loses a star for these two omissions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JOGW99KKIUI9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GBDKF82#wasThisHelpful","R3JOGW99KKIUI9","A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having had very good luck with the Way Basics (square) Storage Cubes that I bought 2 years ago for my daughter's nursery, I decided to buy a couple of these (rectangular) Storage Cube Plus cubes in early 2014 to store some of her toys in.  I chose the Expresso (dark brown) color, because it would blend in with the color scheme in our living room.  Unlike the square cubes, which have held up for over 2 years without so much as a lean, the adhesive strips in these rectangular Cube Plus cubes began to fail after only 3 months, causing the edges of the cubes to separate.  My 2 cubes were stacked on top of each other, so when the bottom cube gave way, both cubes ended up falling over.  The load in the cubes wasn't particularly heavy, either - mainly lightweight, toddler-sized toys.  I can't for the life of me figure out why the rectangular Way Basics Cube Plus cubes fell apart but the square Cubes have stayed intact, especially since the rectangular cubes came with a thick, cardboard ""backboard,"" which you'd think would help to hold the Cube Plus together.  We store only cloth items (lightweight blankets, stuffed toys, etc.), in the square Cubes, so perhaps the moral of the story is that only very lightweight items can be stored in Way Basics cubes.  I definitely couldn't see these working for storing heavy, compact items like CDs/DVDs, vinyl records or books.  Fortunately, I was able to press the boards back together after the Cubes Plus fell apart, so they're not completely unusable.  However, we're only able to store soft, very lightweight toys in them now, so I have to find another storage solution for my daughter's plastic toys.  I gave this item 3 stars instead of 2 or 1 because it is an eco-friendly alternative to toxic engineered wood products, and a budget-friendly alternative to expensive, natural solid wood shelving.  But I wouldn't purchase Way Basics products again or recommend them to others unless they're going to be used to store fluffy items like lightweight sweaters or stuffed toys.Grade: C+UPDATE 9/2014: Shortly after writing this review, I was contacted by Way Basics Customer Service.  They were very attentive and eager to help me resolve my issues with this product.  I sent them some photos of my Storage Cube Plus cubes ... And, as it turns out, I had the cubes stacked the wrong way!  Apparently, for maximum product integrity, the Storage Cube Plus must be placed with the long edges vertical.  If the long edges of the cube are horizontal, that causes separation of the adhesive at the seams.  Unfortunately for me, I was using each of these cubes to store two small canvas storage baskets Whitmor 6241-1501-Kid's Canvas Collection Tote, Small, Blue (of kids' toys) side-by-side, and they won't fit with the cubes in vertical orientation.  So I had to make do with super-gluing the seams in place and putting the cubes back in horizontal orientation.  However, I still can't give this product 5 stars because nowhere on the product instructions does it state that these cubes must be used in vertical orientation only.  Something like this warrants a very clear warning on the package or in the manual/instructions, given that the cubes virtually fall apart if placed horizontally.  Had I known this up-front, I wouldn't have purchased the Storage Cube Plus in the first place.Customer Service: AUpdated Product Grade: B","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM53OMWH29RB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00284AA9C#wasThisHelpful","RM53OMWH29RB6","A8PP8NPRJSAKO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8PP8NPRJSAKO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My almost-3 year-old adores Disney's princess Jasmine, and would walk around our house with blankets on her head pretending they were ""Jasmine's hair.""  So I figured she might like this Jasmine Costume Wig.  To say she adores it would be putting it mildly!  She can now act out all her favorite scenes from the ""Aladdin"" story/movie, starring herself as Jasmine.  So why, then, did I give this item only 2 stars?  Firstly, this wig is really hard to put on and keep on.  Every couple of minutes, my little-one has to stop and ask me to fix the wig because it's slid off her head.  (My daughter has very curly hair that's not especially slippery at all).  What's more, the elastic band around your head that's supposed to keep the wig on is very small.  The product states that it's for kids 3+, but my daughter isn't quite 3 yet, and the elastic band feels too small (or the band is poorly constructed and can't hold the wig in place).  I can't see the wig elastic comfortably fitting a child over 4 years-old.  Secondly, this wig is very flimsy, especially since it's geared to (small) children.  Within minutes of my daughter first putting it on, ""hair"" was already coming loose from the jeweled headband, and she wasn't being especially hard on it.  This is definitely not an item that I expect to survive the rigors of preschooler play.Grade: C-","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BXPW3SASPUF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005RRMWE8#wasThisHelpful","R1BXPW3SASPUF4","A8PP8NPRJSAKO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8PP8NPRJSAKO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These sandals are very attractive and comfortable-looking.  The lilac color is a refreshing departure from the usual pink-for-girls, and the glittery bow detail at the front is adorable.  It also gives the sandals a dressier look, so they go equally well with play clothes or a party dress.  The foot-bed is cushioned and the sole is flexible, making the shoes comfy and appropriate for toddlers' and preschoolers' developing feet.Unfortunately, my 2 year-old girl didn't like these sandals.  Apparently, she prefers closed-toe sandals because she feels like her toes are more protected.  (I actually like them as well because stubbed toes are a common occurrence during preschool play!)  She tried these Meredith sandals on for about 30 seconds, and then took them off and asked me to ""send them back.""

"I usually try to steer clear of products that contain chemicals, so I should've gone with my first instincts and passed on the pottyPod when I read that it contains an ""antimicrobial additive.""  Although antimicrobial substances are usually added to products with the best of intentions (e.g., to kill germs and prevent odors), most of them are chemicals with very questionable toxicity and side-effects.  When I first researched the pottyPOD, I actually called the manufacturer's Customer Service line to ask what kind of plastic the soft seat is made of, and what type of antimicrobial agent is in it.  The rep was happy to inform me that the soft part of the potty seat is made of high-density polyurethane foam, but she was tight-lipped about the antimicrobial additive, stating that that info was ""proprietary.""  By that point, I'd already ordered the pottyPod, but I should've cancelled the order after my conversation with Prince Lionheart Customer Service.  Instead, I decided to wait and check out the actual item ""in person"" before deciding whether to keep it or not.As it turned out, that was not the wisest decision on my part!  As soon as I opened the box in which the pottyPOD was packed, my nose was immediately assaulted by a strong chemical smell.  It was coming from the soft part of the potty seat.  I couldn't tell whether the source of the fumes was the polyurethane foam itself, or the anti-microbial additive, but either way, I was past the point of caring.  Nothing that smelled that bad was ever getting near my preschooler's bare bum!  In addition, the so-called soft, comfortable seat is actually not that cushy.  It looks and feels almost like a gel seat made out of extremely compressed foam, which is only about 1/4-inch thick.  Honestly, I can't see it doing much to ease the discomfort if your little-one needs to sit on the potty for more than a couple of minutes.  The pottyPod is definitely being returned.  (The only reason this potty got 2 stars instead of 1 was that it's height-adjustable, which makes it good for taller/older toddlers and preschoolers).Grade: D","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GCS141Y76R66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ZBHYG2#wasThisHelpful","R3GCS141Y76R66","A8PP8NPRJSAKO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8PP8NPRJSAKO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although Nelson's brands itself as a maker of ""all-natural"" products, their sting gel is definitely not so.  The active ingredients are naturally-derived, but the inactive ingredients are certainly not.  The last time I checked, methylparaben (one of the inactive ingredients in this sting gel), was an artificial chemical of questionable toxicity.Unfortunately, by the time I needed to use the sting gel and read the list of ingredients, it was too late to return the product.

"These Blueberry Training Pants are very well-made and comfortable.  My 2 year-old daughter likes wearing them, the plush cotton velour lining feels good against her skin, and the leg openings fit snugly against her thighs without being too tight.  (The material of the piping is soft so it doesn't dig into my little-ones thighs or waist).  In all, these underpants can be a decent potty training aid, if you're aware of their limitations.  Most importantly, these Blueberry Training Pants are NOT TOTALLY WATERPROOF!  (The product description from the manufacturer is very clear about this).  They contain a hidden polyester panel, which is water-resistant, but not waterproof.  So they will temporarily contain a small accident, and prevent a cascade of urine from running down your child's legs if they're standing up.  However, after a couple of minutes, the fluid will leak through the underpants and onto your child's clothing or whatever they happen to be sitting on.Therefore, Blueberry Training Pants are best suited to a child who is almost fully potty trained, and who only has occasional, small accidents.  However Blueberry Training Pants would probably not be a good fit for your child: (1) if your little-one has just started potty training (and still has frequent accidents or is a heavy wetter); (2) you're taking a long trip or are someplace where frequent bathroom access isn't possible; (3) if you're looking for leak-proof underwear for daytime naps or nighttime sleep.  If you need to prevent moisture from seeping through these training pants, I've found that a good work-around is to pair them with a waterproof diaper cover or shell.  We like the Waterproof Pull On Pants Potty Scotty/PottyPatty, Large.  They're made of waterproof nylon (rather than toxic PVC/vinyl), and they're very thin, so they add waterproofing to any training pants without adding bulk.  If you're looking for a one-stop potty training solution that's completely waterproof (without having to buy 2 separate products), then I would recommend Super Undies Pull-On Potty Training Pant (Medium, The Cupcake Queen), Best Bottom Potty Training Kit (XL/5T, Coconut), or Mumtaz Soakers Nighttime Fully Waterproof Training Pants (available on E T S Y).The main reason I deducted one star from my rating was not because Blueberry training pants aren't completely waterproof, but because they're expensive for non-leak-proof underpants.

"Ever since my now 2 year-old daughter was about 18 months old, she has been a heavy overnight wetter.  So much so that she would wake up with wet pajamas and crib sheets 4-5 times per week.  We tried going up a size in her Earth's Best diapers for nighttime, and we even tried the 7th Generation Overnight Diapers, but she would still wake up with wet clothes at least 3 times per week.  A friend of mine suggested I try diaper booster pads to absorb the excess overnight wetness.  At first I tried the Select Kids Booster Pads Diaper Doubler Pack/30, but because they didn't have an adhesive strip to hold them in place, they would slide around inside my daughter's diaper (especially with her wiggling around during diaper changes), and move away from where I needed them to be for maximum absorption.  Then I found these NorthShore Disposable Baby Diaper Doubler pads.  These booster pads have an adhesive strip along the length of the pad, so you can stick the pad firmly in your child's diaper and it won't slide out of place.  It looks sort of like an old-fashioned maxi pad, except that the booster pad allows excess wetness to flow through the pad and into your baby's diaper, whereas maxi pads have a plastic backing that prevents fluid from flowing through to underwear.  (FYI: I wouldn't recommend using a maxi pad as a diaper booster because the moisture-proof backing causes excess urine to spill out of the sides of your little-one's diaper instead of flowing through to the absorbent diaper beneath).  The NorthShore booster pads are fairly thin without sacrificing absorbency, so they don't bunch up between baby's legs even when wet.  And the fact that they're individually wrapped means that they're easy to toss into a diaper bag or suitcase for overnight trips away from home without getting crushed or misshapen.There are 2 caveats that prevent me from giving this product 4 or 5 stars:1.  Although this product is called a ""Baby Diaper Doubler"" here on Amazon, the actual product packing itself doesn't say anything at all about it being for babies.  It's simply called a ""Booster Pad,"" and the ""X-Small"" size happens to be small enough to fit babies/toddlers.  Presumably, the larger sizes are designed to fit older children, adults and senior citizens who suffer from incontinence and need extra absorbency in their diapers.  I'm usually wary about using ""non-baby"" products on babies because products designed for babies tend to be milder and use fewer harsh chemicals.  However, at the time I bought these, I couldn't find any other comparable baby-friendly diaper booster pads on the market, so I decided to give these a try.2.  When my daughter has had an exceptionally wet night, the NorthShore booster pads leave little gel beads on her skin.  Manufacturers of conventional diapers and booster pads claim that these super-absorbent polymer gels are safe and non-toxic, but they still make me uneasy since they're synthetic/artificial materials with mysterious ingredients manufactured in a lab rather than by nature.  Therefore, when my current pack of these NorthShore booster pads is finished, I'm going to try the Flip Inserts: Disposable - 18 pack, which contain more natural materials.Grade: B-","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G9EEZ9UYJ1KT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A7V9080#wasThisHelpful","R1G9EEZ9UYJ1KT","A8PP8NPRJSAKO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8PP8NPRJSAKO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this cup so I could insert a picture of my 2 year-old daughter's favorite cartoon characters, in order to entice her to drink her milk from a straw cup instead of her soft-spout sippy-cup.  The first thing I did upon receiving this product was check the packaging to see whether the plastic cup was BPA-free.  There was no mention of this cup being BPA-free on the packaging, and I couldn't find a recycle code/number on the bottom of the cup.  (Recycle code ""7"" often identifies polycarbonate plastic, the worst culprit for containing BPA).  This cup was discontinued by Playtex a few years ago, before parents and the general public became fully aware of the dangers of exposing babies and young children to BPA.  Plus the product packaging seemed a bit dated, so I figured that there was a good chance this cup contained BPA.  It just wasn't worth the risk to me, so I returned the cup.

"I had high hopes for these Britax EZ-Cling Sun Shades because my 2 year-old had started pulling off the conventional roller/suction-cup shades that we'd been using since she was born.  Unfortunately, however, the Britax EZ Cling shades were no match for the scorching temperatures (over 90-degrees Fahrenheit) or intense, direct sunlight of Southern California.  I parked in an outdoor parking lot around midday while my daughter and I went grocery shopping, and by the time we returned to the car 45 minutes later, the clear plastic film on the back of the shade had started peeling away from the car window glass.  Naturally, my daughter noticed this and proceeded to pull the shade the rest of the way off.The EZ-Cling Shades also had a very strong chemical odor when I removed them from the packaging.  Before buying this item, I actually emailed Britax Customer Service and asked whether the product contained any PVC, phthalates or lead.  I received a very delayed response (only after I called Britax's corporate office to complain) stating that all of Britax's products are free of phthalates and lead.  However, I have a hard time believing that this product is phthalate-free given its strong ""plasticky"" smell.  (Perhaps it was one of the many other scary chemicals in PVC).  Within 2 minutes of installing one of these window shades in my SUV, the whole car smelled like a chemical factory!  I probably would have ended up returning the product because of its odor even if it had stayed put on my car window, so I suppose it's just as well.Grade: D","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20L2I12JC7MVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ZVV0NO#wasThisHelpful","R20L2I12JC7MVG","A8PP8NPRJSAKO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8PP8NPRJSAKO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lately, my 2 year-old has started getting a kick out of trying to yank the suction-cup sun shade off the window next to her car seat.  (I had to use all 3 suction cups because the clips that came with the shade were too thick to allow the automatic car window to close).  I tried both the Munchkin and Safety 1st car window shades, and the suction cups either gave way when my daughter tugged them (causing the shade to fall off entirely), or she ripped the material around the bottom suction cup completely off and bent the wire towards her face (which scared me half to death!). So I began searching for alternatives to the conventional 3-suction-cup car window shades.  First, I tried the Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black, but the edges of the shade began to peel away from the car window in the scorching L.A. summer temperatures, and my daughter pulled it the rest of the way off.  I didn't want to try the dark-tinted window film because unless you're a professional window tint installer (which I'm not) you inevitably end up with unsightly ""bubbles"" between the film and the window glass, and on top of that, the film often makes it hard to roll the windows up or down.Desperate to find a workable window shade to protect my toddler from the strong L.A. sun, I did the broadest search I could think of on Amazon, and luckily, I found the Brica Smart Shade.  (I ended up buying it from a local brick-and-mortar retailer).  Because this window shade rolls up rather than down, there's no suction-cup within my little-one's reach, and the shade's roller is housed in a hard plastic casing that also makes it (toddler) tamper-proof.  That plastic casing has 2 tabs that snap securely between the window glass and the door (interior), keeping the base of the shade flush against the car door/window sill.  Then you pull up on an extremely thin but sturdy metal (not plastic) clip to unroll/extend the shade and then slip the clip over the top of the window glass.  Unlike the plastic window clips that come with most of the 3-suction-cup window shades, the metal clip on the Brica Smart Shade has such a low profile that the window rolls up easily and closes completely with the clip on.  I never roll the rear windows of my SUV down more than a couple of inches, so I can't speak to how easy it is to roll the window completely down with the Smart Shade on, but it was easy for me to crack open the car window.  And I like that the Smart Shade gives me the option to roll the shade down when I'm driving the car at night, without having to remove the shade entirely (which is a real inconvenience with the cling-type shades).The only reason I deducted a star from my rating of the Smart Shade is that it did have a bit of a ""plasticky"" smell when I first unpacked it from the box and unrolled the shade.  The product packaging doesn't say what material the shade is made of, but based on the smell, I think it contains some level of PVC.  PVC typically contains some pretty suspect chemicals, including phthalates, so we try to avoid exposing our little-one to it as much as possible.  But since the vast majority of the car shades sold at retail contain PVC, I'd rather risk a bit of PVC exposure over sun exposure -- and possible skin cancer -- any day.  (Plus, my car itself contains quite a bit of PVC/vinyl, so you pick your battles!).  I put the Smart Shade out on my patio to off-gas in the sun for several hours, which reduced the smell to tolerable levels.Other than the chemical smell, this product has performed as expected, and was exactly the toddler-proof car sun-protection solution I was looking for.Grade: B+","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MVZ98NTLJC08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CXVI4M0#wasThisHelpful","R2MVZ98NTLJC08","A8PP8NPRJSAKO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8PP8NPRJSAKO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this Boppy Shopping Cart Cover to replace a lost Floppy Seat Ez Carry Shopping Cart and High Chair Cover, Blue ABC. I didn't want to spend another forty-something dollars to get another Floppy Cover, so I opted for the Boppy brand, which was substantially cheaper.  Unfortunately, this turned out to be another case of ""you get what you pay for.""  The back side of this shopping cart cover is made of a smooth, nylon rip-stop fabric that's extremely slippery; plus, there's no snug-fitting elastic or fabric ties to secure the cover to the shopping cart.  As a result, it's extremely easy for my 2 year-old to pull the cover off the shopping cart handle and sides, exposing the germy surfaces I don't want her to touch.  The only thing attaching the cover to the shopping cart seat is the child safety belt, but that only takes care of 1 of the 4 sides of the cover.  The other 3 sides of the cover easily slide off the shopping cart seat on their own, or with the ""help"" of the curious hands of a toddler/preschooler.  Since the purpose of a shopping cart cover is to serve as a barrier between your child and the dirty surfaces of a shopping cart seat, this product is virtually useless.

"A well-intentioned friend bought these Dappi waterproof pants for me when I mentioned that we were about to embark on potty training my 2 year-old.  I was immediately suspicious when I opened the gift wrapping and saw that these were ""vinyl"" pants, and when I cracked open the packaging, the strong chemical smell confirmed my suspicions.  These pants are made of PVC (aka, vinyl), which usually contains harmful phthalates and sometimes even lead!

I used this product twice, and both times, I was extremely unhappy with it.  It completely dried out my hair and made it ""crispy"" to the touch and very frizzy.  Plus, despite the fact that the product claims to be ""natural,"" it had an unpleasant chemical smell that hung around for hours after I initially sprayed it on. The smell irritated me so much that I ended up washing my hair at night just before bed, which I normally don't do because I don't like going to sleep with wet hair. But that's how much the scent of this product bothered me.Needless to say, this product quickly ended up in my trash can.

"I bought this Munchkin Folding Step Stool for my 2 year-old to use in our small kitchen, so she could ""help"" mommy and daddy with small tasks like washing dishes, rolling cookie dough, etc.  Because our kitchen is short on space, I was really attracted to the folding feature of this stool, since I thought it could be folded flat and stowed out-of-the-way between uses.  Though this stool is no doubt sturdy and skid-proof, it is, unfortunately, also extremely difficult to close.  Folding this step stool is a two-person job (at least in our household!), because it requires 4 hands: 2 to hold the 2 spring-loaded buttons that trigger the folding mechanism, and 2 to fold in the sides of the stool.  And even then, it makes a disturbing, grinding noise.  Finally, perhaps we have exceptionally high kitchen counters, but this step-stool was too short to enable my 35-inch tall daughter to reach the counter.  When she's on this step-stool, the edge of the kitchen counter touches her nose, so she isn't high enough to perform any tasks on the counter or to have a proper view of what's going on there.If you don't need to fold your step stool often or at all, then this Munchkin step stool is a good bet.  But look elsewhere if (like me), the folding feature is important to you.  There has to be a better way to make a step stool that's difficult for toddlers to open/close, without also stumping adults!

"After striking out with the pediped Grip Nikki Sandal (Toddler), I decided to give these Pediped Flex Vivian sandals a try since my 2 year-old still needed a pair of sandals for the summer, and we like the brand in general.  Unlike the size 7 Nikki sandals, which were too long and ill-fitting, these Vivian size 7 sandals fit my little girl right out of the box.  In less than 10 seconds, she was off and running, with none of the tripping/falling that we'd experienced with the other sandals.  The Vivians are super-cute and go well with a variety of outfits.  The three crystals are securely sewed into the front center strap of each sandal, so I'm not concerned that my toddler could pull them out.  And each crystal has a silver glitter border, which gives the sandals a nice, extra dash of pizzazz.  Perfect for dressing up or dressing down.

"I purchased this LeapFrog Touch Magic Discovery Town for my daughter's second birthday.  She's always trying to get her hands on Mommy's iPad, so I thought she'd like the touchscreen aspect of this toy.  However, she grew bored with it after about 5 minutes. Not that I could blame her.  There's really not that much to this toy, especially given what it costs.  If you tap a few areas on either of the 2 pages, the toy's computer-voice tells you what you're touching, and then plays the sound it makes.  (There's also an option to play a very limited selection of music).  That's about it.  What's more, this toy also frustrated my daughter because the touchscreen function isn't very sensitive.  In fact, it took me a few tries at pressing pretty hard to get some of the touchscreen items to respond!  Plus, there were many other pictures on the screen that my toddler kept wanting to press in order to hear the voice/sounds, and she was very disappointed when she would press a picture and nothing happened.  And, as you might imagine, it was impossible to explain to a 2 year-old why she would get the voice/sounds when she pressed one picture, but nothing when she pressed another picture.

But, I tried 3 different soaps and never got a single hint of suds. I purchased this soap cannon hoping it would fit and work. The Ryobi has a quick disconnect for the 1/4 inch adapter that comes with the cannon, so install was easy. I tried it yesterday and was blown away by the amount of suds that covered the cars. I initially had it on the maximum soap setting and got a very thick layer of suds that completely coated every inch of what ever I pointed at. I adjusted the soap level to minimum and still got great coverage. I used Chemical Guys Max Suds II and got excellent cleaning and shine results. After sudsing the cars, I popped the cannon off the wand and replaced the stock Ryobi multi-function head, then powered the suds away. I'd highly recommend this product for anyone who has a pressure washer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FN6T7WUDHOQS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BCH4PLA#wasThisHelpful","R3FN6T7WUDHOQS","A1P4XD7IORSEFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P4XD7IORSEFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nice product, but my only complaint would be that everything is a little small. My cat is a 6 month old kitten, and he barely fits in the little house, and hes already too big for the hammock.The Cat Tree has lots of nice scratching posts, and lots of places for kitty to sit. I was hoping the tree would keep him from climbing on other furniture, but its become his launching pad to other furniture.The Cat Tree is covered in a very soft fake fur, or sisal rope for scratching, and has quite a large foot print. The tree is a little wobbly no matter how much you tighten the components, but it would really take some doing to topple it over.The worst part of this Cat Tree is the directions; they are horrible. Some reviewers have stated not to start from the top, as stated in the directions, but to start from the bottom; that would be a mistake. If you start from the bottom and work up, you will not be able to secure the top shelf to the unit. You must start from the top and work down. Believe me, I tried to assemble the tree as recommended by some of the reviewers, and ended up having to take it apart and start over.This is a nice tree if you have the space, and the cat loves it, so I would definitely recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NQ2LU6EC99HS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XY25OK2#wasThisHelpful","R2NQ2LU6EC99HS","A1437CAM9CNC1E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1437CAM9CNC1E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The device lets you know when its placed in the best location, for best coverage, and performance. Now my Wi-Fi coverage is as strong in my basement, as it is in my office. My coverage also now extends to my back yard. The Wi-Fi extender comes with dual band coverage, so you can connect your devices on both the 2.4 GHz and the 5 GHz bands.This is a great gadget, and really a necessity if you want flawless coverage throughout your home. This Amped Wireless TITAN-EX, High Power AC1900 Wi-Fi Range Extender is not a plug into the wall style extender, and you will need a flat surface to put the device on. The TITAN does not have a small footprint, so hiding it is a little difficult.The device has four high gain, dual band antennas screwed into the back of the device, and does resemble a router. It comes equipped with a 1 GHz dual-core processor, 14 high-powered amplifiers, 4 high-gain antennas, and 5 gigabit Ethernet ports to plug in your TV or game console or other devices. This is a great solution for homes with multiple users accessing the Internet at the same time.The device works great, the speed is excellent and set up could not be easier.

"The Black & Decker D3040 Allure Digital Iron is a nice iron, but not a great iron. Some reviewers thought the iron was light weight, but I think it is very heavy for the size of the sole plate.

The iron does produce a good volume of steam which I like, but it also spits, which I don't like.Don't get too excited about the digital component, the iron uses a light to select the temperature setting; no big whoop.I do like the rotating cord, which helps keep your cord out of the way.The iron heats evenly, and works very well. Not the best iron I've ever used, but certainly not the worst.If you like a substantial iron with some weight to it, and you don't mind a little spit, this could be the iron for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12J9ZR2PI48KY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5ILE2W#wasThisHelpful","R12J9ZR2PI48KY","A1437CAM9CNC1E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1437CAM9CNC1E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love Invicta watches. I have had an Invicta watch for a few years now, and it is the best watch I have ever owned. Invicta makes a quality product, which you can see and feel, as soon as you pick up the watch.There are no cheap watch bands, or clasps on these watches, and the weight and feel of the watch is wonderful. The only problem I have with this watch, is that it is VERY masculine looking on your wrist. It is a beautiful watch, but it looks like you are wearing a man's watch, which is not really my style.I do like the larger faced sports watches, because they are much easier to read, but the combination of size, and styling on this watch makes it look like a mans watch.One reviewer stated her Invicta Women's 21494 Wildflower Analog watch had luminous hands, but my watch did not come with this feature.If you want a top quality watch, buy and Invicta, but if you're looking for a watch that appears a little more feminine, you might want to choose another style.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXETETWMLWP14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01487Y82G#wasThisHelpful","RXETETWMLWP14","A1437CAM9CNC1E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1437CAM9CNC1E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow! This is an incredible piece of electronics, with outstanding sound, but not for the faint of heart. This Yamaha YSP-1600 MusicCast Sound Bar can do so many things I haven't had a chance to try them all.  This sound bar allows you to stream music from free and subscription-based services like Pandora, Rhapsody, and Spotify Connect. Using the free MusicCast app, you can control playback from your Android or iOS smart device.  I am using this sound bar for my flat screen TV, and let me say again the sound is amazing. The MusicCast sound bar operates on your wireless system and will support 10 zones. It's AMAZING! The only con I see is the price, $499.95. Ouch! That is a real commitment price.

"This Black & Decker 16"" corded chainsaw is the perfect tool for use around the yard. My guess is it would struggle to cut through anything big that came down in the yard, but it certainly works great for all the smaller cleanup. The CS1216 only weighs 10 pounds, which makes it a chainsaw you can actually handle without being a professional.The chainsaw does arrive needing to be assembled, but it is a no tool assembly, that went together with no problems, in very little time. I like that the CS1216 has a clear view oil monitor; no more running dry, or stopping to check the oil level.The most important thing to me, is that the chainsaw cuts very well, very smooth, without a lot of kickback, which makes it easy to control. I would definitely recommend this chainsaw for small to medium cleanup around the yard.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WWJRLLKFB39I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TJ3FBOY#wasThisHelpful","R1WWJRLLKFB39I","A1437CAM9CNC1E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1437CAM9CNC1E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of the most difficult reviews I've had to write. I am so torn about whether I really like this laptop, or not. I've been using this Toshiba Satellite C55-C5241 for two weeks. Performance wise, I have had very few issues with it. When I first started using the laptop, it would freeze up, and I would have to reboot. Fortunately, that issue appears  to have corrected itself, and is now operating perfectly.The laptop is speedy, but as you would expect for the money, it is a basic model. My real complaints are with the keyboard, and housing. I've never had a laptop that came in a plastic housing; it's like playing with a Fisher Price toy. The keyboard is very soft, and the track pad is challenging. It's really hard to believe that this laptop will last for any length of time. But to be fair, considering the price point on this laptop, it has a lot going for it, and I have not seen anything that can equal it.

"Remington D8700 TStudio PROtect Dryer is an Ionic ceramic conditioning dryer. The dryer comes with a replaceable conditioning ring, which I have never seen before. I have been a fan of Ionic dryers for some time, and the Remington D8700 is a very good choice. This is an 1875 watt dryer, so drying time is much quicker, which will help decrease hair damage. The dryer has 3 heat and 2 speed settings, and a cool shot button.  Most good hair dryers come standard with these features. The dryer also comes with a variety of tools, such as a diffuser, concentrator, and a micro conditioning hair brush.My hair dried very fast for a humid day, and my hair had a nice shine when I finished.

If I find a hair dryer that works well and lasts, I usually stick with it.I have a Babyliss Pro hair dryer right now that I just love, but this Remington might just take its place. The Remington is a lightweight, easy to use and handle dryer, which dried my hair much faster in humid weather.

This case not only adds to the bulk of the phone, but to the weight. Because of the battery charger, which is a really nice feature, it almost doubles the weight of the phone, and adds an additional 2 inches in length. The case certainly has some very nice features. I love the blue color of the case, and it is very well made. The camera shutter is a nice feature if youre afraid someone will hack into your phone.

I asked why they wanted my SSN, and I was met with a suspicious look that said ""He's up to something!"" followed by a lame explanation of why they wanted it and what they would do with it. Sadly, it took the investigation into the logistics behind the 9/11 attacks to bring to the forefront issues like identity theft, promiscuous use of identification such as the SSN, and other matters related to privacy. But even now inquiring why your SSN is being requested can put you in the category of ""trouble-makers.""Today, awareness of one's privacy (or lack thereof) is more important than ever. To many people, it seems like an unreachable goal, or something that is too hard to achieve and so not worth bothering with. This book breaks it down into digestible pieces that will help you bolster your privacy no matter what level of technical knowledge you already possess. Rob Robideau provides guidance for the novice and the expert alike. In an age when many people are cranking out horrible snake oil meant to cash in on the privacy craze without really helping anyone, Robideau writes clearly and concisely, bringing his advice to life with real-world examples of the issues at hand, how to implement solutions for them, and how doing so will benefit you. He is someone who obviously cares about the right to privacy and enjoys sharing his experiences and knowledge.The amount of data being harvested every day about you, your habits, your activities is stunning.

"Unintimidated? Scott Walker has some nerve to write a book with that title. Walker is one of the most cowardly politicians I've ever seen. He has surrounded himself with yes men who pat him on the back and encourage his delusional thinking. Reading this book is like a trip to some sort of alternate universe where up is down. He (or whoever ghost-wrote this book) cites many facts and statistics, but if you look closely you can see that they are strung together after the fact to support his already-reached premise. Another item to note is Walker's reliance throughout on the pronoun ""we"" when talking about victories and accomplishments. This mysterious (or perhaps royal) ""we"" further diminishes his credibility. Walker's belief that state-level politics are some sort of bellwether is preposterous, and his over-reliance on straw men (e.g. unions) gets quite tedious after awhile. It's typically shameless of Walker to have something like this published under his name. If you're looking for something that simply re-affirms your point of view, this book is for you.

The author is deservedly known for some rather good books about Abraham Lincoln, but this one seems like it didn't go through the normal editing and fact-checking process. Passages are repeated, the chronology jumps all over and does not flow in anything approaching a linear manner, and some very basic facts (such as who painted the Sistine Chapel) are incorrect. I can't tell whether the author rushed to get this to print in time for the 50th anniversary, or if he is just being sloppy.

"This classic comedy is even better in this much-needed high definition upgrade. Bill Murray, Ted Knight, and Rodney Dangerfield are at the peak of their comedic brilliance in this ensemble tale of a golf resort, a gopher, and...do I really need to recap the plot for you? If you haven't seen Caddyshack before, see it now. And if you have seen it in one of its standard definition or (shock) a pan and scan video release, you need to see this HD version to fully experience the laughter. Even Chevy Chase, who I don't normally care for, is funny in Caddyshack. The quality of this version is significantly better (don't expect Criterion Collection quality, but it's quite good). The colors are better, and the full picture can be seen throughout. And Carl Spackler's bungalow has never looked better. In the immortal words of Jean Paul Sartre, 'Au revoir, gopher'.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E72E14NB90F0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003PJGD5Y#wasThisHelpful","R2E72E14NB90F0","A1Q1WIWSN6LMDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q1WIWSN6LMDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First made available overseas in 1964 as a tribute to our fallen President, it is very nice to see this released domestically on DVD. From inauguration to burial, this film covers JFK's presidency with remarkably high-quality (and often color) footage. His speeches still have an intensely haunting quality to them, nearly fifty years after his death. and the phases of Kennedy's New Frontier are presented more or less sequentially. This was produced not long after Kennedy's assassination, so a certain amount of lionizing is natural. However, the film on balance does a very nice job of capturing JFK's time in office - a time when America's hopes seemed so achievable. Gregory Peck does an excellent job of narrating, and the soundtrack is beautiful. If you are looking for a great primer on the administration of JFK, this is an excellent candidate for the job.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EJC5I7L8XCF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EP10V68#wasThisHelpful","R2EJC5I7L8XCF8","A1Q1WIWSN6LMDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q1WIWSN6LMDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a diamond of a book. And saying that it will change your life is no bit of hyperbole. Chris Hadfield is positively inspired - and inspirational - as he weaves together his life story and the lessons we can learn from his adventures. Hadfield tells his life story not in the traditional, chronological manner but rather by pulling together relevant experiences and thoughts from throughout points in his life to paint a ""big picture"" in every chapter. In doing so, his book is incredibly effective as a motivational guide for life and how to better live it. His opening line: ""The windows of a spaceship casually frame miracles."" gives you a sense of what the book holds and that it is, indeed, something very special.This book, however, is not merely a glossy, feel-good piece of fluff. Hadfield directly addresses life's dark sides too - the chapter on the power of negative thinking is one of the most insightful examinations of the topic I have ever read, while other passages about the space shuttle tragedy and the preparation of ""death plans"" that every astronaut makes prior to going into space are among those that show Hadfield is the real deal when it comes to a thorough examination of life. His voice has a certain authenticity, making you feel as though he is sitting in the chair next to you, reviewing in full detail the experiences he has had - the positive, the negative, and even the mundane - and weaving a portrait for you of your spot in the cosmos.I read this in one sitting, over the course of several hours, interrupted by only my frequent pauses from reading to write notes and questions for review later. Because, in the end, Hadfield never tells us how to live or what we should change. His voice shares his stories, turning them into the bigger pictures, and then it gently prompts us to reflect and ask ourselves questions we have never thought to ask ourselves before. One of the best books I have ever read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I4Z5ZSO9JZ1T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316253014#wasThisHelpful","R1I4Z5ZSO9JZ1T","A1Q1WIWSN6LMDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q1WIWSN6LMDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

After an hour immersed in the book, she marked her spot and offered to let me read it. What a great book! Ever wonder why they are called the Penguins? The humorous explanation is given here. The day that Mario Lemieux brought the team out of bankruptcy is recounted, as well as the day he announced he was returning as a player (""This changes everything"" being the general sentiment after the announcement). Coach Herb Brooks taking on a Colorado television commentator for a verbal cheap shot on one of his players, the (at the time) third longest game in league history and, just a few years later, another marathon overtime game...these stories and so many others are told in this lively book.

"Dropbox brings the ""ease"" of sharing your files in the cloud to Android. But with that ease comes some very significant privacy concerns. Dropbox is a frequent target of malware authors and, due to some of their own lapses in best practices with regard to security and privacy, the group behind Dropbox has at time left themselves (and your data) open to snooping. If you must use a cloud-based file sharing platform, I would recommend a more secure one such as box.com or, at the least, turn on two-factor authentication in Dropbox (it's just one extra step to make your login more secure). Encrypting your files before uploading them to the cloud is also recommended.

"The Metasploit framework is a very powerful set of tools in the right hands. This second edition of the Penetration Testing Cookbook is a timely update to Abhinav Singh's first edition. From configuring your environment whether in Windows, Linux (Ubuntu specifically), BackTrack, or a virtual machine, Singh goes on to expand beyond the basic usage of the Metasploit framework and explores additional tools for port scanning, exploiting browser and/or OS vulnerabilities, and SQL injection. Singh also explores wireless and voice over IP pen testing and social engineering. The wireless and VoIP chapters were pretty interesting, but I found the chapter on social engineering a bit weak and would recommend a book dedicated to that topic in order to really learn more about it. But the core material in this book - using the Metasploit framework to pen test via a number of different attack vectors - is satisfactory. Not ground-breaking, and you may want to start with a more introductory book (or one that is not in the cookbook format) on the Metasploit framework before diving into this cookbook, but if you prefer to jump in and get your hands dirty right away, this is the book for you.This is a good if less than fresh resource...if you are the type of person who benefits from the cookbook format.

"I admit it: I got it wrong in my opinion of Charles Krauthammer. I thought he was just an unoriginal talking head mimicking the latest right-wing rhetoric. After reading this compilation of some three decades of his writing, I see that Krauthammer is a thoughtful intellectual. I may at times disagree with his perspective, but I can absolutely see now how gets to said perspective. The highly personal introduction is fascinating and sets the table for the writings that follow. His sense of humor and his sense of humanity come through in many passages. At times I actually laughed out loud at his writings; at other times I was enthralled by his ability to ""paint with words"" (most noticeably his column of September 12, 2001). Krauthammer is generally not divisive in his politics and, in fact, has evolved some of his beliefs over time as any reasonable person often does. He also has a real knack for taking difficult and at times abstract concepts and boiling them down to a comprehensible essence.

"I really enjoyed this book's activity-based approach to learning. Having read other books in the Head Start series, I was (as usual) impressed with the level of interactivity that the authors' writing style engendered. I've been programming for about 15 years and have read a number of books on programming in that time, and this is one of the most engaging. Very well-paced, and the games programming actually provides an easy entry point into programming non-game Windows apps. In other words, the skills and syntax you learn by creating fun games is portable to other programs you want to create on your own.The book itself is indeed Windows 8 specific. However, the authors have created a PDF of 165 pages that Windows 7 users can download and learn from. The book pretty clearly delineates at which points the reader should flip to the PDF. You don't really end up flipping between the two all that much, and by using this book, the Windows 7 user has a useful book for now and for future upgrades to Win 8. I think that's a great value add.Finally, Head First C# Third Edition is refreshingly free of typographical errors, which (sadly) is quite rare among programming books these days.

"Violent Python is an outstanding book. It is not an introduction to Python, but there are plenty of online resources for learning the basics of Python. This book takes you into places where penetration and vulnerability testing are the norm and thinking creatively (very creatively) is of the utmost importance. You can get up and running in Python fairly easily, and then kick-start your Python adventures with the recipes in this book. The code samples are quite useful, and I especially like the author's approach to each chapter: each one starts off with a story that helps you think of a challenge and how you might approach it. I wish more programming books took this approach as it really helped motivate me to think creatively about each mission.Violent Python will teach you how to perform testing of web sites for security holes and potential vulnerabilities. In this day and age of every company (and governmental agencies for that matter) having a web site but so few of them properly securing their site - and their customers' data - these are valuable skills to possess.There are, sadly, some typographical errors in the book for which I am deducting one star.

"I don't use Facebook very much, so I can only say that from what I've seen, Seesmic for Android does a pretty good job with Facebook. Of course, the official Facebook Android app is so atrocious that a flaming sack of dog feces is preferable. As far as the Twitter functionality of Seesmic, I can definitively say it's great. I've tried a number of different Twitter clients for my Android phone and tablet, and Seesmic was the one I kept coming back to.

"As a Catholic, during the 1980's and 1990's, I always enjoyed hearing some of my fellow Catholics decry Pope John Paul II as being too liberal or making too many changes, while some others decried him as too conservative or too slow to make changes. Such was the nature of John Paul II; as complex as he was intellectual, Wiegel's biography paints a fascinating picture of a man who cannot be easily defined. ""Witness to Hope"" is an intimate portrait, thanks in no small part to the author's access to the pontiff's correspondence with world leaders including Reagan and Gorbachev, and the Pope's active support of this book being written. The book's length is befitting for a Pope who reigned for over 26 years, and it gives a thorough history of Karol Wojyta the man, the priest, the politician, and of course the pontiff. The young Wojyta's experiences in Nazi-occupied Poland are moving, and a pattern later emerges of Wojyta being exceptionally prone to his holy calling: the youngest bishop in Poland becomes an exceptionally young cardinal. That cardinal goes on to become the first non-Italian pope in over four hundred years.John Paul's role in national and world politics was often, at the time, behind the scenes. Wiegel's accounts demonstrate the significant role John Paul played in the collapse of Communism in Poland and, later, across much of Eastern Europe. Ronald Reagan is often credited with being the primary mover behind the seismic changes that occurred, but ""Witness to Hope"" shows the power of the Pope's work to bring down what he saw as a socially unjust system was at least as large (if not larger) a factor. His pastoral trips took John Paul to over one hundred countries, during which he set a number of ""firsts"" (first Papal trips to the UK, Ireland, Mexico, and Haiti, to name a few). Wiegel's biography gives an insider's view of these trips and the diplomacy conducted during them.And setting aside the secular world, we learn of the movements and counter-movements within the Church and John Paul's stewardship of it. As I said at the outset, the complexity and highly-intellectual nature of John Paul's theology does not lend itself to ""liberal"" or ""conservative"" labels. John Paul held his theology independent of such labels and knee-jerk reactions in either direction. In an age of soundbites and simplified, black and white with no shades of grey rhetoric, John Paul rose above the chatter. Over the years, John Paul issued apologies to almost every group that had suffered at the hands of the Church. We are reminded that during his pontificate, relations with other denominations were improved, and the relationship between Catholicism and Judaism improved dramatically. Throughout the Papal portion of ""Witness to Hope"", we see John Paul slowly reforming the Church. The immediacy of Luther is not there, but the cumulative effect is nearly as dramatic.While I was already aware of John Paul's prison visit to Mehmet Ali Agca, the man who attempted to assassinate John Paul in 1981, reading this version of it was even more moving. I almost felt like I was there as John Paul spoke with Agca (though not even Wiegel is privy to what Agca whispered to the Pope).This book seeks to be the definitive biography of John Paul II. It comes very close. Wiegel shows a bias as an American that other authors do not. It is subtle and only displayed a few times, but it slightly downgrades the authoritative nature of the book. Not to such a degree as to reduce this from a five-star rating, just one blemish on an otherwise compelling book. As we approach the canonisation of John Paul next April, I would encourage anyone seeking to really learn (or learn more) about this complex, amazing man to read ""Witness to Hope"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XJN26OZ86XRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060732032#wasThisHelpful","R1XJN26OZ86XRZ","A1Q1WIWSN6LMDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q1WIWSN6LMDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pink Floyd were the soundtrack to my adolescence. I first purchased The Wall on glorious vinyl. Naturally I got the CD when it first came out, and now this amazing box set. As one of the most demanding bands around in terms of sound quality and presentation values, I always respected Pink Floyd (and in particular Roger Waters) for producing consistently high-quality releases. So here we have the Immersion box set of The Wall. Before getting to the discs themselves, I have to note that the packaging is, as always with Floyd, magnificent. Wall-themed items include a scarf, marbles, and coasters, along with a replica concert ticket and backstage pass. An over-sized booklet of drafts of album art as well as photos from the concerts really round out the experience.Onto the music...the show must go on! After getting this box set, I listened to the original album's remaster from ""...we came in?"" to ""Isn't this where..."" The remastered version of the original album is tremendous. David Gilmour's guitar tracks are noticeably improved; in fact, hearing the opening riff of ""In the Flesh"" is stunningly fresh. On ""The Thin Ice"", Nick Mason's drums are much clearer. On other tracks, Roger Waters' thumping bass is solidly enhanced from earlier releases. The vocals of both Waters and Gilmour are crystal clear; Gilmour's soothing singing at the start of ""The Thin Ice"" and Waters' mournful tone during ""Vera Lynn"" are absolutely crisp. And on it goes, providing the same seamless story in a new and improved acoustic package.The demo discs are a treasure trove. On first listen or to the casual observer, the demo tracks might seem short and incoherent. But taken as a whole, they provide amazing insight into how the individual band members experimented with different tones and sounds to create such a seamless piece as The Wall. Gilmour experiments quite a bit over the course of the demos, and Waters plays around with the lyrics to get it ""just right."" I found it quite interesting and enjoyable to hear the songs evolve from demos to rough mixes to the final album versions. Listening to the demos straight through and then listening to the remastered album from start to finish is as the title states and immersion.The live album ""Is There Anybody Out There"" was previously released, but is still a welcome part of the Immersion set. The documentary ""Behind The Wall"" is an interesting watch, giving a much better sense of the extensive work that went on behind the production of The Wall concerts in 1980 and 1981. It's also interesting to compare the travails of those shows to Waters' production of The Wall live in the last couple years. Building the wall in 1980/81 was a tedious and at times dangerous endeavor for the roadies. How far the technology has come. I also enjoyed the footage of the original live opening where other people made to look (somewhat) like the members of Pink Floyd took the stage. Very cool to watch and a brilliant piece of performance art.All in all, the Immersion box set of The Wall is exactly what you would expect: a very well-produced package that does indeed immerse you into the experience of Pink Floyd's The Wall.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP7TKCEI0KUXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ZNAXX2#wasThisHelpful","RP7TKCEI0KUXY","A1Q1WIWSN6LMDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q1WIWSN6LMDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After hearing the first single from this album, I was pretty excited about hearing the rest. Sadly, as with so many other artists, the single is the best cut from the album. On the other tracks, Paul's voice sounds rather ragged. With a few notable exceptions (Willie Nelson, to name perhaps the best example of a voice that seems unchanged from 30 years ago) this happens over time. But other artists of the same era have adapted their singing to better fit their changed vocal range. Not McCartney, unfortunately. When he is not singing in his worn normal range, he is switching to a falsetto that is just as worse for wear. It doesn't work, even with studio vocal overdubbing, and about halfway through the album I found myself getting very depressed.While nothing is as distressingly horrible as ""Freedom"", a few of the songs feel like they are filler. And I remember when McCartney's filler was considered outranking many musicians primary work. Not these toss-offs. Both musically and lyrically, they are just too slapdash for an artist of McCartney's stature. Don't even get me started on the production, I'll just say this: the mixes seem way off on more than one track. I have to agree with others who believe that there is no one around McCartney who has the guys to say ""No"" or ""That really isn't working as well as it could, perhaps we might try this?""I love Paul McCartney, but not this album.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RF6YAS1IZQEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EUS9JF0#wasThisHelpful","R2RF6YAS1IZQEI","A1Q1WIWSN6LMDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q1WIWSN6LMDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really, really enjoyed the storyline and the characters and the sex but......I didn't enjoy the grammatical errors. There were numerous sentences that had words missing. At times the dialogue was very repetitive.  I think this 551 page book could've easily been reduced without compromising any of the storyline.The author, herself, has even posted the following on her website; ""It needs a few tweaks (nothing like hitting the publish button to see the errors you've missed!.)""  Okay, so tweak it.  It needs a lot of tweaks. These ""tweaks"" should've been done prior to publication.  The author is currently working on another book.  I wish she would fix the errors in this and provide a free revision before she continues on in her ventures of writing her next book.  If there is a revision, I will definitely read this book again.There is non-consent / rape (which is different from dubious consent) and bondage / discipline (some readers might see this as abuse) in this book. ""The Dominator"" is not for the faint of heart.  Potential readers should take heed of the note in the book description:  ""Note: This book is for mature audiences only Trigger Warning!

"The author has compiled a review of his own contributions to physics and cosmology.  These include a number of speculative thoughts, including his simple formula for the mass of a wide range of the elementary particles known as Hadrons (i.e. Mesons and Baryons).  This formula for mass=m(n+1/2)137 MeV, where m and n are integers (p.146), is successfully compared with the experimental values of particle masses on pp.148-156.  Apparently this formula has yet to have a large impact on the physics community, as the journal article in which it was introduced has only received 2 citations.  Other speculative theories addressed in this volume include the Feynman-Wheeler treatment of advanced and retarded fields (pp.6-7).It is not clear who is the intended audience for this book--and unlike most books there is no mention of such an audience in the preface.  At the very least the reader would need the equivalent of a B.S. in physics to benefit from this book at all.  Graduate level courses in quantum mechanics  would be necessary to understand many of the topics.  An understanding of quantum field theory would also help the reader in appreciate many of the author's observations.This almost 300-page book is filled with about 1000 equations (i.e. several per page)  and 455 references--but there are no figures--not one--not even a Feynman diagram!  It is almost like a stream of consciousness account of the author's thoughts--which are therefore difficult for the reader to follow.  Nevertheless, this book is appealing to some degree, from the discussion of dark matter (p.28; a topic to which the author seems to have made an important contribution) to an explanation of something as conventional as positively-charged carriers (i.e. holes) in a semiconductor (p.35).  There is an interesting discussion comparing the thoughts of the ancient Greeks on atomic theory and cosmology with that of Vedic India (p.1).  I was also amused by the author's observation that the range of the Yukawa potential for the photon (given the extremely small estimated mass of the photon) is approximately the radius of the universe (p.140).","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S428CNAIFMY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9812812342#wasThisHelpful","R2S428CNAIFMY3","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pretty easy introduction to Spanish that consists of a series of dialogues and vocabulary lists interspersed with brief treatments of grammar.  The dialogues cover many of the basic situations that you might encounter as a tourist, including registering at a hotel, ordering at a restaurant, buying plane and train tickets, and giving a taxi driver the address of your destination.  Visiting the doctor is also addressed by a dialogue.The CD that comes with the book is generally very helpful.  The parts of the book (chiefly dialogues) that are covered by the CD are marked by a CD symbol in the text.  In some cases, however, the dialogues marked as occurring in the CD are not, in fact, on the CD.  The largest oversight of this sort is found on pages 53-60; the six dialogues that appear on these pages would all seem to be on track 5.  Actually these six dialogues do not appear on the CD at all!

"Authors Akire and Rosen provide the reader with very satisfying insights into the origin and evolution of the romance languages.  This book opens with the reduction of the nine-vowel system to the seven-vowel system, using Italian, Spanish, and French as examples (pp.9-15).  With this discussion, the focus continues on these three particular romance languages through the first half of the book.A very interesting example of consonant weakening is seen to correspond to the initial f in Spanish taking on the value of a silent h.  In this way the Latin ferro (iron) transforms into hierro.  This change is explained in terms of the claim that h and f were considered allophones (i.e. variants of the same basic sound) by early Spanish speakers (p.51).French is given as an example of some the most surprising and far-ranging changes.  The palatalized labials via, vie, and bia that terminate Latin words are transformed into ge in French.  In this way serviente (assistant) becomes sergeant and rabia becomes rage (p.71).The authors also provide the solution to a puzzle that had commanded my attention when I first started learning Italian: that of the third person singular and plural endings brought on by the conditional tense.  It is shown that what began in Latin as cantare habebat (would sing) collapses into catarebbe in Italian (pp.171-172).The second half of the book discusses the evolution of Portuguese and Romanian as well as a brief narrative on the emergence of the romance vernaculars.  An index of linguistic terms is also provided.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B1X7CRM5DPL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521717841#wasThisHelpful","R1B1X7CRM5DPL5","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It should also be noted that Falk's work is principally in German, making Straub's treatment of Falk's ideas particularly valuable to the English-speaking world.He sees fit to compile these thoughts into nine chapters, which bear the names of the nine Valkyries:1) Gerhilde: Physics Today: Perspectives2) Ortlinde: Falkian Dynamics: An Introduction3) Waltraute: Motion and Matter4) Schwertleite: Systems and Symmetries5) Helmwige: Barriers and Balances6) Siegrune: Non-equilibrium Processes7) Grimgerde: General Equation of Motion and Its Approximations8) Rossweise: Paradigmata Are the Winners Dogmata9)  Bruenhilde: Gibbs-Falkian ElectromagnetismChapter 1 outlines how the treatment of non-equilibrium phenomena has evolved over time.  The discussion particularly highlights the work of Gibbs on thermodynamics and the claim that his treatment has been erroneously relegated to the realm of thermostatics (pp.19,21).In Chapter 2 the author introduces what Falk calls the Massieu-Gibbs (M-G) functions, in which the four quantities of internal energy (U), volume (V), entropy (S), and number of atoms in the system (n) are expressed in terms of one another (p.39).  A good illustration of Falk's approach is in resolving Gibb's paradox (pp.65-67).Chapter 3 introduces the Euler-Reech Equation, which adds to Gibbs equation for internal energy by including the flow velocity (p.73).  Here it is shown that while the flow velocity is independent of most other thermodynamic variables (e.g. pressure, volume, and entropy), it is not independent of the chemical potential (p.75).Chapter 4 reviews Noethers theorem and phase equilibrium.In Chapter 5 the balance in the title refers to the balance between forces represented by the Gibbs-Euler Functions (GEFs), while the barriers would seem to be those that must be surmounted by phase transformations.Chapter 6 introduces the Dissipation Theorem, which deals with the splitting of the energy flux density (j) into vectors representing the rate of heat transfer (q) and the rate of work (w) (p.173).Chapter 7 deals with models of fluid flow, including the Navier-Stokes equation (p.214).Chapter 8 (written with help from Michael Lauster) addresses more problems in fluid fluid, one of which include a treatment of Lorentz attractors from Chaos theory (p.232).  The authors note that Edward Norton Lorenz, ""the father of chaos theory,"" was a meteorologist interested in climate forecasting.  Accordingly, the authors discuss Lorenz's model of convection between two free surfaces of different temperature, analogous to the situation encountered in modeling weather.Chapter 9 deals with Falks treatment of charge and current densities (p.280)The author also includes an appendix dedicated to a history of atomism that begins with Greek natural philosophy.  Its treatment of Renaissance science mentions a book by Galileo, Il Saggiatore, which introduces a kinetic theory of matter (p.327).  As was the case for some of his other intellectual ventures, Galileos version of kinetic theory attracted the unwanted attention of the Catholic Church.  Apparently many in the Church were concerned that Galileos theories interfered with prevailing notions regarding the substance of the Holy Eucharist.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ALTBD7NQJZ4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0123996090#wasThisHelpful","R1ALTBD7NQJZ4J","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This film chronicles the personal/sex lives of two college best friends and roommates from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. Art Garfunkel plays Sandy, the more shy and reserved of the two, while Jack Nicholson takes on the role of Jonathan, who begins his college years as a sort of lady's man in training.  Their social lives as college students consist of an interesting dynamic, with the two sharing thoughts regarding their romantic dreams, strategies, and conquests.  Jonathan, with his flat-out ambition to get laid at all costs, naturally scores well in advance of Sandy.  On the other hand, Sandy is the first to discover that women are often able to tell you thoughts that you never knew you hada curious milestone that maddeningly eludes Jonathans grasp.As the years go on, Sandy leads a conventional life married to his college sweetheart (Candace Bergen), who he later divorces.  Jonathan, however, seems unable to visualize a life beyond a series of conquestswhile growing increasingly intimidated  (to the point of impotence) by the sexual demands of a new generation of empowered women.  Even Jonathans discovery of a woman endowed with what he considers the ideal physical proportions (as embodied by actress Anne Margaret), ultimately leaves him frustrated and isolated.I am left wondering how Jonathans life would play out if this story were reimagined in todays world with the presence of Viagra and other ED drugs!  My guess is that he would still be frustratedwhile yearning for the invention of a Viagra of the Soul.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BEW613FILXB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MFDP37A#wasThisHelpful","R2BEW613FILXB0","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is of particular interest to me because part of my family were Quakers who founded Philadelphia under the leadership of William Penn.  About 50 years ago my maternal grandfather gave me a copy of a page he had typed that traced our family tree down to John Key, the first child born (in 1682) in William Penn's colony.  My grandfather's record indicated that our Quaker forefather ""lived in cave near the Elm tree where Penn made the treaty with the Indians.""  My grandfather's record also indicated that John Key was buried in Old Kenneth Cemetery.  In addition to reading the information passed onto me by my grandfather, I had read about my ancestor in other books as well as online.  I was interested to find a section in this book entitled ""Cave-born John Key"" in this book (p.40).  In addition, I was interested to see that the author had included an artist's rendering of these caves, which were actually holes dug into the bank of the Delaware River by the first settlers (p.42).  It is also reported by the author that some of these caves or ""grottos"" were abandoned by their original inhabitants as soon as they could build more proper wooden homes.  The caves were then occupied by the next waves of inhabitants who often used them as gambling dens or brothels.  The author indicates that the caves were exposed as veritable dens of iniquity as early as 1685 (p.41)!  Decades later, these caves became basements of stores and houses situated between Front and Water Streets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SZXF3777RP7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609493710#wasThisHelpful","R1SZXF3777RP7C","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Author Steven Brams considers the situations described in the Hebrew Bible (i.e. Old Testament) within the context of game theory.  In doing so, he addresses a number of important questions ranging from the nature of the God of the Hebrew Bible, to the nature of the faith of His worshipers.  The author arrives at a number of interesting conclusions as he unravels the strategies adopted by biblical characters.  One inescapable conclusion is that the Hebrew God, although possibly omnipresent, is not omnipotent--for it is the limited scope of His power that would seem to motivate his full participation in these game-like scenarios.  As for His adherents, the nature of their faith is seen to fall somewhat short of complete and monolithic--indeed it is their doubts that often seem to motivate God to modify his demands in order to better inspire their faith.  The author also goes so far as to consider faith more of a ""dominant"" strategy than a state of mind or quality of soul.  That is, ""being faithful means that one's rational strategy is independent of the strategy of other players"" (p.37).The doubts of the faithful include those of Eve regarding the death that would seem to immediately follow eating fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, as well as the expectation that God would allow Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac to be consummated.  In addition, these doubts are seen to give rise to the counter-arguments that the faithful often direct towards God.  Adam points out that the forbidden fruit seemed less than completely suspect because it came from the hand of Eve--the very helpmate that God fashioned from his own flesh.  As for Cain and his slaying of brother Abel, Cain's somewhat insolent remark that he is not his ""brother's keeper"" is meant to show that the actual ""keeper"" is God, who set up this seminal sibling rivalry by his summary rejection of Cain's offering.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UXWLBLG07UN7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0262523329#wasThisHelpful","R2UXWLBLG07UN7","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As indicated by some of the other reviewers, this book would not be your best choice for beginning New Testament Greek.  The approach of Porter et al. is almost diametrically opposite to that of Dobson's Learn New Testament Greek--where the reader is introduced to NT readings of increasing difficultly, with more grammar added at each stage.  Instead, the approach of Porter et al. is that of discussing the grammar first and then using the understanding of grammar to parse individual sentences--the first parsing of which does not occur until page 42.  Over the course of its more than 400 pages, Porter never exposes the reader to more than one contiguous NT verse at a time.Nevertheless, I find Porter et al. to be useful as a reference, as well as a way to advance my understanding of NT Greek beyond that which I gleaned from Dobson.  I have used Porter et al. to look up a word in the index, locate the chapter in that word occurs, and find the table with the relevant conjugation or declension.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UP6DLP0ZV5BA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802828272#wasThisHelpful","R2UP6DLP0ZV5BA","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I, however, do not want a dual language book, where the original Italian page would be adjacent to page containing its English translation.

"For anyone with some acquaintance with Hebrew and Akkadian, this book is truly wonderful!  As pointed out by the author in the introduction, much more is known about Akkadian than ancient Hebrew--due to the preservation of hundreds of thousand of  Akkadian cuneiform tablets.  It is great fun to peruse this book and look up the Hebrew words you encounter in your reading of biblical Hebrew--as well as to look up words that just pop into your head.  Also included is a lexicon of biblical Aramaic, an index of biblical names, and a list of Akkadian words and their Hebrew equivalents.The discussion of Hebrew in this book is greatly enriched by phrases illustrating Akkadian cognates.  One of the most illuminating and timeless is an Akkadian phrase cited in reference to the Hebrew word for testicle (ishku in Akkadian,p.39): ""if a woman should crush a man's testicle during a quarrel.""  The name for God ""El Shaddai"" is noted as related to the Akkadian word for mountain ""shadu""--suggesting that the name is that of a mountain god.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FV926WENGW47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1602801142#wasThisHelpful","R2FV926WENGW47","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a longstanding interest in Viking-era Norse society, language, and exploration.  I have even gone so far as to read accounts of Viking exploration in the original Old Norse excerpts found in Gordon's book An Introduction to Old Norse.  I was therefore particularly interested in the author's discussion of the Norse colonies In Iceland, Greenland, and North America.  These Norse colonies suffered three different fates.  Iceland proved to be sustainable and exists to this day.  The original Norse colony of Greenland existed from 986 to about 1500.  The North American colony of Vinland might have persisted for a decade in two around 1000 A.D.  It is well-known that Vinland settlers decamped back to Greenland because of hostilities involving the Native Americans they encountered.  The eventual collapse of Norse Greenland is generally traced to the so-called ""Little Ice Age"" that shortened the growing and a grazing seasons to level unable to sustain an agricultural society.  Iceland, of course, was able hang on.The author completes these stories with a number of less-known or rarely-considered observations and factors.  For the case of Greenland, the author points out the incredibly high overhead of maintaining the style of European society favored by its Norse inhabitants.  An enormous amount of resources were devoted to ecclesiastical dictates: from cathedral building way beyond that required for the small 5000 person colony, to tithes--including additional ""tithes"" for supporting the Crusades in the Middle East.  Clearly, Norse Greenland would have done much better to trade for utilitarian goods than for massive stained glass windows and liturgical vestments!  The author also points out that the ability of Iceland to sustain itself was greatly augmented by the recognition of the need to care for the poor soils of their volcanic island.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R287MDN14X193K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143117009#wasThisHelpful","R287MDN14X193K","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The ""dinner"" is for the ants--the ""show"" for you!  Really, this product is worth the price for its entertainment value alone!The main thing that you need to watch for, however, is a factor that other reviewers have mentioned--namely the tendency for the liquid to thicken or harden after 8 hours or more, therefore making it harder for the ants to consume.  So, try not to put more than the ants can eat.  This is hard to judge, of course, since the ants mob the stuff when you first put it out.  Ants often seem to cluster around the hardened liquid--even when fresh liquid is near by, which is another aspect of the problem.  I noticed that one ambitious ant actually cut off a line of the hardened liquid and struggled to drag it back to the nest--a comic possibility that I would never have considered!When I bought this product, we had ants coming into our kitchen though two different doors leading outside.

"This 9""x11"" 111-page book provides the reader with a detailed description of the development and operational capabilities of the famous Me 262 German WW2 jet aircraft.  This discussion of the aircraft is accompanied with a wealth of beautiful photographs and diagrams that really bring the Me 262 to life!Pages 1-13 provide an overview of the aircraft and its place in military aviation history.Pages 14-51 provide a diary of the development of the Me 262 from Messerschmidt ""receiving the first information about turbo-jet propulsion"" in 1937 to its use as a jet fighter in Autumn 1944 to Spring 1945. The initial prototypes are discussed on pp.14-25, beginning in Autumn 1938 and ending on July 18, 1942.  It is interesting to note that the development of the fuselage was completed before that of the wings and jet engines.  A propeller-driven version, the Me 262 V1, was first flight tested on April 18, 1942.  The first jet-propelled Me 262 V1 is tested on March 25, 1942, with the propeller-driven capability retained as a precautionary measure--a fortunate decision, as the BMW P 3302 engines failed immediately after takeoff (p.23)!  The first successful flight under jet power would have to wait until July 18, 1942 (p.25).  The testing of the proper jet-propelled Me 262 is seen to range from Summer 1942 to Summer 1944, with a number of ""setbacks and advances"" (pp.30-51).Pages 51-79 give operational details and a description of the range of armaments and special features available for various Me 262 models.  Of particular interest is a version with a 50 mm canon that projects at least 6 ft. from the nose of the aircraft (p.65)!Pages 80-96 consist mostly of large color photographs of the Me 262, inside and out.  In addition, pp.86-87 span the official colored drawling of the aircraft from the graphics department of Messerschmidt AG, Augsburg (1944).Pages 97-106 describe the production of the Me 262, including the implementation of decentralized production designed to cope with the damage done by Allied bombing.  A complete set of production figures are included (p.106).Pages 107-111 consists of an Appendix that includes the design layout and performance graphs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MJU5AYKBF9CZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0887405169#wasThisHelpful","R1MJU5AYKBF9CZ","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While reading Ingrid Daubechies' Ten Lectures on Wavelets (CBMS-NSF Regional Conference Series in Applied Mathematics) I came upon a reference to Battle's treatment of quantum field theory (QTF), which led me to Battle's treatment of wavelets and renormalization.  Battle divides his book into five chapters.  Chapter 1 (pp.1-104) is a brief introduction to QTF, whereas Chapter 2 (pp.105-178) introduces wavelets.  Chapter 3 (pp.179-280) deals with topics found in solid state physics such as phase transformations, spin systems, and Landau mean field theory.  Chapter 4 (281-400) gets into the real meat of this book and discusses the renormalization group in terms of wavelets.  The final Chapter (Ch.5: pp.401-512) is devoted to Euclidean field theory.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CNKX4SDGOF9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9810226241#wasThisHelpful","R1CNKX4SDGOF9W","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I once had a conversation with Gert Ehrlich regarding the genesis of his research work.  He joked that his career began with research on the tungsten filaments that supported the development of electronic vacuum tube technology at General Electric's flagship research lab in Schenectady NY.  He went on to observe that this research program collapsed into apocalyptic obsolescence with the advent of semiconductor electronics.  This tragic turn of events forced all those whose careers were supported by tungsten-based technology to find another line of work--and thus surface science was born--especially surface science of refractory metal surfaces!  As so Ehrlich and his colleagues streamed out of the sinking ship of Tungsten-bound electronics, manned with the modern techniques of ultra-high vacuum (UHV) learned at the feet of GE luminary Irving Langmuir!  For Ehrlich, his sanctuary was that of the isolated prairie enclave of the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana--where he assumed the position of full professor in 1968.  And so, 40-odd years later, we see what Gert Ehrlich and his colleague Grazyna Antczak have wrought!Although the field ion microscope (FIM) images of atomic configurations are seductively beautiful, the UHV environment necessary for such experiments is a harsh mistress!  Think of the generations of graduate students and post-docs laboring to bake and outgas their UHV FIM systems (a process taking about a week) only to burn out the filament on the first attempt at depositing adatoms on the FIM sample!  Think of the thousands upon thousands of FIM images recorded--and each one just to determine the position of a single diffusing adatom.  Think of all of the patient waiting while the adatom diffuses a few atomic steps while the tip is annealed!  It is intimidating to contemplate the degree of tedious observation, equipment repair, and troubleshooting required for these experiments!Nevertheless, and in spite of the tragedy of wasted youth laboring in Midwestern oblivion, this book is wonderfully beguiling!  The pioneering FIM surface diffusion measurements of Ehrlich and Hudda for the W(211) plane in 1966 were refined over the course of later investigations (p.211-212, ref.82), first by Graham and Ehrlich in 1975 (ref.84) and later by Flahive and Graham in 1980 (ref.85)--with the latter revealing a slight dependence of the activation energy on the width of the plane.  Senft and Ehrlich (pp.124-127, refs.169-171) were even able to show that diffusing adatoms were able to execute acrobatic jumps that actually soared over adjacent surface bonding sites!  John Wrigley (p.29, refs.28,29; p.90, ref.47) even used Rob Chamber's specially-designed atom probe (p.28, ref.27) to discover that diffusing adatoms could exchange with those (of different elemental composition) constituting the surface.The technique of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) invented by Nobel laureates Rohr and Binnig in the the early 1980's were later joined with the FIM techniques developed by Erwin Muller in the mid 1950's to complete this magnum opus.  The authors review of atomic imaging techniques is very comprehensive--they even see fit to observe that an early version of STM was developed by Russ Young in 1972 (pp.31,60, ref.45), a fact that seems generally known to only Young's contemporary fellow scientists at the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) in Gaithersburg MD.One final and ironic observation is that even the semiconductor world eventually looked to the work of Ehrlich and Schwoebel on metallic diffusion near a surface step in order to better understand the growth of electronic device layers.  I feel certain that this book, and the hundred and hundreds of works sited at the end each chapter, will be aggressively mined for the rest of this century and beyond!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC7PQDSEDH7VQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521899834#wasThisHelpful","RC7PQDSEDH7VQ","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As stated by the author in the first sentence of her redoubtable treatise (p.1), ""The wavelet transform is a tool that cuts up data or functions or operators into different frequency components, and then studies each component with a resolution matched to its scale.""  She goes on to trace the evolution of this mathematical tool, that is seen to rely (in the case of Meyer wavelets, p.119) on ""quasi-miraculous cancellations.""  Sigrid Daubechies' contribution was that of developing an algorithm for defining a wavelet function that did not suffer from the drawbacks of previously-defined analytical or digital functions.  Analytical functions, while usually sufficiently smooth, are not truncated in temporal or configuration space--nor are the associated temporal or spacial frequencies commonly accessed by Fourier transforms (p.4).  On the other hand, digital functions such as square waves or step functions (or the Haar wavelet, p.15) are often not sufficiently smooth.  As the author observes on the first line of Chapter 6 (p.167) ""Except for the Haar basis, all examples of orthonormal wavelet bases in the previous chapter consisted of infinitely supported functions.""  Daubechies, however, was able to unravel the Gordian knot by defining discrete/digital wavelets (pp.53-105) that are both sufficiently smooth and naturally truncated or ""compact"" (i.e. ""compactly supported,"" pp.194-199).The author lucidly derives and proves the incredible properties of what have come to be called Daubechies wavelets--thereby convincing the reader that these amazing mathematical entities actually exist!  It is difficult, however, to digest every proof laid out by the author.  I would therefore suggest that the reader begin with the most interesting proofs, which are found in the first section (5.1, pp.127-137) of Chapter 5: ""Orthonormal bases of wavelets and multiresolution analysis.""  The reader should pay particular attention to p.132, which introduces the trigonometric polynomial m0(u), the properties of which are further detailed on pp.155, 168, and 216.For those of us who are not heavily involved in signal and image processing, however, Daubechies' book is a difficult place to begin one's study of wavelets.  A better starting place for the novice would be an introductory textbook such as that of Burrus et al.: Introduction to Wavelets and Wavelet Transforms: A Primer.  In reading Burrus along with Daubechies, however, the reader needs to keep in mind that the two books use different notations for expressing wavelets and scaling functions (Daubechies p.130; Burrus p.15), such that scaling parameter as used in one book's notation is the reciprocal of that defined by the other.A good overview of the field is also provided by Hubbard's The World According to Wavelets: The Story of a Mathematical Technique in the Making, Second Edition.  It is also necessary that the reader have an understanding of Fourier transforms at the level of Bracewell's The Fourier transform and its applications (McGraw-Hill electrical and electronic engineering series).I should also note that Daubechies' subject index spans only two pages--which is not nearly long enough!  The shortcomings of the index and the detailed nature of this monograph limit its usefulness as a reference book.  Therefore, the reader needs to buy his own copy of Daubechies and mark it up to his heart's content, including notes on the title page (and the pages immediately following it) that may supplement the subject index.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UTTAOUXPJB88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0898712742#wasThisHelpful","R2UTTAOUXPJB88","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The authors of this 1994 monograph cite 583 references as they draw on a wide range of research beginning with the 17th century work of Bertolini and Huygens on elastic twinning of calcite (p.66).  The work on calcite interested many researchers in the 19th century, including Brewster (1816), Kelvin, and Voigt (1890).Soviet researcher (and co-author of this book) R. I. Garber was prominent among those advancing this study in the 20th century, especially as he was the first to observe reversible plasticity--using optical microscopy to discover reversible twinning in calcite and sodium nitrate published between 1938 and 1947 (p.68).  Garber also seemed to be the first to observe the petal-like shape of the twinned region (p.69), the profile of which drew the attention of Soviet theoreticians interested in its elastic properties and dislocation theory, including Lifshitz (1948) and this volume's coauthor V. S. Boyko in the 1960's and 70's (Ch.2: pp.23-65).The contributions of modern researchers in Western Europe and American are also covered, including that of Christian, Cottrell, and Frank in the U.K. in the 1950's and 60's.  Clarence ""Marv"" Wayman at the University of Illinois and Greg Olson at MIT used microanalytical techniques with great success in the study of martensitic transformations and the shape memory effect in the 1970's (Ch.5 pp.149-173).  Wayman even went so far to have his own transmission electron microscope for the exclusive use of his group at University of Illinois--an instrument that was never even seen by graduate student electron microscopists outside of his group.  I also recall Professor Wayman demonstrating a heat-engine involving a shape-memory wire moving through an array of pulleys that drew it through a liquid that I assume was held at a temperature different from that of the room.  Greg Olson spent the first part of his career at MIT, receiving his undergraduate degree from MIT in 1970, his Ph.D. in 1974, and then serving as a member of technical staff at MIT until he became a professor at Northwestern in 1988.  When I met Greg Olson in the early 1980's he told me about his use of field ion microscopy in the study of martensite.More recent work includes the study of high-Tc superconducting oxides and metals (a research of area of co-author A. M Kossevich), where the ability to reverse twin formation is expected to reduce the deleterious effect of these twins on superconductivity (pp.254-261).","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GZCY7S2TTMDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0883188694#wasThisHelpful","R1GZCY7S2TTMDR","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author provides the reader with a careful survey of the New Testament writings that have come to represent the life and teachings of Jesus.  In doing so, he asks us to imagine the world that was the source of these writings--one that existed well before modern printing, editing, and journalism.  He makes it clear that the various writers who composed the Gospels, Pauline letters, and so fourth were often unaware of each others writings; while at other times they borrowed from each others work.  The working of these many hands led to various issues becoming clouded.  For example, was the kingdom of God immediately at hand and about to arrive before the last of the disciples died, or was this event to occur in the distant future?  It also seemed that the Pauline letters were written without any knowledge of Jesus' supposed biography.  Such discrepancies are in keeping with the account of a life that is largely legendary--which is the central and well-argued point of the author.The discussion of the Gospel of Mark is of particular interest.  It is generally believed that Mark was written before the other four Gospels, and that the Gospels Matthew and Luke borrowed heavily from Mark.  Therefore, Mark is closer to the origin of the Jesus legend than the other Gospels.  The author views Mark as a literary work where drama is enhanced at the expense of realism.  For example, the disciples are shown as unable to understand Jesus' parables--which made them seem impossibly dull!  This dullness, however, served a dramatic purpose in that they were later able to understand after the Resurrection.  He also observes that some aspects of the Gospel of Mark may reflect the conflict between Christian and Jewish communities during the time that the book was written (70-100 AD?)--rather than the situation characteristic of 30 AD Palestine.  I would also make an additional observation, that the attempt of the gospels to present Christianity as an otherworldly religion that does not challenge Roman temporal power, was meant to aid Christians at the time of the Gospels' composition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23JXJNVNM8EOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812693345#wasThisHelpful","R23JXJNVNM8EOB","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author chooses a sort of winding scenic route through the world of research addressing the possibility of extending human life way past a mere hundred years or so--and appears to seriously consider a lifespan of 500 years or more.  Much of this quest seems to have been spent at the side of British scientist Aubrey de Grey, with almost as much attention spent on de Grey's love of beer and English pubs as anything else.  As the author hangs out with de Grey and other luminaries, he gathers their thoughts regarding what shortcomings of the human body might be corrected in order to greatly increase its lifespan.The author lays out two types of strategy for addressing these issues, with one camp labeled as ""skin-out"" (evolutionary, ecological, and field biologists) and the other as ""skin-in"" (cell and molecular biologists).  ""Skin-out people look at the big picture and skin-in people tend to think about the panorama of history"" (p.176).  Skin-in people look to Darwin for inspiration, while skin-out people look to Watson and Crick.Among the most interesting challenges to longevity mentioned in this book is that associated with the atrophy of mitochondria with age (p.150).  That is, many of the mitochondria in old cells (and old people) loose their ability to manufacture ATP--the main currency of energy in our bodies (pp.75-77).  This is a big problem because every day a person burns through his own body's weight in ATP (p.79).  Unfortunately our body is not always able to detect derelict mitochondria so that they can be disposed of--which only serve to contaminate the cell (p.81).Although the author tells an interesting story about the failure of our bodies with age, and how these failures might be prevented, in the end he does not supply enough detail to satisfy me.  There are no diagrams, for example--or figures of any kind.  The are no charts of the lifespans of animals or cellular entities as functions of various genetic or physiological attributes.  There are no diagrams of mitochondria and the sites that might be damaged by free radicals.  Really, too much time is spent on the personal habits of Aubrey de Grey and not enough on the science.

In place of the government, a number of commercial entities emerge to maintain something resembling order--from local thugs to Fedex and UPS.

"Given the difficulty in defining the path of a particle in quantum physics, a fractal path would seem worth considering.  The fractal formulation is at variance with one alternate formulation of quantum mechanics--that of David Bohm where particles follow the smooth path dictated by Bohm's version of the Schrodinger equation.  On the other hand, a fractal path has much in common with the Feynman path integral of quantum field theory (pp.89-109).There is also a fractal quality to interactions that create electron-positron pairs.  This appearance of electron-hole pairs is consistent with the space-time path of an electron jerking alternately forward and backward in time (pp.106-109), such that the particle going forward in time is an electron, but traveling backward in time is a positron.  The author also points out that the proliferation of Feynman diagrams (and associated virtual particles) needed to describe an interaction suggests the fractal character of quantum electrodynamics (pp.164-171).","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24TTPX3HD7SL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9810208782#wasThisHelpful","R24TTPX3HD7SL4","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author provides a mathematically sophisticated treatment of dislocation stress and strain fields near interfaces in terms of the concepts developed by Lekhnitshkii, Eshelby, and Stroh (LES theory) in the 1950's and 1960s.  The author goes way beyond the derivation and application of the very abstract complex variable based LES theory--he also provides an intuitive motivation for these concepts.  This intuitive treatment is especially valuable for understanding the forces acting on edge dislocations at interfaces (pp.255-273)--which are much more difficult to treat than screw dislocations.Despite my high regard for this book, it does have a few problems--one of which is that some of figures are confusing.  The author has chosen to represent every dislocation in these figures by the symbol that is normally reserved for an edge dislocation with the Burgers vector running from left to right (e.g Fig.3.3, p.78).  In the case where the Burgers vector of an edge dislocation is tilted, the symbol for edge dislocation should also tilt--but the author does not see fit to include the tilt of the symbol in his figures.  What is even more confusing, however, is that the edge dislocation symbol is also used to represent screw dislocations.  As a result, the reader is left wondering regarding the location of the screw dislocation mentioned in the figure caption when only edge dislocation symbols are present in the figure!  So let me just warn the reader that in this book all of the dislocations in the figures are represented by the edge dislocation symbol.As in all books that involve mathematically-intensive theories, there are sections where some of the details are left to references.  Allow me to point out a reference that the reader must go to in order to understand one of the major topics in this book--the configurations of image dislocations at an interface: Ting, J. Mech. Appl. Math. 45, 119 (1992).  Unfortunately, this article is not online and therefore requires the reader's access to the library of a university or research institute.  The author does, nevertheless, devote a great deal of attention to such half-space problems, including those involving the bilateral problem and the position of orientation of the attendant image dislocations (see especially Fig.8.6, p.272).Prof. Ting includes the best treatment of the Lekhnitskii formalism that I have read thus far, with Chapter 4 (pp.118-133) dedicated to this topic.  The derivation of the homogeneous 6-order differential equation (pp.122, Eq.4.3-13) is particularly clear.The author includes an in-depth discussion of Barnett-Lothe tensions and the role of positive-definite matrices in two-dimension deformations of anisotropic elastic bodies (p.192).  In fact an entire chapter (Ch.6: pp.164-200) of this 570-page book is dedicated to the structure and identities of such matrices.  There is also a chapter completely devoted to degenerate matrices (Ch.13: pp.486-496) and to a generalization of the Stroh formalism (Ch.14: pp.497-519).Professor Ting treats a number of the problems in anisotropic elasticity theory in addition to planar half spaces, including curved boundaries (p.353), elliptical boundaries (Ch.10: pp.365-408), cracks or rigid line inclusions (Ch.11: pp.409-439), as well as steady state motion and surface waves (Ch. pp.440-485).  The final chapter (Ch.15, pp.520-536) addresses three-dimensional deformations.  In addition to a useful subject index, the author includes an author index.The author also graciously provides a short biography honoring luminary Allen Neil Stroh (pp.159-161).  Stroh was born in Queenstown, South Africa on April 4, 1926--only two and a half weeks before the birth of Queen Elizabeth (April 21, 1926). He received his secondary education at Queens College (1934-42) and his undergraduate education at Rhodes University College (1943-1947).  He went on to receive his M.S. degree in physics from the University of South Africa.  He received his Ph.D. from University of Bristol in 1953, where he was supervised by the legendary J. D. Eshelby and Sir Neville Mott.  He was DSIR fellow at Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory in 1953, and a lecturer at University of Sheffield from 1954-1958.  He went to MIT in 1958 as a Sloan fellow and became an associate professor of mechanical engineering in 1959.  He went on to accept a position at Boeing Research Labs in Seattle in 1962.

"The authors have assembled a textbook that differs significantly from other books that fall under the title mathematical physics.  Rather than focusing on Bessel functions and spherical harmonics, the authors have penned a survey of classical and modern physics.  Topics covered include Hamiltonian mechanics, coupled oscillators, normal modes, vibrating strings, electromagnetic fields, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, Heisenberg's equations of motion and uncertainty principle, the quantum harmonic oscillator, time-dependent perturbation theory, Fermi's Golden Rule, quantum angular momentum, electron spin, and superconductivity.  Interspersed between these topics are brief introductions to mathematical techniques such as matrices, differential operators, and complex variables.Given the wide range of topics addressed by this book, I have difficulty imagining the course that it might accompany.  Perhaps it might be of greatest value to advanced undergraduate physics majors who might want to look and back and check what they have learned against the contents of this book.I found the treatment of superconductivity the most interesting aspect of this book (pp.357-373).  This authors systematically lead up to their introduction to superconductivity by preceding it with chapters that address the quantum statistics of Cooper pairs (pp.345-355), second quantization (pp.335-343), magnetic susceptibility (pp.307-327), Bose-Einstein condensation (pp.297-305), the free electron gas (pp.283-296), and quantum statistics (pp.273-281).  The authors even briefly address high-temperature superconductors like YCBO.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HA0DPCBSV2CE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=3527408088#wasThisHelpful","R3HA0DPCBSV2CE","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The Schwarz Reflection Theorem is proven using Morera's Theorem (p.43), that if the integral of a function is zero for a closed contour, then that function is analytic.  The authors' lucid proof of the reflection principle relies on imagining a contour that loops around a boundary with an analytic function defined within this contour.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W47YM993KX3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486691934#wasThisHelpful","R2W47YM993KX3P","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most people with a physics degree at least vaguely remember the 1927-1930 gedanken experiment discussed by Bohr and Einstein addressing the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.  This book continues Bohr and Einstein's debate into the present day, or at least up to the publication date of 2007.  Einstein once characterized as ""spooky"" effects that would seem to suggest a transluminal connection between entangled entities, a view which culminated in his formulation of the Einstein, Podolski, and Rosen paradox in 1935 (and which was, in turn, countered by Bohr's own proposals).  Such spooky effects were put on a much firmer foundation by the experiments of Aspect and others in the 1980's, 1990's and early 2000's--to such a an extent that Bohr's views might be regarded as triumphant.  The authors, however, point out the difficulties in accepting Bohr's Copenhagen approach--as well as challenges by alternative views of quantum mechanics which have their root in Einstein's criticisms.The authors address a number of interesting points that I have not seen discussed in my previous readings.  In particular, I am interested in their discussion of quantum coherence issues (pp.303-305).  The authors challenge the view of Joos and Zeh regarding collisions of a wave packet with the bombarding particles and radiation that would seem to pervade any environment.  While Joos and Zeh propose that such collisions limit coherence and therefore wave packet spreading with time, the authors counter that such scattering is not strong enough to introduce significant decoherence.The authors devote a small amount of space (pp.221-246) to Bell's theorem, and even less space (p.231-236) to the actual experimental tests of this theorem.  Unlike other books covering experimental tests of Bell's theorem, there are no figures laying out the positions of the lasers, optical paths, beam splitters, and detectors used in these experiments.  Nevertheless, the compact overview provided by this book is still valuable as it divides the evolution of these empirical tests into a discernible eras.  For example, the need for high efficiency detectors (in successful Bell-type entanglement experiments) was first discussed by Clauser et al. in 1969, although it was not until 1987 that is was realized that this efficiency would need to be at least 84% (p.233).I was also interested in the authors' discussion of David Bohm's relationship with Einstein (pp.196-199).  While at Princeton in the early 1950's, Bohm laid out to Einstein his program for building on the approach of De Broglie and Schrodinger, which led to what is sometimes called ""De Broglie-Bohm"" theory.  Although Bohm seemed to have received some encouragement from Einstein to pursue this path in these conversations, Einstein did not actively promote or explicitly endorse Bohm's theory once he came out with it.  This lack of backing from Einstein was deeply disappointing to Bohm!  Nevertheless, the fact that Einstein did not endorse Bohmian mechanics might be seem as emblematic of Einstein's view of almost all aspects of quantum theory and its interpretation--that of an independent thinker who could never be satisfied with half-baked ideas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SZFT3HOTO2KH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1441924450#wasThisHelpful","R2SZFT3HOTO2KH","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The authors describe the nature of collusion, where a number of individuals or corporations seek to increase profits by agreeing to cooperate rather than compete.  Much of this story is told as a series of vignettes, following the activities of the colluding entities as they secretly work together towards their common goal.One particularly easy to visualize example constructed by the authors is that of a bidding ring consisting of antique dealers who bid on high-end furniture, such as original Chippendale pieces, at estate sales and auctions.  One particularly interesting practice of this bidding ring is that in which only one dealer belonging to the ring places a serious bid at any given time.  That is, the members of the ring never bid against one another--which would drive up the price of the item.  For show, however, the members do bid against one another at early stages of the bidding, but only when the price under consideration is at a ridiculously low level!  Another reason that the members of the ring do not bid against one another is that a series of high ascending bids notifies less well informed auction attendees that the piece under bid is of great value, which provides free information to members outside of the bidding ring--resulting in others bidding higher and driving up the price!  As the dream of the members of the ring is to buy valuable pieces at prices characteristic of neighborhood garage sales, constraining the bidding process is necessary in order to insure large profits.The discussion of bidding rings also provides a good introduction to the concept of the ""square off"" where the members of the bidding ring divide the pieces purchased among themselves after the auction--a process that often consists of a mini-auction that is conducted among the ring members.  In corporate collusion there is also a square off process, though in this case it deals with the problem where one member of a cartel sells more units than has been agreed upon at the outset.  Essentially, the member who has exceeded his sales quota must pay a penalty to the other members of the cartel, or buy units from the other members at a specified price.The authors also address the problem faced by cartels and bidding rings in avoiding government scrutiny, as such collusion activity is illegal.  The members are seen to hammer out their agreements at trade association meetings, the minutes of which are recorded only by an employee (often a lawyer) of the trade association itself--while the cartel members themselves do their best to divorce themselves from the formal proceedings.  It is also interesting that the square off often takes the form of the members of the cartel suing one another--a form of monetary transfer that is more opaque than more direct transactions.  Collusive activities may also avoid government scrutiny by taking the form of constraining product quality rather than constraining price.  In the early 1990's incandescent light manufacturers put this strategy into effect by capping the operating lifetime of each light bulb!The one place where this book falls short is in the mathematical description of competition.  The authors devote a few tables and footnotes to a mathematical description of price competition, so that the derivation of the relevant equations remains almost completely opaque (pp.93-98), even for the simple linear model considered by the authors.  The authors briefly reference about a dozen papers on this topic, with that of Singh and Vives, 1984 (which can be found online as a pdf file) given more attention than the others.  To get some flavor for this class of models, the Wikipedia article on the Cournot pricing model is worth reading, especially as an example of Nash equilibrium.  The model described by Singh and Vives, and that of Cournot, however, only involve two competing entities (i.e the duoloply case).  I have yet to find a paper that treats an arbitrary number of competing entities to my satisfaction.  The case with an arbitrarily large number of players competing for a slice of a given market is central to the collusion process, as the greater the number of players, the more difficult it is maintain the high prices that are the objective of the colluding entities.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXBG1379SDFMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0262525941#wasThisHelpful","RXBG1379SDFMP","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Kramers began his career in physics in as a graduate student at University of Leiden, but left Leiden in 1916 to do his Ph.D. thesis research with Bohr in Copenhagen.  Kramers went to to serve as Bohr's assistant, and later as the vice chairman of Bohr's famous institute for theoretical physics after it was founded in 1921.  Kramers eventually returned to his native Holland to continue his academic career, during which he wrote the original German edition of this book, which was first published in 1933.  In 1957, the English version of Kramer's QM text was published, translated by Kramers' old graduate student D. ted Haar.  As ter Haar's native language was Dutch, he found himself with ""the hazardous task of translating from one foreign language to another.""  Nevertheless, he deemed this to be a worthy undertaking because ""I felt that that this book still represents the best available exposition of quantum theory.""  Although such a bold statement as this might well be challenged, we should be grateful to ter Haar for undertaking this mission and allowing those of us in the English speaking world to get a view of quantum theory from one of Bohr's closest disciples.Kramers' book is admirable for its direct and unassuming explanation of quantum theory and its mathematical formalism, and written in such as way as not to overwhelm the reader.  As stated by Kramers in the preface to his 1933 edition: ""The apparent lack of mathematical models which is contritely pointed out in the text is not exclusively due to the incompetence of the author.  Physical morals, even (or rather especially) in their purest form, that is, unencumbered by pedagogic afterthoughts, do not live happily together with their mathematical relations in the restricted mansion of the human mind--and neither in the restricted volume of a monograph.""  Despite these modest qualifications penned by Kramers, his book manages to address the depth of concept and completeness of mathematic description common to graduate level textbooks on QM, including the derivation of the Dirac equation.  Like Landau and Lifshitz's QM book, however, Kramers book is still sufficiently unencumbered by abstract arguments that it is accessible to advanced undergraduates.  In particular (and also stated in his preface) Kramers avoided reference to group theory in order to make his introduction to QM more approachable.I should also note that Kramers assembled his book in such a way as to highlight the most important aspects of quantum mechanics--and without bothering to look back at earlier contributions that were considered somewhat dated by 1933.  It is particularly noteworthy and laudable that Kramers made no reference to his 1924 work with Bohr and Slater (BKS Theory) that pointed the way to Heisenberg's 1925 work with Born and Jordan on matrix mechanics.  Kramers also avoided any mention of his own independent version of the Dirac equation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18INDW28VKLHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486667723#wasThisHelpful","R18INDW28VKLHI","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Max Dresden, a prominent Dutch-born American theoretical physicist, is the author of this wonderful book--which is a biography of his fellow countryman and theoretical physicist Hendrik Antonie Kramers--as well as a sparkling account of the revolution in early twentieth century physics that led to quantum mechanics.Born in the Dutch city of Rotterdam in 1894, Kramers assumed the nickname ""Hans"" as a boy.  He went on to study physics at the University of Leiden, followed by the unusual step of traveling to Copenhagen in 1916 to convince Denmark's newly-minted first professor of theoretical physics, Niels Bohr, to hire him as an assistant.  In doing so Kramers got in on the ultimate ""ground floor"" of physics, establishing himself as Bohr's first and only assistant--long before Bohr's famous institute was established in 1921.  Kramers continued as Bohr's second-in-command at the institute, or as Wolfgang Pauli later said, ""Bohr is Allah and Kramers is his prophet.""  In his work with Bohr, Kramers played a significant role in the development of quantum theory.  Of particular note is the 1924 paper that Kramers wrote with Bohr and Slater (BKS theory), and which laid much of the groundwork for Werner Heisenberg's 1925 paper that would establish matrix mechanics and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  In 1926 Kramers left Bohr's institute to assume the professorship at University of Utrecht, leaving Heisenberg to assume the position of Bohr's adjutant.I was also interested to learn that Kramers independently discovered what came to be known as the Dirac equation, the development of which was foreshadowed by Kramers discussion with Pauli regarding the possibility of a comprehensive theory that explained the origin of spin.  Sadly for Kramers, however, his version of the Dirac equation was completed only a couple weeks after Dirac's result was published in 1928.  Because he was scooped by Dirac, Kramers did not bother to publish his results, but waited almost another decade before including it as one of the final chapters of a textbook.  Kramers had also done significant work in the development of electron mass renormalization in quantum electrodynamics--results which were hardly noticed by the rest of the physics community until the discovery of the Lamb shift in 1947.  Kramers' efforts in mass renormalization did finally come to light during his participation in the Shelter Island Conference in 1947.  These near misses with respect to achieving a greater level of fame led to some of the great men of physics to describe Kramers' career with certain qualifications.  In discussions stimulated by Kramers' death in 1952, Bohr even went so far as to lament that Kramers was ""without ambition.""In addition to describing Kramers' career in physics, the author comments on the contributions of many other great men in physics.  I was surprised to learn that it was Konrad Lorentz who first recognized the problem of wave packet dispersion when Schrodinger's famous 1926 paper appeared.  It is also interesting that Bohr strongly resisted claims that called for existence of photons.  The author also draws an interesting contrast between the three major research institutes that played the principal roles in the development of quantum mechanics: Copenhagen, Gottingen, and Munich (p.37).  Of course Copenhagen was led by Niels Bohr and was well-known for an informal atmosphere which fostered so many rich collaborations.  A completely different atmosphere was that of Gottingen, with Max Born taking the lead in theoretical physics.  The University of Gottingen was known for its formal and rigorous approach to mathematics as exemplified by David Hilbert, and which Wolfgang Pauli jokingly characterized as ""Gottingen Learnedness.""  Theoretical physics at the University of Munich revolved around Arnold Sommerfeld, who advised such brilliant students as Pauli, Heisenberg, Bethe, and Debye, as well as numerous accomplished post-docs.  Sommerfeld encouraged his students to address concrete problems using a mathematically sophisticated approach, leaving philosophical rumination to Bohr and his associates.The author also devotes ample space to Kramers' personal life as a thoroughly decent man in the most trying of times.  Kramers was one of the 53 professors (out of a total of 56) who resigned from the University of Leiden in March 1940 rather than accept the antisemitic dictates of the occupying Nazi forces (p.499).  While the university was closed Kramers continued to teach in secret, so as to provide for a generation of students who might otherwise be lost.I should also mention that the Max Dresden goes far beyond giving the biographical details of Kramers' life and career.  Ample space and attention are also devoted to a detailed and mathematically complete description of Kramers' contributions to theoretical physics--especially with respect to Bohr-Kramers-Slater Theory and Kramers' renormalization of the electron mass.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXBO3LLJKKEOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1461290872#wasThisHelpful","RXBO3LLJKKEOT","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Kierkegaard advocates a faith of personal commitment where the objective of the adherent may seem outside the dictates of conventional society and logic.  As the exemplar of this faith, Kierkegaard chooses the biblical patriarch Abraham, with the near sacrifice of his beloved son Isaac as the seminal act of faith.  In addition to Abraham's ultimate act of faithful sacrifice, Kierkegaard also considers Luke 14:26, where Christ maintains that his followers must ""hate their father and mother"" in order to properly devote themselves to the mission he lays before them.  In each of these cases, the adherent of the Judeo/Christian faith finds himself in a position that is in many ways contradictory (i.e. to ""hate"" or ""sacrifice"" those who one clearly loves--and in regard to one's parents, those who the fifth of the Ten Commandments requires one to honor).  Kierkegaard also maintains that this version of faith is significantly different from that espoused by other religions.I should note that Islam, the other religious faith that traces itself back to Abraham, assumes an approach that seems to differ from the Judeo/Christian one--and that this different view serves to further illustrate Kierkegaard's thesis.  The Koran also details Abraham's sacrifice of his beloved son, in Surah 37, verses 99-107.  Though in the Koran, the name of the son offered for sacrifice is not explicitly stated.  Given that Isaac is mentioned immediately after the Koranic account of the sacrificial act, in verses 112-113 of Surah 37, it would also seem that it is Isaac who is the son designated for sacrifice.  Nevertheless, according to Islamic tradition, Ishmael, the son of Abraham through Sarah's handmaiden Hagar, is considered the object of the anticipated sacrifice.  Ishmael plays a much larger role in the Islamic faith than in Judeo/Christianity, especially as he is considered the ancestor of the Arab people.The difference between the Islamic view of Abraham's attempted sacrifice of his son, and that of Judeo/Christianity, does not consist merely in whether it was Isaac or Ishmael who was chosen.  In the Koranic version, the son is informed by Abraham of the plan of the divine sacrifice and explicitly agrees to comply.  In Genesis, the plan for sacrifice is strictly between Abraham and God, with Isaac neither informed of their intentions, nor playing any role in the decision making process.  Therefore, the burden of the decision in Genesis is born only by Abraham, which is completely in keeping with Kierkegaard's notion that Abraham's leap of faith is strictly an individual one.  In the Islamic version of this sacrifice, the burden of faith is born by the son as well as by Abraham--and thus is not a completely individual choice.  I should also observe that this sacrificial act is not an obscure event in Islam, but is commemorated by the feast ""Eid al-Adha"" which is one of only two religious holidays in the Islamic calendar (the other being ""Eid al-Fitr"" which marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan).","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4HMHIBUJPGB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140444491#wasThisHelpful","R4HMHIBUJPGB6","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I turned to this book for information on a very specific problem among the many facets of anisotropic elasticity theory addressed by the author: the interaction of a dislocation with a free surface, or with a planar boundary for a layer of different mechanical stiffness.  I had read about the treatment of this problem using Stroh's 2-dimensional dislocation model and analytical continuation in the complex plane in numerous journal articles.  Prior to reading Hwu's rigorous treatment of this problem, however, I did not understand how the authors of these articles used analytic continuation to extract the boundary conditions from the continuity of displacement and stress at the interface.Instead of presenting the boundary conditions as ""obvious"" or as the result of ""standard analytic continuation arguments"" (as indifferently observed by the authors of various journal articles), Hwu clearly explains how Liouville's Theorem (a concept found in all complex analysis books) is used to arrive at the result.  Liouville's Theorem states that a function which is analytic in a given region of the complex plane must also be constant in that region.  Therefore, if a function in a given region is analytic, that region would necessarily be free of singularities/dislocations.  By invoking Liouville's Theorem (p.102, Ch.4), Hwu makes it clear that each side of the interface (i.e. each half-space) may only be represented by a sum of functions that are devoid of singularities.  Thus, if the dislocation is contained in the lower half-space (i.e. half space#1, which is situated below the interface), half-space#1 cannot include the Green's function G(z) corresponding to the dislocation/singularity.  The sum of functions representing the upper half-space (i.e. half-space#2, the which is above the interface), however, may include the Green's function for the dislocation/singularity because the Green's function is finite within half-space#2.  Similarly, the sum of functions representing half-space#2 may not include the Green's function corresponding to the reflection of the singularity/dislocation (i.e (G(z*))*, according the Schwarz reflection principle for harmonic functions).  On the other hand, the sum of functions representing half-space#1 may include (G(z*))*, because (G(z*))* is finite within half-space#2.  For a good treatment of the Schwarz reflection principle see Dennery (pp.80-82) Mathematics for Physicists (Dover Books on Physics).Almost everything you need to know about calculating the strain field or Peach-Koehler force on a dislocation near an interface or surface is contained in Chapter 4 ""Infinite Space, Half-Space, and Bimaterials"" on pp.87-114.  What I have learned from reading this chapter in Hwu's book is vitally important in my research work.  Only the level of understanding achieved by reading a book of this caliber is sufficient for the dedicated research scientist or engineer to have confidence in his calculations.The brilliant treatment that I have described above, however, only takes the reader up to the first four chapters (pp.1-113) of this outstanding book!  In addition to the laying the groundwork for the treatment of half-spaces, the author addresses wedges and interface corners (Ch.5: pp.115-158); elliptical and polygonal holes/voids (Ch.6: pp.159-186);  interfacial cracks and delimitation (Ch.6: pp.187-23; inclusions and their interactions with dislocations (Ch.8: pp.239-275); surface indentation and the elastic theory of contact between two adjacent bodies (Ch.9: pp.277-332); thermoelastic effects on voids, cracks, and wedges (Ch.10, pp.333-367); piezoelectric materials (pp.369-410); and plate bending (Ch.12: 411-434).  Chapters 13-14 (pp.435-543 address stretching, voids, and inclusions in laminates: Chapter 15 (pp.545-588) is devoted to boundary element analysis.  The remaining pages of this book (pp.589-673) are devoted to its extensive appendices, tables, references, and indices.For those who find this book as fully informative and enjoyable as I have, I recommend the book authored by Professor Hwu's Ph.D. advisor, Professor Thomas Chi-Tsai (T. C. T.) Ting: Anisotropic Elasticity: Theory and Applications (Oxford Engineering Science Series).","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKNEN8OQ559D5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1441959149#wasThisHelpful","RKNEN8OQ559D5","A16GAIJJE39T1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16GAIJJE39T1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have several over-the-door racks from different companies.  I was a bit concerned about the plastic parts on this OXO rack, compared to the all metal construction of the others, but, so far, so good.The hooks are sturdy enough to hang up a terry cloth robe, plus some lighter garments. A big plus is that the plastic bars that go over the top of the door are invisible, so you don't see metal bars as you do with other racks. Additionally, those plastic bars snap on, so the rack stays put and doesn't slide from side to side.It's important to measure your door plus the gap between the door and the door jam. I have one door in my house, in a bathroom no less, that is so tightly fitted that it won't accommodate any over door rack. The product guidelines state that it fits ""over thin and thick doors (1 3/8"" - 1 3/4"") - my door is a bit bigger than that, not quite two inches, and it fit - and a ""standard 3/16"" gap between the top of the door and its frame.""

"This is the second time an Ensure product has helped an elderly family member regain health and strength. My aunt is a healthy eater, and has avoided pre-made shakes like this. That is, until she was hospitalized with colitis, and could not tolerate mist foods for quite a while. Ensure probably helped save her life.

This one does not - if you follow the cooking instructions, it holds together well; I have found it to be a bit sturdier than other brands.  It also has a ""whole grain"" taste to it - slightly nutty, and more flavorful than the plain white elbow pasta by Barilla.

"My favorite brand of grocery store pasta is De Cecco, but Barilla runs a close second, if not equal in some categories. Elbow macaroni is one of the types of pasta where I see no difference in taste or texture between the two brands. I have used this pasta in soups, pasta salads, and to make Mac and cheese, and as long as you do not overcook. It turns out great.  It tastes like pasta, not vegetables, but you are getting a bit extra nutrition, and the colors are nice. One thing to be aware of is that this is NOT a 16 oz box - it is 25% smaller. This is something that a lot of manufacturers have started doing, and it is irritating to be double checking weights and buying extra pasta so that you have enough for recipes that require the standard one pound box.

I prefer stainless steel spoons on a ring for ease of use.***OXO is one of my favorite brands.  Some of their products really make cooking easier, such as their salad spinner.  That being said, sometimes there are items that really don't need much engineering, and I think that measuring spoons are one of them.  I prefer metal spoons, but for some applications, such as dealing with lye, they are not a wise choice.  So, it's a good idea to have a set of plastic spoons on hand.  Metal spoons also won't melt if you leave them too close to the burner.  These plastic ones are sturdy, and clip together at the end of the handle.  I don't use the scraper at all, so it's useless to me.

Therefore, this review deals with the taste of the product in coffee or black tea, which I drink almost every day.I have found that most sweeteners, including white sugar, have a slightly bitter aftertaste when I use them to sweeten coffee or tea.  The two exceptions are agave nectar and sugar in the raw.  Stevia has a taste so weird that I can't use it at all, so I was curious to try this.  First, it has half the calories of regular sugar, because it is a combination of stevia and white sugar.  Second, the aftertaste is milder than either straight stevia or straight white sugar.

"I've had over ten years of experience with this and another grab bar, the Avin AI 1001 Red Handybar 3-in-1 Vehicle Support Handle, because of an elderly relative with mobility issues.First, this works, and no installation is required.  You just hook it onto the latch hood on the body of the car when you open the door, and then it can be used to brace oneself to stand up.  This was all the help my aunt needed for many years, but then her joints deteriorated to a point where  this tool was not enough.

The problem for my aunt was that it was impossible for her to do any of that after a certain point, and she needed a strap (like Stander CarCaddie) on the car door window plus one on the window of the back door, as well, literally to pull herself out and then up.  Unfortunately, these straps also have their own issues, as you will see from reading the reviews.Another concern is that the plastic feels flimsier than that of the sturdy Avin AI 1001, which as lasted us for over 10 years, with no problems.Bottom line, yes, this works well for certain people, and can even be used in conjunction with a strap.  It may not work for everyone, and I hope that my description can help you figure out if it will work for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24VPKS7BTIG4D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I45JJQO#wasThisHelpful","R24VPKS7BTIG4D","A109L3WXD1SJFU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A109L3WXD1SJFU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using their guides for over 20 years, back from when they were the new kid on the travel guide block.  Their India guide is fantastic, and remains my favorite.  This guide to Italy is also excellent - it covers every region of Italy, and provides a lot of detail on food establishments, which is something most travelers are interested in.  There is a handy pull out map of Rome, and the usual information on hikes, museums, and other activities.  If you plan on spending more than a couple days in a particular area, I recommend getting an additional guide for that locale, which will provide more in-depth coverage.

"I am one of those people who has read some if not every book in the different series by Ms. Harris. She has a creative mind and an ability to engage readers.  Nevertheless, I was disappointed in the Sookie Stackhouse series, which started off wonderfully, and then took a decided turn for the worse around book 6.The product description for this book provides a good synopsis without giving too much away - small town, mystery, things are not as they seem.  I thought the book was interesting, moved a bit slow at times, but most promising is that the author is limiting this to a trilogy.  That is why I said ""thankfully"" in the title of this review: not because Harris is a poor writer, but because I think she gets bored, really bored, writing an open-ended series, and it shows.  Hopefully, she will stay enthusiastic and engaged through a brief trilogy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JPGX48M6G26D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425263150#wasThisHelpful","R2JPGX48M6G26D","A109L3WXD1SJFU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A109L3WXD1SJFU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was curious to try this for occasional use - I still don't want a lot of soy in my diet, but a little bit from time to time is ok.  This powder is a little chalkier than the Myoplex, but once I added some banana and an ice cube or two, I didn't notice it.  The flavor is not as rich as the Myoplex.

At first, when snapped shut, it would stay put; after a week, it just slides up and down the strap, causing the nose band to twist, irritating the dog, and losing the tension needed for the headcollar to be effective.

"I am NOT a connoisseur of duct tapes, I just want stuff to work when I need it.  I've been very pleased with Gorilla tape - it has stuck to bricks, and is currently holding together an under-cabinet trash can contraption in my kitchen, which I can't repair properly because of overly large drill holes.  Regular duct tape would not keep everything held together in that dirty trash area, due to dust, sometimes bits of grease, etc., that would fall on the surface.  Gorilla tape did the trick.  I put this tape to the same test.  It is thicker than Gorilla tape, you have to cut it with scissors (not tear it like regular duct tape), and it does seem to be sturdy.  When I used this tape on my repair project, however, it took more tape and a lot of pressing to get it to stick, when the Gorilla tape required less effort.  It is holding up, and that trash bin gets a lot of daily use, so I'm pleased with its performance so far.**UPDATE** After a couple of months, this tape is losing its stickiness, while the Gorilla tape held my trash bin together for a year.

"What do I mean by ""approachable""?  I mean that it's doable - there are a lot of new Southern chef cookbooks on the market, like the wonderful John Tesh's, but they provide labor-intensive recipes that take more time than the average home cook can allot.The B.T.C. Old-Fashioned Grocery Cookbook is just what it claims to be - a compendium of delightful, old-fashioned, quintessentially Southern recipes that are comfort food, especially if you grew up eating them. Every once in a while, the authors will toss in something a little more modern.  For example, tucked into the breakfast chapter amongst the Skillet Biscuit and 4 different gravy recipes, you will find Honey Goat Cheese Frittata with Prosciutto and Arugula.  Not your typical Southern fare.  The casserole chapter has a recipe for Artichoke and Green Pea Gratin, and a few pages later, Chicken Spaghetti, which calls for hoop cheese, a can of Ro-Tel, and three different types of Campbells Cream soups.  98% of everything I make is fresh and from scratch, but I am not a snob, so I tried that Chicken Spaghetti recipe and my family asked me to put it on the ""repeat"" list.If the authors have a favorite product, they mention it by name, such as Tabasco sauce and Hellman's (Best Foods out west) mayonnaise, which I think is great.  One of the things that I wish they would have done is provide a bit more explanation about some of these regional or locally-named items, such as hoop cheese.  Other recipes I tried:  Pimento cheese (yum), Home Brined Corned Beef Brisket, the Marinara sauce in the lasagna recipe, and Buttermilk Ranch Dressing (delicious).  All were very good.A couple final notes.  Some of these recipes do take time, so take that into account.  The Chicken Spaghetti recipe is quick and easy IF you have the chicken on hand, like a rotisserie chicken.

"I love these and find myself using them all the time since I received them.The pros:- They take up little space and fit in small storage places- Comes with a finger guard- Affordable- Easy to cleanThe cons:- The slicers are not adjustable like a mandoline+Basically, I find myself just washing one of these after use, and leaving it in my dish drainer, to be used again.  I love my $300+ mandoline, and I will very occasionally use it to slice something extra thin or for a special shape.  The thing is, I so rarely used it that I found myself avoiding recipes that would require me to pull it out, set it up, then clean it and shove it back into its dark storage space.  With these little guys, I am slicing radishes, cucumbers and fennel to add to salads, which I wanted to do before but did not want to go through the rigamarole I described above.  I find that I also rarely pull out my box grater or microplanes for the same reason - I just leave the graters in the dish drainer and use them as needed.So, if you do not need an expensive mandoline with multiple settings, and are content with an inexpensive but practical set, give these a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW1DVRNWWQMIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HEZ8A6K#wasThisHelpful","RW1DVRNWWQMIE","A109L3WXD1SJFU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A109L3WXD1SJFU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have not found that my teeth are any whiter, and even though it's a soft brush, it does feel a bit harsh on my gums, so I advise a light touch when brushing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PLPNTGYROOQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008CQQHPQ#wasThisHelpful","R2PLPNTGYROOQL","A109L3WXD1SJFU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A109L3WXD1SJFU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I honestly wasn't sure what to expect with this - if I didn't like it, it would have been too expensive to ship back because it's heavy.  At any rate, I was not disappointed - the stairs are very sturdy, attractive with a richly-colored wood, and easy to use.  No assembly required, a big plus for me.  After a bit of gentle coaxing with treats, my 13 year old pup LOVES them and uses them all the time.

"I was looking for a bucket that was stable and easy to carry, so when the opportunity came up to review this bucket for Amazon, it was perfect timing.The PROS:- sturdy, yet light weight.  When I pick a full bucket up by the handle, I don't get the wild swinging that I have with tall, round buckets.- the handle is easy to grip and hold.  Other buckets have handles that are too thin and twirl around, making it hard to keep a grip.- the markings on the side of the bucket are very helpful, and are marked in both metric and English standard measurements.- it took me a bit to figure it out, but there are also marking on the bottom of the bucket to help you measure liquid amounts without the use of another measuring cup.  At first I thought they were for dry ingredients, but they work for best for liquid ones, like bleach.The CONS:- the markings are a bit hard to see- the handle gets slippery when wetNeutral:Other reviewers have had mixed feelings about the mop clip, but I don't use it so it doesn't affect my review.None of the cons are significant enough for me to subtract any stars.  I love this bucket, and even use it to haul stuff around the house, not just for cleaning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20LCRLM3O9LL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00940DVQ2#wasThisHelpful","R20LCRLM3O9LL1","A109L3WXD1SJFU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A109L3WXD1SJFU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As you can see from other reviews, this is a fantastic product - for the right dog.We recently adopted a 13 year old dog with a number of health issues, and having used other products from this company, I purchased this as a vitamin supplement that I could use on all my dogs (with my vet's OK).  I started the dogs out on a half dose, and 2 of them ended up with diarrhea.  Again, NOT unusual when you make changes to a dog's diet, so I cut back to a quarter dose.  Still terrible diarrhea.  That's when I put on reading glasses and took a closer look at the label, and saw that the fourth ingredient on the label is Nutritional Yeast.  The 2 dogs that were reacting badly to the product are allergic to Nutritional Yeast.Unfortunately, neither the Amazon description nor the product page at the manufacturer's website at rxvitamins - dot - com (if I put in the link, Amazon will delete it, so just replace ""dot"" with a ""."") provide any information on the actual ingredients in the product.  Here is information off the side of the bottle:Active Ingredients per scoop:L-Glutamine (2500 mg), Kelp Powder (760 mg), Lecithin Granules (760 mg), Nutritional Yeast (760 mg), Bio-Agaricus (600 mg),L-Arginine (500 mg), Green Tea Extract (500 mg), Spirulina (500 mg), Sodium Ascorbate (250 mg), Larch Arabinogalactin (250 mg), Silymarin (150 mg), Del-Immune V (25 mg), Zinc picolinate (15 mg), Vitamin A (500 IU), Vitamin E (200 IU), Vitamin D (75 IU), Selenium (25 mcg).Cautions:  Safe use in pregnant animals or animals intended for breeding has not been proven.Directions for use:  For each 50 lbs. (22.7 kg) of body weight, mix 1 scoop in your pet's food once daily or as prescribed by your veterinarian.  Higher does have been associated clinically with increased formula efficiency.Like I said above, the website does not give any of this information, so you may have to call or email the company directly.  Contact info is on their website.So, this is a terrific product IF your dog is not allergic to any of the ingredients; in the case of 2 of my dogs, that is nutritional yeast.  Had that information been available in the product description or on the manufacturer's website, I would have passed on this particular supplement.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GU2M7C03K285/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003PQS404#wasThisHelpful","R1GU2M7C03K285","A109L3WXD1SJFU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A109L3WXD1SJFU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In a nutshell, the people who will probably like this book are ATK fans, and those who like to experiment with a crock pot.  Those who may not like it likely view a slow cooker as the ultimate fix it and forget it kitchen tool, where you throw everything in the crock and come back at the end of the day to a meal.I like this book better than the first one because the recipes appeal to me more.  However, many of the recipes are not slow cooker only, but require the use of a microwave, the broiler, stove top, or boiling water.  I tried one of chicken wing recipes and it was good, but after basting and finishing it off under the broiler, it left me wondering just how much of a savings the crock pot was in terms of effort.  I would probably never make any of the desserts in the book, not because they look bad, but because I like to bake the traditional way.I really recommend that you click on the ""Look Inside"" option at the top of the product page, and take a look at some of the recipes, photos (a big plus- lots of color photos), and some of the recipes.  This book will either click for you or it won't, as you can tell from the tone of a lot of the reviews.  The recipes are good, so that's not the issue - it's whether you want to put more effort into them than is typical for slow cooker recipes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34HNM01NUO4FH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936493578#wasThisHelpful","R34HNM01NUO4FH","A109L3WXD1SJFU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A109L3WXD1SJFU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tested this with very, very low expectations.  There are some decent products on the market, but none have been able to tackle the stains left on old berber basement carpet that serves as the thoroughfare for three dogs from the back yard.  Earlier this year, the dogs added some pee stains and family members added BBQ chicken juice to the carpeting.  Had I been around when this occurred, I would have used Nature's Miracle, a fantastic product that works very well if used *promptly.*Almost a year later, I decided to try Krud Kutter on this conglomeration of stains.  While I was still spraying, THE WORST STAIN STARTED TO DISAPPEAR BEFORE MY EYES.  I was completely shocked.  I then went bonkers tackling spots, some of which were 6-8 inches long and very dark (the BBQ sauce had acted like a glue).  Those took a little rubbing with a damp cloth, per the instructions, but they, too, disappeared.  This is the best stain remover I have ever used.  I am tempted to try it on a couple of old t-shirts to see if it works on them.Note:  My basement carpet is a speckled berber that is on the pale side, so there was no discoloration from the cleaner.  The label states that you should test first for color-fastness, and if you have darker rugs, you should definitely do that.  This stuff is powerful!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH0WQ8SIFR3LZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CIQW1YC#wasThisHelpful","RH0WQ8SIFR3LZ","A109L3WXD1SJFU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A109L3WXD1SJFU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Quieter than my uprights, but it still makes noise like a vacuum cleaner, so don't expect it to whisper.  It is NOT bagless, so you will have to figure out when to change bags and the replacement bags are not cheap.

"I have found that this helps shorten the length and reduce the severity of a cold IF you start taking it early - as soon as you feel the vaguest of cold symptoms. Follow the directions and do not take more than the recommended amount or you may end up with some temporary loss of the ability to taste, which I think may be due to some of the active ingredients.

"I've read, bought, and checked out from the library about a dozen paleo cookbooks, and I'm usually left with a kind of ""meh"" attitude.  Nice, but not inspiring for me, although they may be for others.  This is not one of those books.  Beautifully photographed, clearly written with some recipes that have a long list of ingredients, but most that don't, I actually want to cook from this cookbook. I've made several main dishes and salads, with a favorite being the meat loaf muffins.  I don't really like the dessert chapter much, but honestly, when I allow myself to eat dessert, I go for it and don't try to make it healthy.  The recipes use a lot of coconut milk, which works find, but I've also subbed heavy cream (which is probably more ""primal"" than paleo eating), and it worked find.

"*UPDATE*- I ordered these again, and this time I would rate the jalapeno 1 star.  Why?  My personal preference is mildly spicy and mildly salty.  In the second batch, the jalapeno flavor was inedible for me - so spicy and so salty that I had to eat yogurt to cool the burn in my mouth and throat.  So, the heat and salt intensity were extremely inconsistent between the two batches.  If you love heat and salt, no problem, but if you don't, be careful.My family loves Kettle Chips, and once in a while we will get a big Costco-sized bag of rippled chips for special occasions.  Because you never know if another variety will taste good, and I didn't want to be left with a bag of chips that I hated, I had been reluctant to try other flavors.  This variety box did the trick, and I found 2 new flavors that I will be buying in the future.Sea Salt and Vinegar - 5 stars, my favorite flavor.  Perfectly salted, with a vinegar taste that does not overwhelm.Jalapeno  - 4.5 stars.  The bags say ""HOT"" but they're not, just mildly spicy, and this is coming from someone who does not like a lot of heat.Backyard BBQ - 4.5 stars - typical BBQ flavor, but it was not as salty as other brands of BBQ chips, which is a good thing.Salt and Pepper - 4.0 stars - very strong pepper taste, which I like, but which got old after a while.If you like strong flavored chips, this is the variety pack for you.

"The recipes in this book are really good, for the most part - flavorful, very diverse, and interesting.  The photos are great.  I'd give the book 4 stars for those two things alone.The problem, however, is that this is supposed to be a book on techniques, i.e., a teaching book.  In this regard the book is weak.  While there are pictures of cutting up a chicken, for example, I don't think there are enough of them for a beginner.  Another example of sparse instructions can be found in the instructions for scrambling eggs - a side note explains that the addition of different liquids will change the results. . . and that's it.  It doesn't tell you what adding cream versus water versus milk will do.  You are left to wonder.  So, if you want some really good recipes and don't really care too much about very detailed technique, this is a great book to have.  If you are looking for a book that provides more detailed instructions, then I recommend looking for another book, such as Cooking, by James Peterson.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8DHCC4O0A850/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0470587814#wasThisHelpful","R8DHCC4O0A850","A109L3WXD1SJFU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A109L3WXD1SJFU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

After I ate 2/3 of the box, which is about 1200 calories later, I changed my mind.  Delightfully salty and zesty, I like these a lot better than regular Cheez-its.  18 crackers add up to about 150 calories, and there are 12 servings for box.

"As some of the other reviews noted there are no slick production values. It feels and looks like you are in a working dojo street sounds and all. Frankly that doesn't bother me as I work out in one. David Chang demonstrates the moves well and narrates as he goes along to help get the proper movement. For me the learning speed was just right, not too fast or too slow. It may take several run throughs to get it all right, but the beginner can accomplish learning basic Tai Chi from this DVD. There is an 8 minute stretch to begin then you have a 28 minute session where there is a choice between a regular and mirrored version. I appreciate there is a version for iPod as I like to use mine.I only have 2 small criticisms. The iPod version of the regular workout portion is split into 3 separate 9 minute clips instead of one flowing one. I also would have liked an un-narrated version where once the moves were learned we could just go with the flow of the stretches and routine. Of course you can always turn off the sound and put on some music and the only distracton would be ignoring the lip movements as Chang narrates. Other than these two small quibbles, I enjoyed this DVD and would recommend it to beginners. As I recall I also purchased this DVD new at a discounted price so for me it was also a good value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QLV9OL5SXAI3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JCF51S#wasThisHelpful","R1QLV9OL5SXAI3","A3BFEEL2F7O5XB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BFEEL2F7O5XB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As of the writing of this review, the book is availble free on the Internet (due to Amazon's policies I am not able to leave the URL here). Of course there are plugs for Dick Sutphen's products and workshops, but along the way he does manage to deliver some interesting info and I can't complain as I got the book for free. Plus, I have nothing against people making a living.To summarize some of the info, there are different qualities to the energy of the vortexes, yin and yang or postive and negative (negative does not mean bad or evil, but it's just a different quality like the positve and negative ends of a battery) and each vortex also emanates energy that is electric, magnetic, or electromagnetic (combo of both). Boynton Canyon is electromagnetic, Airport Vortex is electric. It is also possible to see ""auras"" around some of the vortexes. Many anecdotes from his workshop participants are included. The e-edition I found was copyrighted 2006 and was approximately 150 pages. I can't substantiate the info and to be truthful haven't done any research into vortexes so I can't say if his info is accurate, but it was an interesting read. There are a few suggested meditations and suggestions for things to try such as automatic writing while a vortex.I have visted Sedona and had some interesting experiences after coming off the votexes.

"I found this book in PDF for free on the Internet (because of Amazon restrictions I cannot put the URL here). It was copyrighted in 2006 for the e-edition of the book and is about 150 pages. It has interesting information about vortexes and people's experiences, though I cannot confirm all of it is accurate. Of course part of the purpose is mentioning Dick Sutphen's products/tours, but it didn't bother me as I felt there was interesting info presented along the way and the man has a right to earn a living. Perhaps at this point in time much of this information is available for free off the Internet so that is why the book was made available for free. If the info is accurate there are different types of vortexes, yin and yang or positive and negative (not negative as in bad or evil, but more like a different quality such as the positive and negative ends of a battery), and each vortex also carries a different energy or combination of energies, electric, magnetic, and electromangnetic. According to Sutphen Boynton Canyon is a great place to visit as it has balanced electromagnetic energies. Another good place is Bell Rock as it's like an energy beacon and there have been many UFO sightings. Some also state they able to see energy ""auras"" around the vortexes. There isn't a whole lot of deep info and the book isn't very long, but still a nice collection of interesting info and anecdotes. There are a few suggestions for meditations and things to try such as automatic writing while at a vortex.I can say for myself I have been on a Sedona vortex tour and I had some interesting experiences after coming off the vortexes, perhaps the best words for it would be synchronicities. My experiences changed my mind about the spiritual. I was always busy running offices and people and never thought about the spiritual and after Sedona I took up energy work and now do volunteer energy work in local hospitals. This book is about Sedona vortexes, but it mentions Kauai as the other positive energy vortex (the entire island is apparently an energy vortex). I have also heard people mention Maui and Kona as energy places to visit. I offer this as additional info for those looking for these types of places to visit and I admit Hawaii is my home state so I am biased in favor of a visit there.Not everyone will experience something on vortexes and everyone will experience something different. A trip there can be expensive, but if you're able to go when the rates are lower or look for a B&B rather than staying at an expensive hotel you can do it for a reasonable cost. The beauty of the place is undeniable and if you enjoying hiking Arizona is a great place to do it in and there are many hikiing trails and clubs. There are touristy areas and given there are limitations to what kind of business activities one could do there what else do they have to support the area but tourism, health and wellness, weddings, etc.? You can go out from the area and experience other things. As with all things it is what you make of the experience and if you only want to focus on the touristy parts then that is what you draw in. I met some nice people there and found authentic Indian made jewelry for about the cheapest price I've seen so far so explore the area and make it a positive experience. I saw one of the breathtaking rainbows ever while there.

This CD is what I would term guided meditations as journey's should not have too much guidance. Part of the point of the journey is to allow what is meant for you to receive. Ingerman should have provided some info, help set the intention for the journey then let the imagination of the journeyer take him/her on the journey to discover what is meant for him/her. A large part of the shamanic journey is allowing and using your own imagination and by trying to guide too much I felt Ingerman didn't allow the natural journey process to occur. Also since her voice was distracting I just could not keep my mind focused on the journey.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAFLQ6H6LRH16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591797578#wasThisHelpful","RAFLQ6H6LRH16","A3BFEEL2F7O5XB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BFEEL2F7O5XB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is aimed at the layman and is kept succinct, around 75 pages, so as not to overwhelm the reader. There is some great information and Rita explains a technique called The Remembrance. The Remembrance essentially relaxes you, puts you in touch with the sacredness/love that dwells within. The Remembrance instruction is about a page and a half and easy to do. It can be done prenatal to connect/bond with your baby. This would make a wonderful gift for any family expecting a baby or preparing for parenthood. Even if that baby has already been born, this book can help families understand and connect with that precious little one and with your own inner resources.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H1FFYX9PHKT3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0983474907#wasThisHelpful","R3H1FFYX9PHKT3","A3BFEEL2F7O5XB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BFEEL2F7O5XB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I appreciated most about this book first published in 1919 is Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe) takes great pains to stay true to the sanskrit texts instead of reinventing them or overlaying them with his personal experiences, interpretations and thoughts. This book is a follow up/expansion on his previous book Shakti and Shakta and in retrospect I wish I had read it first, although it is not necessary as this book stands on its own. In the beginning of the book Avalon/Woodroffe takes to task some of the Westerners, most notably the Theosophical Society and Charles Leadbeater, which popularized their version/ideas about the 7 chakras in Western society. Avalon/Woodroffe felt they also popularized misconceptions or inaccuracies along with their ideas about the cakras/chakras. As the author prefers to let the texts speak for themselves most of the book is devoted to his translation of the texts and their description of the 6 cakras (chakras), their associations and powers. He also discusses kundalini and the rising of kundalini. Having said all this, the book is not an easy read. Avalon/Woodroffe uses many sanskrit terms and verses to keep to the actual text/meaning and while he does explain each and there are copius footnotes this will not be reading you can breeze through. I particularly enjoyed some of the verses.Verse 37He then also sees the Light which is in the form of a flaming lamp. It is lustrous like the clearly shining morning sun, and glows between the Sky and the Earth. It is here that the Bhagavan manifests Himself int he fullness of His might. He knows no decay, and witnesseth all, and is here as He is in the refion of Fire, Moon, and Sun.Perhaps not a book you might want to begin with, but for those interested in studying the cakras/chakras a must.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15GINE3XZQO1O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486230589#wasThisHelpful","R15GINE3XZQO1O","A3BFEEL2F7O5XB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BFEEL2F7O5XB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking for something in the 15-30 minute range as I wanted to use the didgeridoo track(s) to journey or meditate to. These tracks fit the bill. I also purchased Didgeridoo Meditation: An Odyssey Through Consciousness. I didn't care for the water sounds for some reason so I only purchased the 3rd track off the album after listening to the samples. I feel the nature sounds really add to it and I like that it's just didgeridoo playing without a lot of new age/digital enhancements. Playing the track makes me feel relaxed and yet energized and like I'm camping out sleeping under the stars.

"The subject of reflexology is complex using many points throughout the body, but by keeping the subject to the hands and feet the author makes the subject accessible for beginners. The hands and feet are great places to start to learn reflexology. My own experience doing energy work has taught me that working the hands and feet, lightly massaging them to release stress, has been very helpful to patients so starting off learning reflexology with the hands and feet makes sense. The drawings for the reflexology massage were clear, but some of the other illustrations were a bit cartoonish and simplistic. The general information and written instructions were clear and easy to follow showing where specific locations are connected to organs, nerves, etc. and how to perform basic sessions. The back of the book has an Ailments Reference Chart of a few pages with ailments, symptoms and main areas to treat. The chart has a range of ailments that include cerebral palsy, cancer, bursitis, gout, angina, epilepsy, constipation, indigestion, hay fever, and migraines. Overall I liked the book and thought it was good starter book for those wanting to learn the basics before heading off into a more complex book.

"Update:I've been using this P12 every night, inside and out, to do spot checks, and this is now my favorite and Brightest, compact flashlight, and it seams to run forever with my Orbtronic 18650 batteries. (The Orbtronic 3600mAh 18650 Protected batteries can only be bought on the Orbtronic web site)I've really begun to LOVE this P12, it's amazing!Review below.This new 2015 version P12 is a Great little compact flashlight!!!I'm comparing it to the other compact flashlights I own, which are all very close in brightness, size and cost.I own the P16 (Love this light!), the SRT 6, and the SRT 7, also some others, but they're lower lumen output flashlights.When considering the size, especially for your EDC light, this is the best, being slightly lighter in weight, and no flared out reflector assembly, it's 1 inch in diameter, all the length of the flashlight. The total, overall length is 5.5 inches long, which is about 9/16ths shorter than the P16 and the SRT 6 & 7. So for your front or rear Jean pocket, this flashlight will be a very good fit.Brightness wise, this is a very bright little flashlight. It's hot spot is equal in size, to the hot spot of the P16 and the SRT 6 & 7, but to your eye, you can see that it's a little brighter/more white.All 4 are very bright for such compact flashlights, but this new P12 being smaller, makes it that much more impressive. Also, in comparing all 4, I can't tell any difference in the surrounding fill light, either in size, or brightness. All 4 are very good! But again, the brightest hot spot goes to the P12. (by a small margin).Feature wise, this P12 is identical to the P16, with the tail cap push button switch being the On/Off and momentary on switch, and the separate forward button controlling the mode (low/med-low/med-high/high), and when held in for over 1 second, it goes into Strobe mode first, then hold in for over another second, and it goes into it's S.O.S. mode, hold in for over another second, and it goes into it's Beacon mode. It also has built in memory, so what you shut it off in, it will start up in, the next time you turn on the flashlight. I really like flashlights with these features, and NiteCore seams to know this!Power wise, it's identical to the P16 the SRT 6, and the SRT 7, all can use a single 18650 li-ion battery, or 2 CR123a batteries, which I consider to be a big advantage for any flashlight. The P12 also has identical runtimes, as the other 3, all of which are very respectable! My choice is a Orbtronic 3600mAh Protected 18650.Build quality wise, there are no surprises, it's a very solidly built flashlight, made to IPX-8 standards, and 1.5 meter impact resistant. High quality seals, and high quality switches. Simply built to last!The biggest difference between all 4 flashlights are the candlepower, and there throwing distance.The P12 comes in dead last in both of these areas.The highest CD and throwing distance goes to the SRT7, then the P16, then the P12. Sorry, I didn't check the SRT 6. Now this is just my opinion, but as a EDC flashlight, throwing distance isn't a big factor, at least not for me. Still all are very respectable.As a EDC, which I think this flashlight is best suited for, it has excellent specs, and is a great performer.This is the perfect compact flashlight for doing those routine spot checks.I do highly recommend the P12 if your considering it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GQ9J5CTITM64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H1XDYFW#wasThisHelpful","R2GQ9J5CTITM64","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gotta say first, I really wasn't expecting much for the cost of this flashlight, as similar ones 2000 lumens and greater cost in the $200>$250 range. So for $93 bucks, it's really not bad.This flashlight says it's a Sky Ray King, and I'm not really sure if it is or not, since I've read that they are copied a lot.Regarding the 8400 lumens....I don't think so!I own many high end flashlights, from Fenix, Olight, and NiteCore, and using them as a measuring stick, I'd say this puts out between 2000 lumens and 2500 lumens. Seriously, no where near 8000 lumens, not even close.I don't see how 4-18650 batteries could power 8400 lumens for any length of time?This is a very bright flashlight, and the hot spot is huge, much larger than any other flashlight I own. So I'm sure it's not much of a thrower, but as a flood, it really hits the mark. The fill light is about normal (not any brighter than my TM11 puts out), but I did expect a brighter fill light (because of 7 U2 LED's, and it's claim of 8400 lumens). It looks like most of the light is focused into the huge hot spot. So for me that works out good, because I do prefer a flood over a tightly focused thrower.It emits a pure white light, with no tints at all, I'd take a guess at about 5000k to 6000k (light temp).My biggest concern is it's quality of build, and overall longevity.The switch feels quite cheep, but it works without any problems (for now).The switch also operates in the simplest way, with No memory. It cycles through High/Low/Off, and if held in for about 3 seconds, it goes into strobe mode. The Strobe is very slow, not very disorienting at all. Another push of the switch, brings it back to the High setting.This is a very light weight flashlight. It's Very similar in size, to the build of a NiteCore TM11, but it's much lighter than the TM11. I can't find any runtime info on this flashlight, so I'll try to keep track and update this review with that info. It does come with it's own UltraFire batteries, they say they are 4000mAh batteries, but as far as I know, the largest capacity 18650 is 3600mAh. I'm using my 3600mAh Orbtronic Protected batteries, since I don't trust UltraFire batteries. (they may be fine, but I'm not using them). It also comes with a Smart charger for charging 2-18650's at a time. It's a Chinese made wall charger, and about the cheapest one I've ever seen, so that went straight into the trash. I'll use my Soshine charger. I'm not basing my rating on the batteries, or the charger, I only wanted the flashlight to check out the 8400 lumens...so one star comes off for over stating the lumen rating.Overall, considering only the flashlight, and if this flashlight lasts, I think this is a 4 star item. I do think it may be a bit overpriced, just due to it's build quality, and cheep switch, this flashlight could have been made much better if they just used a quality switch. I would have gladly paid more if it came with a high quality switch that incorporated memory, and more levels of brightness!At this point, I'm not going to recommend it to anyone, unless you have the money to spare, and really want it. I'll wait a few months before I can recommend this light.I say this because I am concerned with how long it will remain functional.In the coming months, I'll be using this flashlight a lot, and after that I'll update my recommendation.Hopefully I won't have to change anything, except the recommendation.If or when something fails with this flashlight, I will update this review accordingly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29MVZPW1YNAQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O13L65A#wasThisHelpful","R29MVZPW1YNAQQ","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this charger as a safety net, for when on the road for extended periods of time. It's Very easy to use, and can charge virtually anything that uses a micro USB charging port. Plus a HUGE storage capacity, for multiple charges, before needing to recharge the device.It really holds a full charge well, and for a long time.I had it charged up, and in my glove box for well over 2 months (in cold weather), then used it for the first time, and it still had a full charge (showing 4 lit LED's), and then fully charged my Moto G from 15% to 100% and was still showing 4 lit LED's.At the time I needed to use it, I was in a bind, and no where near any power outlet, plus it being winter time, I didn't want to use my cars battery, and it's cold out (Very Cold! I'm tired with winter). But this device is just an excellent item to have, (it's an Emergency Saver!).I bought one for my sister because she's traveling in India, and was warned about there unstable power infrastructure, so she can use this to charge her phone 3 or 4 times, without needing to worry about power spikes. She was told (by many), that when charging, there phone, or laptop had fried, due to a power spike.I not only love having it and using it, but just the piece of mind, knowing it's there is Great!Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29FCO6565IMOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M3073L4#wasThisHelpful","R29FCO6565IMOB","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've bought multiple pairs of the 912 socket, LED replacement light, and these were the brightest LED's out of 4 different pairs I tried. Just beautifully, pure white, and extremely bright. When they say ""Super Bright"", they mean it! So far I've used 2 different JDM ASTAR LED's as replacement lights on my 2002 Ford Windstar, these and the ""Extremely Bright 5730"", for my socket 168 lights, and both look and feel very well made, and also look to be brighter that there competitors.Over the past few months I've been in the process of replacing all of my Ford Windstar Mini Van's incandescent light bulbs (both interior and exterior), with LED lights.I started with the front end, both headlights, and driving lights/fog lights.I tried 2 other different brands besides JDM ASTAR, and 2 different makes of JDM ASTAR made LED's. This ""Super Bright AX-2835 Chipset"" was the brightest by far, and used for my driving lighs/fog lights, they worked perfectly for this application.These LED's provide a pure white light, with no tint of blue, or purple, or yellow, or any other color. They really enhanced the look of the LED Headlights I installed, and look excellent on there own!They fit the existing socket perfectly, and work perfectly, and as you can tell by my review, I do LOVE these lights, both the look, and the function! Very easy to install.I do highly recommend these lights to all who need this type socket, you'll be very pleased!!!

"I love these replacement LED lights!There very bright, and perfect for where I needed them.These go at the top of each side door, as an entrance light.They're more than twice as bright as my old incandescent bulbs were, and whats really nice is they use a fraction of the power. Being as bright as they are, the second row, or back seats are really ""fully"" lit up, and easy to see anything and everything, plus they're above eye height, so they don't blind you when your getting in.These are your standard ""fuse type"" light, and they are directional.The extra wide board allows for more LED's on one board for a much brighter light.Again, this is perfect for any kind of dome or roof mounted lighting.The fuse type are very easy to take out and replace.I'm in the process of replacing all of the lighting in my Mini Van to LED's.These 1.72 inch long fuse type lights, seam to be a pretty standard light socket (42mm to 44mm), in length. I've seen there incandescent counterparts in many other vehicles, and found them in 3 different places in my Van.Being LED lights, they'll have a much longer life, and they'll draw much less current, so the pull on my alternator is reduced a lot. Hopefully that will translate into longer life for my alternator.So now I've gotten all of the interior lights changes to LED's.I did the Headlights and running lights last month, and just yesterday got the License Plate lights changed over as well. I just have the turn signal, brake and backup lights to change next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRP38WVLKSX10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006R2RZOY#wasThisHelpful","RRP38WVLKSX10","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The black lacquer is really what makes this display look nice with my Katana Swords!I originally rated this stand at 4 stars, but due to it's low cost, you really can't ask for more, so I raised my rating to 5 stars. It really is a fair price for what you get.My CAS Hanwei Katana's are not collectors items, but still nice in my opinion, so this stand was really all I wanted, or needed.It comes in a small box, with protection, and packed well.It only took a few minutes to assemble, with 1 screw and 1 wooden guide pin, for each side.Once assembled, I found it very sturdy, plenty strong for 2 Katana's.It also comes with a pre-installed closed loop hook, on each side, to make it easy for wall hanging, brass colored.When fully assembled, the display/stand, is over 12 inches wide, which is plenty wide to support your Katana. It's total height is approximately 10.5 inches tall, and the depth is 3.5 inches deep.The contoured sword supports have a red velvet pad that simply sticks to the wood, for the protection of your Katana.The display stands on its own just as well, to place anywhere you'd like.

"Wow, this is an extremely nice set of metric wrenches!!!I'm REALLY impressed with these, and love working with em!I've already been using the SAE sister set of these wrenches and they've really impressed me, both with there quality and there toughness.This set is the same, very tough, and very high quality made wrenches, professional quality!All are ratcheting box ends (reversible with a push of a button), and instead of the cheaper point style box end, these are the spline box end, which grabs the flat side of the nut or bolt, so no problems with a nut or bolt thats previously been rounded by someone else, if it still has the flat surface intact, these will work great for you!The finish is beautiful, with a mirror polish shine, also they're strong as a mule, as I've already put my SAE set through some tough tests, and they all passed with zero problems at all.All of the interior gears and teeth are hardened steel, and all are 90 tooth geared, so you need only a little room to make progress, and I really enjoy the length of these, that allows me to use plenty of force with those rusted or stubborn nuts that don't want to come off. They do with these wrenches!The 90 tooth gearing also makes for very smooth ratcheting, these are just a pleasure to use, I love working with them.I think anybody who has an appreciation of fine tools, would love both this set and the SAE set of double box end, spline drive ratcheting (and reversible) wrenches.This is a really good price for a professional set like this, and I very highly recommend these to all who need them!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18VE4N33OKNE8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DDO1DPG#wasThisHelpful","R18VE4N33OKNE8","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This bag works perfectly as a secondary medical storage bag.Or a Emergency essentials bag for your vehicle.I use it as a Secondary medic storage bag, and my main medic bag is the Kemp Large Professional Trauma Bag. All of my main medical gear is in the Kemp bag, and I use the Arsenal Responder for bandage, wraps, tape, and other essential, that are able to take a hit. The main reason is because this bag has very little protection padding, so keeping anything thats possibly breakable in it, is taking a chance of loosing it.But as a storage bag for unbreakable supplies, this bag is wonderful, and you can fit a LOT of supplies in it. It's very roomy, and really well made.It's a center opening bag, and the 2 strap handles tie together with a sewn on Velcro strap, which makes it easy to handle, and carry.Inside the bag, on both side, there are pockets for smaller storage, aside from the interior center open storage.The bag is made of heavy nylon and the sewing is done very well, this is a high quality medic bag, it just lacks some good padding. But for mu purposes, it works beautifully!It also uses an oversized zipper, and it works very smoothly, and easily secures the contents of the bag.I Highly recommend this bag, if what I described is what your looking for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R286RIPD02BTU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AYGFP4#wasThisHelpful","R286RIPD02BTU8","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are very nice and light weight valve stem sleeves.There good quality sleeves, I couldn't find anything cheap or defective on them.So you have a reference, these measure 1 inch total, from base to top.Don't worry about your tires becoming out of balance with the addition of these, because these sleeves are light enough that they won't affect the balance of your tires at all.They fit my valve stems perfectly, and a added benefit I noticed, is they help keep the valve stem straight up, when your taking air pressure measurements. They fit down flush with the bottom flare of the valve stem, and cover all of the stem except the top threads, for your caps.These along with some nice, all metal, valve stem caps: EDELSIGN - HEXAGON Tire Rim Valve Stem Caps, really make for a nice and clean look.I really like them, and they would dress up any tire and rim set.They made mine look much nicer, without being to flashy.Just what I wanted.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFC7PG32QXRS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XKQQII#wasThisHelpful","RFC7PG32QXRS6","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This stuff works really well, I was amazed!I used it on a 14 year old engine thats never been cleaned before.I wanted to get it clean since I'm going to be doing all of the maintenance work on it now.I will say I needed to give it 2 treatments, between spraying it off, but it got my engine looking close to brand new.My hand got a little tired having to keep using the spray pump, but for the cost of this stuff, it was Soooo worth it!The nozzle will adjust to 2 different spray patterns, a stream, or a mist like spray.It didn't stain my driveway, like other products have, namely Gunk.Don't get me wrong...Gunk does work well to, but it does stain my driveway.This comes from a well established company Name Brand, ""Permatex""For the cost, and considering how well this works, after using it, I came in and ordered another 6 pack of this De-Greaser!

"This is a beautiful set of ratcheting box end wrenches! (Spline Drive)They work & feel very smooth with small step ratcheting, so even in tight areas, you can still get good turns. There internal gears use 90 teeth, so smooth and tight ratcheting!All parts, (internally as well), are all hardened steel, so you do need to keep up with proper lubrication.This is a complete set from 5/16"" to 3/4"", and all sizes in between.The quality and build of these are top notch!Much more than I ever expected, so I'm really happy I took the chance and tried these.I just love the ease of use that they provide. They make jobs quicker and easier.Each wrench is reversible as well.Applying torque is no problem for these wrenches.Each wrench is much longer than I expected, even the smallest size 5/16th's - 3/8th's, is 12 inches long.The longest wrench (11/16"" x 3/4""), measures in at about 14 inches long, so each wrench has great reach and leverage.I've been using these for about 3 months now, and used each size. I've had Zero problems, and have been really impressed with there performance.These are spline drive box ends, so they really grab the fastener well, with no problems if your dealing with partially rounded bolts or nuts. I've also applied plenty of torque, in most cases, more than needed, but I did so mainly to see if these wrenches could take it, without any skipping, or breaking of the ratcheting teeth.Not a single failure!This set comes with a limited lifetime warranty, good throughout the U.S.A.So after using these for a good 3 months, and to a point abusing them, they've performed great.The ratcheting is very smooth, there reach is great, all are spline drive box ends, just a superior set of wrenches.I now plan on getting there Metric set of 5 wrenches. Just great quality.You could store both sets in a good canvas wrench roll up like this one: Arsenal 5782 Canvas Wrench Roll-Up, I have 2 already and plan on getting 2 more, these are great wrench roll ups, very tough!I very highly recommend these to everyone!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD8F3O1ZF1CG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DDO1CT8#wasThisHelpful","RD8F3O1ZF1CG8","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I immediately put this charger to use, and it really impressed me!Well built, with quality parts.I've had no problems with this charger at all. In fact I'm really happy with it, all of it's features, and it's build quality! I'm also really impressed with the chargers outer shell/body. It's very well made, not like some of there older styles that used thin sheet metal, that would flex, and bend. This charger has a very tough shell (inclosure)!I have had problems with past purchases of Schumacher products.So I was worried about getting this charger, but this charger works perfectly for me.In the last 2 months I've use most every feature it has, and they all work really well.The transformer inside sounds like a good one, very quiet and smooth sounding.When in 100 amp jump assist mode, it doesn't sound like it's struggling, like some others I've had (other Schumacher chargers, older models).It charges really well, it can charge fast or slow, and I really like the floating feature (self adjusting). It automatically monitors the level of charge that your battery's in, and will lower the charging rate when within 80% to 90% of full charge.It also will show your your batteries charge capacity, in a percentage form.So when in charging mode, and it says your battery is fully charged, you can switch to the percentage readout, and that will tell you how much more your battery can actually take.This is very helpful because automatic battery chargers never fully charge a battery, they will charge to within about 85% of the batteries full capacity, then stop charging.With the percentage readout, and with the charger set to trickle, or slow charge, I can fully charge my battery, to it's true full capacity!My favorite feature on this charger is it's slow, and variable charge rate. This is what I use in the winter, because sometimes I don't even start my 2002 Ford Windstar for 3 or 4 days, and in very cold weather this can spell trouble, so I hook it up and run the charger in 2>6amp slow charge, and set the readout to percentage. When the battery reaches a 100% charge, the charger automatically switches into maintenance mode, to keep your battery topped off.I've used this charger this way about half a dozen times now, and my battery couldn't be happier!Me as well.I do understand others that have had problems with Schumacher products, and not wanting to go through another return, or be let down by the purchase they just made.I can tell you that this is actually one of the best battery chargers I've had.Great battery charger, at a great price.This one is packed with many features.Works with both 6 volt, and 12 volt batteries, plus a engine start mode (but only 100 amps)I do highly recommend this battery charger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10TAE45N8H8BK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISKYBRM#wasThisHelpful","R10TAE45N8H8BK","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very nice set for a no name brand!High quality, with a wide range of sizes (1/4"" to 7/8""), just well made wrenches at a great price!This is a full and complete set of Offset double Box End wrenches.The quality is very good, as I've been punishing them for 3 months now, with no signs of weakening, or bending.They all fit there corresponding fastener very well, zero slippage, nice tight fit for plenty of torque.They're not polished, about equal to your standard Craftsman set.Plenty strong for any task where you'd need to use a offset wrench.I've used mine in situations where I didn't need one, but used it anyways, to test the amount of force I could apply, without damaging anything, and they performed excellently, no failures, no bends or breakage.These are great for the budget minded buyer, and are made with quality to be able to use every day, to there full potential. I needed a new set, because over the years, I've lost, left, or misplaced some of mine, and I wasn't ready to spend 10 times the cost for a polished set of SnapOn, or SK's. If I had the extra cash, those would be my first choice! But all in all, these are just fine, and work very well.Update:I was going to buy the sister set to this SAE set, until I found these: 6mm - 22mm 8 Piece High Quality Metric Offset Box Wrench Set with Heavy Duty Pouch, these are a TOP Quality set of Professional grade offset wrenches, and well worth the low cost of $49.99 + $4.99 shipping, these are an excellent buy!!!

"This is the exact same light thats featured  here & offered by Amazon: Drive Medical Light, I know because I bought BOTH at the same time. Trying to find the best light for my Mothers walker, both are very disappointing (not bright at all), but at least the Drive Medical Light only costs $9.23, with free shipping, and offered by Amazon.For a cheep little attachable light, it's not a bad deal for only $9.23, but for $27.45, this company (Just Home Medical), is taking you to the cleaners!!!I'm writing this review because I hate it when companies take advantage of buying customers.It's a very dim, and cheaply made light to start with. Both are about as bright as a 5 watt night light. Both are built and made exactly the sameMy 86 year old Mother who frequently gets up in the middle of the night, needs a descent light for her walker.The dark can be dangerous for her, so I was hoping to find a good quality, and a bright enough light, that I could attach to her walker. I have it done now, but not with this light.I actually got what I needed buy looking for Bike headlights. I found a good light, and a clamping device that attaches directly to the tubing of the walker, thats adjustable, both vertically and horizontally. The flashlight just snaps in place. It works excellently.This is what I purchased for my Moms walker: Refun(TM) LED Zoomable Bike Head Light, and she loves it.In my opinion, both this light and the Drive Medical light fall short in quality, and brightness.But at least the identical light from Drive Medical, doesn't try to over charge you.$27.45 (this one) v.s. $9.23 (Drive Medical Light)When I first saw this light, in person, in my hands, my heart just hit the floor, knowing I was just ripped off, and already have an identical light, and the only difference is some ink spelling out a name, and a basic overall color.Please don't spend the $27.45 they are asking for this light, if you really want to try this light, buy it for 10 bucks from Drive Medical.

"Really nice fitting underwear, very comfortable, and holds it's size & elasticity after washings.I've mostly worn BVD's and loved em, but they are very hard to find now, if at all?So after a while I tried Jockey underwear, and have not liked them from the start.There waist bands would actually wrinkle, and stay that way, which made wearing them very uncomfortable.Plus there material was very thin, and they did not give me good wear life.I first just bought 1 pack of these to try, and fell in love with them right away.There make, and design reminded me of my old BVD's.These Dockers use very good quality cotton material, and thick material as well.These feel great against your skin! Very soft.They have great quality waist bands, that keep there flat shape, and they retain there elasticity in both, there waist band, and leg openings. I really love the high quality of Dockers underwear.They have the traditional fly, instead of some of the other name brands that use under and over flaps, which I hate. I like the traditional fly much better! I don't see why any other manufacturer would even try using a different design?The Bottom Line...is these are very high quality, 100% Cotton, Very well made, and $15.00 for 4 pair is a great deal. I'm very happy with them and am sure others would be to.Update 5-23-15After multiple washings, these have stayed true to size, and have become even more comfortable.I did find some new BVD's and bought a 3 pack (more expensive), in comparing them with these Dockers, they fall FAR short, in every way! Comfort, material thickness, sewing quality, elastic bands...all areas in the BVD's were very disappointing. The Dockers are a very high quality product, and will stay with these in the future.

"Very well made, high quality, and extremely comfortable work out pants!!!They hang very nicely from your waist, and look sharp as well.These pants are made really well, the sewing is excellent.They are light weight, but the material feels very durable.They're made with 100% cotton, and I had a hard time finding that, these were the only ones I could find that were made totally from cotton.The waist band is also top quality, it a nice wide waist band at 3 inches wide, so it really helps in keeping these up where they belong! The 3 inch waist band holds very snug, without being, or feeling to tight.They hang well on you, and they look good to.They are a light weight work out pant, very cool to wear.The material is thin, but high quality, and should last you a good long time.They're plenty roomy, almost baggy, but not quite. I bought a baggy pair from Golds gym, and these are not as baggy as those, but still extremely comfortable.These are definitely an inside, or Spring and Summer pant. Cool and Comfortable!I highly recommend these workout pants!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O8G47CBL2GRE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001LNS7SC#wasThisHelpful","R1O8G47CBL2GRE","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This skill saw is a great addition to DeWalts 20V Max line of tools.My first reaction after using this skill saw for a while, was just WOW, this thing is Amazing!!!The motor they use is smooth as silk, and powerful.I was hoping to wait till DeWalt incorporated there brushless motor into this skill saw.But I needed it, so I bought it. Man am I happy I did, I really LOVE this skill saw!This is a superb saw!It has all of the features and power of a Top Quality corded skill saw, and it's light weight, with the 4Ah & 5Ah batteries, it does the work of a heavy duty skill saw.I've been in construction since 1980, and have used most all light and heavy duty power tools. This Skill Saw ranks among the best I've used, in cordless saws.Just remember your blade choice is the most important factor in how effective this saw will perform. Please see my blade recommendation below.Others have commented on it's longevity with there batteries (1.5Ah & 2Ah batteries), regarding they drain fast. The smaller DeWalt batteries are going to drain faster. This skill saw is powerful, and puts a heavy load on the batteries. With this saw, you need the High Capacity 4Ah & 5Ah batteries (model 204 & 205). This saw will work with any and all of DeWalts 20V Max batteries, but the lower capacity batteries aren't recommended.I only use DeWalts 4.0Ah and 5.0Ah batteries, and with those, I can use this skill saw all day long, with 1 battery lasting most of the day, and usually all of the day.Features:-This skill saw has a blade break, which is a very nice feature in any skill saw. As soon as you release the trigger, the break engages, and stops the blade from spinning within seconds.-This skill saw also directs the cut material away from the user, and away from your line of sight.-This skill saw has the ability to cut from a directly perpendicular (90 degrees), and also can cut up to a 50 degree angle.-This is a nice light weight skill saw, and that greatly cuts the fatigue you would feel from using a traditional skill saw, all day long.-This skill saw allows for a direct line of sight to the blade and working surface. This is much like the design of a worm drive saw (a Roofers Saw), the design of most all other skill saws have the motor and the blade on opposite sides, so the skill saw operator would need to look over the top of the saw, to see his work surface. This is Not the case with this DeWalt Skill Saw!-The front and the main handle has a rubber over mold, and this gives the operator a great and comfortable grip on the skill saw. This makes it safer, and easier to control.Blade choice is important!-This skill saw uses a standard 5/8ths inch arbor, which gives the owner a wide selection of blade choices.There is a LOT of new blades out today that use think kerf cuts. This means the width of the cut is very thin, usually about 1/16th of an inch thick. Just know that these are basically cheap, and throw away blades.You also need to know, the thinner the tooth, the faster it will dull.-Please see Blade recommendation below-This blade here: Vermont American 6-1/2-Inch 40T Smooth Cut Carbide Teeth Circular Saw Blade, is one of the best blades you can buy for this saw. It's an extremely high quality blade, and the same blades that I use professionally, every day. It can be resharpened many times before needing replacement. It's very sharp, and uses very high quality carbide teeth.I Very Highly recommend this saw blade!To end, this DeWalt skill saw is a Professional Quality skill saw, and will last you for many many years.Everything about this skill saw is very high quality, and built very well.Very Highly Recommended!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8FM4HHTJSW1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007NVSTO8#wasThisHelpful","R8FM4HHTJSW1V","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm really impressed with this cordless jigsaw!!!I've been doing construction work (of various types), for over 30 years.This DeWalt cordless jigsaw is absolutely amazing, in both quality and durability.With a 4 or 5 Ah battery, it's very strong and powerful.The motor in it, sounds just as smooth as the best corded jigsaws.This is a compact jigsaw, and I'm really at a loss of words about how nice this saw is.The build of this jigsaw is ""Professional"" quality.It's extremely easy to use, and changing the blade is done completely without any tools, just very convenient!This saw is very tough, and should last most anyone, many years of use.Even on a daily basis.With some of the larger capacity DeWalt batteries, this jigsaw will run for a very very long time.The rubber over-molded handle makes for a excellent non-slip grip.The adjustable base comes with a removable plastic guard...very handy!This jigsaw has most every option as the best corded jigsaws, it even has a blow tube to clear the surface, to follow a line easily without any material buildup.Everything about this jigsaw is professional quality, and I'm really overly impressed.I really wasn't expecting such a nice and powerful saw, but thats what I got, and I'm really happy with it! Absolutely no buyers remorse.I've been using power tools all my life, and this jigsaw ranks up among the best I've used.Just please note, this is the jigsaw only, no batteries, charger, or case comes with it.For this tool, I'd highly recommend the 4Ah or the 5Ah DeWalt batteries.Very Highly recommended!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9E0FZSVKTRKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007NVSSFS#wasThisHelpful","R9E0FZSVKTRKR","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another excellent flashlight from NiteCore!Very powerful & packed with features.Comparing to the TM11 & the TM15, this one is even shorter.It's 4 & 15/16th's inch long, with a diameter of 2 inches (2 inches from end to end, there is no flare out for the reflector housing). Very compact!It's run with 4x 18650 li-ion (Protected) batteries.I use Orbtronic 3600mAh Protected cells.This flashlight emits a pure white light, with no blueish or yellowish tints to the light.The ""Turbo"" setting is simply another click on the selector button, you don't need to hold down any button or switch for Turbo mode.When in Turbo, it's extremely bright! I own many high powered flashlights, and this one is now the brightest of them all. Even brighter than my TK75. The throw isn't the best (still not bad) because it's more of a flood light. It does have a good size and very defined hot spot, with excellent peripheral spill light.It's peripheral spill light is really pretty amazing!It has 5 levels of brightness, and 3 hidden modes.All 5 levels of brightness can be controlled by the side button (Even the Turbo Mode), so all though they advertize that you need to simultaneously push the side button and the back power button to access the Turbo Mode, ""You Don't""!All levels are all controlled by the side switch/button.The brightness levels are: Very low, Low, Medium, High, Turbo.When you hold in the side button for 3 seconds, it first switches to Strobe Mode.Hold for 3 more seconds to enter SOS mode.Hold for 3 more seconds for Beacon mode.One click to exit the hidden modes.The runtimes are ANSI FL1 standards, as follows:3 lumens-433hrs/160 lumens-25hrs/480 lumens-9hrs/1500 lumens-3hrs,15min/3800 lumens-45min.All runtime tests were run using 4, 2600mAh Protected Li-ion batteries.Which is why I use Orbtronic 3600mAh Protected batteries...Longer runtimes!The rear tail button/switch is the On/Off control, and is also used for momentary on.I really like the rear button, due to this flashlights short profile.The rear button On/Off/Momentary On switch also has a built in memory circuit.So what ever mode, or level of brightness, you turn it off in, is what it will start up in, when you hit the On/Off button.This is another very well built/crafted flashlight from NiteCore.It's built to be extremely rugged. It's IPX-8 waterproof, and 1.5M impact resistant.It's easy to use one handed, not to heavy at all.This is an excellent addition to the ""Tiny Monster"" line up!It's also my favorite, and I have the TM11 and the TM15.I know it's an expensive flashlight, so probably not a good choice for everybody.But for the Lumen nuts, and Flashaholics, (like myself), it's well worth the cost!I consider this flashlight a must have, and have no buyers remorse.For me, this is a perfect flashlight. I love the larger hot spot, and how this flashlight acts more like a flood, than a spotlight, and the peripheral spill light is very bright.To end, this is one tough flashlight, this is a super Bright flashlight, the build quality is second to none.

"So far this stylus pen is the best overall performer, from the ones I've tried so far!It's very accurate, and my Moto G 2nd Gen (2014 version), is very responsive while using this stylus.From notes, to writing, and simple dragging and dropping Apps in folders, this stylus works the best for me.So far I've used 3 other bargain brands, (2 of which have the Hybrid, microfiber tip).My initial concern was to find a stylus with a slimmer tip, for use with texting.I've tried the Bargain Depot Premium brand with the Hybrid Miro-knit Fiber tip Stylus/Styli, Length 5.5""Slim Barrel, and although they worked well, they do occasionally drop apps while dragging them, and sometimes won't register while typing.What drew me to this stylus was the thinner tip, and I was interested it this Hybrid microfiber tip.They do seam to glide across the touch screen easier than a silicone tipped stylus.These did come close to my top pick, but the Targus stylus tip is a bit smaller, although a bit stickier, when sliding across the touch screen.Another stylus with a microfiber tip is the The Friendly Swede Extra Long Premium XXL Micro-Knit Hybrid Fiber Tip.This stylus also has some problems with not registering on my touch screen, loosing apps as I drag them, and thought the stylus and tip look small in there picture, there actually much bigger than you'd think, so for me, not a good stylus for typing.These were my least liked stylus.The 3rd I tried was the one that came with my smart phone, and it has the same problems as the other 2 mentioned above, dropping things as you drag them, and it has a large silicon capacitive tip, so it's a bit harder to use to type with.So far this Targus Ultrabook Stylus has had very few of the above mentioned problems. Plus it does have a much more narrow tip (great for typing), and it feels good in your hand (good weight).It measures about 6 inches long, and has the smallest tip I could find, without spending a load of cash.So well worth the cost!I really like it, and an sure others would as well.So I do recommend this stylus over the others I mentioned above.I am interested in an active stylus, but they cost much more, so they'll have to wait for now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35YVAU9XHOSR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0098QVS08#wasThisHelpful","R35YVAU9XHOSR4","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are the best, high quality sweat pants I've ever had!Warm, but not overly so. Perfect for retaining heat on those cold days!The quality of these pants are excellent, a top quality sewing job, and the size fits perfectly.They have a nice & extra wide waist band (2 full inches), with a sewn in tie.I always look for sweat pants with the wide waist band, they just seam to be made better, and the wider width really helps with keeping them up, and in place when active.I also really like the open bottom legs, rather than an elastic band cuff.The fit is great, and I love how loose they feel, a very relaxed fit, they're somewhat baggy, but not overly so, and the fleece inside is super soft feeling on your legs. They hang really well on you, just very nice fitting sweat pants.They are warm, but not a heavy material at all, it's really quite light feeling.Just great for that cold day, of around the house work, or just lounging around.I wear then for running out on errands, and even when guests stop by.All around, very nice looking sweat pants!So the short of it is, they're made very well, and look equally nice.They seam to be made to last a very long time, so equally tough.High quality, excellent sewing, great fit, made to last, everything you'd want!I've bought 4 pair and am very happy with all of them.Not to many colors to choose from, but enough (more would be nice).The Carbon Heather color is extremely nice looking, and my favorite!Highly recommended!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C9Q97EKXQ8X0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JX9U9K#wasThisHelpful","R3C9Q97EKXQ8X0","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Fosmon case/holster provides a very high level of protection for your Moto G 2nd Gen Smart Phone. Designed to be Very Tough, with 3 separate layers of shock absorbing defense. Plus it has a excellent, & very positive non-slip grip. Super quality for a low price. Affordable, and great looking!!!The Moto G 2nd Gen (2014) Smart Phone is my very first smart phone. After a few days of use, I absolutely fell in love with this phone. So finding the best holster for it became my biggest priority, focusing on high protection! I'll elaborate more, about this holster below.The build of this holster is Top Quality, using Top Quality materials, and should last the life of your phone, and then some!It's also very sharp looking, and at a minimal, and unbelievably low price of between $7 to $9 dollars (thats including shipping costs), it's more than worth the cost for such a high quality case and holster. I'd really expect to pay double of what this holster costs, due to it's quality build and very high level of protection.Once you have your phone inserted into it's protective case (comes with this holster), it then slides fairly easy into the holster, and fits in it nice and securely. With this holster you wont need to worry about it slipping out, from any bump or jarring.When your phone is in this holster, it sits very close to your side, so very little chance of getting it snagged or knocked around from anything.The holster uses a spring loaded hing to attach to your belt, or pocket. It's a very good quality latch, that wont break because of over use. I like it much better than the others that use the same style hing and latch, but instead of using a actual spring, they designed it with bendable tension plastic, which is much stiffer, and much harder to use.The protection of the case that fits your Moto G 2nd Gen is second to none!It's made of very high quality silicone, and is excellent for shock absorption. Then that soft shell has a hard skeleton shell that fits around it, and that also has soft silicone ribs on the outside of the skeleton shell, for a complete non-slip grip.It does make the phone feel a bit thicker, but still fits your hand nicely, and extremely non-slip.You might think with all this padding and protection, the buttons would be hard to push, but they're not, they're still very responsive to your touch, thats the beauty of the high quality silicone!There are others that are equal and/or slightly different, if this one holds your phone to tight, but I prefer that so it doesn't slip out.Here is one thats Identical to this Fosmon Holster: E LV Dual Layer Armor Defender Holster Case Cover, this holster is equal in every way.This one here: Townshop[TM] Extreme Rugged Heavy Duty Impact Armor Hybrid Holster & Case, it has a shinny finish to it, and it slips out of it's holster very easy.But this last one may be a target for thugs to easily pop out and steal.Smart phones are targeted by thieves of all kinds these days, so be careful.The Fosmon is my favorite, and will continue to use it.I just love everything about this case & holster, and it just works well with the Moto G 2nd Gen.I would highly recommend this to all who own a Moto G 2nd Gen!!!It's one of the best holsters I've seen and used, and I love mine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P7VEYVPMAAAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PHIQKE0#wasThisHelpful","R3P7VEYVPMAAAG","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Please keep in mind that this is my first Smart Phone, and saying that, I absolutely ""LOVE"" this phone!!!This Moto G 2nd Gen gets very good & clear sound, it has the best sound quality of any past cell phone I've had, (again, never had a Smart Phone before this one).The quality of reception is excellent! I live in a rural area (lots of farming fields), but get a very strong signal, and before, that was a problem in this area. Although this phone is only a 3G & not a 4G LTE, it's still plenty fast enough for me.The build quality of this phone is also excellent, and very easy to install my Sim Card, and an extra 32Mb micro SDHC card, I chose the SanDisk Extreme PRO 32GB. It's very affordable, and one of the fastest SDHC cards made. Plus I've been using SanDisk storage cards of all kinds, for many many years, and have never been let down.This phone has a good weight to it, without being to heavy to handle. Very solid phone build!I've always liked Motorola & Samsung, for good quality cell phones.This one does not disappoint at all. Absolutely Zero buyers remorse!The features on this Moto G 2nd Gen are wide ranging and many.As this is my first smart phone, I found it easy enough to set up, and have been learning how to do things each day. The ability to connect to my Wi-Fi network really makes it easy on my phone plan, (I use Consumer Cellular). So while at home, all of my calls, data, and messaging, are unlimited, and all free, through my Wi-Fi.The phone plan usage takes affect only when I use it on the road. So it's very economical for me!When I turn it on, it automatically seeks out and connects to my Wi-Fi network, and when I leave the house, it automatically switches to the cell towers.This smart phone is basically a hand held computer, and very fast in my opinion, (again, never had a phone with a quad core processor in it).The battery life is just Ok, but when I stop playing with it, I'm sure it will last me far longer.This phone does everything I need, and much much more!This is a great smart phone at a great price.So for what it's worth, I'd highly recommend this phone.Update (12/13/2014)Man, I tell ya, the more I use this Moto G 2nd Gen, the more I Love it!!!This thing really is a handheld computer, and there's just so many very useful Apps, it's unbelievable.I also very highly recommend getting this Holster:Fosmon Shock Absorbing, Hybrid Holster Cover and Case, for Motorola Moto G (2nd Generation, 2014)I did a lot of searching for a good holster, for my new Moto G 2nd Gen Smart Phone, and it had to have good protection, without breaking the Bank!This Case/Cover Holster is all that and more!I was just amazed at how nice this Holster is for the incredibly low price.It provides Excellent protection for my phone.Take a look at it, and it comes in different colors, other than Black.I think it's an excellent holster for the Moto G 2nd Gen!!!If your looking for a great protective case, rather than a holster, I first bought this one:LK  - Rugged Armor SpiderIt's an excellent case for this Moto G 2nd Gen!It also provides a high level of protection, with excellent materials, and great cushioning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L444TC06CRPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWI4F0O#wasThisHelpful","R1L444TC06CRPU","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Rugged Armor Spider 2 in 1 Defender is an excellent case/phone protector!It provides maximum protection, with minimal bulk added to your phone.This case protector fits the Moto G 2nd Gen (2014 model, with 5 inch display) perfectly.A.K.A Moto G EXT, purchased from Consumer Cellular.The whole cover is a rubber like material (Silicone), and very non-slip. So it's very easy to hold onto your phone with this protector. The ribs are a added benefit, which makes it even easier to hold, especially if your bumped into while your using your phone, or any other type of body jarring episode. It's simply really well designed, and as I said earlier, it fits the Moto G 2nd Gen perfectly.It also has a kickstand, which I use a lot when playing short videos for other family members.The kickstand is a great feature, and well thought out.It was 1 buying point for me, since I knew I'd use it a lot.The 2nd buying point was the overboard protection of the case itself, with very good shock absorption.The 3rd buying point was it's price, as there are many other case/protectors, with much less protection, but at a higher price.The addition of the free Stylus Pen was a nice bonus gift, which I use a lot, when at home sending texts or emails.In my opinion this product is easily a 5 star item, and I highly recommend it to anyone considering this case for there Moto G (2nd Gen) Smart Phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX18E9G4AT40P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NMA9XZS#wasThisHelpful","RX18E9G4AT40P","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Phenomenal & Professional saw blade!Professional & Exceptional quality made saw blade!For a skill saw that requires a 6.5 inch blade, this is the best choice you can make.It's made in the USA, it's carbide teeth are fully re-sharpenable, and the carbide used for the teeth, is the highest quality carbide (there are many different grades of carbide used for saw teeth). These carbide teeth can even be replaced if broken off, by the company that resharpens your blades.The kerf cut is 1/8 inch, a little on the heavy side.This alone will give you plenty of resharpenings, which means a long life and a lot of use!When you do need to get it resharpened, go to a machine shop that does it, and not one that says they CAN sharpen it for you.Blades can be sharpened poorly, so make sure they specialize in resharpening circular saw, and/or table saw blades!This is one of the highest quality blades I've used, and have been in custom cabinets, and remodeling for many many years (30+). This is a Professional Quality blade!The 40 tooth count gives you that smooth cut, with very, very minimal chipping (if any).This makes it perfect for use on paneling, pre-finished plywood (Oak, Maple...), and also it's equally great when cutting any solid surface material, like Corian.This blade has a 5/8th's arbor, and works perfectly in my Dewalt 20V Max Skill Saw.The blade body is standard thickness, not one of those thin kerf throw away blades.I just got 2 new ones and they should easily last me for at least 3 years or more with proper care, and with medium duty use.Even with heavy, and everyday use, the 2 of these will last about 2 years.Vermont American makes Top Quality blades of all sizes, and I would recommend them all, and to anyone who asks!Vermont American is easily one of the highest quality saw blade makers. You can walk into the smallest cabinet shop, and the largest cabinet manufacturer, and I can guaranty you, they're using Vermont American saw blades.You wont be disappointed!!!I was pleasantly surprised I found them here on Amazon!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O9NYBA1P4D2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004YX9Z#wasThisHelpful","R1O9NYBA1P4D2E","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Extremely bright, pure white lights, and really easy to install!A great investment for any car or truck.It probably took me a little while longer to install these, due to cold hands.But if you can change your normal halogen headlight bulbs, then you can install these just as easy.The only extra step is to mount a ballast (a small one), and it just screws to any open area near your headlight. 3 small screws and your done mounting the ballast.The wire connections are easy to see, and pretty self explanatory. Each connection uses a different style plug (3 connections to make). This way, no mistakes are possible.These LED headlights really are plug & play...just really easy to install.35 minutes and I was done.These headlights are super bright, with 2600 lumens on low beam, and 3200 lumens on high beam.They use Cree LED's so you can be confident they are the best made.The color is listed as being 6500k, but other reviews I've read, including my mechanics boards and flashlight forums, all say these are measured closer to 5600k and 5700k, but that is still a excellent color/temp.These are a Pure White light, they have absolutely no bluish tint to them (or any other color tint for that matter), just a very nice pure white light.I call these an investment because they will last you for a very long time!They're advertized here as having a 25,000 hour life span, but the paperwork I received with my kit says 30,000 hours.So either way, these will last for many many years to come!Thats double the life span of a LL (long life) Halogen headlight, that comes standard with new cars today, and the LL Halogen headlights are only 50% or less, as bright.There 5 year Hassle-Free Warranty is great, and if any problems do arise, you also get lifetime customer support.So to sum it up, you get very high quality (Cree) LED headlights that are super bright (easily replacing any HID lights).Being LED's, you get the long life that an LED gives you. So no worries about burning out.Plus these are super easy to install.You also get the added benefit of these running on much lower power draw than normal halogen or HID headlights, which means less strain on your alternator.I just love mine, and will recommend them to everyone who asks me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30FPXOP4EUR8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOR4DEQ#wasThisHelpful","R30FPXOP4EUR8H","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For a gas additive, this is one of the best.For me, I didn't start using this for more horsepower, and to this day, I've had no fuel injector problems at all.But this product helps improve my gas mileage, and can keep down, and eliminate carbon deposits, so for me it's worth every penny! It also acts as a gas stabilizer, making it possible to store emergency generator gas for 2 years or more.I say it's worth every penny because it's so concentrated, just 1 - 8oz. bottle will last you for a very long time. I had to double check the amount to make sure I was reading the bottle correctly.Just 1/4 oz. of this will treat 20 gallons of gas. Thats just amazing to me!So considering how far just 1 bottle will go, and considering all of the listed benefits this additive can give to your vehicle, it's an excellent bargain for anyone using it.I now keep half a bottle in my road emergency kit/bag, for easy access when I need to stop for gas.I also use AR9100-8 ~ Archoil Friction Modifier 8oz, (there oil additive), which is also one amazing product!Now that I'm using both, in an engine that just turned 50,000 miles, I'm really very impressed with Archoil products.I highly recommend both products, for everyone to use on a regular basis.If you can save some gas money, and extend your engines life, why not!Great stuff.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YR1R06VT9WJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005WWO7YQ#wasThisHelpful","R1YR1R06VT9WJM","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first reaction, after adding this to my oil....Wow!!!This stuff is amazing.I initially let my Van (3.8L V6), sit for about half an hour, after adding this to my oil (Mobil 1). I just had my last oil change about a month ago.Then after starting the engine, I noticed from the start, it slowly became more and more quiet. Just a much smoother idle & smoother running.This is all with the hood up, and standing directly over the engine.Once I closed the hood, I let it idle for about 3 to 4 minutes, then took it out for a drive. Plenty of time to warm up the engine, and get everything circulating, and mixed up good.I did notice that the engine actually sounded different, just softer, much more quiet, and simply a better running engine.The difference in my Van is pretty dramatic. Well worth the cost, and is going to be part of every oil change, from now on.I've read all of the other reviews, and now I really understand why they talk so highly about this oil additive.Adding this to every oil change (for only about $20.00), is a really easy decision to make, now that I've actually used it, and I've seen, first hand, how it really helps, smooths out and quiets your engine.Plus this is also an additive for your transmission fluid, your differential case fluid, and your power steering fluid.They give you the proper amounts you should add (in conjunction with each capacity amount), right on the bottle, and both easy to read and understand directions.I'd now recommend this additive to everyone who owns a vehicle on the planet!This is definitely going to be used in the next oil change for my home generator.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QI0YTAZCVIWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005UNQXOE#wasThisHelpful","R3QI0YTAZCVIWN","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent roll-up for your wrench sets!It's made of all canvas, and really well made, at that.The canvas is thick, and some have spoke to that (in there review), as a negative, but this is a really good thing!It will last a very long time, and also given time, the canvas will become easier to roll up.Plus being made out of thick canvas, it's very durable.About the only improvement I can think of, is it would be nice if this had an additional 2 slots, so a 16 slot tool roll-up.Because with both my SAE and Metric sets, I have a couple of extra wrenches, (Large Ones), and I could use the extra slots.Having my wrenches in these roll-ups, I now have a lot more useable room in my chest drawer.If you want to hang this roll-up on a workbench pegboard, the grommets are very good quality, and will easily support a full set of wrenches.I've been looking for some good quality wrench roll-ups, and now I'm really glad I found, and chose these!Another great quality product from Arsenal!I highly recommend this roll-up to everyone who asks me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W0SBUQSAD2B9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001G8XIG8#wasThisHelpful","R3W0SBUQSAD2B9","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"High quality/High performance air filter!Great upgrade to your old OEM filter, and the last one you'll ever buy.Just clean when dirty.They recommend a cleaning at 50,000 miles, and sooner if in a rural/country setting, or simply running on dirt roads frequently, so I'd say 30,000 to 35,000 miles in a continually dusty environment. This filter also provides better air flow, which translates to better gas mileage, and more horsepower...better acceleration.It fits perfectly in my 2002 Ford Windstar (3.8L V-6 engine).It's no easy task putting it in, since everything is so crammed together, on a sideways sitting V6 engine. Just no room to maneuver your hands for any wiggle room. But with some stubbornness, and persistence,  you can do it!I'll be checking my gas mileage for the next 60 days or so, and I hope to see an improvement.This is a much better quality filter than your standard Fram, but it should be, due to it's cost!I really haven't noticed any improvement in pickup (possible a little), I mainly bought it so I can keep it, and just wash when needed. So no need to keep replacing it when it gets dirty. I am looking forward to seeing if it does give me better gas mileage.All in all, it's a great air filter.Very high quality, durable, it should last the life of your vehicle, washable/reusable, with much better air flow than your stock/OEM filters.I'd highly recommend it!Update 1/1/2015I've really enjoyed checking the gas mileage, because I've seen a good 10% to 13% increase in mileage, I see the biggest increase when on the highway. The horsepower is much more subtle, but very noticeable when passing on the highway, not so much from a dead stop.

"This is a very thorough set of 1/2"" drive, metric sockets.They're SK's, so Made in the USA! Always a plus for me.Very High Quality!All are 6 point sockets, and I described them as being a thorough set because they are complete, from 10mm to 24mm, and every size in between, No left out sizes.Many other sets you find will say 14 pieces set, or 15 piece set, but those sets always seam to skip some sizes, like the 19mm, 21mm, 23mm, and others.This set doesn't, it has them all, it's a full 10mm to 24mm...Complete Set!Now this is just my opinion, but I think 6 point sets are the best (for most, but not all situations). You'll have ZERO problems with rounding, due to the torque being applied to the flat side of the bolt or nut, instead of the point of the bolt or nut. So if my ratchet has enough room, I always grab my 6 point sockets.I've been using SK sockets, drives, and wrenches for many many years, and I can say they""re still the same, Extremely high Quality tools, now, as they were years ago.A big plus is they don't come in a thin & disposable display case. These come in a hard plastic carrying case, which is a nice extra for me.If your looking for a high quality socket set, this is it, and for under $100.00, it's also a great deal.I'd expect to pay $50.00 to $75.00 more for a set like this, so I'm very happy with this purchase!Another plus, is all SK products I've ever owned come with a ""Full"" Lifetime Warranty, and not a ""Limited Lifetime Warranty"".This socket set also comes with a FULL LIFETIME warranty, so if you ever snap a socket, or damage it somehow? Just walk it into any Hardware Store that sells SK tools, and they will honor that warranty, on the spot, no receipt needed.Also, as said, this is a socket set, so it doesn't include a ratchet. If you do need a good ratchet, and if your looking for an extended ratchet, I can tell you this one here is simply wonderful!!!I own one to, and really LOVE it!SK 40170 1/2-Inch Drive 15-Inch Professional Reversible Ratchet, this ratchet is smooth and solid! Plus it's longer than a standard ratchet, normally in the 10 inch range, this one gives you an addition 5 inches, for added force/torque. You can do a lot more with a ratchet this size than a standard size ratchet, much less reaching for your breaker bar!Being SK (yes, I am a little biased towards SK tools, simply because they are always so good), and made in the U.S.A. your getting one of the best ratchets made, with one of the best warranties in the business!SK is, and always has been, a great brand of Very High Quality tools.I'd VERY highly recommend these, to anyone looking for High Quality, metric 6 point sockets!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12R9HMFXQL4FM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007DFZ4G#wasThisHelpful","R12R9HMFXQL4FM","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very very bright light for night vision cameras, that can use a 850nm IR illuminator/emitter.I emailed my manufacturers Tech Support to find out if I needed a 850nm, or the 940nm emitter.There reply said my cameras were designed to see IR between 820nm and 870nm, so the 850nm emitter would work perfectly for my needs, and they added that my cameras would not see the 940nm emitter, since thats outside of it's IR optical range.As I said, this one is Very Bright, and I do really like the enclosure, being rated IP66, means it's dust tight/proof, and can take high pressure water jets, from all angles.But don't mistake that for being water proof! If it was rated IP68, or IP69, that would be water proof.The first digit indicates it's resistance to dust, the last digit is the indicator of it's water resistance.You can find that info online in various places. Also under commercial code enclosures.I only have 1 problem with this product, and it's not a big deal to me, so I didn't take any stars away from it's rating.It's regarding the hardware & design of the hardware.The enclosure is made of cast aluminum, and has a top notch finish applied to it.But cast aluminum does NOT hold tight and thin threaded screw hardware.With a very very minimum amount of torque, the screw that holds the fixture on the elbow joint, that has teeth on both halves, for adjustments, it immediately stripped. I'm talking about just a snugging up of the screw, not even considering tightening it yet, because I was checking the angle of the light.The screw itself is made of extremely cheap and soft metal, and it was threaded very fine.Now that with a cast aluminum enclosure, with a tapped hole, well, everything just went to hell, quickly and decisively!Luckily I keep nuts and bolts of all sizes on hand (in large amounts...lol).It was a very quick fix for me, I just got a hardened bolt (10/32), about a 1/4 inch longer than the original, and used a wax insert bolt to tighten it back together. All done.Also, for the mounting plate...""Pre-Drill"" the holes, before trying to just screw them in without a pre-drilled hole, or you'll strip out the Phillips head on the screw. Or better yet, either find, or buy some better/harder mounting screws!This is another oversight by the manufacturer. Still, not terribly bothersome to me.That was the only negative I ran across.This could be a major pain in the ass for those who don't have extra pieces and parts on hand, in case of a situation like this.If that were the case for me, I would have been pissed, knowing I would now need to make a trip to the hardware store for a single nut and bolt of good quality, which would probably cost more in gas, to drive into town & back, than the nut and bolt itself.So if this was a problem for others as well, I can understand the 2 and 3 star reviews.This is a nice unit, and would only cost a few cents more, for proper hardware.Pretty silly (and cheap) for a manufacturer, if you ask me!The power supply comes with this unit, so it's basically a mount, plug & play. Very easy!For me, this IR illuminator works excellent! On my cameras, in night vision, this 1 emitter looks like 2-150 watt Halogen flood lights, just oozing out light, everywhere!It's also a very nice and wide angle of light, and it does carry a good distance, but realistically, I think they are a little over confident in there claim of 300 to 400 feet. I can easily see a good 200 feet, possibly more, and like I said, with a nice wide spread.The light is very even in it's distribution of light. It's a true flood light. No hot spots, just a large area full of light.I'll upload a screen shot of the night vision.Well, apparently Amazon isn't posting customer pics anymore, but they are posting your uploaded picks in your own profiles, so to see my uploaded pic of this product throwing light, you'll need to go to my profile and look at it. It's currently at the top, so you don't have to scroll through a bunch of reviews.I do highly recommend this IR emitter to anyone asking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3266CG8ZPRQSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004F9LF7E#wasThisHelpful","R3266CG8ZPRQSW","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This knife really is a work of art!!! Just Beautifully crafted!!!The Super SOG Bowie is a very, very solid knife.Made with AUS 8 steel, it's very resistant to water/rust damage, yet still has a high carbon content.Plus with the TiNi finish, makes this blade that much more resistant to any and all environmental threats.The blade itself is a 7-1/2 inch long chunk of steel.It's slightly over 1/4 inch thick, and that 1/4 inch carries down to within 2-1/4 inches to the tip.It's also 1-1/2 inches wide, through most of the blade.Just an excellent blade, with beautiful lines.This Super SOG Bowie comes sharp as a razor blade, this is my 3rd SOG knife, and I still say that SOG delivers the best factory grind on a blade, that I've ever seen. I own quite a few knifes. A bunch of Ka-Bar knives, 3 Zero Tolerance locking folders, and some Buck knives.SOG, by far, comes with the cleanest and sharpest grind on there blades.Great Handle!!!They did a excellent job with the stacked leather handle, (just beautiful work).The handle is a full 5 inches long, and thats Not including the blade guard. So even with very large hands, this knife has plenty of room to get a good solid grip on it!The Super SOG Bowie, as a whole, is a great, great knife! The balance is very good, though the complete knife does carry some weight, I still find it easy enough to use and handle.This really is the perfect choice for a hunter carry knife, even if, for the only reason, if your other means of protection/hunting failed, I.E. riffle, handgun, this Super SOG Bowie will dispatch a dangerous animal quickly, and you can depend on this knife.I simply LOVE this knife, and would buy it again tomorrow, if I lost mine.The Super SOG Bowie comes with a very nice & heavy leather sheath, and the sheath has a leather (sewn on) pouch for a sharpening stone, and the sharpening stone is also included.This Super Bowie is a Home Run for SOG, one Spectacular Bowie Knife!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29YAM7EFYIYHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JVQT3M#wasThisHelpful","R29YAM7EFYIYHT","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Ka-Bar Bowie Hunter is just Ok...I'm a little hesitant to review this knife, but I'll give your some data thats not in the description page anywhere, some basic facts, and a few of my opinions, then you can make up your own mind, if this knife is for you, or not?This is definitely not a crap knife, as some say it is.However, I do agree, it's also definitely not up to Ka-Bar standards, which with the Ka-Bar name, you'd expect a tough, no-nonsense, heavy duty, do it all knife. This knife is not any of that.It's a ""Show knife"".It comes completely polished up, very shiny. They do a very nice job at this!It's a traditional Bowie style blade.The blade is 7 inches long, 1.25 inches wide, and 1/8th inch thick.The steel is AUS-6, and it's a little softer than I'd like to see in a hunting/skinning knife.For a blade with these dimensions, I'd think it really should have been at least 3/16th's thick, if it were going to be used for hunting and specifically, cleaning/skinning.At least in my opinion.But again, for a show knife, thats really all you need.Plus you need to remember, it's only a 43 dollar knife.The knife is solid and well made.There is absolutely no give in the handle (no bending, very solid and stable), thats the first thing I checked.The stacked leather handle is done well, and very nice looking.The blade guard does look like solid brass, and is also well polished.The aluminum pommel is polished, and attached using a solid 1/8th inch pin, so the partial, full length tang, is not a welded on wire, or rod, as another reviewer had stated, at least not in my case.It is a true ""Partial Full Length Tang"".For the cost, I really don't think you can expect that much more.It is a very nice looking knife, and it is a ""Show Knife"".It is well made, but honestly I don't know what I'd use it for, because it's just a very light weight knife, meaning, it's not meant for any type of over use, or abuse!Again, this is only my opinion.It's definitely not close to a Becker, or a military Fighting/Utility knife.The sheath is FAR less impressive!Lastly, this is a very light knife (light in weight), so this may make it more appealable to some? Less weight to carry, can be a big plus when ounces count.If your looking for a ""Top of the Line"" Full Tang Bowie, take a look at the SOG S10B-K Tech Bowie. It's one of the best!Very tough/strong, AUS-8 steel, Kraton G handle (synthetic rubber, both heat and chemical resistant), Comes shaving sharp, Holds an edge really well, 1/4 inch thick blade, and comes with a very nice Kydex sheath. The SOG Tech Bowie is what a Bowie knife should be. I Love mine!Yes it does cost more, but I think it's worth every penny!So you can make your mind up, if this knife is for you, or not.Being only 43 dollars, I really can't complain.It might make a nice gift to someone who collects knives?I am thinking of gifting mine.I do love Ka-Bar knives, I own 5 full tang, and a few other locking folders.That being said, I really can't recommend this knife, one way or another.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YWKQQLJQ98E0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000N36R4M#wasThisHelpful","R1YWKQQLJQ98E0","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love Mediabridge products!Always good quality, at an affordable price.I purchase this 3 foot ethernet cable and the 7 foot version, both work perfectly, and are of very high quality construction.I've bought many Mediabridge cables, of many different kinds in the past, and 2 things have always been true regarding Mediabridge cables.One, is that they're always reasonably priced.Two, is that they're always made to higher standards, more robust, just higher quality cables.They also have very good customer support (if needed).I'll continue to buy Mediabridge cables, as the need arises!Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TQLNWDPYFMKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BI06G1S#wasThisHelpful","R1TQLNWDPYFMKT","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, I can tell you my first thoughts of this product were, WOW...pretty impressive for only 10 bucks.But please keep in mind, this is my first night of trying these out.According to many other reviews, the IR array will start failing soon, and quickly become useless.I'm keeping an open mind, and will give these a fair chance.How it looks, and how it's build quality is...It's small/compact, it looks very well built, it has a nice & thin protective cover (a rubber or silicone of some type) over the impact resistant glass and around the front edge of the casing (aluminum or thick plastic of some kind?). The mounting bracket could have been made out of better/stronger material, it takes very little effort to bend. But all in all, the build looks solid and professional.Now for how well it works...I use a WiFi Dropcam Pro camera (multiple), and 1 that's set up inside my house, pointed out through a double pane window. Yes...I had to disable the built in IR illuminators, which was an easy task using some 3M electrical tape. Now, with this Dropcam Pro, I can still enable night vision, without getting a lens full of reflecting glare. I can also come close to seeing my entire front yard, with the exception of the far left, driveway, and mailbox. The second Etekcity Night Vision Illuminator, mounted just above the garage door, took care of lighting up the rest of the front yard. Excellent coverage for such a small IR unit.Now with both mounted, powered up, and working properly, my entire front yard is lit up like day time, and I can also see across the street, and see my neighbors house and fence line. I mean these things are crazy bright, and worth every penny of the 10 bucks each! The power cord was only an extra 8 bucks. Still a great deal to me, both being ""Prime"" so fast shipping and delivery.I easily get 60 feet of good illuminated views, probably more, haven't actually measured it.2 factors are going to determine if these will work well for you.1 is the quality of the camera your using, this really does make a huge difference.2 is if 850nm is the right wavelength for your camera.I only mention this because some of the bad reviews stated they saw little to no improvement, with there night vision, and this might be due to the cameras need for a different wavelength IR.So I can only speak from the point of a Dropcam Pro owner, these work excellent with the Dropcam Pro!Now all I can do is wait, and see when these burn out and become paper weights, which a lot of reviewers say happened to them.I'll update this review, if or when, either one fails on me, or if they keep running strong. I have a feeling there going to keep working just fine.For now, I love em!!! (I have 5 of these now).They work as described & expected...Very Nice.At this time, I would recommend these.Update 9-4-14:Shortly after buying the first 2, I bought 3 more.All (for the first 30 days), have performed perfectly.Zero loss of any IR array LED's. As bright as day one (all 5).Zero failures, Zero loss of any IR LED's.I'll keep updating this, since some say these didn't last a week, a Month, or up to 3 to 4 months.Or, I've also read that some will burn out 1 or 2 IR LED's a day, or every few days.Again, best 10 bucks I ever spent! (Per unit)Last Update: 1/1/2015Zero failures, great IR illuminators, at a great price!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33F4N9XX5MPGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EV6ABFS#wasThisHelpful","R33F4N9XX5MPGZ","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using the Netgear AC750 for a while now, and it has been wonderful!!!I love this WiFi extender, and everything about it!I know there are so many reviews about this particular networking device, that my review will most likely go un-read and un-noticed, and thats just fine with me. I mainly want to convey my satisfaction with this Netgear Extender, how well it works, and how easy it was (for me), to get running. I do emphasize the ""for me"" part, because I do have a lot of experience in setting up networks, and all of the security protocols.Setting up secure networks can be a very tricky job, even for the most savvy computer techs. Years ago, I was one of those that thought I knew it all, and tried to setup my first secure network...I screwed it up. I've been building PC's for years, and had no idea there was so much involved in setting up a network.So I read, and then read some more....and then even more...I say this because there are a lot of bad reviews for this Netgear Extender...A Lot!This really is, a very good piece of hardware.I have read about half of the bad reviews, and though it is unfortunate, I see that most, if not all, are due to user error, and nothing else, except for very poor customer service help from Netgear Support.I really do blame the poor customer support from Netgear, more so, than I do the user error. If your going to sell networking hardware, your need qualified support staff, and it seams as though Netgear is answering questions using poorly written, form letter style, cheat sheets, and not speaking from experience, as they should!Now with that said, they do have a ""genie"" that you can use to take you through the basic setup, and be done with it.I didn't, and haven't used there Genie, so I can't really comment on how well it works, or how good of a job it does.I set mine up in advanced mode. Well, I set up my router in advanced mode and then added my extender to it, but it works just great, and I use WPA2-PSK, AES.I've also got NAS enabled with MAC address filtering, among other features.My best advice would be, if your new to router setup, and extender additions, ask around your circle of friends, and see if you can find someone who's done this type of setup before, and see if they could come over for a bit and just take a look at what you have, and what you want to do.I use mine in a long ranch style home, with my router at the far west end.I know it should be centralized...but it's not.My network consists of 1-Netgear Router, this (AC750) Netgear Extender, 2 laptops, a couple of Apple products, and 4 WiFi enabled cameras (Dropcam Pro)My router covers most of my house very strongly. But...I have 1 Dropcam at the far, opposite end, and with a signal thats just slightly degraded, due to distance, thats where this extender comes into play.Now, what was a slightly pixelated video feed, is now a very sharp detailed video feed.This can be a hair pulling event, if your not prepared!!!Bottom line is, this is a very good WiFi extender, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who asked me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18RURHDIA22AD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HHRP11C#wasThisHelpful","R18RURHDIA22AD","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This latest BP monitor from Omron (BP791IT), is Excellent!!!In 2000, I started having blood pressure issues. My Doctor wanted me to monitor it while I was at work, and at home. He recommended the Omron BP monitor.The model I purchased has a power button, a start button, and a memory button,(the memory capacity was 12 readings, of blood pressure & heart rate).It came with the adult small cuff (D-ring style), carry bag, and external AC power adapter.I took it with me, once a year, to my doctors appointments, to be sure it was giving me accurate readings.It was right on the money, correct!It is still, today, working perfectly, and giving correct readings.Before anything happened to it, like rubber rot, cuff failure, or any kind of electronic failure, I wanted to make sure I had another, so I purchased this one (Omron 10 Plus Series), from Amazon.I love this new one, and all of the new options you can use!I do still monitor my blood pressure, but I'm also the primary care giver for my 86 year old Mother.This monitor (Omron 10+), lets me check and record readings for both me and my Mom, and thats hugely convenient for me and our doctor (we both see the same doctor).I haven't had this new one (the 10 plus), for very long, but right out of the box I checked it against my old monitor, which I know to be correct, and it is right on the mark correct, when checking both me and my Mom.I really love the ""Irregular Heartbeat Detector"" and the option of using the ""TruRead"" mode.I use the TruRead for the both of us, and having the irregular heartbeat detector, is a great piece of mind when taking my Moms BP readings.I also really like that it has a built in calibration checking system.Before buying this particular model, I did read all, or most of the 1 & 2 star reviews.I noted a continued complaint about the comfort fit cuff, and almost all of the bad reviews were based on this.I do have larger arms, over 13 inches, and the comfort fit cuff is very easy for me to use.However, I can see how it could be a problem for someone with skinny arms, and no help.When I use it on my Moms arm, it does take 2 hands to place and secure it properly.Other than that, I also read that some say it's to slippery to secure it to your own arm.I haven't had that problem, and it doesn't seam slippery to me.I've had only 1 single error reading, and found it was due to the wrong placement of the cuff.I had placed the blue alignment line, closer to the top of the arm, and not right in the middle.Once I corrected that, no more errors.So far I've found this new style of cuff very easy to use.I do like it better than the large adult cuff (with D-ring), that I've been using.It goes on both easier and quicker, and it is very comfortable.Omron has been a trusted name for many years now, and a top pick from Consumers Choice.I really like the Omron 10 Plus, and would quickly and highly recommend it to all who asked.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BSADD9R1DPEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H44GB4#wasThisHelpful","R1BSADD9R1DPEU","A39H7F511SV2AS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H7F511SV2AS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used the word frozen addicts because that is exactly what my 4yr old niece is.  She has watched the movie over 50 times and can almost recite it by heart.  I was thrilled to try this to see her reaction.  She is only 4 so I think her experience may have been better than some of the other reviewers with older children.  At 4 this really captured her attention and she played with it at least 4 times after we had installed it.There are 5 games that you answer questions on and then you play the game.  Her favorite was Jewelry making and after trying all the other games, she kept going back to that.

It is nice that you can take it right from the oven to the table.  Cooks evenly, is relatively light at about 4lbs.  My reason for the 4 star vs the 5 star is the price.

"My son has fairly severe acne and we have used many products to help clear it up.  He has been using the Proactiv treatment for about a week and a half and so far we really don't see that much change.  It has dried up his face and is flaky in some places but the acne is still very red and irritated.  I told him to stop using it this morning as I think it may be more irritating to his face.  I am not sure why as it is a very low dose benzoyl peroxide.  He may be allergic to it and I should have tested on him beforehand.  I also think the price at 90.00 is very high for this type of product.I have a neighbor who swears by it as it has cleared up both her daughters acne, so I guess it may work for some people.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REJEKTKYQF259/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K7P7FO2#wasThisHelpful","REJEKTKYQF259","A1I2U8NT5J6P1N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I2U8NT5J6P1N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have only worn false eyelashes a few times because the products I usually purchased from the drugstore, either lasted one or two times or the glue that comes with them are usually 1/2 dried when I try to apply it.  Those false eyelashes aren't cheap especially considering you will only get a few uses out of them.  These are beautiful and the compact that they come in is really nice.  It holds the glue, the eyelashes and is mirrored.  I had no trouble putting them on.  I didn't trim them until I put them on so I would see how much to trim.  I have big eyes, so I just cut a little off of the ends.I would also say this is a value, it is a bit more than drugstore lashes but I have had them on 4 times now and I have a ton of glue left and they still look new.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AJ9YUZP7OMHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00819ROA6#wasThisHelpful","R1AJ9YUZP7OMHS","A1I2U8NT5J6P1N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I2U8NT5J6P1N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the 2nd Ryder Creed novel in the series.  If you are a fan of Alex Kava and her Maggie O'dell books you will love this one.  I actually like this duo much better than the Maggie stand alone books.  The chemistry between the two is electrifying and you can't help root for Ryder since he is such a nice guy.  Seems non complicated on the outside but is actually very complex in the inside.It is a fast paced story dealing with events in the early 60's with a tie in to the Military and experiments today.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I really thought the ending left way too many questions unanswered and it was clear to me that the ending was just the beginning of book 3.  I really dont care for those endings with any book, I would just rather it be finished and then move on.  But, that's just me.  Excellent read for all thriller fans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R390UCZVFLTZTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399170774#wasThisHelpful","R390UCZVFLTZTO","A1I2U8NT5J6P1N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I2U8NT5J6P1N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This little guy really works!It is 3.5 inches long by about 1.5 inches wide with 2 adjustable antennae.The setup was easy but that might have been because we have a TP-Link router as well (model AC 1750).  I just plugged it into a wall outlet and hit the ""Re"" button after I hit the WPS button on the router and it linked up in about 1 minute.There is also a 5 step process to set it up via their website but try this easy way first.Our router is dual band (2.4Ghz and 5.0 Ghz) and before we had this range extender, the 5.0 Ghz was not useable past 10 feet from the router.  Now, we can use the speedier Wifi all over the house.We placed the extender about 30 feet from the router and our house now has full coverage for both frequencies!If you have wifi dead zones or just want a stronger signal throughout your home or wherever your wifi router is located, this range extender give you the connection that you want.

"First I want to state that I have been using Phyto hair care products for years.  They are the best products for unruly or damaged hair.  With that said, I was excited to try the eye serum.  I have been using it for over 2 weeks now and I really cant see any significant difference on my eyes, or my bags.I started using it to tighten up my bags after I applied my makeup like I do with my current cream that reduces puffiness and lines.  If I applied after my makeup, I saw no difference.  So I decided to put it on before my makeup and that didn't work for me either because it was a little crusty and you could see it.  So, I stopped wearing it during the day and just applied it at night time. After 2 weeks, I did not notice a difference, however you may have to wear it longer to notice.The other reason for the 2 stars is the cost.  At 83.00 it is significantly more expensive than what I currently use and doesn't work as well. It is also such a small amount that if you used it daily and then at night you would need another bottle in a month or so.Again, it may just be me.  I really don't like to leave a negative review on a product from a company that I love, but there you have it.If I had the chance, I would try a sample and see how it works for you before you make the purchase.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YAUB21GOBRKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WB865F8#wasThisHelpful","R1YAUB21GOBRKL","A1I2U8NT5J6P1N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I2U8NT5J6P1N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It cooks very evenly and I love that it is so Pretty that I bring it right to the table instead of leaving it in the kitchen like my old casserole dishes.  You can freeze in it, and bake up to 500 in it.It is a vibrant cherry red so it would also be great to bring to a friends potluck.  The price is very reasonable at just above $46.00.

It's nice and firm, which keeps his head elevated so he can breathe easier and snore less!I did like that it kept cool even though memory foam is notorious for heating up when you lay on it for awhile.  I suspect the shredded memory foam is responsible for the cooling factor.It's a queen size pillow which is 27"" long x 17"" wide x 5"" thick.

"I feel like I am very fortunate to be able to review this Hitachi Impact Driver.  The high-quality engineering and design is evident as soon as you pick it up.  Here are some actual specs:+ Drill is 8.5"" tall x 6"" long x 2"" wide.+ Carrying case is 15"" x 11"" x 4"".+ The drill with battery weighs approximately 2.5 pounds.+ The complete set, including drill, charger, both batteries and carrying case weighs about 6 pounds.+ Includes 1 standard 1/4"" phillips bit.I first used it to put together some patio furniture and it worked like a charm.  The variable speed motor minimizes your chances of over-torquing and stripping the bolt/screw heads.  The grip is very comfortable and secure.  The rubberized portion on the back grip ensures no slippage even when the sweat starts to pour.What I like the most is its very small profile for the power it delivers.  You can squeeze it into small spaces that you wouldn't be able to with other makes that have the same power.Worth the price, especially when Hitachi backs it up with a Lifetime Lithium Ion Tool Warranty, including a 2-Year Lithium Ion Battery Warranty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LXE4NU2YQGPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O1WOCYS#wasThisHelpful","R3LXE4NU2YQGPR","A1I2U8NT5J6P1N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I2U8NT5J6P1N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have never read any of Robert Dugoni's books and I am going to change that after finishing MY SISTERS GRAVE.  Solid mystery, creepy, great character development and a great story line.  Where the heck Have I been?  And, the best part the book was only 2.99 on Kindle.  Much better than most of the 'bestseller' novels out today.Highly recommend this book and looking forward to reading more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGU9SG5JLMOLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477825576#wasThisHelpful","RGU9SG5JLMOLC","A1I2U8NT5J6P1N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I2U8NT5J6P1N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This backpack is ideal as an everyday briefcase or as your carryon for the plane.  There is a pocket or compartment for just about anything that you need to bring with you on a short trip.In fact, I recently used it as my carryon for a trip to DC and it worked out great.  It fits perfectly underneath the seat.  Also, when walking around with it on your back, the padded shoulder straps adjust easily on the fly.  That way, you don't have to take it off, adjust, and put it back on.The khaki color and front leather flap give it a more formal look, almost like a nice briefcase or fine piece of luggage.  It is well-made and should hold up to the rigors of everyday use and air travel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R268WZ567P0N9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OTRE5FQ#wasThisHelpful","R268WZ567P0N9U","A1I2U8NT5J6P1N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I2U8NT5J6P1N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know that mushrooms are really healthy for you.  I've been taking Reishi mushroom powder for about a year now, because I figured that it couldn't hurt to try and prevent any kind of diseases, due to the healing powers of triterpenoids in reishi mushroom spores.  I was really excited to try this blend of Mushroom Extract Powder Blend, it's definitely full of a lot of nutritious properties.  I'll have to admit it doesn't taste too good, but it's not horrible either.  I just mix it up with raw cocoa powder and it helps to improve the flavor.I did a lot of research on all the benefits of the five mushrooms on Natural News and their blog.

"I'm always on the look out for products that boost the immune system and help to make my body's pH more alkaline.  I wanted to see how my body's pH would change by opening and dumping three capsules of the Essiac Tea into hot water.  I used a piece of pH test strip before I drank the tea and after I drank the tea.  The pH test strip can be used by testing your saliva and it can tell you weather your saliva is more acid or alkaline.  As you can see in the picture my saliva was probably a 5.8 before and a 7.2 after I drank the tea, so I can see that the tea does help your body become more alkaline.  By making my body more alkaline, I'm removing the toxic build up and detoxing my body.At the moment I'm on the master cleanse and this is my 6th day fasting, so the tea is an added bonus of helping me detox my body.  I'm happy to see that the tea has some AWESOME ingredients like,Burdock Root, Sheep Sorrell, Slippery Elm Bark, and Turkish Rhubarb Root, plus it has no artificial coloring, artificial flavor, preservatives, yeast, corn, milk or milk derivatives, lactose, salt, sodium, soy, sugar, gluten, starch or wheat!I'm feeling great and the Essiac Tea is helping me to detox, so I'm really happy and I would highly recommend the Essiac Tea!I received this product for a discounted price for my unbiased opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15LZR7WYOGE9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013QAZCDK#wasThisHelpful","R15LZR7WYOGE9N","A2EIIDTYMJAEXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EIIDTYMJAEXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Goji Berries and these are very tasty, plus very healthy!  I tried Goji Berries over a year ago and I wasn't too sure about them, but they really grow on you and then they're hard to put down, once you start eating them.  I love snacking on them and cooking with them.  I always seem to sleep better after I eat Goji Berries.  Goji Berries are full of antioxidants and they're a SUPERFOOD, which is always a big plus!

"This is absolutely the most fabulous Snow Tree that I've ever seen!  When I first took it out of the box I was pretty skeptical, but after I bent the branches out, screwed on the base, attached the the plugin and turned on the lights, I was so impressed how gorgeous it was!  I decided to decorate it with a few ornaments and it looked beautiful.  This tree is perfect for Christmas, but it could be used for all of the holiday, by just putting different seasonal types of ornaments on it.  I wasn't sure where to put the Snow Tree, but I thought it would look pretty awesome on top of a bookcase we have in the bedroom.  So, check out the picture of it on the bookcase, it looks awesome and it gives the perfect amount of light to light up the bedroom, without turning on the overhead light.  It looks stunning in the bedroom and we definitely LOVE it!  I would absolutely give this Snow Tree Five Stars and if I could, I'd give it 10 stars, we love it that much and we highly recommend it!!!I was given this product for my unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U08Z1EFKWOU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JPDH8E#wasThisHelpful","R1U08Z1EFKWOU1","A2EIIDTYMJAEXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EIIDTYMJAEXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first time I have ever seen a Blooming Teapot and I found it to be a very unique experience!  I wasn't sure what to expect, but I thought it was really AWESOME to watch the bloom open up in the teapot.  I loved that the teapot is made of glass, instead of some sort of metal.  The glass seems to be rather fragile, but I didn't experience any problem with that.  The teapot came with four blooms and I was extremely happy to see that the blooms had no artificial ingredients or additives!  The teapot is very well crafted and easy to pour, without dripping.  I heated the water in my electric teapot and poured it directly into the glass teapot, without any problems.  I think that this teapot is very unique and a very fun way to drink tea.

I recognized several of the stones, but there were a few that I didn't recognize.  The ones that I recognized were, amethyst, rose quartz, tiger eye, red jasper and the quartz crystal.The Gem Stones came with a 32 page guide book for collectors, called ""Dig Into Rocks - Minerals & Crystals"" and a Tumbled Stone Identification Sheet.  I decided to put the Gem Stones in a glass container on my desk, they add some color to my home office.

"If you want a true ghost story, reported by multiple credible witnesses and repeatedly documented by a  corporation over several years, look no further than this fascinating account of true supernatural sightings. After a plane goes down in the everglades due to the pilots preoccupation with a faulty landing gear light, many of the parts are salvaged for use on other planes.  On those other planes, members of the doomed flight crew appear to give cogent warnings as to electrical and hydraulic problems.  These fully formed individuals are seen and even spoken to by industry executives, flight crews, flight attendants, and passengers.  At first the industry reacts by sending employees to shrinks, and reissuing new log books for flights after every sighting. Then finally, they pull the parts out of every plane.Often true haunting stories are poorly written and poorly documented (too often seem to be written by people who want to publish a book, so decide they live in a haunted house, based on little more than dreams, feelings and noisy pipes).  But this is a well written and well documented account.  Worth the price and fascinating, not just for the credibility of the sightings themselves, but for the accounts of how truly ""real"" and interactive these manifestations were.  You may start reading as a skeptic, but given the multiplicity of the sightings and credibility of the witnesses, on multiple planes over long periods, this phenomena passes the credibility test.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPJA3NJOO9J0Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGGWM3U#wasThisHelpful","RPJA3NJOO9J0Q","A3KM9UA6MAVURN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KM9UA6MAVURN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The other review seems to be describing a completely different book.  Me, Cassie, is the funny and  irreverent narrator of this coming of age story.  It's set in the mid 60s, in a suburb outside of NYC,  but actually Cassie's journey is essentially timeless.  The chief attraction for this novel, outside of the narrator's voice is the cast of characters, which starts out with Cassie, her suburban club attending cause conscious mother, businessman father and odd teenage brother Eddie.  She also has an eccentric actress grandmother who lives in the East Village.  Cassie is very pretty, but becomes attracted to a short, nerdish new boy, and they go out without actually going out. Meanwhile, upheavals occur in her family, a whole group of orphaned relatives move in, and in the confusion, her mother forgets she's invited an African exchange student, who actually turns out to be two.  Cassie describes the resulting tumult  very amusingly. Meanwhile, through her Grandmother, she begins to get modeling, print ad, and tv commerical jobs, eventually becoming a minor teen celebrity.  Her boyfriend goes off to Harvard, assorted relatives and exchange student friends go off to their colleges, while she stays home and becomes increasingly famous without, she believes, any merit behind it - the kind of empty fame from exposure rather than skill.  By the end of the year, she's come to a conclusion about that sort of work and something of her future is settled.The real merit of this book is not in the actually storyline, but in the characterization and dialogue and in the zany happenings.  I am surprised there are no other reviews for this book, and so I have to put in a plug for it. I read it as a teen and periodically reread it every few years, because it is always good for a bit of a laugh","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ63I4AOBKBDU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0803755597#wasThisHelpful","RZ63I4AOBKBDU","A3KM9UA6MAVURN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KM9UA6MAVURN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The daughter of a famous radio personality who will soon be graduating from college visits the U.N. while her mother is making a research trip for her father's book.  Undecided about a future career, but not wanting it to be in radio, she becomes enamored of the U.N. guides after taking a tour.  A year later she arrives in New York to train and serve as a guide.I purchased this as a Scholastic book title when I was eleven or so, some ten years after it was published in 56.  Coming across it, have just reread it, noting that it was written by the later bestselling gothic author Phyllis A. Whitney.  Even early in her career, due to her competence,  the story moves smoothly.  Three storylines intertwine -- the story of a young woman moving away from home to her first job in a big city in search of her life's work, a love story, and a tribute to the U.N.  According to the author's notes, she was asked to write a book involving the U.N., and it becomes almost the main character in the book, particularly the UNICEF children's fund, which children often collected change for during Halloween in specially marked milk cartons.More than 60 years after it was first published, the story holds up pretty well.  The heroine's search for her own identity and her plight of not wanting to be a clone of her famous father is universal regardless of century.  While the heroine, her apartment mate, and their suitors  read as very young, compared to a similarly aged young adults  today, it's more likely this is because the story was written with young teenage girls in mind, rather than that young people of that age were that nave.  It's interesting and amusing, to see NYC through Whitney's eyes in 1956.  What is most anachronistic is to compare the hopes for the U.N. as expressed ten years after WWII, to what the world has become now.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R188M8JUQEVY6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UUIUUC#wasThisHelpful","R188M8JUQEVY6R","A3KM9UA6MAVURN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KM9UA6MAVURN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read very carefully the description of this item, and while it says it strips undercoat and removes dead hairs, it doesn't say it cuts hair. I also bought the model recommended for a German Shepherd (GSD)  I started at my dogs head and ran it along her body in long sweeping strokes.  It brought out some undercoat, but mixed with guard hairs. I will say the removed fur was not so flyaway as it is on regular shedding rakes, but as I looked at it, I realized that was because it contained as much guard hair as undercoat.  Still I thought it was removing 'old dead' guardhairs, as the description claims.  I will say that my dog, who sometimes objects to a pin or rake style shedding rake, apparently didn't mind the feel of this on her.But on conclusion, my dog appears to be of a different color in places where her long black tipped guard hairs were cut off before they turned black.  Her guard hairs are not standing out as much from her coat.  And her tail, which I didn't think I had gone over very much, appeared more like a rat's tail than a fat GSD plume.  I've never had a shedder rake do this.I went back and read the description again, and all the reviews.  The description of the item, and the reviews just don't indicate this kind of result. While there was one lone review warning it cuts hair, the rest say it doesn't cut hair, but removes undercoat and thins out dead hair.  Pulling out dead hair is very different than cutting off long guard hairs.  True, most of those reviews  are for owners using it on newfs, terriers and goldens, breeds who may not have the long guard hairs of a GSD, particularly a long haired/long coated GSD.  But some were for long coated dogs.Anyway, in terms of comfort for the dog, she minded it less than a pin style rake.  As far as raking hair, I don't know how effective it is at thinning or removing dead undercoat.  Being September, her last years undercoat was already largely blown.  It brought out some additional undercoat, but that appeared to be mixed with half guard hairs, which I suspect were not all ""dead"" guard hairs being removed, but live ones sheared off.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23Z0FCFVIBH0A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007L9C31M#wasThisHelpful","R23Z0FCFVIBH0A","A3KM9UA6MAVURN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KM9UA6MAVURN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book lacked a beginning and an ending, and useful details.  I wasn't looking for excitement or drama.  But  the author does little setup and to me doesn't quite deliver on the title.  If you're familiar with the geography of the area, you can soon tell he's intending to climb Everest from the north.  But the author doesn't say that at the start, nor is he very explicit in the beginning as to what expedition he's climbing with, details as to his choice of this group, etc.  OTOH, seldom is a beer drunk, (and there are a lot of beers drunk) without him noting the brand.  I would have liked a little more on climbing.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36UJZERA91O30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A9KMN2Y#wasThisHelpful","R36UJZERA91O30","A3KM9UA6MAVURN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KM9UA6MAVURN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Commercial guided expeditions for risky endeavors are more common than ever.  So it is interesting and useful to have a rational account presented of the decision making of this survivor, and so far as he can relay it, by Rob Hall, as to why this expedition went so wrong.  If you ever join an expedition with similar life threatening risks, it might be useful to you.Some of what might have been motivating Hall is information I had not read before. What motivated the author was love, responsibility, and a desire to return alive and whole to family  -- when he could clearly see this expedition was taking the level of risk to an unimaginable level.But why was it raised to that level?  I've never understood why Hall continued to guide his group so late, when he knew if they went to summit they were going to run out of oxygen before they returned to the oxygen cache. Apart from the issues of daylight, weather, relative strength, etc, the logistics of oxygen, for those using it, were incompatible with success with that timetable.  Hall had to know it, particularly for Hansen - who'd had a problem crashing in the previous year.  Hearing Mr. Kasischke relate his problems with his oxygen system,  added to complaints from others,  made me wonder if that gear was flawed. A bad oxygen system would  contribute to the poor decision making.Kasischke relates his own psychology of why he climbs, why he chose the Hall group, his disappointment when Hall made decisions counter to the reasoning he chose him in the first place, and when and why he broke with Hall's leadership when he determined it was fatally flawed. I think all these are useful for anyone who might need to make similar decisions in the future. Even if survival is not part of the end result - we all have to choose who to follow, why, when to follow, and when to leave.In terms of content, this narrative is heavy on philosophy and less heavy on daily details of the expedition, personalities and color. That doesn't mean it isn't there, because it is. But that's only half the tale, the rest is philosophy.  And Mr. Kasischke is discreet.  Having been rudely surprised himself when Krakauer's ratings of his teammates appeared in an Outside Online web interview - something the members of the team didn't expect to  have discussed or reported on -- Kasischke is careful to respect his teammate's privacy.  As a reader, I respect that too, but I confess I had less of an immediate feel of the places and people at times, due to that.  Still, the last chapter, where he goes into some of what he suspects was Hall's reasoning for the summit attempt was fascinating and something I had never read elsewhere.This book also gave a great sense of the truly frigid experiences of high camp after the summit attempt, how pinned down everyone was by the storm and how difficult survival was even for those who made it back to camp.  I can completely understand why, having survived this, the author chose to hang up his crapons after this expedition.  I am glad, though, that he didn't hang up his pen, and that we have this account.All in all, if you are interested in Himalaya expeditions, Everest, or just this particular expedition, this is a book that you have to purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V89JK8UUIE04/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXG2TB2#wasThisHelpful","R1V89JK8UUIE04","A3KM9UA6MAVURN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KM9UA6MAVURN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this bio decades ago, and liked it for her insider's view of the SF and NYC Ballet companies, as well as her later 'comeback' attempt in the U.K and Europe.  True, those looking for the fantasy of standing ovations and roses may be disenchanted by the hard work, sore muscles and injuries, jealousies and intrigues and so on that the author relates.  But this is a backstage view of the 'making' and 'unmaking' then 'remaking' of a dancer.  I think the author speaks very believably.

"According to the description, there were 8000 applicants for the 19 positions in this reality series on recreating an authentic Edwardian manor house environment.  To me it seems the selection was based more on who would provide the most 21st century angst than who were most suited to the positions, and how much historical reality was involved in setting up the house or was that contrived for drama, rather than the historic re-enactment.The participants are repeatedly described as volunteers. I wonder if that means they were entirely unpaid for their labor in the house, because certain of them were required to labor -- apart from the filming --  while others had leisure.  The life of a scullery maid, of course, was the most hellish, rising well before dawn,  basically tied to a sink or a scrub brush for 18 hours a day.  Using caustic soda would rapidly turn hands red and raw, and they fell into bed exhausted at night. The girls who took these jobs  were generally from the workhouse, or extremely poor, all of whom had little choice but to go out at work at 14, or not eat.  Their families often had to scrimp and save for 2 years just to buy them the uniform -- dresses and aprons -- necessary to start life in service. And their families were often depending upon the wages the girls earned, that they often sent home so their siblings could eat.  They generally were getting the best food of their lives in service.  Even as bad as it often was, at least food was available and the alternative was back to the workhouse.I have to wonder what 21st century girl would volunteer to spend 18 hours a day chained to a sink or scrub brush for three months for free?  There is no great drama in washing dishes, scrubbing floors or peeling root vegetables.  After a day or two, when it sunk in that there was no drama, and the 3 months would be mere drudgery, I'm not surprised two scullery maids left.  All I can say is I hoped the ones who stayed got paid because that was drudgery.As far as historical accuracy, I thought the house was understaffed even for daily life --  based upon the size and the usual staffing levels of such houses then.  And it was also usual that for special events, extra help was brought in.Most servants in 1900 had a half day off every week or two,  so that initially the servants were given no time off at all, seemed contrived to make them revolt.The older son Jonathan would have been at school, and even the younger son would probably have been away, so that seemed odd to me.  What they should have had were a family with daughters -- daughters stayed at home with governesses.I thought the butler was tiresome in his search to be loved by both upstairs and down. A butler was the head of  a house.  The butler here kept having 21st century staff meetings, trying to work things out democratically.  And expecting his employer to be fond of him. He came to realize his employer regarded him as just a servant responsible for his comfort.  But still to the end of the show, the butler seemed to whine more than the underservants.  Striving to be liked seemed equal or more important to him than doing his job.'Sir John' was probably the best and worst chosen, best because he quickly fell into the mindset of thinking that because ultimate power suited him, everyone else was fine -- smiling maids are happy maids.  Worst because he quickly seemed deluded as to what was going on around him, quite content  so long as he wasn't forced to do anything he didn't want to do.  His unwillingness to eat the traditional cuisine being an example.  His peevishness toward his cook, butler, etc, for delivering that food to him was where he lost the distinction between being in a reality show, where he was expected to be inconvenienced by the period, and being ""Sir John"", where everyone was supposed to cater to his desires.This is where the premise broke down. It seems the butler was expected to keep reminding everyone of their roles. But the butler couldn't dictate to the family, and even the butler was often inappropriate. And no one was keeping him or the family on the rules. So the only people required to really follow the rules were the underservants.  So were their complaints because of the inequities of Edwardian life, which were many, or equally because of the inequities in the reality show setup?  Who was  keeping the upstairs players and upper servants on track?I expected in the end, to see some discussion from upstairs and downstairs as to this at the end, but the producers didn't. Perhaps because it would have pointed out where their setup failed. And of course having the double dissatisfaction in the under-servants suited the drama more.I thought it was interesting how ""Sir John' and his wife, and even the sister, who professed that she was strait-jacketed at first, cried when the 3 months came to an end. The servants did not cry (apart from the butler, who seemed perpetually moved over his role).  I think the family had been infanticized -- reduced to the status of children, shielded from reality, cared for and protected  - because of course 'Sir John' had no real worries - he didn't have to worry about his son's succeeding in society or gambling his estate away, his estate paying, or his real status in society. It was all one big picnic.  In real life, that would not have been as much the case. The servants on the other hand, had mountains of work to get through.  So even that minor 'reality' in making their roles comparable was not real.  I think perhaps another family might have pulled this off better.  At least have been more likable. I can't say I grew to know, or like, any of the upstairs family or believed that any of what they were doing had any real reflection of what their roles would have been in Edwardian society.As for the downstairs, I grew really tired of the butler, and would have preferred to see more of the housekeeper. The lower servants were okay.  The lady's maid was very believable. The tutor was annoying and seemed there to beat the viewer over the head with the wrongs of English colonialism.  This was not the venue for a serious treatment of that theme, and having the tutor say 'do you think it was right for England' to do this or that,  to a child who was his student, is a simplistic question for both the child and the audience. And also not part of the reality of the time.  But the servants roles, the ones who actually did the cooking, cleaning, etc, were believable.2 1/2 stars seems more suited to this drama than three. I watched all of it, but I just didn't think it was as good as it could have been.  A more thoughtfully chosen cast, with someone keeping all sides historically accurate, rather than letting certain groups get off scot free, and a more realistic upstairs life would have improved it enormously.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20RL1NSFRXXMW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009K77X#wasThisHelpful","R20RL1NSFRXXMW","A3KM9UA6MAVURN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KM9UA6MAVURN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Absolutely outstanding piece of technology.  I purchased my Chromebook about 6 months ago and I am just as pleased with it today and the first day I opened the box.  Several things that are stellar about this machine tha should be highlighted:Weight: At only 3 pounds it is easy to take anywhere and I actually ended up saving myself about 8 pounds.Cost: With a price tag that is lower than most tablets, why not have a real keyboard and a 13 inch screen?Ease of setup:  I was up and running on this machine is less than 30 minutes (a new world record).Lack of MS software:  Not an issue.  I use a remote desktop app to access any MS software remotely if I need it.Battery life:  At least 9 hours has been like having a long distance cord.  Never an issue!Lack of a hard drive:  Honestly, who cares.  The cloud is my hard drive now and it is much more convenient.Software availability:  They're right when they say ""there's an app for that"" because there very nearly is every time.Overall the best technology money I have spent in years.

If you are actively engaged in the art, discipline or profession of project management, then you just found the only book you will need to be successful at it.Lynda has done a wonderful job of distilling down the techniques involved in all the stages of the project management lifecycle and making them available in a concise guide that is easy to understand and implement.  Her combination of actual project management experience and extensive teaching experience provides a perfect mix of real world experience as well as an insightful method of teaching these techniques to others.The illustrations add just the right touch to make the techniques come alive for those of us who learn better ""visually"" as opposed to ""textually"".  As a life-long project management ""practitioner"", I am sure I will come back to this book again and again as a reference and invaluable project management resource.

"As an adult it's easy to overlook how relaxing coloring is. This book reminded me of that. The intricate designs are beautiful and so fun to watch them ""come to life."" I like that their is quite a selection of designs in this book.What didn't I like? The pages are not spiral bound or perforated, that would have made coloring near the edges and taking them out to color much easier.

" 1:54 Mins My son loves trains and train sets, but we don't always have alot of room to set one up.  This train set is great because you can set it up in any size and format you want.  The pieces are incredibly flexible in location, watch the video to see a bit more about that.  We really like how portable it is, because most of the pieces are squares they are easily stack-able and can go anywhere with you.  Other than to change batteries, you will not need any tools with this set.My son is 3 and he loves this, he can decorate the scenery around the tracks however he wants.  Most of the time he asks me to help him set it up and then plays with this without a break for over an hour.  He asks for this first thing in the morning and plays with it for no less than half an hour at least 5x a day.  We also like that the tracks are different colors to help him practice his colors.  This is well made and looks like it will last us years.  Some other vehicles my son has fit in the tracks like the matchbox cars, but not his other train sets.  I do not have any other sets like this to plug and play tracks and roads, but it comes with quite a bit of track and I don't feel we need more.

"This set has great colors and they look beautiful.  It's been years since I used color pencils and they are more fun than I remembered.  There are so many shades in this pack of each color that I didn't have to cross use 2 of them to make many.  These colored smoothly, no scratching or colors that just didn't want to appear on paper.  The names of the colors are not on the pencils, none are metallic or neon.  They appear to be a wooden pencil and sharpen easily enough.The case is nice for storing them when your not using them, however it can be difficult when your using the colors and changing them frequently. The snap closure is nice, but inside are tabs like on baked goods and while they are sturdy enough the first one goes through the middle for opening.

"This pack folds into itself and then becomes a bag to carry it in making it great for a day at the flea market.  We put a medium Carheart jacket into it and it could easily fit more (see photo of it being worn.)  The bag is sturdy and well made.  Their is a pouch inside the bag (see photo). The top part of the bag can be pulled down to keep rain and leaves out of the bag.  The top otherwise is a drawstring.The sternum strap has an orange clip - it's a whistle which is very loud.Their are loops on the bottom you can hang things off of, my 3 year old son is holding it in the photo.I chose the blue because it has different tones to it making it very pretty.

" 2:12 MinsThe pictures in this planner are beautiful.  The entire planner is smaller than you might expect as an English writer I was not able to fit much in the spaces.

The book is small enough to easily fit in most purses.  The maps are for metro in Tokyo, JapanI think this is best for: someone who is using it for appointments or special events only.

"This is a very worthwhile live recording of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers in 1967.The band line up is John Mayall, Peter Green on guitar, John McVie on bass and Mick Fleetwood on drums. Peter Green's guitar playing is superb; too bad that Green's health problems in the early 1970s derailed what should have been a very productive career. Green is at the top of his game on these recordings.The CD clocks in at just over 76 minutes total playing time so the full storage capacity has been used.Although these are live performances, the audience noise is minimal. The sound quality is good but not up to studio standards. I've deducted one star for the sound quality.But the performances are first rate. If you're a Mayall fan, this one is well worth adding to your collection. It's also worth having for Peter Green's performances. Peter Green only recorded one studio album with John Mayall (A Hard Road - I've given it a 5 star rating on Amazon) before leaving Mayall's band with John McVie and Mick Fleetwood to form the first incarnation of Fleetwood Mac. Since Peter Green largely disappeared from the music scene in the early 1970s due to his health problems, this CD is well worth having as an example of Peter Green's playing in his heyday, before his health issues set in.Overall, a very worthwhile John Mayall CD.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HCWJ9V3SBYMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T73ATC0#wasThisHelpful","R2HCWJ9V3SBYMY","AFSBKKDFLZZX5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFSBKKDFLZZX5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It also goes into interesting detail on the business side of the music business, which often gets glossed over in many music histories.Overall, a very worthwhile book for anyone interested in the history of the music business and the development of rock and roll and R&B.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CQVGIVSXHHE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=025207727X#wasThisHelpful","R3CQVGIVSXHHE5","AFSBKKDFLZZX5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFSBKKDFLZZX5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second great collection (2 volumes so far) of Leadbelly recordings from JSP Records.The recordings run from Leadbelly's first recordings - the 1934 John and Alan Lomax recordings of Leadbelly at Angola Penitentiary in Louisiana - to Leadbelly's last recordings in 1948. The sound is good, the liner notes are decent and the price is reasonable.Leadbelly was one of the major figures in blues and folk history; this is a very worthwhile collection of Leadbelly recordings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LW1CJZSFKOQ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GAPMPVQ#wasThisHelpful","R1LW1CJZSFKOQ9","AFSBKKDFLZZX5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFSBKKDFLZZX5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bourinot's Rules of Order are the standard rules followed in Canadian government, business and private meetings. The better known Roberts Rules of Order are not as widey used in Canada as Bourinot's. If you attend Canadian meetings and/or are eligible to participate in those meetings, a knowledge of Bourinot's Rules of Order is very useful.This short book provides a very useful explanation of Bourinot's Rules of Order. If you attend Canadian civic meetings or are a member of any Canadian group that has meetings, this book would be useful to you.A note to fellow union members: most Canadian unions use Bourinot's Rules of Order, not Roberts', in conducting their membership meetings. If you're a union member and you want to make sure your local or national executive is following proper procedures, this book is very useful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22IDMWN7DRWAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JN1CGK#wasThisHelpful","R22IDMWN7DRWAD","AFSBKKDFLZZX5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFSBKKDFLZZX5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a CD/DVD combo of a Richard Thompson performance on Austin City Limits in 2001. The performance is 16 tracks on DVD, 15 on the CD.Thompson is backed by a drummer and a bass player and performs material from various albums he has released over the years. The sound is very good and the performance is excellent. On the DVD the camera work and editing are very good. The video looks good.Overall, an excellent performance and the CD/DVD combo is very good value for money.Any who likes Richard Thompson should like this one.

"This release from UK based Jasmine Records is an excellent CD of early 1960s British blues.Alexis Korner was one of the most influential figures in the late 1950s and early 1960s British blues scene and this CD is a great example of his early 1960s work. It features the material released on the 1963 album R&B From The Marquee as well as other first rate Alexis Korner material from the period.For those unfamiliar with the name Alexis Korner, note that people like Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Long John Baldry came out of Alexis Korner's bands.The recorded sound is very good and the music easily stands the test of time. If you're interested in early 1960s British blues, this is an album you should check out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTW99ZF350VX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CUFZWH4#wasThisHelpful","RTW99ZF350VX5","AFSBKKDFLZZX5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFSBKKDFLZZX5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Cash Box Kings are one of the best Chicago blues bands currently on the scene and this album is a very good example of their work.The album is 15 tracks with a total of about 70 minutes playing time. It's all first rate material. The sound recording is very good and the playing is excellent.One major issue though. I ordered this CD from Amazon in mid December 2013 and I finally got it in early March 2015. This is not Amazon's fault; it's the fault of the record label and/or distributor. The price on Amazon was $18 when I ordered it and Amazon delivered it at the original quoted price, despite the 15 month delay . In between my initial order and the final delivery, the price for this CD fluctuated between $30 - $160 from various Amazon affiliates. For much of that time it was unavailable.To the Cash Box King's record label and/or distributor - you've got a great band here that deserves commercial recognition and success but you're really screwing it up with your terrible distribution and lousy availability of their product. There's no excuse in this day and age for a 15 month delivery time on a CD; that's just blatant incompetence on someone's part.To the Cash Box Kings and their management - you really need to sort out the distribution and availability issues on many of the band's releases. The band is great but the availability and distribution of their CDs is pathetic. Sort out your record label and/or distributors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLO57H778MTKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0039BD6R6#wasThisHelpful","RLO57H778MTKI","AFSBKKDFLZZX5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFSBKKDFLZZX5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the title says, this 4 CD set contains all the Muddy Waters' singles released on the Aristocrat and Chess labels between 1947 and 1962. For novice blues fans, bear in mind that these labels typically released Muddy Waters tracks as singles during this time period so you're basically getting all the classic Muddy Waters material on this set.The sound is good. Liner notes are fairly basic but they contain all the essential information like recording dates for each track, musicians playing on each track etc. The price (currently about $20) is reasonable.These are very influential recordings. The Rolling Stones took their name from one of these songs. Led Zeppelin took another as the basis for the Led Zeppelin II track ""Whole Lotta Love"" and got sued successfully by songwriter Willie Dixon. Bands that have covered many of these songs are far too numerous to include here.If you're a blues fan, or you like bands like the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin, these are essential recordings for your collection. This set is a good way to get them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PAURDZCHLNS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HV3MC3M#wasThisHelpful","R3PAURDZCHLNS8","AFSBKKDFLZZX5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFSBKKDFLZZX5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a bit leery of this one when I first saw it on Amazon. It was on a reissue label that I'd never heard of, but I took a chance on it and ordered it anyway.It turned out to be a really good sampler of Duke Records releases from 1952-62. There are some familiar names like Bobby ""Blue"" Bland, Little Junior Parker and Rosco Gordon along with some names I wasn't familiar with. One little gem is Texas Flood by Larry Davis, which was covered by Stevie Ray Vaughan on his Texas Flood album. I wasn't aware of the Larry Davis original before I heard it on this album.Overall, a very good set. It's 3 CDs, the price is reasonable, the sound is good and although it's definitely not the full Duke Records Story, it's a very good Duke Records sampler.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XO5BYM5NNR6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EUI5P76#wasThisHelpful","R2XO5BYM5NNR6X","AFSBKKDFLZZX5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFSBKKDFLZZX5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Three single ladies move in to the McCauley's childhood home and rent it from their parents. Of course, one brother lives next door. And of course, trouble ensues when Flynn McCauley finally meets the fiery redhead, Maddie.Maddie has had it with men and swears off all men. She is middle of her tirade about how awful all men are when Flynn shows up to fix the sink. Flynn's not into relationships either, so why not arrange a friends with benefits arrangement. Only, Maddie isn't falling for Flynn's charm and Flynn has to pull out all the stops and even get help from his 5 year-old nephew to win Maddie over.Overall, this was a fun story. Yes, it was a bit predictable, but it was still fun. I really liked the brother's relationship and their banter. Even his 5 year-old nephew was a hoot--and real!Normally I'm not a fan of the friends with benefits storyline, but somehow it worked here for me. I think it worked for me because of how honest they were with each other about things. There was a bit of the back and forth thing as they try to sort out their feelings for the other, but it didn't drag on endlessly.The McCauley BrothersThe Troublemaker Next DoorHow to Handle a Heartbreaker (The McCauley Brothers)Ruining Mr. Perfect (The McCauley Brothers)What to Do with a Bad Boy","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PCHJXIGLG01V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFDVOGO#wasThisHelpful","R3PCHJXIGLG01V","AAMU00SSB7TYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAMU00SSB7TYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a fan of Zoe Archer. I haven't read everything she's written, but always enjoy her stories when I do pick them up. I haven't read the previous book in this series, so everything was all new to me. Despite the fact this is a continuation of a story line for the hero and heroine, I didn't feel like I was completely lost.A Nemesis agent and former client, Michael and Ada respectively, both go under cover as servants at a country estate to expose corruption. Michael and Ada had a romantic past, but that all fizzled when Michael left and didn't ever try to contact Ada. She's vowed to forget Michael and do her duty for Nemesis. Michael knows his in Ada's bad graces since he disappeared on her, but he has a very good reason...only if he can get her to listen.I enjoyed this story. It was actually quite fun to read about a country house party from the perspective of the hired help. Normally, all the historical romance stories are of wealthy debutantes and titled lords. Neither Michael nor Ada are grasping for the polite society and are happy with their stations. It was a nice change.The mystery they must solve was more of a background filler and easy to follow along. The focus seemed more on the repair of Michael and Ada's relationship and how they learn to trust each other once again.I always enjoyed Ms. Archer's writing. The storyline is smooth as she weaves a fun mystery to solve and watch two lovers reunite. I look forward to reading this series.Nemesis UnlimitedSweet Revenge: Nemesis, Unlimited Book 1Winter's Heat (Novella)Dangerous Seduction: A Nemesis Unlimited NovelWicked Temptation (Nemesis Unlimited)","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39G377NV76LE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DK44LI0#wasThisHelpful","R39G377NV76LE1","AAMU00SSB7TYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAMU00SSB7TYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The beautiful Miss Amelia Snow has been a nasty thorn in the side of many debutantes. So when her family falls on hard times and she is forced into employment as a companion to a wealthy cit's daughter, not many in the haute ton pity her. Humbled, Amelia is ready to change. She has been used to being the beauty everywhere she goes, but now needs to downplay her beauty so as to not outshine her employer. In the midst of her new reduced standing returns her childhood friend, Lord Quentin Fortescue. She snubbed his proposal years ago. Now they are thrown together again. Is she still the haughty beauty who stomped all over his heart? Can either of them risk their heart again?Having read a few of the previous books, I was surprised to see the villainess get her own book. It was actually fun to see what Amelia's fate was after she got her comeuppance. We were finally allowed to see behind the nastiness and faade Amelia used to parade behind. I didn't want to like her, but I slowly did.I liked the theme of second chances. Amelia worked hard to redeem herself and to find her true self. Who was she if she didn't have all her money? Who are her true friends? And just what is so special about her now? I liked how Quentin didn't just fall all over himself to ""rescue"" Amelia, but they both had to work to trust one another again.Overall, this was a fun short story to wrap up the Ugly Ducklings series. No, it isn't about one of the Ugly Ducklings, but it was a great way to show what happened ""Happily Ever After.""The Ugly DucklingsHow to Dance With a Duke (Ugly Ducklings Trilogy)How to Romance a Rake (Ugly Ducklings Trilogy)How to Entice an Earl (Ugly Ducklings Trilogy)Perks of Being a Beauty","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H1X6AXP52GK4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BCFZM00#wasThisHelpful","R2H1X6AXP52GK4","AAMU00SSB7TYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAMU00SSB7TYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But now, the rules arent helping her. While her dad is hiding in rehab, her mother runs off to Paris to pretend everything is ok. Done with all the pretending, Hannah opts to stay the summer with her aunt. She is dertermined to do things she never dared before. There, Hannah meets Jude Westmore.

On the surface she is polished, but on the inside she is a mess. The hero was tortured, having forgotten his own dreams, ambition, and way after a family tragedy. They had a way with each other that was sweet to watch.I could totally relate to Hannah and her trials. I never went through when she did, but her desire to start over and find out who she truly is was heartfeltand I remember feeling exactly like that at 17.

"When I saw the reference to ""Beauty and the Beast"" theme I thought this book would be perfect for me. Overall, it was a good read with only a few minor annoyances at the end.Lord Jason Lockwood is notorious for his scarred face he hides from Polite Society as well as his Sin Parties. He is lonely but content, or he thinks he is. The reemergence of a half-brother stirs Jason to action to find out what the no-good bastard is up to and brings him into contact with Lady Lydia Prewitt. Under the tutelage of her aunt, Lydia has become the most feared gossip, besides her aunt that is. Lydia wants to change her reputation and sees helping Jason regain his social standing as a way to redeem herself from all the harm she has inflicted in the past.Both Jason and Lydia feel trapped by their circumstances. Jason feels like his half-brother ruined his life and is to blame for all the misery in his life. Lydia feels trapped by her aunt who is THE gossip monger and threatens Lydia daily with banishment if Lydia doesn't gather gossip for her.Lydia was an interesting character to get to know. She isn't all that likeable in the beginning. She has been gathering gossip for her aunt to wield as weapons against others and to elevate her own standing. She does want to change, but she is weak willed and unsure of how. She slowly takes steps to distance herself from Aunt and grows into a strong willed and determined woman who is sure of herself.There is a LOT going on in the story and a lot of backstory to discover to understand all the whys and the whats and the hows. The author does a great job at slowly peeling back each layer to discover more and more and still keep the storyline moving forward.I did love most of the book. I did have a problem with how Jason reacts at the end and how Lydia deals with it.Secrets & Scandals SeriesHer Wicked Ways (Secrets & Scandals Book 1)His Wicked Heart (Secrets & Scandals Book 2)To Seduce a Scoundrel (Secrets & Scandals Book 3)To Love a Thief (Secrets & Scandals Book 4)Never Love a ScoundrelScoundrel Ever After (Secrets and Scandals Book 6)Scoundrel Ever After","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EK766TZ83ISY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CR5TS18#wasThisHelpful","R1EK766TZ83ISY","AAMU00SSB7TYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAMU00SSB7TYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two shattered and broken souls collide in this love story. Socialite Rebecca Clare is a tabloid staple, and her hard partying ways do nothing to stop it.  Her latest trouble is of course being documented by the ever present paparazzi--she gets into a brawl at a club. The only one to step in and help is Jake Montgomery--her sister's step-son.  Jake isn't usually one to help out like that, but he figures she is family...in a way. When the photo from the brawl goes viral, Jake steps in again to save Becca and family from scandal by claiming they are engaged. Becca agrees to play along for a while.Becca is a shell of a girl when we meet her. She recently lost her best friend and isn't coping very well. She can't sleep with the lights out, she needs to get drunk to even get a little sleep, and she is lonely in the crowd around her. She is also completely honest and never pretends to be anything she is not. Jake was a heartless, emotionless tin-man when we first meet him. He is currently on the outs with his family and needs a place to crash...which leads him to Becca. Where Becca has no ulterior motives, Jake is conniving and manipulative.We think we know them in the beginning of the story based off their tabloid exploits, but this story takes us behind the headlines and into their lives. I love how honest and upfront these two are with each other. The world seems to be getting crazy around them, but they gravitate toward each other and find their true selves in the process.Overall, I really enjoyed this story and would highly recommend this if you are looking for another new-adult read. I haven't read the first in this series, but it didn't seem necessary.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34805TJQ7952A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KPJNL7U#wasThisHelpful","R34805TJQ7952A","AAMU00SSB7TYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAMU00SSB7TYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"At age of 17, Lady Alexandra was wedded and bedded to settle a gambling debt. After the deed was done, she fled and hid herself away under the assumed name of Lizzie Allbright. For eight years, Lizzie has been content and happy to live the life of the local pastor's adopted daughter. But her peaceful life is upturned when her husband shows up to reclaim her. He doesn't try to reclaim her with words of love and devotion, rather with the insistence that it is time she fulfill her wifely duty and give him an heir. Time is of the essence for Xavier, Lord Steyne who fears there is a plot to eliminate him.THE WICKEDEST LORD ALIVE was an overall good read. It was a little heartbreaking to read about a 17 year old virgin and the young 21 year old son forced into this awkward situation neither of their making.Lizzie was an ok heroine. She was resourceful, smart, and a natural caretaker. She enjoyed caring for those around her. She really cares nothing for wealth and title--she lived under the brutal hand of her titled father for 17 years.Xavier was made of ice. He kept himself detached from everyone and everything around him. He doesn't believe in love and is a cynic.As enjoyable as the storyline was, I had a hard time with believing the love.First, Lizzie barely knows him, had only seen him a few times before their forced wedding, once when he bedded her (and he wasn't very nice about it), and when he came to fetch her, yet she knew that she was already half in love with him. It couldn't have been his sparkling personality as he himself said ""How the hell had she come to think herself in love with him? Hadn't he been autocratic, cold at times sarcastic to the point of brutality? What could she possibly have found in him to like, much less love?""Second, Lizzie thinks that she can save him. Her foster father even says to her ""You might well be his salvation."" It was just so clichd that to have this rude, cynical libertine who just needs the love of a good woman to save him.Apparently, this is part of a series. Maybe I would have been more invested in the story had I read the books before it. As it stands, I don't feel like I ever really new Xavier's wicked reputation as it wasn't ever really seen.

"2-1/2 starsFor years, Celia and Marcus have been at odds. They cant be near each other without sniping and cutting remarks. Unfortunately, they are forced to play nice for a few minutes at the wedding of Celias brother who happens to be Marcus best friend. Well, those few minutes are enough to cut through the animosity and straight to the lust and wanting.This was a quick read that I couldnt really get into all that much. It was too introspective, not a whole lot of dialogue. Most the book was their thoughts where were are told everything, we dont see it. They both were really insecure and I found it grating. It was frustrating to see them both hide so muchnothing moves forward with both of them holding back so much!Overall, this was just an okay read that was easy to put down.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R151I9MJY9P3F1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HAZ6B7Y#wasThisHelpful","R151I9MJY9P3F1","AAMU00SSB7TYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAMU00SSB7TYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, I am a huge Ilona Andrews fan girl. Ive read just about all they have published.  Second, Ive followed the progress of this book on their website and read the snippets and have been eagerly awaiting this book. I had pre-ordered this book, so I jumped at the chance to get it early.Nevada Baylor is a small time PI strong-armed into solving a case she normally wouldnt touch with a 10 foot pole. She is tasked with bringing in a fire mage who is accused of killing a cop. In a paranormal world just like ours, magic and family are power. Nevada has family, but is short on the magic. She does have the ability to know if someone is truthful or not. But when she is going up against a fire mage who can melt the skin off her bones, it doesnt help her much. Her investigation draws the eye of another powerful man, Mad Rogen, who wants the fire mage for his own reasons and joins forces with Nevada.What I liked:1. NevadaWeird name, but awesome girl. It amazes me how unique and different she is than any other heroine Ilona Andrews has written before. She has common sense, is pretty intelligent, is incredibly loyal, and well rounded.2. The World Buildingeverything about this world made sense and was easily understood. As a bonus, there was no huge info dump trying to explain it nor was left vague and open with little clues to figure out on my own.3. FamilyNevadas family is hilarious, but they also felt so real! Their conversations and actions felt like real life. (You can tell the authors have a house full of teenagers.)4. Mad Rogenwhat a conundrum. I loved trying to figure out Mad. He is incredibly powerful and used to things his way. The fact he cant seem to crack Nevada has him scratching his head. (For Ilona Fan Girls: hes almost like Kate and Curran mixed togetheryeah, that awesome.)5. Storylinethe storyline was engaging and very interesting. It was easy to follow and clear. I felt like I was along the ride as Nevada and Mad worked through the investigation and was solving the clues along with them.6. Realistic RomanceEven though this is being billed as a romance, this wasnt the typical romance where we hear from the girl and then we hear from the boy and the main point of the story is their romance and everything else is secondary. Nevada and Mad Rogan meeting and actually getting to know each other is secondary to the investigationand I liked it that way.7. Development of powersI loved watching the different powers people had and how they used them. Nevada may think she is small time, but oh! I really dont think so.What I didnt like:Couldnt find anything.Recommendation: Read it!If you are new to Ilona Andrews, this is a great book to start. The action and mystery are nicely balanced with the romance making it an engaging read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S0CRJK5FP8BL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062289233#wasThisHelpful","R1S0CRJK5FP8BL","AAMU00SSB7TYG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAMU00SSB7TYG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Smash is a highly entertaining and deeply moving journey that will take you by storm and never let go. The paranormal aspect drew me in like a moth to the flame, but it was the amazing and bold characters and the intriguing storyline that held me utterly captive. There is a beautifully raw and absolutely mesmerizing talent that will leave you both wanting more and completely satisfied.David has lived a full and relatively satisfying life until a deep craving begins to make itself known. This craving comes naturally to those like himself. He desires above all to find and claim his mate. He is ready to lay aside his empty, carefree life and bask in the deeper meaning and fulfillment that comes with the cherished bond of ones mate. Melissa enjoys her relatively simple yet satisfying life. She has a best friend that she can count on no matter what and she is determined to make the best of things. In an attempt to cheer her best friend up on his birthday, she drags him to a nightclub and finds that her life is quickly turned upside down. Will David find that which he desperately seeks, and will Melissa reclaim her life before its too late?I found the characters in this book to be wonderfully entertaining and beautifully crafted. The twist to the paranormal storyline was very enjoyable and I couldnt get enough. I love when someone takes an old story and makes even more compelling with new and unique information. Knowing more about the history of the Lore they followed would have been even better. The relationship among the characters was absolutely fascinating, and I would have loved to have seen more of that revealed. Its almost scary how quickly this story wrapped itself around my heart. I didnt want to let go of the characters, and I hope that we hear more from them in the future.Susan Child has an astounding talent that I see only getting better and better as time goes on. There is an incredible amount of talent that is just bursting at the seems to be released. This is one author that you need to keep an eye on.

"Santas Pet by Rachelle Ayala is a magnificently breathtaking story of realizing that no one is perfect but that we are all deserving of pure, unconditional love. No matter what haunts or mares our past, we can be sure that each and every one of us deserves to be seen for who we are and not for what we have done. No one is born perfect, and so we cant in good conscience expect others to live a life free of blemishes. There are too many double standards that cloud the view of what our society expects from men and women, and those dark standards are constantly becoming even murkier as the years tick by. This is a very sad testament as to the fact that each generation devalues the power and influence of love while they push the boundaries of taking more than they give in return. I hope for all our sakes that we can learn from these heartbreaking mistakes and come to cherish and value each other as we all deserve and need.Brittany is convinced that everyone sees and expects her to be the perfect daughter since she has always been compared to her naughtier and more devilish older sister Lacy. To that end, she simply cant accept that she has vulnerabilities and weaknesses just like everyone else. No matter how hard she tries, she cant fight the need of more and the loneliness that invades her heart from time to time. When her life turns out not to be as perfect as she would like, she tries to bury it and move on. Only secrets have a way of becoming unburied at the worst times. When Ben Power enters her life and turns her heart inside out with this charm and vulnerabilities, she is helpless to avoid the pull she feels toward him. Will Brittanys past tear their happiness to shreds and jeopardize any future happiness, or will Bens own past destroy what could be before it even begins?Ben and Brittany are such a beautiful paring of characters that complement each other so wonderfully that its no wonder that the disappointments from their past leave such a painful, sour after taste. What they could have is so beautiful and powerful that they have to decide if they are ready to risk their heart for it. Giving up that much control and allowing another that much power over you is absolutely terrifying and tremendously exposed that some people just cant live with the damage if it doesnt work out. However, allowing for the possibility of the pain is so worth the pleasure and the fulfillment when things do work out. There are no words for what the power of love can do to transform a persons heart and life. Its a tremendously wonderful gift that doesnt come close to anything else.I never fail to be wonderfully surprised and delightfully enchanted by each and every story written by Rachelle Ayala. She pours such genuine heart and emotion carefully into each incredible masterpiece that she creates. Nothing is thrown haphazardly together, but instead it is brought to life by deliberate, meaningful strokes of love and passion. Her devotion to her writing is truly remarkable and unbelievably inspiring.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ONVTFQQNQQEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013RSMVXA#wasThisHelpful","R3ONVTFQQNQQEB","AVNDR3UMO7VU5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVNDR3UMO7VU5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cocked is a beautifully intriguing romance intertwined with a pulse-pounding, edge of your seat thriller. I didnt find anything lacking in the plot, and it spoke deeply to my heart the entire time. There is something to be said in finding a wonderfully satisfying and deeply moving storyline that can also keep you on your toes the entire time. I might be asking for a lot, but I enjoy such a full and robust plot that highlights strong yet vulnerable characters that reach out and touch you throughout their journey. This story delivered everything I love and in such an unforgettably grand style!Camden might be considered the black sheep of his town, his friends, and even his family. What he thought was him spreading his wings turned out to be stubborn self-destruction. He didnt care about anything except Lacey. She captured his heart as a teenager, and no matter what all he went through afterwards, he could never shake her memory or her presence in his heart. When he unleashes an unspeakable horror, he vows to protect Lacey and his family with his dying breath. Lacey tries to forget Camden after all these years. He broke her heart when he disappeared and never came back. She saw so much potential and beauty in him even when he couldnt see it, and her heart just wont listen to her when she wants to let him go. Instead, she and her family finds themselves in the crosshairs of a dark and devastating nightmare that refuses to be stopped. Will Camden be able to keep them all safe and do something right in his life, or will he find that for all of his efforts not even Fate can be outrun or out smarted?Lacey pulled into the story initially, but it was Camden that captured it and kept it. Finding out what all Camden went through in finding his way back to the light was utterly astounding. Most people couldnt have done what he did and kept his heart and soul intact. Holding onto the memory of Lacey was a huge catalyst in keeping from getting totally lost and consumed. When he gets the chance at redemption, he takes hold with hands and refuses to let go no matter how much his family doesnt trust him or how much Lacey hates him. He cant let them down when the stakes are so high that lives hang in the balance. I was proud of Lacey for showing him how much he hurt her and his family when he left and never sent word if he was dead or alive and yet also allowing herself to show him that she still cared for him even if she continued to fight and deny it. In the end, we cant fight against our hearts for long without breaking ourselves in half. When the truth comes to light, we have to accept it for what it is and let go of the past while holding tight to a future that is so full of light and happiness that our vision is blinded and our heart is ready to burst.B. B. Hamel is an insanely talented author who knows how to deeply touch the hearts of readers. Nothing was carelessly left to chance and everything was a perfect mesh of all of my favorite elements to create a breathtaking work of art that I thoroughly enjoyed! Dont miss out on the incredible talent of this author, so be sure to check this book out or others that she has written. You dont be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAMI9YRTF75GP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016TY3IHW#wasThisHelpful","RAMI9YRTF75GP","AVNDR3UMO7VU5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVNDR3UMO7VU5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nothing Else Matters is a beautifully outstanding conclusion to this masterfully written series that follows the tumultuous journey of Xan and Georgie. There is nothing easy or calm about any step throughout this astounding series. Their pain will become your own and their heartache will threaten to overtake all of your senses. When you emerge at the end, you will not be the same, but you will be so much better for it. This is truly an inspiring and magnificent work of art!Georgie finds her worst fears finally coming true. She is staring at her worst nightmare in its cold, dark eyes, and she finds herself somewhat calm knowing that she has tried to do all she can to right a terrible wrong. Her last wish at keeping Xan safe has been gratefully fulfilled, and she cant ask for anything else. Her dreams and wishes never mattered, and she wont let them interfere now. All she ask is that no one will walk into the crosshairs to try and save her. She isnt worth saving, and she cant live with the blood of another on her hands. Will the end come on the wings of swift justice or will it tarry long enough to cause one more last complication?Watching Xan and Georgie slowly but surely discover the courage, the power, and the motivation to reclaim their life is beyond anything that I could have ever imagined. These astounding characters will shred your heart and encourage your soul as you watch their individual struggles and their inspiring journey to pull the other from their own quicksand while trying to survive in a world filled with sharp pain, unforgiving suffering, and harsh judgment. Nothing worth accomplishing is ever easy or pain-free. When survival and happiness are on the line, only a miracle and perhaps an angel can pull you back from the edge of darkness and begin to mend a fractured soul.Blair Babylon has proven that without a doubt she has the literary mastery and the incredible heart to write a story that will touch even the darkest recesses of the soul while shattering any literary boundaries that exist in your mind. After reading this marvelous story, I am confident that there is absolutely nothing that she cant accomplish on paper. Her genius is a breathtakingly extraordinary gift to experience, and I hope that no one misses out on it! This is a journey that should be read and cherished by all who understand the power and the importance of the written word.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YHEENKFDY13O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013AOYTV8#wasThisHelpful","R2YHEENKFDY13O","AVNDR3UMO7VU5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVNDR3UMO7VU5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dark Sky is a deeply touching and intensely passionate tale of reclaiming a love that never died. The story centers around returning to ones first love as a last ditch effort to reclaim a life that should have been. What an astoundingly beautiful journey we are privileged to behold as it unfolds before our eyes! I simply couldnt get enough of the promise of hope and unspoken potential that penetrated and surrounded this amazing story! It had my head spinning and my heart singing the entire time.Severin has lived through a dark past marred by secrets and pain. Just when he begins to open his heart to a sweet girl, he is forced away and loses himself in another world even darker than the one he left. With nothing left to lose, he decides to go home, and take one last chance on cleansing his soul of the blackness of his past while discovering if his one possibility of love is still within his reach. To say that Avery is excited to see Severin would be a devastating understatement. She has waited for too long to show him the love she desperately wants to give him, and nothing will stand in her way this time. Can Severin accept Averys unconditional and pure love, or will he walk away thinking he is beyond any chance of redemption?Watching the incredible love story of Avery and Severin was such a breathtaking journey! The love that Avery poured into Severins dry and thirsty soul literally brings him back to life. He knows he can live the life he wants as long as Avery is by his side. Avery is finally being loved and cherished just like she has always dreamed of, and she will not let him go again. No matter what they know they are walking the rest of their days together, and I loved every minute that I spent with these two. They are absolutely amazing!Katalina Leon is a wonderfully talented author who will undoubtedly pull at your heart strings from the very first word. This is the first book I have read by her, and I am looking forward to reading more in the future. Her wonderful characters will endear themselves to you without you even realizing what is going on.

"Never Love an Outlaw is an utterly fantastic, action-packed masterpiece! I was completely blown away by its unexpected force and intense impact to my heart. This is a story like no other in its depth and breadth of emotion and inspiration. Whatever you do, dont let appearances deceive or underneath the surface lies a breathtaking love story that you will not forget.One minute Megan was living the perfect life of a bored socialite and then she found herself trapped in a living nightmare. She long gave up hope of ever climbing out of her Hell until he showed up. Skin wasnt looking for anything more than an easy payday for himself and his club. What he found would change his life forever. Megan find within herself a strength and a fierceness that she never knew existed until Skin shone the light in her dark pit. She would rock the very foundation of his world while he would grant her the only thing her heart desired most. Will happiness continue to elude these two lost, hurting souls, or will they take Fate by the hand and lead her where they want to go?I was astounded as I walked along this harrowing journey with Skin and Megan. What they received neither of them either deserved. They were beautiful, honest, and true to themselves no matter what. They only wanted to be given the ability to live a life worth living. They didnt ask for the world, but what they asked for was everything. Neither was ready for the force or the impact of the other, but they absorbed all of the love, intensity, and passion that they found. Only the unexpected raw beauty and incredible heart they found in each other was worthy of their devotion and their very life blood.Nicole Snow writes with an unimaginable passion and beauty that flows from her amazing heart. Her story will leave you gasping for breath and holding your dreams in the palm of your hands. There is nothing better than a book that can tear shred your heart to pieces and then slow and powerfully mend all of the pieces back together into something new and beautiful. There is something to be said for an extraordinary author who isnt afraid of crossing boundaries and forges her own path toward mastering the greatest gifts that life can offer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5DYSHAT0SZ5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016BA0JJY#wasThisHelpful","R5DYSHAT0SZ5X","AVNDR3UMO7VU5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVNDR3UMO7VU5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Forsaken Control is a surprise assault on the senses. Its achingly heart-breaking, intensely emotional, and infinitely healing. Without your consent, this story will seep into your very soul and bring you to your knees in a painfully sweet submission. What an absolutely incredible journey to have the privilege to take part in!Ares has had the type of childhood that few would ever dare to imagine. It shaped him in ways he had no control over, and try as he might, he couldnt run from it. He did the next best thing; he made it work for him. It helped to shape a life that he is proud of and wouldnt trade for anything. He is fiercely devoted to his new family, and he would pay any price necessary to keep them safe. What he doesnt expect is to be drawn deeper into the lives of two friends that he holds most dear. He fights to give up his tightly held control in order to open his heart to unconditional love and pure acceptance. When danger threatens all he holds dear, will Ares steps up and fight as if he can conquer the very flames of Hell itself, or will he fail and find himself weaker for allowing his heart to rule his mind for once?Learning more about Ares past and where he came from made me fall in love with him. I never realized such a hard man could love as deeply as he did. His capacity for love was nearly boundless when it came to his brothers and their families. He would do anything for them, and that warmed my heart so much for him. Watching him open up and accept the love that was just waiting for him with arms open wide brought out so many emotions for me. It was such an astoundingly breath-taking journey that I enjoyed every minute experiencing. His brothers were amazing men who loved each other and their families with no holds barred, and I was truly taken aback by the depth of their devotion. What a wonderful story!This is the first book that I have read by Sapphire Knight, and she literally took my breath away! I plan on reading more from her as I have fallen in love with not only Ares but the other man of the OathKeepers MC. This sounds like an incredibly amazing series that I dont want to miss out on!

In fact, I was pleasantly surprised, and blown away by the fantastic characters and the incredible storyline that I discovered. I couldnt get over how much I fell in love with both Dom and Irisa as well as their friends and family. They were all absolutely stunning in how real they felt, and how I could easily relate to each of them.

"Mending Hearts is a wondrously exquisite and deeply freeing journey of learning how to live without borrowing worry and to allow our dreams to take shape in their own time. How incredibly liberating it is when we finally realize that even when we dont achieve our dreams in our desired timeline that it doesnt make them any less meaningful or precious when they finally do arrive. Wrestling these types of demons may be the hardest ones that I think humans have ever had to deal with. We dont deal well with waiting especially when we think we have everything ready and in place. Its what we dont have ready and in place that could cause our dreams to disintegrate and die if we were to receive them when we want them. Maybe, just maybe, the Plan behind our plan is one that is even better then what our finite minds can think up. After all the Creator behind that Plan is the very one who made us, our world, and the universe that surrounds us. Wouldnt that Plan be even more to our benefit then our own hastily thought out dream?Candice has watched her most beloved dreams burn and fade away before her eyes. Her heart cant take anymore, so she asks her husband Logan for a separation. While unwilling to let her go, Logan agrees in order to not lose her completely.

Logan is a reminder of a past that has torn her spirit to shreds, and she cant handle anymore hurt or disappointment. At the first sign that Candice is considering a divorce, Logan jumps back into her life begging for one last chance. He knows he cant live without her any longer, and he refuses to let her go without having a chance to show her just how much she means to him. Will Logans determination and patience prove to be his undoing, or will Candice be able to work past her fear in order to see and claim everything that she could lose forever?My heart hurt so much watching these two beautifully broken souls trudge through life while going through the motion of living. I almost couldnt finish reading this book due to the intense and bone-searing pain and disappointment that permeated the pages of this book. While life isnt filled with flowers and sunshine 24/7, it is also not continuously inundated in regret, fear, and worry each day. There is a healthy balance to living this life, and once that balance is found, it will bring you more joy and peace than you could ever imagine. Candice and Logan needed and deserved to find this balance, and that is what kept me coming back for more. I loved the sweet and sincerely loving interactions that these two had with their family and friends which gave them the courage to turn their life around and rekindle their beautiful marriage. Even though marriage is probably the hardest thing you will ever undertake in your life besides having and raising children, it will bring you more love and fulfillment than you ever thought possible.Kimberly Krey has shown me yet another reason why I adore her creative talent and could never get enough of her magnificent heart. She knows how to touch the heart and show us that while life is hard, it is so worth each and every effort we can put into making it exactly what we want. The best things in life are worth the wait, and on the same hand, they are worth the fight in order to get it and keep it. The heart always knows what it wants. Its just trying to convince the mind that throws us into a painful whirlwind that forces us to confront what is holding us back and learn how to conquer it.

We cant separate the heart from the mind without stripping away all traces of our humanity. Logic needs the emotion of the heart in order to ensure that we do not turn into cold, vacant carbon based shells walking around this world.

We must be ever vigilant in taking care not to allow our neighbors and friends to fall into such despairing danger.Mia Quinn is working on a heart-wrenching case that is taking everything she has to keep alive and on track.

You see this story through the eyes of one who longs for hope and love to prevail, but she also knows the cruel reality of life including her own. All she wants is to see those around her live a life filled with promise and peace, so she does what she can to help make this wish come true.Lis Wiehl is a passionate soul that deals with facts and logic, but what really guides her is a deep seated love and drive that this world will set its eyes on the bright light whose purpose is to transform and complete the lost and hurting of this dark and empty world.

"Revenge is an incredibly exquisite and thrillingly action-packed journey that takes us into a realm of darkness and oblivion that some are all too familiar with. We understand and accept the harshest parts of life when it comes our way, but what makes us stumble and stutter is whenever we are confronted with small pieces of pure and precious gold that are meant to be a haven of comfort and support. We dont know how to deal with the small slice of Heaven that has been sent directly to us, and as a result we fumble around in the darkness of our minds trying to comprehend what is happening. Instead, we need to stop rationalizing and contemplating and instead just allow the peace, love, and hope that it brings to fill us up and heal our hearts. The soothing respite may not last long, so take it and hold it close for as long as you have it.Carrie has been stripped bare of everything she ever loved and cherished in her life, so to have it given back to her with interest is something she isnt able to deal with easily.

He finally has her back, and he absolutely refuses to allow her to slip away. As he beings to understand what all she has gone through, he knows that she needs him more now than ever before, and he is determined to not only keep her safe but to show her how much she has always meant to him. Only with his unconditional love and trust can she hope to heal her heart one piece at a time. Will Carrie finally accept the help and love she craves from her friends, or will she see that coming back was the biggest mistake she ever made?If I thought Carrie was a strong and courageous woman in Return, then Revenge just confirmed what my heart has been telling me all along.

She is sto much stronger then she gives herself credit for, and luckily those around her see that and do everything they can to strengthen, encourage, and love her.

"Falling for My Boss is a delightfully fun and breathtakingly brilliant story of finding the stunningly unexpected at the worst possible time. This is an incredible story about finding yourself and the person who completes you in every way amidst the uncaring, stormy chaos of life. No matter how hard we might try to fight against and ignore our heart because of bad timing, ugly circumstances, or deeply ingrained insecurities, it will work that much harder to secure its hold on you and capture your full attention. You will not walk away easily, and you most definitely will not walk away forever unchanged from its overwhelming passion, its life-altering hope, and its devastatingly unfair knowledge of your deepest needs and biggest dreams. Once it has its hold on you, fighting is utterly useless, so instead embrace it with everything in you and allow your soul to find the peace and wholeness that only a love this true and pure can bring.Elizabeth is trying to live a life that she can be proud of, but chasing her dreams is proving harder than she ever thought. When she is offered a questionable job that makes her rethink what she is really doing, she is torn between pursuing something that could be end up to be a total disaster, or perhaps if she wants it bad enough could be a new start to finally opening her heart and trusting again.

Some gifts come wrapped with strings and secrets that could rip a burgeoning dream apart before it ever becomes reality. Does Scott and Elizabeth have what it takes to survive the aftermath of this raging storm, or will they watch helplessly as their small piece of Heaven slips right through their fingers?I felt so torn when Elizabeth finds herself in a terrible situation that only gets worse. Yes, she made a bad choice, and the price she paid was so much higher than she could have ever imagined. Its funny how we think we can compartmentalize ourselves in order to do things we think will benefit us. Thats like saying we can stop breathing and still continue to live a normal life. While Elizabeth courageously faced and dealt with one insecurity after another, it was Scott that my heart hurt for the most. Scott had no clue what was going on and all he did was put his heart on the line for her. Please dont think that I disliked Elizabeth because truthfully I fell in love with both her and Scott. They were so right and perfect for each other. There no barriers between them when they were together. They brought out the good in each other and helped to build the other up. Together they could have overcome anything, and what they found in each other was the missing piece to their soul. No words could accurately describe what they shared. They were simply beauty at its finest.J. S. Cooper continues to surprise and captivate me with her wonderfully heartfelt and fiercely raw stories of astonishing love mixed with true to life heartbreaking circumstances. She holds nothing back as she breaks my heart and mends it at the same time. Her writing and heart only grows stronger and bolder with each beautiful work or art she creates. These beautiful masterpieces are the stuff of dreams and the designers of legends. If you want to have a totally unique and intense experience, then look no further than a J. S. Cooper book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TBTIQJEWX1F6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TCQPCN8#wasThisHelpful","R2TBTIQJEWX1F6","AVNDR3UMO7VU5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVNDR3UMO7VU5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beautifully intense, wildly unexpected, and achingly raw Badass is the story you wont see coming that will capture your soul and hold your heart for ransom. Every now and again life offers us the best thing that we will ever find amidst the worst possible circumstances. All we have to do is to figure this out before its lost to us forever. Absolutely no pressure there. Some say when life gives us lemons, we should make lemonade. Too bad more of us dont think that way. Life would be a whole lot more interesting and what fun is life if we dont take a risk every now and again.Cassie is a serious student who is starting her graduate degree on the foreign shores of California after living her entire life in Massachusetts. She plans to devote her life to marine biology and to her love of nature and the wildlife within it. She never intended to find her own brand of wildlife for her own non-existent love life, but life had a big surprise in store that she would turn her heart and world upside down.

Will they be the same when the dust settles, or will they discover a love so all-encompassing and resilient that they will gladly open their hearts and their lives to the only One that has ever been able to breathe life into them?Cassie and Shane couldnt have been more different and yet they complimented and completed the other in ways they refused to acknowledge. While being too busy guarding their hearts from being hurt, they find that they have been living life on automatic. Not really feeling, keeping everyone out, and losing themselves in their work. They dont make excuses for who they are, but when their eyes are finally open they realize how much they have been missing. Their hearts collide and intertwine almost immediately ingraining the other into their very soul. Watching these two stumble through the meaning of real love, unconditional acceptance, and being vulnerable initially tore at my heart and then made it soar when life took on such a powerful meaning that they couldnt even express. I couldnt help falling in love with these two stunning characters that made me feel every part of their incredible journey together. The honest realism and the depth of their emotions hit me hard and left me absolutely gutted. There is no way that I could get enough of their love story!Linda Barlow and Alana Albertson undoubtedly and forever rocked my world with their mind-blowing masterpiece! They crushed and obliterated all of my expectations taking me for one out-of-this-world exquisite love story that has etched itself like a beautiful tattoo on my heart.

"A Gypsys Kiss is without a doubt both tantalizingly captivating and breathtakingly beautiful in its dark shroud of mystery, life-changing journey of love, and unwavering devotion to family. What an amazing gift to enjoy such an incredible adventure that highlights and focuses on the most important things that make life worth living! No one is ever truly unloved, and everyone touches the lives of those around them no matter how insignificant they think they are. Dont ever discount your place and importance in this world. We are all created to fulfill a very specific purpose, and we are the only ones that fulfill can it. We need to daily gather hope and courage from that fact. The greatest that thing you will ever do is just to love and be loved in return.Breena is born with a gift that she has only ever viewed as a curse. She doesnt see her purpose in life as being meaningful and so she chooses to isolate herself from everyone. While she has a huge heart and an untapped reserve of love, she resigned herself to being alone. After all who could ever love and accept her for who she really is? It could be said that Hawk has it all with his endless popularity, natural athletic talent, and a loving family, but sometimes appearances can be deceiving. He has a growing concern that he knows only one person can help him with, but he isnt sure he can convince Breena to help him out. He knows nothing about her, but as they try to unlock the mystery that haunts him, he sees in her what he has been missing and craving for in his own life. What starts out as a request for help slowly turns into a quest for winning the heart of the girl who completes him in every way. Will Breena open her heart and her life to take a chance to fulfill her deepest desire, or will she only give Hawk her help in unraveling the mystery surrounding his life?Walking beside Breena and Hawk during this entire journey has been completely exhilarating and delightfully heartwarming. Highlighting the importance and power of family and friends made my heart soar to the Heavens as society today doesnt typically view family in such a stunning and wholesome way. The only way we can succeed in this life is to hold our family close and to cherish the special love we find along the way just as dearly. I very much enjoyed watching Breena and Hawk discover and nurture the amazing love that came to life between then. Neither could have anticipated the impact that the other would have on them, and I am so glad that they took their time to learn about, cherish, and accept everything about each other. It was so wonderful to watch them fall in love and surrender to the beauty that their love created and inspired in them. It was their lifeline when things got hard, and it served as their courage to keep going when life looked impossible.Susan Griscom wrote with a heart full of vibrant color and overflowing love. When you combine the two, you get something that is wholly unique and incredibly spectacular. It touches the heart in such a powerful way that you know you will take this story and its characters with you from this day forward. The paranormal and suspense genres have always appealed to me, but when you mix those with strong, passionate themes of family, devotion, and love, you will steal my heart away and earn my reading devotion every time. If you enjoy these genres and themes as well, do not hesitate to read this book. You will NOT be disappointed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OALDPVT9I4VE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7DMMLY#wasThisHelpful","R2OALDPVT9I4VE","AVNDR3UMO7VU5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVNDR3UMO7VU5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wild Thing allows us a much deeper dive into this beautifully enchanting and fiercely emotional rollercoaster that is Georgie and Xan. We are privileged to see behind the veil on the mysterious and complex character that is Xan. I loved how we are granted a back stage pass to get to know the other band members as well. We see their strange dynamic up close and personal, and nothing is as it seems when it comes to Killer Valentine. So sit back, fasten your safety belt, and be prepared to for one wild and unforgettable ride!Georgia is determined to keep her heart as far away from Xan as possible. She is only with him for some temporary no strings fun and a place to hide while she regroups and gets her life back on track. No long term plans for her thank you very much and especially not with a man like Xan. The Ice Princess is firmly in charge and has no desire to relinquish control to anyone. Xan says he only wants Georgie around for some much needed fun and to help with his songwriting. Thats all he needs, and he barely has any time for those things with his bands packed scheduled. However, what he didnt count on was how quickly, quietly, and completely she has invaded his life, his heart, and his very soul. Now, all he wants is to keep her safely by his side, and he will do it by whatever means possible. After all alive and brokenhearted is better than dead and never coming back. What is a girl to do when her life hangs in the balance, and the only one who can save her is the very man who can easily destroy her? What will Xan risk to keep Georgie safe and his band on schedule to see their rise to fame finally become reality?I loved getting to know these beautiful characters on a much deeper level. They made me fall in love with all of them without any regrets. Georgie and Xan are both phenomenal characters who never failed to show me how beautiful life is when you find the person that completes you and how devastating love can be when it is toyed with and forced into a mold that it was never meant to fill. We have to be true to ourselves if we hope to grow and live a rich and fulfilling life. If we arent honest with ourselves, then we can never be truly honesty with anyone else. We all have choices we have to make, but we need to sure that they are good for not only us but for those around us. No matter what people may tell you, family and friends are all that you have in this world, so they should never be treated poorly or taken advantage of.Blair Babylon has written another utterly incredible work of art. No matter how many of her books I have read, she continues to become an even greater and more formidable author whose fierce passion and unbreakable conviction shines through the crowd to illuminate her uniquely creative and completely unforgettable genius. She excels at shining the light on the human soul and illustrating that we all have pieces of both light and dark inside each of us. We have to choose which we will allow to dominate and control us. Only we have that choice, and it should never be taken lightly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K4MBP3R4JF1M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEPXALS#wasThisHelpful","R1K4MBP3R4JF1M","AVNDR3UMO7VU5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVNDR3UMO7VU5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Perfect Love is an unquestionably courageous and undeniably passionate story that above all else highlights the indescribable power and the priceless value of family. No one or nothing should ever deter us from making sure that our family knows how much we love and appreciate them. They hold us up, empower us, and put a drive in our soul to do the unthinkable in order to protect, love, and cherish those who not only make up our world but are a piece of our world. Without family, the soul never truly lives, the heart never fully awakens, and the mind blocks off unused segments in order to survive and function. Our soul cries out to belong, to be wanted, and to be cherished. This is a part of ourselves that we ignore at our own peril, so no matter what you do in life, always be sure to love often, appreciate well, and never let go.Jo receives an extremely unexpected surprise that tilts her world on its axis.

Each one realizes how hard life is, but in the end they choose to focus on and nurture the best parts of their life  their family and friends.  Watching them rally around Jo and Liam during and after their darkest times in their life completely took my breath away. I cried many tears at seeing how much love and dedication they showered on this amazing couple. The right words to convey my full emotion utterly fail me. Jo and Liam are such a precious, real-life pair who fight every day to keep what they have and make it grow. They simply had me head over heels for them by the end of the story. I truly hope to see more from these truly breathtaking characters. In particular, I look forward to Liams bother Mace finding a woman who not only heals his broken heart but shows him everything that he has been missing out on in both life and love.If ever an author can open my heart and fill it with more emotion and understanding then I ever thought possible, it would be Becca Lee.

When a love so pure and right envelopes and permeates itself so thoroughly and gently throughout your heart, it cannot be easily stopped or pushed aside. Throwing aside such a precious gift is unthinkable and beyond cruel. Unfortunately, in life nothing is cut and dry when it comes to love and life. Sometimes we are convinced that love will only serve to hold us back from our dreams when in reality they only help to fuel and enhance your deepest dreams. If only, we could really understand that and not allow others to convince us to settle for leaving our heart on the side of the road. Living life without your heart completely removes the reason for life itself. Who would want to live like that?Evie is a girl with a dream of becoming a doctor. The only problem is that while her dreams pull her away from home, the boy who has stolen her heart is at home. She is completely torn by this, and ultimately she is convinced that her dreams are more important then what her heart wants. After all she can find love anywhere, right? Her heart tries to tell her that she is wrong, but to prove that she knows best, she finds a love at college that becomes only a shadow of what she desperately longs for. Romeo doesnt understand why the girl he intended to marry left him standing with his heart in his hands. He thought he knew where she stood, but obviously hes missing some important piece of information. When she comes home for a short break, he doesnt intend to waste any time in showing her what all she has missed out on. He wants to ingrain himself so deeply into her heart that she cant walk away this time. With meddling families and jealous siblings, these two have their work cut out for them. Will Evie follow her heart this time, or will she forever lose the best thing in her life?Evie attempted to make her dreams come true at the ultimate expense of her heart which only proved to her that she was making a huge mistake in the end. Everything came crashing down around her because you cant live your life devoid of your heart. You ignore it at your own demise. Her character really tugged at my heart because she learned the hard way that you cant walk away from the incredible love that she and Romeo carefully built and nurtured. My heart broke for Romeo since he was left completely in the dark without an excuse or any word from Evie for 5 years. I admire him for not hating her when she came back, but instead he was fiercely determined to prove to Evie that he still loved her and she had always been in his heart even she shut him out of her life. He was relentless in loving her and proving to her that she deserved to be loved so completely and perfectly even after she broke his heart. They belonged together, and he did everything he could to show her that she needed to choose him this time.Rachelle Ayala has created this beautifully dysfunctional Sanchez family who you love and yet want to smack them from time to time. They are a fun yet realistic family who in the end loves each other in spite of their faults and mistakes. While they might not go about things the right way, in the end they find the love, forgiveness, and courage they need to make the right decisions. We all get frustrated with those in our family, but deep in our heart, we love each other unconditionally. This is what I love to see each time I come back to this incredible group of people who have touched my heart one person at a time. I very much look forward to seeing more from them in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFH7FDVODAZ66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VS2DBU0#wasThisHelpful","RFH7FDVODAZ66","AVNDR3UMO7VU5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVNDR3UMO7VU5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This feels like the perfect storm in how it wildly and surprisingly brought Andie and Cade together and now all we see is its cruel and persistent attempts to pull these two apart. Thankfully, there is more than just a pretty face to this couple otherwise they would have thrown in the towel long before now. They recognize that there is something undeniable and irresistible that they found in the other that they havent been able to find in anyone else. Rather than give in and run away from their problems, they continue to weather this out of control hurricane and in the process they are forced to strengthen their defense and strike back just as viciously with their offense. The victors that are still standing after this disaster ends will win the ultimate prize which is unconditional and unquestionable love with an incredible future that is brighter than they ever dared to imagine.With a new and exciting job that pays well enough to help her parents out and getting a fresh start with Cade, Andie would love to sit back and just enjoy all of this good fortune, but fate is not without a bitter sense of humor. She finds her past has returned with a vengeance and a vendetta to destroy everything she holds most dear.  Knowing the messy and painful results of lying out of fear, she works up the courage to tell Cade the harsh truth of the life-altering shock that is tearing down her dreams one breath at a time. Cades life is finally settling down as he anticipates the birth of his son. He has Andie back in his life, and he couldnt be happier. Knowing that she intends to help and love his son, and seeing how well he is performing at training, he is walking in the clouds. Just as he gets comfortable, he is also blindsided with a surprise that tilts his world on its axis. Can Andie and Cade find the courage and strength they need to get through this together, or will one or both of them fold under the pressure and be forced to leave the game prematurely?I cant say how much I have enjoyed watching Andie and Cade grow as individuals and as a couple. They have a lot to work on and figure out, but they find out that the amount of time, patience, and love they invest in themselves and each other will be returned back to them ten time times greater making it so worth it in the end. Nothing seems to be easy for them, but truthfully nothing that is worth anything in life is ever easy to earn or work towards. That just makes the reward that much sweeter when they finally find it and keep it. I know for me its been so hard to watch these two wonderful characters struggle so much, and I know their troubles arent over yet. In fact, they are just heating up to a fast boil. Now, we will see if what they have already invested in each is going to pay off by standing with each other to the end no matter what or if they will instead choose to give up and walk away. I really hope they choose to be strong and hold each other up because this story ending with them together will be so very sweet and utterly fulfilling after this horrendous ride they have been forced to endure.While it may sound like I keep repeating myself when I sing my praises for Rachelle Ayalas masterpieces, but its only because it is the pure and honest truth. I continue to be astounded by the depth of creativity and heart that she pours into each of her stories. There is no pretense, it is just her offering up a piece of herself to all of us, and I am eager to accept it, savor it, and treasure it forever. The fresh and original approach to each of her stories just blows my mind. Nothing is stale with her storylines or her characters. They both jump off the pages and forever embed themselves into my heart. I will never get tired of the soul and honesty that I see hidden inside each book. It deeply touches me like nothing else can. Whatever you do, you have to read at least one of Rachelles beautifully captivating and thoroughly entertaining stories! You will never look at stories the same ever again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CYWABA14QS6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VDHM9C6#wasThisHelpful","R2CYWABA14QS6X","AVNDR3UMO7VU5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVNDR3UMO7VU5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Incredibly heartfelt, amazingly optimistic, and fiercely passionate are just a few of the ways that I would describe The Mistake by Elle Kennedy. It is definitely unique in its view of life and the people who are a part of that life. Rather than dishing out harsh rebuke for mistakes, Kennedy wants us to focus on the motivation behind those mistakes. Dealing with and resolving the root cause rather than just making the problem worse. Bad decisions are owned and instead of despairing over them, her unbelievable characters choose to rise above them and make amends as much as possible. Everyone from family to friends has a hand in helping those who need to right a wrong. After all, we dont live our lives in isolation, so why should we not offer a helping hand when we know we can truly help someone?!John has no future. At least that is what he has convinced himself over the years. His family situation continues to fall apart fast, and this only adds more chains of depression and hopelessly that wrap around his heart cutting off the happiness and joy that he desperately clings to. His only solution is to plunge himself into every pleasure that he can find which include a never-ending supply of girls and parties. Grace started college with a resolve to become more then what she had settled for in high school. She wants to spread her wings and find out who she is and what she is capable of doing. Along the way, she inadvertently crosses paths with John, and what starts out as a mistake blossoms into something that is too beautiful for words. When John carelessly pushes Grace aside under the guise of protecting her, her heart is broken and he realizes too late the needless damage he has done. What he doesnt realize in time is that his heart is steering him towards something that is longer lasting and more deeply fulfilling than what he has settled for. Will he listen to his heart before its too late, or will he lose his one chance at a love so pure and ravishing that he will find himself in an even worse place then he can imagine? One thing is for sure  John has his work cut out for him because he isnt winning Grace back without hard work, determination, and imagination.I wasnt sure what to expect going into this story, but I can tell you that I was rocked to my core at finding the immense love, powerful encouragement, and out of this world determination to hold onto the precious gifts and surprises that fate throws into our path. Each problem and conflict is dealt with such grace and love that I almost cried a few times at how much it really touched me. This story is nothing short of a stunning success! John and Grace were fiercely independent and not the usual weepy, touchy-feely teenagers that you might see in NA stories which made me love them that much more. Their journey felt so incredibly real and their struggles tore at my heart as I watched them stumble and fall a few times, but my spirit soared with them as they both learned to trust, depend, and love each other in a positive and uplifting way. These two had me falling for them before I realized what was happening which tells me that this author knows how to sincerely touch the heart of her readers in a way that will leave them forever changed.Elle Kennedy surprised me, shocked me, and secured my loyalty as a reader. I am over the moon in love with John and Grace and their extraordinary story! Everyone should read, experience, and enjoy their story as well. It will leave you rethinking your approach to life, friends, family, and strangers. I dont know about you, but I love being challenged by books that are written with the heart and soul of a person who longs to show others that love and hope can change the world one person at a time. Now, its up to you to decide what to do with the challenge that Kennedy has placed before you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S23NILKNBZPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WASWK7Q#wasThisHelpful","R1S23NILKNBZPH","AVNDR3UMO7VU5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVNDR3UMO7VU5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is not magic, it will work amazingly well for the small set of people who are quite overweight and need fiber but other methods aren't working. I tried plenty of other fiber rich foods nothing worked. Lost 1# per week for more than half a year with this product. hence the 5 stars.. now the 'cons'; this brand is VERY over priced. I was happy to pay the 4x premium because they were the ones that brought it to my attention with their pricy national advts. but now I use generic konjac root for 10/g vs 44/gram this costs.I have to keep taking but in my case only about 1-2g/day average helps me maintain 160# vs 185# and that is five-stars worthy.

"Awesome value,  useless tweezers,  sadly missing the 100g weight that would make the kit complete. I bought a 100g weight hoping i could modify the box to fit it into the space that seemingly was made to fit it so that i could have a complete set that I could use to calibrate my new 200g scales. (both of which need 200g but one of which needs both 100g and 200g)I used a razor knife to separate the inner frame from the box, pulled out the inner frame from the box, then i used a forstner bit size 7/8 to drill the bottom out of the 100g spot. The foam in the lid was too tight for the box lit to close w/o distorting it so i used a 5/8 fortner bit turned backwards by hand on the foam to cut a nice circle, using the same trick i cut a circle in a piece of smooth cardboard and pressed down on the foam so the cut circle would 'pop up' through the cardboard and used an extendable razor knife to slice off about 80% of the thickness of the foam; now i  have a complete set including 100g individual weight and enough other weights i can easily calibrate my two 200g scales.I managed to 'tiddly wink' one of the 20mg weights across the room and lost it and am pretty sure the kit came with a 5mg weight that went missing on first use; so word to the wise be very careful opening the ziplock bag with the micro weights!My new scales have 0.01g precision and all the weights appear to be well within 0.01g tolerance as i've been getting exactly repeatable measurements.the mg weights could be made better and with consistency (e.g. all stainless steel so they won't disappear in the presence of a magnet) and it would be *really nice* considering the size of them and the negligible cost, that there might be some spares! That said it would be a solid 5 stars if it had the mystery 100g spot filled with a 100g weight and if the tweezer included wasn't pointlessly useless (wouldn't open enough to pick up the 5g weight and broke when trying to stretch it open big enough to do so, also wouldn't grab the mg weights so really literally useless). Super happy on the purchase and would most definitely buy again. (and modify again and through out the useless tweezer again)","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10H87RYIC363W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003STEJAC#wasThisHelpful","R10H87RYIC363W","A7728VDTCAOHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7728VDTCAOHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great little scale,  stunning price, hard to pick between this one and it's brother, the ACP-200. After studying the reviews I bought both so I could review and either send back the least favored or keep them both (i'm keeping both).How do they compare?The size; chrome is smaller, 2 1/2 x 4 9/16 x 3/4 inches vs 2 3/4 x 4 7/8 x 3/4 (2 7/8 bumps for the hinges)volume: 8.55 cu. inches vs 10.05 cu. inches (the chrome is 15% smaller).The chrome is nearly identical in width and height to an iphone 4 in a case, and 1/4 in. thicker, the other is 1/4 inch bigger in all all 3 dimensions.The chrome weighs 116g vs the other is 143 w/o the pouch and 152g with. (means the chrome is 25% lighter). for comparison my iphone 5 with  the case is almost identical to the acp-200 (not the chrome) at 142g.Displays:Hands down winner is the non-chrome. The chrome is reverse LCD and you can almost always see the ghost of the non-lit segments, you can see the illumination point on  the side, it's not evenly lit but the saving grace is it's still always absolutely legible. The height of the numbers is 3/8 on the non-chrome vs 1/2 inch on the chrome.  The non-chrome's display is perfect. absolutely perfect EL blue illumination corner to corner. It shows the battery level it shows grams value always and the secondary unit choice also always in 1/4"" tall numbers in the  bottom right. In addition it shows a zero mark when it's not reading any weight which is nice to remind you if you've tare'd or not.Functions:They are functionally nearly identical with these differences:1) the chrome has avoirdupois oz, troy oz, pennyweight, carat, grain as well as gram but ONLY shows the chosen unit,2) the non-chrome has pennyweight, grain, carat as well as gram and shows the secondary unit simultaneously.This clearly puts the chrome ahead if you want for measuring gold or jewelry or need to have your results in oz right away w/o needing to do math.The LID/cover as a tray:The chrome model, the lid comes off completely in normal use, and works a little better as a tray, It also includes a cheat-sheet of operation which is really helpful for reminding you how to calibrate the scale but is missing a critical item: how to use for piece counting! (something you are very likely to forget how to do by the next time you want to use it).There is a curious quirk with the lid on the chrome model: if you put on upside-down, it takes literally 12x the force to remove (i just measured 50g force to open when installed correctly and over 600g force to remove when upside down). this is after wearing it in; when brand new it wsa likely twice that or 'nearly impossible'. The fix; pull open from the top not the bottom. Testing just now the lid pulled off at 700g from the bottom and 100g from the top when on upside down. You can grip from the sides and slowly pull at the top edge; if your fingers are too slippery use a piece of tape, then pay attention in the future and put on correctly you'll never have a problem again.The non-chrome model,The lid is attached with a hinge. I didn't notice in the manual if it said how to remove to use as a tray but it's quite simple; open the lid 90and pull the lid away directly sideways either at the top or the bottom 'peeling' the lid away from the base.The performance 'as a tray' goes hands-down however to the chrome. The lids are both a little bit convex so when placed on the scale platform they get skittish and will want to wander around a bit; the chrome model it's not noticeable but on the non-chrome it's super-duper noticeable; it feels like you've invented magnetic levitation. I just spun my lid and it twirled over a dozen full rotations. Fortunately in practice it rarely causes any problem, it's more of a nuisance than any actual problem.Calibration:The chrome model is easier to calibrate requiring only a 200g reference where the non-chrome requires both 100g and 200g weights.Do not attempt to use some makeshift solution you will need to get some actual reference weights to calibrate your scale. My chrome scale came completely miscalibrated; off maybe 6g at 100g when I got it; the non-chrome was spot-on and within 0.02g from the factory. My 100g calibration kit came with the scales but my additional 100g weight hadn't arrived yet but I was able to make one pretty easy in this way: I put my 100g reference on the working scale, and hit the tare button giving me a zero reference. I put a small measuring cup that would hold maybe 150ml of water and filled it until the scale read almost exactly zero. Then i took a small wad of paper towel and soaked it in water. taking that piece of paper towel either squeezed out drips or soaked up a bit of water until I got the scale to register 0.00 g.Then I took off the makeshift water weight, zero'd the scale and put the reference weight back on. noting the reading (100.04 for example) and put the water weight on.. it was slightly different probably due to evaporation so tinkered a bit until it matched the reference exactly and I could swap the two and get the same reading within 0.01g. At that point I could use the real reference and the water copy to achieve the 200g needed to calibrate both scales with perfect success.. A little while later I measured the 'water weight reference' and sure enough  it was a few 00ths of a gram lighter due to evaporation.With a little bit of luck on your side and a pile of coins you could likely achieve the same success if you have 100g reference but need 200g. You will want to have a permanent actual 100g and 200g reference.accuracy:absolutely amazing on both scales! I have taken over a dozen pictures with the scales showing 0.00g error or 0.01g error at all levels from 0.50g to 200.00g and even with the scales stacked; putting the chrome on the non-chrome, hitting tare on both and putting a weight on the top scale. I could put on 52.12g of reference weight and get 52.12 reading (0.00g error) on both scales where the bottom scale is of course measuring with  116g offset yet still achieving near perfect and repeatable accuracy.just now put a 5g reference on each scale and got a 5.00 reading on each. added 50g and chrome reading 54.99 and non-chrome also 54.99.added 10mg and non-chrome came right up to 55.00. repeated on the chrome and it likewise came up to 55.00. The fact that the scale will actually register a change of .01g after it's already settled in is astounding.Auto-off function.As you will see from other reviewers; the scales will shut off after some amount of non-use. The non-chrome seems to do a MUCH better job at re-setting the count-down timer when you change the weight; bump the scale, add or subtract weight within a minute and it does not shut off. The chrome model shuts on me plenty, the non-chrome if i bump it once in a while (within a minute) it stays on continously and i never have a problem with it. The chrome model on the other hand is annoyingly quick to shut off. fThey clearly have the same basic timer; doing this review i've  seen them both shut off within 1 sec of each other half a dozen times but during the same time Ive seen the chrome off while the non-chrome still on at least a half dozen times.Accuracy:They both are crazy accurate and high or low weights.If you need to measure crazy low weights like 2-20 mg, you want a different scale but in a pinch these guys will measure values in the 100mg range with repeatable accuracy. I have noticed the non-chrome does have some better software and hits repeatable values better. example; putting on a 100mg reference, I'm more likely to see 0.09 on the chrome than the non-chrome. Or when adding on 10mg, more likely to NOT see the up-tick on the chrome. In BOTH cases, lightly tapping the platform (talking about a 1-2g tap with tweezer), i've found that the re-weigh will be far more likely to match the  reference especially if you've just added on 10-20mg.That being said, using 100+10mg  references, I could repeatedly get 0.10 and 0.11 readings from the non-chrome as well as get readings  as low as 30mg that matched the reference weight where that just won't happen on the chrome. below .1g I wouldn't trust the chrome at all, while i've gotten repeateable accuracy of 30, 50, 80, 110, 130, 150mg on the non-chrome. it may take 10+ sec. for the final reading to come in but sure enough.. I saw 0.05g reading after I added 20mg to 50mg (it didn't show the addition of the 20mg).. i looked away for a few seconds and sure enough 0.08 was showing! at the same time i put 100mg on the chrome and it settled in on at coincidentally 0.08. off by 20mg.another test just now: 5g = 5.00, add 100mg; 5.10, add 50mg;  5.15, add 10mg; 5.16, then add 20mg and it reads 5.18. that is absolutely insane for a $16 device!now the same test on the chrome: 5g= 5.00, add 100mg; 5.09, add 50mg; 5.14, add 10mg; 5.16, then add 20mg; 5.18. also insane.I tapped the platform any time i add weight to ""tell""  the scale to re-evaluate. oh the scale just changed to 5.17; also something that happens more often on the chrome; wondering results. never a big difference but more likely than the non-chrome to do so.astounding; both scales auto-off'd on me, I turned 'em on, let them warm up a few seconds and put the 5.18 back on.. the non-chrome hit 5.18 the first shot. the chrome: 5.16, then with a tap, 5.17, weights off; tare, weights on; 5.17, weights off, re-tare, weights on; 5.17, tap; 5.18.took som coaxing but did work. non-chrome auto off'd; power on, weights back  on; hit5.18 first shot.So in my first 5 days with the scales, this is what ive been experiencing; the non-chrome ACP-200 has been hitting repeatable #s within 0.01g, and while the chrome model will hit within 0.02 per it's claim, it is a much bigger fractional error on small weights so the non-chrome kicks its butt when weights are less than a gram and even when below 10g, the error starts to become significant (.4% at 5g where at 100g that error is 0.02%).last test; 1g weight freshly turned on; the non-chrome hit 1.00 within a second, the chrome registered 1.01 for a couple seconds then was 1.00 then 0.99 then back to 1.00; adding 50mg they both hit 1.05 within a couple seconds. absolutely stunning.

"Great little scale,  stunning price, hard to pick between this one and it's brother, the ACP-200. After studying the reviews I bought both so I could review and either send back the least favored or keep them both (i'm keeping both).How do they compare?The size; chrome is smaller, 2 1/2 x 4 9/16 x 3/4 inches vs 2 3/4 x 4 7/8 x 3/4 (2 7/8 bumps for the hinges)volume: 8.55 cu. inches vs 10.05 cu. inches (the chrome is 15% smaller).The chrome is nearly identical in width and height to an iphone 4 in a case, and 1/4 in. thicker, the other is 1/4 inch bigger in all all 3 dimensions.The chrome weighs 116g vs the other is 143 w/o the pouch and 152g with. (means the chrome is 25% lighter). for comparison my iphone 5 with  the case is almost identical to the acp-200 (not the chrome) at 142g.Displays:Hands down winner is the non-chrome. The chrome is reverse LCD and you can almost always see the ghost of the non-lit segments, you can see the illumination point on  the side, it's not evenly lit but the saving grace is it's still always absolutely legible. The height of the numbers is 3/8 on the non-chrome vs 1/2 inch on the chrome.  The non-chrome's display is perfect. absolutely perfect EL blue illumination corner to corner. It shows the battery level it shows grams value always and the secondary unit choice also always in 1/4"" tall numbers in the  bottom right. In addition it shows a zero mark when it's not reading any weight which is nice to remind you if you've tare'd or not.Functions:They are functionally nearly identical with these differences:1) the chrome has avoirdupois oz, troy oz, pennyweight, carat, grain as well as gram but ONLY shows the chosen unit,2) the non-chrome has pennyweight, grain, carat as well as gram and shows the secondary unit simultaneously.This clearly puts the chrome ahead if you want for measuring gold or jewelry or need to have your results in oz right away w/o needing to do math.The LID/cover as a tray:The chrome model, the lid comes off completely in normal use, and works a little better as a tray, It also includes a cheat-sheet of operation which is really helpful for reminding you how to calibrate the scale but is missing a critical item: how to use for piece counting! (something you are very likely to forget how to do by the next time you want to use it).There is a curious quirk with the lid on the chrome model: if you put on upside-down, it takes literally 12x the force to remove (i just measured 50g force to open when installed correctly and over 600g force to remove when upside down). this is after wearing it in; when brand new it wsa likely twice that or 'nearly impossible'. The fix; pull open from the top not the bottom. Testing just now the lid pulled off at 700g from the bottom and 100g from the top when on upside down. You can grip from the sides and slowly pull at the top edge; if your fingers are too slippery use a piece of tape, then pay attention in the future and put on correctly you'll never have a problem again.The non-chrome model,The lid is attached with a hinge. I didn't notice in the manual if it said how to remove to use as a tray but it's quite simple; open the lid 90and pull the lid away directly sideways either at the top or the bottom 'peeling' the lid away from the base.The performance 'as a tray' goes hands-down however to the chrome. The lids are both a little bit convex so when placed on the scale platform they get skittish and will want to wander around a bit; the chrome model it's not noticeable but on the non-chrome it's super-duper noticeable; it feels like you've invented magnetic levitation. I just spun my lid and it twirled over a dozen full rotations. Fortunately in practice it rarely causes any problem, it's more of a nuisance than any actual problem.Calibration:The chrome model is easier to calibrate requiring only a 200g reference where the non-chrome requires both 100g and 200g weights.Do not attempt to use some makeshift solution you will need to get some actual reference weights to calibrate your scale. My chrome scale came completely miscalibrated; off maybe 6g at 100g when I got it; the non-chrome was spot-on and within 0.02g from the factory. My 100g calibration kit came with the scales but my additional 100g weight hadn't arrived yet but I was able to make one pretty easy in this way: I put my 100g reference on the working scale, and hit the tare button giving me a zero reference. I put a small measuring cup that would hold maybe 150ml of water and filled it until the scale read almost exactly zero. Then i took a small wad of paper towel and soaked it in water. taking that piece of paper towel either squeezed out drips or soaked up a bit of water until I got the scale to register 0.00 g.Then I took off the makeshift water weight, zero'd the scale and put the reference weight back on. noting the reading (100.04 for example) and put the water weight on.. it was slightly different probably due to evaporation so tinkered a bit until it matched the reference exactly and I could swap the two and get the same reading within 0.01g. At that point I could use the real reference and the water copy to achieve the 200g needed to calibrate both scales with perfect success.. A little while later I measured the 'water weight reference' and sure enough  it was a few 00ths of a gram lighter due to evaporation.With a little bit of luck on your side and a pile of coins you could likely achieve the same success if you have 100g reference but need 200g. You will want to have a permanent actual 100g and 200g reference.accuracy:absolutely amazing on both scales! I have taken over a dozen pictures with the scales showing 0.00g error or 0.01g error at all levels from 0.50g to 200.00g and even with the scales stacked; putting the chrome on the non-chrome, hitting tare on both and putting a weight on the top scale. I could put on 52.12g of reference weight and get 52.12 reading (0.00g error) on both scales where the bottom scale is of course measuring with  116g offset yet still achieving near perfect and repeatable accuracy.just now put a 5g reference on each scale and got a 5.00 reading on each. added 50g and chrome reading 54.99 and non-chrome also 54.99.added 10mg and non-chrome came right up to 55.00. repeated on the chrome and it likewise came up to 55.00. The fact that the scale will actually register a change of .01g after it's already settled in is astounding.Auto-off function.As you will see from other reviewers; the scales will shut off after some amount of non-use. The non-chrome seems to do a MUCH better job at re-setting the count-down timer when you change the weight; bump the scale, add or subtract weight within a minute and it does not shut off. The chrome model shuts on me plenty, the non-chrome if i bump it once in a while (within a minute) it stays on continously and i never have a problem with it. The chrome model on the other hand is annoyingly quick to shut off. fThey clearly have the same basic timer; doing this review i've  seen them both shut off within 1 sec of each other half a dozen times but during the same time Ive seen the chrome off while the non-chrome still on at least a half dozen times.Accuracy:They both are crazy accurate and high or low weights.If you need to measure crazy low weights like 2-20 mg, you want a different scale but in a pinch these guys will measure values in the 100mg range with repeatable accuracy. I have noticed the non-chrome does have some better software and hits repeatable values better. example; putting on a 100mg reference, I'm more likely to see 0.09 on the chrome than the non-chrome. Or when adding on 10mg, more likely to NOT see the up-tick on the chrome. In BOTH cases, lightly tapping the platform (talking about a 1-2g tap with tweezer), i've found that the re-weigh will be far more likely to match the  reference especially if you've just added on 10-20mg.That being said, using 100+10mg  references, I could repeatedly get 0.10 and 0.11 readings from the non-chrome as well as get readings  as low as 30mg that matched the reference weight where that just won't happen on the chrome. below .1g I wouldn't trust the chrome at all, while i've gotten repeateable accuracy of 30, 50, 80, 110, 130, 150mg on the non-chrome. it may take 10+ sec. for the final reading to come in but sure enough.. I saw 0.05g reading after I added 20mg to 50mg (it didn't show the addition of the 20mg).. i looked away for a few seconds and sure enough 0.08 was showing! at the same time i put 100mg on the chrome and it settled in on at coincidentally 0.08. off by 20mg.another test just now: 5g = 5.00, add 100mg; 5.10, add 50mg;  5.15, add 10mg; 5.16, then add 20mg and it reads 5.18. that is absolutely insane for a $16 device!now the same test on the chrome: 5g= 5.00, add 100mg; 5.09, add 50mg; 5.14, add 10mg; 5.16, then add 20mg; 5.18. also insane.I tapped the platform any time i add weight to ""tell""  the scale to re-evaluate. oh the scale just changed to 5.17; also something that happens more often on the chrome; wondering results. never a big difference but more likely than the non-chrome to do so.astounding; both scales auto-off'd on me, I turned 'em on, let them warm up a few seconds and put the 5.18 back on.. the non-chrome hit 5.18 the first shot. the chrome: 5.16, then with a tap, 5.17, weights off; tare, weights on; 5.17, weights off, re-tare, weights on; 5.17, tap; 5.18.took som coaxing but did work. non-chrome auto off'd; power on, weights back  on; hit5.18 first shot.So in my first 5 days with the scales, this is what ive been experiencing; the non-chrome ACP-200 has been hitting repeatable #s within 0.01g, and while the chrome model will hit within 0.02 per it's claim, it is a much bigger fractional error on small weights so the non-chrome kicks its butt when weights are less than a gram and even when below 10g, the error starts to become significant (.4% at 5g where at 100g that error is 0.02%).last test; 1g weight freshly turned on; the non-chrome hit 1.00 within a second, the chrome registered 1.01 for a couple seconds then was 1.00 then 0.99 then back to 1.00; adding 50mg they both hit 1.05 within a couple seconds. absolutely stunning. Adding 50mg to chrome and 51.04, tap and 51.05 appears. non-chrome: 51.04 and stays. adding 50g and the -.01g offset stays 101.04g. the chrome started with101.04 but settled in at 101.05 exactly matching the reference values. re-weigh after power-cycle and with 100g reference hit 100.00g (i took a pic) then put on the 1g + 50mg and it hit 101.05g for almost a minute; it wandered up to 101.06 (0.01% error). just before powering off.

"Really nice rack; some things to be aware of however;1) the kit includes a mount you attach to the wall and then hook baskets onto.2) the baskets are not necessarily 'square' with the pegs on the mount3) the pegs on the mount are not prefectly square with the mount.I mounted the mount on the wall perfectly plumb only to discover that the baskets 1) were not level and 2) were not the same amount of crooked.I found two of the three baskets that were the  same amount  of crooked, put my magnetic level in the bottom of the baskets and re-leveled the bracket crooked so that the baskets are perfectly level.The baskets are too close together reducing the capacity by 40% on the bottom two so i'm using 2 on the bracket that came with and will mount the  3rd elseware by itself.Since  the bracket is not wide enough to  reach between studs, I drilled holes into the  bracket in the center so i could mount onto a stud (totally not needed but I'm a member of overbuilder's anonymous).

"Absolutely fantastic; retail price over $230, they sell for $150 elsewhere and the PLASTIC VERSION was actually 50 more last time i looked.I couldn't find any review that would confirm that this tool worked with the scotch-weld dual-syringe 50ml tubes and this one says 2-oz but the so-called 2-ounce tube i bought with this gun actually said 1.6oz on it!So with amazon's policy of return, i 'took a bullet' for the team and bought some of each of 1.7oz (50ml) and so-called '2 oz' 'automix' epoxy and this gun to compare them and see which worked..The results:  1.6oz, 1.7oz, 50ml, 47ml, are synonymous and all work in in this metal version and presumably the plastic EPX applicator gun as well. The 'pro' with the metal one is it's WAY stronger, but the only 'con' is that it only works with 1:1 mix epoxy tubes, where the plastic one has interchangeable plungers allowing for 1:1, 2:1 and 10:1 mixes.It looks possible to modify this heavy duty gun to work with 2:1 mixes and i may buy one tube to verify if that is indeed possible. I will certainly post an update if that's the case.Also, the picture is very confusing so i posted a set of pics showing exactly how the gun works.-awr","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28EVQ5UQGPRY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PF13Z6#wasThisHelpful","R28EVQ5UQGPRY6","A7728VDTCAOHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7728VDTCAOHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update: bumped up to 4 Starr's from 3: the easy fix stayed for 15  months before I sold my pan to a buddy and bought a new one. The new 12"" had the hump (about 1/16 inch tall). I put a star back because in practice very few items have a problem with cooking on the hump and though every indication is t-fal is backpeddling on trying to say it's on purpose that is obviously not true if it's not always. ""We purposely make SOME of them domed"". My 10"" is perfectly flat.As promised and only 4mo. after getting my new 12"" I developed a new way to flatten the pan: one step and worked like a charm.How'd I do it? Drove over it with my SUV. NOT KIDDING check out the photos.I was trying to figure out a fool proof method somebody could copy using on-hand items.Items: sawdust or kitty litter etc sheet of plywood about 18"" square several ""drive over boards"" (3/4 plywood about the width of your car tire good) some bricks or 2x limber cut to size small pieces of plywood cut to size as neededAs the last photos show, clips from my movie, I put sawdust down in a circle under the pan, slightly concave in the middleI put the 18"" square of 1/2 plywood over the sawdustI put the pan on that sheetI assembled a ramp from bricks and plywood to get car tire over the lip of pan.I put a square of 2x4 on top of a 4"" square of 1/2"" thick plywood to do the pressing.I drove over using front wheel for more weight.I stopped for a second or two centered on pan and drove off.My dome dropped 58/1000 on one pass and the flat c-channel I used for flat reference shows nearly perfectly flat after and a test with some soapy water shows absolutely zero ""moat"" effect. 100% solved!For whatever reason my 10"" model was perfectly flat out he gate so no fix needed.For naysayers that drank the t-fal koolaid: in addition to the problems of food like crepes and eggs being hard to cook: flat top stoves lose about 80% of their conductive heat transfer when only touching on the outer edges so it makes for uneven cooking which is my primary motivation for fixing my ONE AND ONLY EVER domed pan.Original review:As many have noted: the pan may actually be the holy grail of non stick but the ego stamped on the bottom makes for a mini mountain in the centre of the pan.Wheat happens is that you will get a ""moat"" of oil around the center island of dry in the center of the pan. Nice if you want to make donut shaped crpes I suppose. Not super nice for anything else.QC so ""out of whack"" for a top tier vendor like t-fal is inexcusable. Somebody should be fired literally.Is it too much to ask that the flat bottom of a pan is flat without having to fix it yourself? Yeesh!The good news: easy to fix. I've used the trick of standing in a pan on carpet to un-mound a dozen pans in then past, and a similar trick worked on this pan.Then trick: the thick aluminum bottom was more robust than the pans I've fixed in the past so i used a slightly different method:I formed a donut shape with a rolled up towel and set the pan on it, then I stepped inside and while standing on the ball of my foot I lunged up and down ""hopping but keping foot On the ground"".I checked for flatness with a ruler both outside and inside until I was satisfied. In the end, two teaspoons of water with a tiny bit of dish soap to ""wet"" the surface spread edge to edge, no island. Also 1 1/2 tbsp. of oil once heated filled the bottom of the pan perfectly. (When cold it puddled in the center and stayed).So, ""A"" for non stick, ""D"" for putting a hill in the center of every pan by stamping a logo in without the proper compensation in the blank or the very least a follow up stamp to make the pan flat and some friggin' quality control!Ok, so after 1-2 minutes of hopping up and down, the hump in the middle went from nearly 1mm tall (about 1/4 the thickness of the metal to put that into perspective) down to about a 0.2mm dent in the bottom and darn near perfectly flat inside. (There are a couple areas maybe 0.1mm shallow inside, enough to take maybe 0.1 tsp of liquid but inconsequential. The fact the bottom still has a shallow when the top is flat means the stamping process (for the logo) is making the metal thinner in the center in addition to making the little hill.Love the pan and can't wait to get some cooking done and a follow-up if the fix is relatively permanent.I'll post pics when I get a chance.-awrupdate: so i got to try it out, and freakeshly non-stick; was so easy to cook crepes in this pan! especially with the thermo-dot. It turns color just a little too hot for perfect crepes but they were amazing and tasty; and just slid out of the pan!I ended up having to re-level my stove before i could really test the flattened out fixed copy, but with only 2 tsp of oil to lightly oil the pan (probably not even remotely needed for these crepes), there were just random spots of oil; it doesn't want to adhere to the pan enough to make a coating.I have a neat picture of 2 tsp of oil just sitting in a puddle in the dead-center of the pan while heating. I also was able to make an 'oil moat' just about 3/8"" wide around the entire pan at one point, so there is still a little bit of a 'low spot' or perhaps just the fact there is a bend in the pan gives the oil something to grab onto.Now if i can only get my wife to stop using metal instruments and get the pan to last a while.considering it was 1/3 to 1/4 the price of a decent tri-ply pan the same size, this pan in spite of its hiccups is a home-run.-awr","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD4YBP8M1UWXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GWG0T2#wasThisHelpful","RD4YBP8M1UWXG","A7728VDTCAOHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7728VDTCAOHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You do need a drill press to use one. The fist modification I did I used regular drill bits and 3-4 steps in size up to half inch. That hole was nowhere near as perfect or easy as the plug cutter solution. note: the 3/8 size makes a 1/2"" hole. The 3/8 dimension is the inside.Then to plug the hole I use an expanding plug like a boat uses to drain when pulled out of the water.

"The power switch (they call a 'selector switch' is a terrible and inexpensive design destined to fail. It is a non-snap-acting leaf switch related to the 'knife' switch we used when we were in 4th grade but less reliable. The design is inherently bad, and destined to fail. This is because every time the unit is turned off it wil absolutely ARC which will cause a little bit of a 'burn' on the contact making it less conductive the next time. The switch is not different from the type of switch used in the 1800s for a telegraph machine; two contacts held apart on a springy coper strip that is pressed on until the contacts slowly touch (guaranteeing and arc every single time).(if you ever notice a flash of light emitting from the bottom center of the unit (reflecting off your counter top), that is from the ARC going across the switch with one more 'simon says' step toward certain doom)In my case, the switch self-destructed on the SECOND use. the contact for the main element overheated due to the carbon from the arc and melted the plastic lobe designed to SLOWLY PUSH the contacts closed, so the contact didn't close and it would no longer turn on.the ones that stay working are just lucky. the design is terrible. (of the switch). It (the switch) carries 12 AMPs and NEEDS to be a snap-acting switch. i'm very shocked this unit passed any type of product testing (e.g. UL labs).In any event, rather than waste 45% of the price i paid for mine just to send it in and get another useless switch, i re-engineered mine to utilize the other half of the leaf spring switch to carry the high-current of the unit and by KNOWING how tragically bad the inherent design is, i can switch the switch as fast as possible or better yet, turn the 'selector' switch to the position i want FIRST and *THEN* plug in the unit. the arc will then happen in the plug in the wall 1. something that gets cleaned each insertion and 2. costs $1.50 for a replacement.If my repair job fails i will 'jumper' out the switch permanently so that i will HAVE to plug/unplug to supply power to the unit and the 'selector' switch actually will be just that and no longer attempt to be a power switch.If I really feel like it i may replace the piss poor power switch with a proper one then won't have to un-plug to power down. a proper snap-acting switch even if just a light switch will do the job properly.I will post pictures of my failed switch and some descriptions that will help somebody with electrical skills to repair their own unit for free (and permanently).almost certainly if your unit started to turn itself off, and then would turn on only if the switch was partly turned toward either grill or griddle but would turn back off when all the way to either, your switch self-destructed by over-heating and can easily be fixed permanently.if you get one or have one, if you want it to continue working you should NEVER turn the unit OFF while plugged in! it will also last longer for SURE if you plug in AFTER selecting the mode you want. The switch literally is not designed to handle being turned on or off with power applied, it's a terrible terrible switch design for high-power.now for the good.1. man it makes a mean panini. absolutely perfect toasting of the bread, it self-levels and does exactly what it's supposed to do2. replaces my $20 griddle. probably not really better but eliminates an appliance and does fit eight pieces of french toast at once! I probably will never use for bacon unless i use it outside camping! just way too much grease splatter (though i'm considering trying it CLOSED). the new enclosed grease tray should harvest the splatters well.3. i bought the waffle plates. see my review there; they are great, not fantastic, however they are perfectly acceptable and there goes one more machine i don't need anymore.4. the 'new' model doesn't match the descriptions in many of the '1 star' and '2 star' reviews. Clearly they made a 'revision b' model with the same name (dumb dumb dumb). The new model 1. uses flip-over vs separate plates for grill/griddle, 2. uses identical plates for top and bottom, 3. has an integrated drip tray, 4. has a METAL hinge! 5. has some really tough plastic clips to hold the hot plates on.I'm very happy with mine, now that i've fixed the switch and know not to flip the power off while on. (oh. an easier way to turn off w/o pulling the plug would be to turn down the temperature until the 'heated up' indicator goes out, at that point the main switch would have no current and would not arc. That doesn't really help for turning the unit ON. I recommend having the selector switch set to your choice BEFORE plugging in the unit, then as just mentioned, turn down the temperature before turning the unit off. If you follow that protocol, the unit will last a WHOLE lot LONGER.I recommend the unit for anybody interested in the utility. I recommend that unless you are an electrical DIY genius you get one NEW so you have the full warranty. I recommend you follow the previous paragraph to the letter if you wish it to last.look for my pictures of the ridiculously cheap and inadequate switch, the fix and the 'plan b' fix for if and when the stop-gap fix fails.update: i annotated the picture of the switch to show how somebody can DIY repair a defective power switch.-awr","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW5RR7SZPE9MA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002YD99Y4#wasThisHelpful","RW5RR7SZPE9MA","A7728VDTCAOHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7728VDTCAOHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wish they worked a little better but using the cooks illustrated buttermilk waffles with the seltzer water achives the best tasting waffles i've ever had.that said, they cost more than half the price of my griddler so they should be bundled even if at a higher price of course.the size of waffle is perfect. they are under 200 cal each (before condiments of course), and the recipe i use makes exactly three batches or 12 waffles.the waffles tend to come out perfect on one side not quite perfect on the other.I only spray with 'pam' before the first waffle (and only if i've cleaned the plates since the previous batch). they are perfectly non-stick!I LOVE the overflow area. at first i was annoyed they wouldn't use the entire space for bigger waffles, but clearly they needed to get the heating to work out best they could with the squggly heating wire and non-contact heating.my waffle recipe has a lot of 'lift' and actually pushes the top plate up unless i hold it down.it's very helpful that you can adjust the temperature for waffles. my first batch i used 400 but they weren't tosted properly by the time the indicator said 'done'. at 425, they came out much better without over-running the cooking time, and also the frozen ones are re-heating better without turning HARD.the plates should cost $20. but i only paid $70 for my griddler so i'm not complaning overall.. $100 total including both sets of plates and i gave away my old waffle iron.Oh ps: These waffles are a bit of a mutant in between belgian waffle and regular waffle.

"The overall look is fantastic; tubes of stainless is gorgeous for sure! An added bonus is they pretty much can't get dirty, all dust and dirt and water fall right through the rods!now for the limitations:1. the counter-sink holes for the screws are not uniform so the screw heads don't seat flush. minor but it's not as clean as it should be.2. The tubes are made of very thin metal. I have the 48"" long version which exaggerates the issue but even the 31"" version will have considerable 'wobble' and 'flex' to the tubes when placing items. even a 2-3 pound load will make the tubes bend and flex. It's most noticeable if you put on a small item that only touches 2-3 rods but has some heft to it; it makes other items rock back and forth that share the same rods.3. egregious oversight: the width does NOT match the standard spacing of STUDS in the wall, so there is virtually no way to mount this item solidly. wall anchors? please. On mine I was able to put the brackets on with the bracket to the OUTSIDE of the bars which spread the spacing between mounting holes to just about 48  inches so i could get the screws into the STUDS so it's solid.I added some support brackets under the rods at each 16"" and now the shelf is 'as it should be'. I could probably put 200# of items on EACH shelf without a problem. My added brackets don't reach to the very first rod so it's super obvious how wobbly the rods are without the added support.

"I want to point out something many are unaware of. typical to this type of rack system; when designed for mobility the shelves are designed 'upside down' that is; the sides go UP from the shelf level so there is a 1"" LIP on all sides (to keep say some onions or cans or boxes) from falling off while being moved. I was planning to use the self as stationary shelves and that was going to be a problem.Then i re-engineered the design to be much more useful for my purpose.I set four of the rods aside, put the three shelves very close together (for storing the likes of pyrex 13x9x2 baking pan), i installed the bottom rods in the unit upside down and bought some -20 eye bolts and put them in the now TOP of each corner.Then i found some studs in the wall, screwed in some lag type eye-bolts and used some nice heavy stainless chain to each of the four corners to each of the four eye-bolts in the wall using some cut-out links from the same chain (vs s-hooks; looks much cleaner).so now rather than spending $90 for a purpose-built pot rack that is nearly identical, mine cost $30 and i have THREE levels. I will upload a picture or two to showcase the solution.update: i did in-fact upload and NOTE very detailed photos for anybody wishing to copy me. I will be making a second copy of the pot rack for my mother soon. Also, since i ended up with four spare rods, i found the perfect use for them. legs for my son's built-in bed. drilling holes into the edge of some 5/4th decking board and it made a perfect support beam.UPDATE:  21 may 15I recently had to relocate my pot rack when i bought a new fridge. I re-oriented it wide vs narrow and wow it's a big improvement I actually ca to 'take off a star' because so many people mentioned distain about the top shelf not being flat and a microwave won't work on the microwave rack but this rack it NOT SOLD AS A MICROWAVE RACK and there is no claim to the contrary other than the photos indicating that the shelving is 'upside down' of a normal stationary rack.. the five stars remain. Best pot-rack EVER.If i could find the wheels i never used and confirmed they suck as bad as other reviewers mentioned i'd take off a star but i can't find them so i can't comment accurately about them. I just added a new photo with the rack in it's new home; take note of the way i put on the frypans; with the larger in the middle; it works WAY better that way than all the same way small-to-large.-awr","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LFI6K0FCBTIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000063SI0#wasThisHelpful","R3LFI6K0FCBTIS","A7728VDTCAOHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7728VDTCAOHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"About 2-3 weeks into first use and I'm amazed how perfect the butter is. In 68F room, the butter is pretty firm, not mush like if left on the traditional stick plate with glass dome. Butter tasted today just like the day I out it in.It's very important to keep the water fresh because there is natural bacteria that will get in there.There is a common misconception about these butter crocks. Many people think that the water fits up into the butter, but just like a cup held upside down in water, the air in the inverted dome just holds the water out.

"I've had the Robotoolz > portercable 5-point laser that this tool is based on for 8 years or so. It finally died after 7-8 years of abuse.The model/s this is based on used to 'lock' the laser once it was done auto-leveling. This new mini-me model does not. This shouldn't be a huge problem but i'm taking off a star because of it simply because with my old unit, it would NOT wobble around when walking near it and this one is in constant pendulum mode so will wobble/wiggle with any microscopic vibration.FYI: there is no 'magic' to the 'auto leveling' it doesn't use servo motors etc; it's simply a pendulum :-D on the higher-end models where you can hear a pulse like a motor doing adjustments, it's simply a mechanism that releases then grabs then releases then grabs the pendulum so when it's done the pendulum is locked in place and you don't get a wobbling laser dot.There are some good points brought up in one of the low-star reviews that are valid and stooped on bosch's part for having some gross errors in the manual:1. it would seem that there is no longer a 'mode' for calibration; it is *always* in calibration mode. I owned the older model that this device is based on; it had a pendulum 'grabber' that would 'tick tick tick' while it was bobbing around and when it was happy that it was done, it would hold the laser beams solid so you wouldn't get the bobbing and wobbling as you walked around on the floor near the device. IGNORE the step how to get into and out of calibration mode and i'm quite sure it will work as described in the manual.2. the ' tripod mount is built into the multi-purpose attachment. this is the same as the older brother to this device as well.3. it's true that because the laser goes through a few prisms in the path out of the device (it's a very smart design because it make sure that the five beams will always be perfectly normal to each other), the dot will a) have diffraction interference dots and b) will get larger the farther away you are.with respect to 3, the center dot will get pretty big at distance, but it will a) have a CENTER and b) have smaller and smaller dots going away from the center; example the center dot might be  inch diameter but the 6th interference dot left or right of center will be only ' "" diameter. You can get a very decent level from the horizontal offset dots and you can get a very decent plum from the vertical offset dots. it's not perfect but it works perfectly well.i've used the older brother to this device for 8 years (finally died after using it literally in a puddle of cement), and i will miss the locking feature that the 'calibration' function was made for, also since the 'overthrow' function of the power button (you would push PAST on), to engage calibration mode, was also used to defeat the auto power down function, i'm not sure if that's possible on this model and that will suck.It would be FAIR to rate a THREE based on the sloppiness in the manual not 'getting' that there is no longer a calibration mode but that you CAN in-fact still CALIBRATE the friggin' thing, you just need to get past the bug in the manual, but i think dropping the fancy wobble grabber will likely make this model more reliable long-term.You can also defeat the auto-off (20 min) function by turning the unit on then off then back on immediately.. it will blink fast for 2 seconds to confirm the auto-off was 'disabled' (quotes because it will shut off after 8 hours!).From a 'construction' standpoint I would be dead-in-the-water; i pretty much literally use the 5-point laser for every single thing i build; it's fantastic for putting in garage doors (4-5 i've done), entry doors (about half a dozen), kitchen cabinets (dozens in several kitchens), tile floors; many; the square function is priceless.you can use the strap to strap onto a 2x4 and with this new model, it has 2 holes in the removable base to SCREW to a wall, then project a dot onto the NEXT stud and use as a reference to drill a hole; you can get a PERFECTLY horizontal set of holes for beautiful results when putting in wiring, or you can use a pitch offset (drill each hole ' inch lower than the previous and get a perfect "" per foot slope!)There is NO other way to make sure counter top (cabinets below) are at the same height than using this type of tool. It's also priceless for getting doors perfectly plumb; you can get things to 1/32"" over 8' really easy, that's not so easy with even a 4' level.in a word: INDISPENSABLE-awr","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GW15G49U7IIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ECEDF0#wasThisHelpful","R1GW15G49U7IIA","A7728VDTCAOHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7728VDTCAOHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've tried and looked at a dozen variations of this type of soap handle scrub brush. The is the only one i've seen that has all these attributes:1. removable brush2. easy fill3. squirts (most open a valve and dribble).4. seals with a valve.there is a rubber button half way down the handle. when pressed it pressurizes the inside, pushing the valve open and squirting out some dish detergent.nothing short of perfection; it even has a little plastic scraper for tough items on the back side.-awrps: be CAREFUL selecting; oxo makes an nearly identical one that doesn't squirt i wouldn't GIVE that one away.UPDATE: Mine finally failed after 2 3/4 years. That is a very fair lifespan. I would recommend if you are getting over 2 years to buy a spare; don't bother buying the brush the button will fail before the brush wears out. Keep out of the sun, and don't subject to harsh chemicals or press harder than you need to. I suspect a lot of premature failures come from people pressing too hard on the button because there is a bit of a design flaw that it doesn't squirt well when less than 1/2 full. When it gets below half full re-fill it does not squirt well when less than half full (can't circumvent the laws of physics; when the airspace above the liquid doubles it takes double the pressing to get the same liquid out; when the airspace is 90% bigger it takes 10x the pressing of the button to get the same liquid out. So with this item the rule is; fill it often; it only works well when more than 50% full.Also, i hang mine over the sink facing brush side away from me; then i can squirt some directly into the sink or onto my hands for cleaning my hands, super convenient.  Off to order a new one to replace the broken one.

"Oh my no. If there's one aspect of book blogging that I dread, it's having to write a review for a children's book I didn't enjoy. Since I receive a lot of review copies from publishers with the understanding that I will post an honest review, I don't feel like I can just skip reviewing it altogether.I also can't sugarcoat it. If I didn't like a book, I have to be honest or else my favourable reviews of books that I DID like will be less meaningful. How would anybody believe I was being honest if I can't be honest about what I don't like, as well as what I do?Anyway, I didn't like this book. At all. If it had been a book for adults, it probably wouldn't have been so hard for me to be blunt, but for some reason I worry about hurting the feelings of children's book authors and illustrators more than other authors. But I need to get over that because this book was terrible.The illustrations are so crudely done that I was shocked it was a professional artist who created them. They didn't seem intentionally crude, either. They weren't like Garth Williams' delightfully ""messy"" pencil drawings, full of charm and intention. No, these seem like they weren't done with love at all.The concept of the book might have had potential, but the text felt woefully unfinished and under-edited. The idea of a little man who lives under a tree watering the roots is introduced out of nowhere, and the book ends just as abruptly. What was the point? Does he have adventures? What are we meant to take from this? It really could have been so much more than it was, but instead it was a story stub with forced rhymes and undeveloped characters.This is usually the part where I try to think of one nice thing to say about the book because I feel bad for hating it so much (maybe it's because I'm Canadian? or a preschool teacher?).

"My daughter and I learned a lot from this book. I was vaguely aware of the role of animals in the First World War because I had seen A Bear Named Winnie, the biopic of the ""real"" Winnie-the-Pooh. I knew that there were horses and veterinarians sent over to help the war effort, but I didn't realize that Canada had sent so many police horses over to Europe, many of which were killed in action, and the rest of which were adopted out to European farmers at the end of the war.This book tells the story of one such horse, nicknamed ""Bunny"" because of its slightly long ears.Bunny was ridden by two different Canadian soldiers who were brothers. One brother was killed in action while the second brother--and Bunny--survived. The book showcases the bravery of Bunny and the other horses, as well as the soldiers themselves, without being overwhelming for young readers. I'd definitely recommend it for children, particularly Canadian children.

"Julia, Child is not strictly about the life of the famous chef, Julia Child...but it sort of is. It's a story very much inspired by the spirit of Julia Child, in the form of a little girl named--you guessed it--Julia who falls in love with food and wants to share her passion with everyone. She and her best friend, Simca (the real nickname of French cookbook author Simone Beck, a contemporary and friend of Julia Child), set out to share their buttery treats with all of the adults around them and to remind them of the joys of childhood and the joys of food.The illustrations compliment perfectly the delicate whimsy of the story and the spirit of its inspiration. Julia Child was an English chef who introduced the world to French food. She was a formidable woman who managed to put the most reticent aspiring cook at ease. She was funny and passionate and joyful. The pictures in this book (by the very talented Julie Morstad) are all of these things. There's something delightfully English-but-also-French about the scenes she creates; they're sophisticated yet rustic, joyful yet refined.

"In real life, I'm not sure that moles are particularly cute, but there sure are a lot of cute and curious moles in children's picture books. Why is that? I'm not sure, but my daughter Magda sure loves them!In this book by Ellen Tarlow, the little mole in question wants to explore the outside world, particularly in the daytime. She falls so in love with the sunny blue sky that she wants to catch it and bring it back to her home underground. This proves to be impractical for a number of reasons, but with the help of some of her animal friends, she manages something almost as good.Although I prefer animal books in which the animals all have names (rather than just 'Mole' and 'Rabbit,' etc.), I do like the fact that Ellen Tarlow made some of her characters male and some female. I'm always shocked by how many authors choose to make all animal characters male by default. Has anyone else noticed that? What is that about? Even female authors do that! I find myself changing the pronouns back and forth between ""he"" and ""she"" just to even it up. I was happy that I didn't have to do that with Mole Catches the Sky.As soon as Magda and I finished reading the digital review copy of this book (thanks NetGalley!), she immediately asked if she could read the ""real"" book. I completely agree with Magda that print books are more satisfying to read, particularly when it comes to children's picture books. I'm grateful for the chance to read books on my computer or ebook reader that I wouldn't otherwise have access to, but I'll always prefer to hold a book in my hands, smell the paper and turn the pages with my thumbs. Unfortunately, our local library doesn't have this book in their collection, so Magda and I have already put in an official request/recommendation that they buy it immediately!Magda's Take:""I know that a mole wouldn't really want a skylight in her home, but it was still very sweet of the other animals to try to give her some sunshine.

As the founding editor of MAKE magazine, former editor of Wired, and creator of BoingBoing, he's got everybody beat in the category of ""guy most likely to write a book about cool DIY projects to try at home."" But as a father of two girls he also brings the added element of ""guy who understands how great it can be when dads share these cool projects with their daughters. It's not that any of the projects in this book are limited to dads only, or to daughters only, it's just that it's great to see that dynamic actively encouraged.As the parent of a little girl myself, I sometimes feel like I'm manoeuvring through a mine field of unhelpful--and usually harmful--gender messages along the lines of ""construction toys are for boys"" and ""arts and crafts are for girls"" (I saw almost that exact sign at a toy store just this week...ugh). A lot of times the message is subtle: pictures in magazines, books, catalogues and flyers that show boys and men using tools, blocks and trucks, but girls using paints, beads and dolls. This gender divide is reinforced literally everywhere. So I very much appreciated seeing so many photos of girls using band saws throughout this book (most of the pictures are of Frauenfelder's own daughters).I'll admit, some of the projects in this book are a little intimidating at first glance. In the introduction the author says that most of them can be accomplished with ""tools you probably already have at home"" then he lists a full page of equipment that includes things like jigsaws, soldering irons and blowtorches (wait, was there a blowtorch? I might be remembering that wrong). So it seemed scary. But in reality, a great many of the projects don't involve anything scary at all--just some cutting, gluing, painting, sculpting or hammering--and look like they could produce fantastic results. Even the lounge chair that he and his girls made looks pretty straight forward.The projects are not arranged in order of easiest to most complicated, so don't let a difficult looking project discourage you from reading further. ""I wasn't always an eager maker of things,"" Frauenfelder assures us. Even he had to be coaxed into trying new things. But if he can make it all look easy--or at least doable--then maybe it's not so hard after all. And with several projects that involve delicious looking edible treats (YAY!), I'd say it's worth a try.This review was first posted on my blog, Cozy Little Book Journal, and is based on a digital review copy I received through NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQWPWOGIAB7YZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054411454X#wasThisHelpful","RQWPWOGIAB7YZ","A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agree with other reviewers who said that this book is a good reference for art students, or for artists who want to look something up quickly, or explain a concept to a non-artist.It's a brief overview of the second half of the 20th century (or at least it is now, thanks to the updated version) in terms of art movements and the major social and political events of their respective times.It is not necessarily a book that I would enjoy browsing through just to look at lovely art. It's definitely not a coffee table book...well, especially not my copy, since I was reading the digital version!The digital version does have the added benefit of being hyperlinked with cross references so you can look up definitions as you read.This review was originally posted on my blog, Cozy Little Book Journal, and is based on a digital review copy I received through NetGalley.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R199X7KPXPYW8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0789211513#wasThisHelpful","R199X7KPXPYW8X","A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm sure I'm not the only one who has a preschooler at home who is obsessed with babies and pregnancy (tell me I'm not the only one?) but it's hard to imagine anyone being MORE obsessed than Magda. She unself-consciously tells people that pregnancy is ""her hobby"" (what the heck?). So I can't imagine anyone enjoying this book nearly as much as she did. It's a lovely book, but you haven't really experienced it until you've heard my four-year-old cooing and squealing excitedly at every picture. Every. Single. One. I tried to record her reactions so I could play an audio track with this review, but it came out is an unintelligible collection of ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"" and high-pitched giggles.Magda's Take:She can't talk right now.

"The Sagebrush Singers is an interpretation of the classic ""incredible journey"" type stories in which a ragtag group of animals travels together to form an unlikely musical band. Apparently it's from a Brothers Grimm fairy tale, which you can read on the book's website (part of the publisher's site).The thing is, the original German tale is way better than this book. Way, way better. The 'twist' of The Sagebrush Singers is that it takes place in the desert (in the Wild West?) and has a burro, a coyote, a skunk and a crow gathering together for...some reason. It's not all that clear. They do manage to scare away a bunch of cattle rustlers so that's...something.The crude drawings, overly wordy text, Spanish words peppered in on every page (but apparently you have to go to the website to find the glossary), and nonsensical plot make for a mediocre book at best. Even Magda (the world's most generous book reviewer) gave it a ""so-so"". Harsh words, coming from her.Here's what my daughter, aged 4, had to say:Magda's Take:""It was...eh...so-so. I mean it was good, sort of. The pictures were a little...I don't know. Were they sexist, do you think? Because every single character was a boy--all the people and all the animals--no girls at all. It would have been nice if at least one of the animals was female. I don't know. It was okay, I guess.""Mom's Note:Magda and I do talk about things like gender stereotypes and sexism from time to time, particularly when it comes to things like toy marketing and stories aimed at children. I do notice that WAY too many children's book authors (both male and female authors) decide to make every single animal character male by default. This annoys me. Not only is it irritating and lazy, it's also never the other way around. There are never animal books in which every single animal character is female by default, so it's not just a coincidence that could go either way. It's either evenly distributed between male and female, or else it's all male. Argggh.Anyway, this is one of those male-only animal books. I think Magda is noticing it more now that she's reading on her own, because she notices if I try to switch the pronouns back and forth between ""he"" and ""she.""To be honest, the all-male characters didn't necessarily bother me in this book (as it has in other books), but that might be because I thought the book had so many other problems going on already.This review was first posted on my blog, Cozy Little Book Journal, and is based on a digital review copy I received through NetGalley.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R67YOTXSL3GT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0984532234#wasThisHelpful","R67YOTXSL3GT2","A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I adore Robert Munsch. I think he's a masterful storyteller and his long-time collaboration with illustrator Michael Marchenko has produced some amazing children's classics.Sometimes, however, when his books are condensed to board book form, they lose some of their oomph. The best parts are edited out, or they're oversimplified, or the magic is somehow not there.Pigs, however, retains all of its ""Pigness"" even in the shorter format. My only problem with it is that I'm not sure this particular story *needed* to be made into a board book.The board book format is presumably so it's easier for little hands to handle, so that younger children can access the story. I'm not sure Pigs is best suited for younger kids. It's one of the Robert Munsch stories that has characters being a bit rude to each other, with the constant refrain of ""Hey you dumb pigs!"". This may be fine for school-age children, but a lot of parents and teachers don't like reading that kind of impolite phrase to very young children.This review was first posted on my blog, Cozy Little Book Journal, and is based on a digital review copy of the board book edition that I received through NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XWCGFA5NPDGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1554516285#wasThisHelpful","R2XWCGFA5NPDGR","A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ouch. This was a painful read. I alternated back and forth between reading the book and listening to the audiobook, so it was doubly painful. Sigh. I'll try to start with the good points.1. First, I loved the first book in this series, The Yard. At least I think I did. After reading and hating The Black Country and The Devil's Workshop, I'm starting to question if I ever loved the first book as much as I thought I did. Maybe I only liked it because it reminded me of the far superior Inspector Ben Ross and Lizzie Martin series by Ann Granger (THAT'S A HELL OF A SERIES, BTW). Anyway, at this point I'm ready to give up on Alex Grecian altogether. As a writer he is clearly more interested in a gothic thriller style than a classic Victorian detective novel. It's just not my cup of tea.2. Secondly, I should point out that the narration by John Curless is quite good. He doesn't overdo the voices or the accents, though sometimes it might be a wee bit hard to tell one character from another. Sure, it's excruciatingly melodramatic most of the time, but that's hardly Curless' fault. I'm convinced he read the book exactly as it was meant to be read. It's not his fault it was so poorly written.I think that's the end of my good points. I found the book, as I said, excruciating. Here are just a few things that annoyed me:1. Alex Grecian turned Jack the Ripper into some ridiculous caricature of a ""devilish"" baddy that is slightly less menacing than Sideshow Bob and twice as cartoonish. Plus all of his passages are italicized, which is a lot less fun to read than Alex Grecian seems to think it is.2. Inspector Day's perpetually pregnant wife Claire is, as it turns out, a total idiot. She finally goes into labour (hasn't she been pregnant FOR THE ENTIRE SERIES?) and reacts by writing horrible poetry and simpering like a child. I mean I know childbirth is hard (TWENTY-EIGHT HOURS OF LABOUR, PEOPLE!) and lord knows I'm probably the least brave person on the planet when it comes to physical discomfort, but even I wanted to scream at her to buck up a bit. Honestly. I'm amazed this woman has the brain cells to operate anything as complicated as a button.3. The entire premise of the book MAKES NO SENSE. A group of vigilantes have been busting prisoners out of jail so they can...what? Punish them MORE? But it's not like convicted murderers in Victorian England were sitting around on death row for decades before execution. These prisoners were definitely going to be executed, and quickly. So what then? Do they mean to torture them? I guess so, but again, Victorian English prisons WERE NO PICNIC. They were already being 'tortured' in a lot of ways, and the treatment they received at the hands of this secret group of vigilantes didn't seem any worse than descriptions I've read of actual prison conditions at the time. So are we supposed to believe that the torture was worse, but Alex Grecian just chose not to describe it? It's not like he's shy, because he certainly gets mighty descriptive about grotesque violence later in the book. My guess is he just didn't think it through all the way. So irritating.In the end, I think my favourite thing about this book is that it reminded me of another series which I do love, the Inspector Ben Ross and Lizzie Martin series by Ann Granger (seriously, it's sooo good), and it prompted me to check to see if there's a new one coming out. And there is! Hooray! So I have that to look forward to at least.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27AFL0MCISXAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611762839#wasThisHelpful","R27AFL0MCISXAF","A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Callaloo: A Jazz Folktale is an ""almost"" book. I can see where the author and illustrator were going with it, but it didn't quite get there.The basic story is that a boy named Winston is eating callaloo, his favourite Caribbean dish, while sitting in his apartment in New York City, when he is suddenly transported to the island of Tobago. And that's when the book gets a little scary. Winston encounters a series of frightening demons and monsters before finally returning home to his kitchen. Upon his return he apparently has learned the value of eating in moderation. Was that what he was supposed to be learning? I guess so. It wasn't all that clear.I think the idea behind this story (which is based on a play) is that readers are supposed to feel they are transported to another land along with Winston (sort of like Where the Wild Things Are), or that a regular kitchen can have the power of transformation (like Jonathan Cleaned Up and Then He Heard a Sound), but also that we're supposed to learn a lot about the Caribbean islands (like The Drummer Boy of John John). The problem is that the drawings are simple and unsophisticated enough to suggest the book is for very young children, but then the monsters are pretty scary. So the overall message seems to be, ""If you eat Caribbean food you may end up in Tobago, which is the scariest place on the planet."" I can't help but feel the author intended the book to have the OPPOSITE message.Magda's Take:Magda didn't actually finish this one. We started to read it after she'd had a big lunch and just before she was supposed to take a nap. When she saw that it was about a boy eating a lot of food she declared that she was too full and too sleepy to read this right now. I finished it on my own while she was napping and I'm glad I did because those monster drawings would have definitely scared the crap out of her.This review (including my four-year-old's limited input) first appeared on my blog, Cozy Little Book Journal, and is based on a digital review copy I received from NetGalley.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MGKR78XNDJYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615951589#wasThisHelpful","R3MGKR78XNDJYK","A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Clara loves her curly hair but oh, how she wishes she could have MORE of it. Thanks to some conveniently placed hair growth formula found in her parents' bathroom, she gets her wish and more. Before long she has hair that reaches the sky and all the inconvenience that comes with it.She's like a cross between a Robert Munsch character and one from Dr. Seuss (remember Gertrude McFuzz?). How she managed to get her hair to stay upright as it grew past the ceiling I'll never know.Magda and I enjoyed this book, though I think Magda found the premise of wanting MORE hair a bit perplexing. She had been growing her own hair out so she could donate it to Locks of Love when she eventually had it cut. After months of dealing with tangles, braids, extra brushing and endless blow drying, the day she got it all chopped off was the happiest of her young life!Overall, the book is good, but didn't make it to the ""read it again...and again...and again"" list in our house.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8I1WX1UPZHW1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623700434#wasThisHelpful","R8I1WX1UPZHW1","A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What an absolutely charming, laugh-out-loud funny book! I know my four-year-old can be pretty easy to please when it comes to children's books, especially if they have dinosaurs in them, but I wholeheartedly agree with her glowing review of this one. Here's what Magda had to say:Magda's Take:""I loved it! I loved the part where it says 'If you happen to have a dinosaur in your living room' because it's so funny! You can't have a dinosaur in your living room! They died out before humans were around! But I liked where they got all the dinosaurs to give them rides and deliver the mail. I even liked the part where it said that some dinosaurs would make good kites even though those weren't really dinosaurs. It was still funny though.

"My four-year-old daughter helps me review children's books on my blog, Cozy Little Book Journal, and the Rose Lagercrantz books are among her very favourites in early chapter books. Here's our review (as it appeared on my blog):Magda and I were so excited to see this followup to Rose Lagercrantz's My Happy Life that we almost couldn't read it fast enough! First we had to re-read the first book (at Magda's insistence) which we borrowed from the library, then we devoured the second one in a single sitting. I know as soon as it is published Magda will want a ""real book"" copy of it as well.If you're not familiar with My Happy Life, I recommend reading it first. The characters are introduced so well in the first book that the second one makes more sense if you already know and love them, but I'm sure it's not strictly necessary. Both stories follow a little girl named Daniella--Dani for short--who describes herself as being ""always happy"" despite the fact that she actually has quite a lot of unhappiness to deal with. She prefers to focus on her happiest memories though, which she tries to think of often.In My Heart is Laughing, Dani is still trying to deal with the fact that her best friend, Ella, has moved to another town. She has other friends, but it's not the same. She tries to think back to her last visit with Ella to get her through the tough times.My favourite thing about these illustrated picture books for young readers (perfect for reading aloud) is that the character of Dani is complex and realistic, despite the fact the books are quite simple. At first glance, I thought that the stories would be saccharine and shallow, that the little girl would be happy all the time and everything would be perfect. While that may or may not have made a good book, it's not very true to life. I couldn't have been more wrong in my assumption, however. Dani's life is anything but perfect. Her mother died when she was young and her father is trying his best to give her a good childhood. She frequently has conflicts at school that she finds difficult to handle. She sometimes behaves in ways that she regrets. She is sad sometimes. But the book's delicate optimism hits just the right balance between sweetness and poignancy. Dani is a child to root for and relate to.My four-year-old, herself a happy child who has her fair share of anxiety, conflict and regrettable behaviour at times, adores these books. I asked her to tell me what she thought of My Heart is Laughing and she talked for about fifteen minutes! Here are just a few of the things she had to say:Magda's Take""I love this book. I think this book and My Happy Life are my new favourite chapter books. I can't decide which one I like better, but I guess it depends on my behaviour at the time. I know that sounds odd, but it's because in My Heart is Laughing, Dani has all kinds of behaviour that isn't very good--like when she squirts the sauce and runs away from school and kicks her shoes and breaks the vase--and she has to deal with all of that. Dani's the star of the books, but then when she hides under the table and runs away from school it's like she doesn't want to be the star anymore.""My favourite scene is when Vicky and Mickey are pinching Dani. I like that scene because I like news. I mean, that scene was sort of like the news, because I learned a lot about the characters when they were pinching. For instance, I thought that Vicky and Mickey were sort of like stars of the book too, but then when they were pinching Dani so hard it was actually hurting, I thought that they're not stars at all. They were like her worst friends, the bottom two. But I liked that scene a lot because I learned about them by what they did. Even though it wasn't a non-fiction book, I felt like I learned a lot from this book. I think you can learn even from fiction books.""I received an advanced digital review copy of My Heart is Laughing from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. I was not otherwise compensated for my review. All opinions expressed are strictly my own...and, in this case, those of my daughter, who will want to get a hardcover copy of this book (or ""real book copy"") as soon as we possibly can.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HFAPBAPOZJIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1877579521#wasThisHelpful","R2HFAPBAPOZJIJ","A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love cozy mysteries. Like most avid readers, I read a lot of different kinds of books, but I have a guilty-pleasure favourite genre. I adore a good paperback murder that has an amateur sleuth snooping around her small town looking for clues and handing out recipes. Ooh how I love them! And because I love the genre so much, I'll usually put up with a lot of the mediocrity that comes with genre fiction (by that I mean that even though there are many, many great examples of the genre, there are inevitably also many less successful ones...and I love most of them just the same).With Barbara Ross' Maine Clambake series, however, no forgiveness is required. Her writing is stellar, right out of the gate. In fact, if someone who had never read a cozy mystery before asked me to recommend a book to introduce them to the genre, I might choose this one.Barbara Ross understands everything that I love about fiction in general and mysteries in particular. First, her setting is a real place. I don't just mean that she set the book in a place that exists in real life (I don't care about that...fictional places are just fine), but that she describes it in a way that is so deliciously realistic that I feel I could walk down any street in her book and I would know exactly what it would look and smell like. She spends time on her secondary characters, giving them things to do other than just provide clues to the murder investigation (which is wonderful because some of them are hilarious).I had actually started reading the second book in this series, Boiled Over, first but then was enjoying it so much that I decided to stop and read this one first. Because of that, I think it was a little easier for me to figure out ""whodunnit"" in this one. I'd recommend just reading them in order if you can. They're both heaven.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LJAA3W6ZAMYR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758286856#wasThisHelpful","R2LJAA3W6ZAMYR","A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh this is a lovely book! It tells the story of Feivel, a Jewish immigrant who comes to America in the 19th-century, leaving his family behind in Europe, so he can make a better life for them in the new world and hopefully earn enough money for them to come over and join them. A gifted artist, he makes a living carving elaborate and beautiful carousel horses, each dedicated to a member of his family. Finally, he earns enough for his wife and children to join him in New York, where they can finally see his amazing ""horses.""Because it's based on real events, the book is of particular interest to children of Jewish families, European immigrants, or those who live in New York, but it is certainly not limited to that audience. The theme of longing and determination expressed through art is a universally relatable one, I think, and I found it very touching. Mostly though, the illustrations are so rich and lovely that it made me want to go on a carousel.

"I'll admit I picked up this cozy for the title. It's a hell of a title. Like many cozy mystery titles, it's pun-based, and after binge watching all three seasons of Rosemary and Thyme (an absolutely delightful British mystery series that has nothing to do with this book), it was a pun I was particularly susceptible to. Plus, I had a vague recollection of reading a review and/or giveaway for this book on another book blog some time ago, though I couldn't remember if the review had been positive. No matter. I figured I'd pick it up and decide for myself.I wouldn't say I was over the moon for this book or its characters. There was something unconvincing about the whole thing right from the beginning.The premise is that our heroine--not that I found myself rooting for her much--runs a spice shop in a small town in Georgia. A spice shop. As in, one that only sells spices. I'm not sure how she'll manage to stay in business! Granted, I'm sure these shops do exist, but the author has the spice shop owner doing such ""radical things"" as putting curry in mayonnaise (shocking, I know!), only to have the people in the town revolt over such exotic spiciness. Yeahhh...that's not a town that can support a spice shop.But I decided to ignore it. After all, Gail Oust is hardly the first author to create an amateur detective who runs a shop that couldn't possibly make enough money to stay afloat (*ahem* Joan Hess).Beyond the premise, though, it's the little things that kept taking me out of the story. Our ""heroine,"" Piper, discovers the body (of course) and panics (okay) and thinks to herself that she should contact the authorities to ""report the crime"" (good). But then when the police arrive and spend most of their time being excessively rude and snappish (why?) and tell her they have a murder to investigate, she freaks the hell out. Murder! She never considered it might be murder! She's beyond shocked! Except that no, she can't be, because she just called it a crime scene two pages ago!It's just those kinds of little things that annoyed me throughout this book. I believe the technical term is ""bad writing.""Even if I had been willing to overlook the flaws in the storyline, it's not like I was enjoying following the characters around or being immersed in the setting. The town is dull and unpleasant, all of the characters are irritating, and Piper Prescott the spice shop lady only has two settings: shock and rage.

"The Ellery Queen Mysteries is a TV show about a regular forty-something single guy in New York who writes mystery novels and lives alone with his also single father, a police inspector who brings his son along literally every time there's a murder to solve the crime for him. That's normal right? Nothing strange about any of that at all.I've been curious about The Ellery Queen Mysteries ever since I read creator Peter S. Fischer's book Me and Murder, She Wrote (which is SUCH a great book btw). In it, he talks about several series he created or worked on, including Murder, She Wrote, Columbo, and a few you probably don't remember (like The Law and Harry McGraw or Blacke's Magic). There's a special place in his heart, though, for The Ellery Queen Mysteries, which Fischer recalls fondly throughout the book while expressing continued confusion as to why the show wasn't more popular. After watching the series on DVD, I think I know why.It's not that the show is terrible--it has a lot of great elements which make it fun and watchable--but it definitely has some problems. The premise--that writer Ellery Queen solves murder cases better than his police inspector father can--might be straight from the books, but the TV series makes it seem like his father is the world's absolute worst detective. It's not that he's portrayed as bumbling (quite the opposite--David Wayne is very gruff and direct) so much as that he has no idea what he's doing. Whenever there's a murder he literally panics until someone goes to get his son. His son the writer, not the police officer. It stretches the very limits of belief.I'm also not a fan of the fourth-wall-breaking moments when Jim Hutton as Ellery Queen speaks directly to the camera saying, ""I've figured it out. Have you?"" That almost never works out as well as TV and movie creators want it to. Suddenly I feel like I'm watching a children's detective show with the host saying, ""Hey kids, did you figure it out?""The series was only based on the Ellery Queen stories in the most basic ways (only one or two episodes even credit Queen, the rest being original scripts using the same characters) so you're not likely to find your favourite books or short stories depicted. It does stay true to the ""fair play mystery"" aspect of Ellery Queen stories, in that all the clues you need to solve the mystery at home are given and shown. Of course, they rather hit you over the head with that point. And the answer to almost every single one is that the murderer left before the victim was really dead, giving the victim a few seconds to leave a ""dying clue,"" some cryptic indication of who the killer is (no one ever uses those last seconds to call for help or try to stop their own bleeding).Still, there's something inviting about the show. It takes place in the 1940's but was made in the 1970's, which means that it feels very 70's. What was it about the 1970's that compelled people to make period dramas in which everybody wore polyester and shiny blue eyeshadow? And the odd relationship between father and son is sort of like a detective duo version of Sanford and Son. Plus there's the added mystery of how 5'7 David Wayne managed to have a son as tall as 6'5 Jim Hutton. How tall was the mom supposed to have been??But the chess-themed opening sequence and instrumental music draws you in. Get it? Because his name is Queen, like a chess queen? And he solves difficult puzzles, sort of like playing chess. Yeah, the show doesn't go much for subtlety. But I'm glad I watched them. I could almost hear Peter S. Fischer in the background saying, ""I love this show! Why isn't anyone watching it?""This review first appeared on my blog, Murder She Watched, a mystery-themed offshoot of Cozy Little Book Journal, and is based on the Ellery Queen Mysteries DVD set that I borrowed from my local library.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RREA5NBZ9WT3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003RHZ6CK#wasThisHelpful","RREA5NBZ9WT3L","A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been meaning to publish a review of this book for some time but I've been procrastinating just a little. Unlike the overwhelming majority of books I review, this was written by someone I know in real life. Sort of. I met author Eva O'Regan at a my local library where she was doing a book launch event for this book (which is when I agreed to review it on my blog) and it turns out she works in my dentist's office.I'm not one to sugar coat reviews, and I would never give a dishonest review of a book just because I'd met the author (or for any reason really), but, well...if I didn't absolutely love the book then a lukewarm review could be...awkward. I'd probably have preferred to just not review this book at all, but I already said I would, so here goes. (I assure you it's my honest opinion, but I definitely wanted to give everyone a heads up about any connection I have to the author, in case that changes how you assess my review.)My daughter and I read this book together and it's, um, okay. The idea is an interesting one: A little girl writes backwards and astounds her friends at school. The entire book is written in mirror letters (THE ENTIRE BOOK) so it comes with a sort of shiny reflective mirror paper thing in the back that you're supposed to use to read the words. The idea is that you put the shiny mirror paper against each page and read the reverse image.First of all, the shiny mirror thing doesn't work that well. It's awkward to read the book under the best of circumstances. I can only imagine how hard it would be once the reflective paper gets scratched, creased, smudged, or worse--lost. And because the book is paperback it's difficult to keep the reflective page at the exact right angle to read the words. Nice idea, but not the most practical execution.Also, when I say the entire book is written in mirror letters, I mean the ENTIRE BOOK, not just the parts where Rosie is writing. Personally I think it would have been more successful if the main story were written normally, but maybe the character of Rosie could write things in reverse that readers would have to ""decode."" That's just my opinion.As for the story itself, I do like the fact that Rosie's backwards writing is treated as a special talent instead of cause for concern. On the other hand, it probably would have been good if there had been a little bit of conflict for the main character to overcome. Did the kids at school think she was weird? Did her parents worry that she had a learning disability? Was her teacher annoyed that she wasn't writing properly? Although Rosie briefly worries about these things, the reaction from everyone is universally supportive. While that's lovely, it doesn't necessarily make for the most interesting storytelling.Here's what my daughter had to say:Magda's Take:Will I have to know how to write backwards when I start school? I know how to write most of my letters, but I don't know how to write them backwards! Is my teacher going to ask me that? Also, why does the teacher in the book look exactly like the mom in the book? Do you think the illustrator was just drawing herself? The grownups all look the same. That's strange..Mom's Note:Magda is right about the adults in the book looking a lot alike. I hadn't noticed that!As for her fears that she'll ""have to"" write backwards when she starts school, I've assured her she won't! But it seems like a bit of a missed opportunity to me that the author didn't include a parent resource page at the end about reverse writing, dyslexia, etc. Even a brief note on her website would have been great. Again, just my opinion.This review originally appeared on my blog, Cozy Little Book Journal, and was based on a print copy of the book that my daughter and I received from the author. All opinions expressed--for better or worse--are solely those of my daughter and myself.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17YROHXHQQTK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0988144506#wasThisHelpful","R17YROHXHQQTK1","A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Kathy Stinson's (Red is Best) book, Big or Little? is about an experience that every parent of a toddler or preschooler can relate to: your child feels (and behaves) like a big kid some of the time, but also feels (and is treated) like a little kid other times. Helping in the garden makes him feel big. Being able to reach the elevator button makes her feel big. But then she has to go to bed when she's not even tired, or he tries putting on a shirt and the sleeves end up in all the wrong places, and it's back to feeling small. It's the constant struggle of being a toddler.I say that parents will relate to it, but I can't guarantee that kids will admit to it (even though these are things they go through ALL THE TIME). When I read it to Magda I asked what things made her feel big or little. She said, ""I'm four, Mommy. I'm BIG. FOUR IS BIG, Mommy."" She probably just didn't want to admit to anything, in case it was a trick question to get her to take a nap when she wasn't tired.My daughter and I read a digital copy of the board book edition with illustrations by Jennifer A. Bell.

"It's like Kinky Friedman and Christopher Moore got together and had a misanthropic baby. A baby with an ill-tempered monkey.I only wish I had read this book sooner. I've had it on my e-reader for about a million years (or whenever the advanced review copies were released) but it took me this long to get around to it. On the plus side, that also allowed me to enjoy the audiobook read by Arte Johnson, which is FAN-TAS-TIC.Another reviewer pointed out that Carl Hiaasen must not like women very much, since all of his female characters are broadly painted caricatures of awful personality types. And it's true. I mean, I think the ""Dragon Queen"" character isn't even given a real name. Of course, another reviewer responded by pointing out that his male characters are pretty awful and unlikable as well. Also true. So he's a misanthrope. But something about the kvetchy reading by Arte Johnson makes the misanthropic craziness of the book seem, well, almost irresistible.And the monkey IS very ill-tempered, so that's fun. But it's not really his fault. He is surrounded by awful people. What's a Capuchin to do?Still, it's not exactly an enjoyable read all the way through. There's racist language--which didn't seem to me to add anything other than, well, racism--a lot of sexist language, and some situations that are more than a little icky. I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed it at all if it weren't for the great narration.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VCXMGVQGY9LC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0739385143#wasThisHelpful","R1VCXMGVQGY9LC","A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this book from the library when I was about three and it was love at first sight. It was the first book I ever learned to ""read"" all the way through, meaning that I memorized all the words and when to turn the pages. When it was time to return it, my mom didn't have the heart to tell me I couldn't have my favourite book anymore so she marched me into the children's section of the Colchester Regional Library in Truro, Nova Scotia, and told me to 'read' the book for the librarian. She figured--correctly--that the librarian wouldn't have the heart to make a three-year-old part with her new favourite book either. The librarian was sufficiently charmed and stamped the book ""DISCARD"" right then and there so my mom could buy it for me.I still have this book today and now my own child counts it as one of her favourites.

"I've never read an M.C. Beaton mystery that didn't star either Hamish Macbeth or Agatha Raisin, so I'm glad I tracked down this stand-alone novel. It's charming, and written in a style that reminded me of Michael Palin's novel, Hemingway's Chair (which I read years ago and absolutely loved).The story revolves around two people trying to solve a years old train robbery rather than a murder, though a few people are killed--or nearly killed--along the way. I liked Fellworth and Maggie as the sleuthing couple and almost wish Beaton had given them their own series. They could have been a folksy Tommy and Tuppence (Agatha Christie), or a shabby Nick and Nora Charles (Dashiell Hammett).The only thing that surprised me, familiar as I am with Beaton's other work, was that there wasn't a literal skeleton in the closet. The title is use in the traditional sense of the phrase to mean ""a hidden family secret,"" which is established early on as the main intrigue (so it's not a spoiler). Still, with M.C. Beaton, I was a little disappointed no bones came tumbling out of the pantry!This review originally appeared on my blog, Cozy Little Book Journal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZGG46HGNF06/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312981457#wasThisHelpful","R1ZGG46HGNF06","A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Poetry collections are among the most difficult books to review. Poetry, even more than most other kinds of writing, is so subjective and also so personal. If you don't like a poem, it's easy for the poet to argue that you ""just didn't get it.""Having said that, I didn't like these poems.I was excited for this collection because I've always had a great admiration for Marilyn Monroe, like so many other people who were born long after she died. She's fascinating, even in death (my mother insists that Marilyn's fame after death is greater by far than any she enjoyed in life). Plus, I like poetry. I just don't like reviewing it.But this collection of free verse left me disappointed. The style and content are repetitive, to the point that I wondered why the author even needed to write more than one or two poems on the subject at all. Every piece has essentially the same point of view: Marilyn was beautiful and alluring but ultimately a victim. She didn't want to be sexy; she was forced into virtually everything in her life; and she was tragically and chronically misunderstood. It's a story that's been told many times before, and by writers far more compelling than Lyn Lifshin.This collection was originally published 20 years ago and I'm not sure what, if anything, has been updated. As much as I love Marilyn Monroe, I didn't find anything in these poems that hadn't already been better said by Elton John four decades ago.This review first appeared on my blog, Cozy Little Book Journal. I received a digital copy of the book through a giveaway on LibraryThing but was not required to write a favourable review (obviously).","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EMRGW37JCS0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H1EMORU#wasThisHelpful","R2EMRGW37JCS0S","A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are some things I really like about this neck pillow, and other things I'm not so keen on.First of all, as other reviewers have noted, it is soft and feels lovely against the skin. I also quite like the colour, which is exactly as it appears in the picture (but that's a pretty small detail, and wouldn't have been a deal breaker either way). And the stuffing of the pillow is the kind that molds to the neck nicely, so it's very comfortable that way.So just as a neck pillow--forgetting the vibration for a moment--it would be very comfortable. Well, except that it's small. Very small. I didn't have any problem getting it around my neck, but once I had it on I didn't feel like it provided very much cushioning as a travel neck pillow, compared to others I've had. On the other hand, sometimes when you're travelling you have limited space, so maybe some people would prefer the smaller size.As for the vibration, I'm not sold on it. The vibration pack is located at the back of the pillow (it also has a battery pack that takes 2 AA batteries, not included) so it's very intense on the back of your neck, but nowhere else. And I found it loud! The sound of the vibration started to hurt my ears after a very short time (which is all I could use it for anyway, considering the instructions recommend not having it vibrating for any longer than 10 minutes). And even the lowest setting seemed fairly intense. Maybe I just have a sensitive neck, but I was hoping with 6 settings that at least one of them would be gentler.Also--and this might be something I wouldn't do as much once I got used to it--I found myself accidentally turning on the vibration buttons when I was taking the pillow off, putting it on, or adjusting it. Maybe it was just because I wasn't used to it yet (or that I'm a total klutz) but I had visions of taking a nap with it and waking up to a sudden surprise vibration as my face hit the 'ON' button.So overall it's okay, but not perfect. But it's not bad for the price. And I liked that it had an easy to understand instruction manual and a 3-year warranty (not that I use product warranties much, if I'm honest). It just wasn't the perfect pillow for me.Full disclosure: I was sent this pillow from the manufacturer at no cost in exchange for an honest review. I wasn't otherwise compensated and I never agreed to give a favourable review just because they sent me the product. What I wrote is exactly what I think.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2867VXYVS8NKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IY0J536#wasThisHelpful","R2867VXYVS8NKI","A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eeee! I loved this book so much! It was the most fun book I've read all month (I read a lot of books, so that's definitely a compliment).I love detective fiction set in Victorian England ('VicLit,' I like to call it) but lately I seem to have found all the worst examples of the genre. I was starting to despair. I'm so glad I found this book. It was like a palate cleanser after a bad meal, or in this case, after bad writing.Not only is The Revenant of Thraxton Hall well written, it's SO MUCH FUN. It's like a Scooby Doo episode for nerdy adults. Vaughn Entwistle has Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Oscar Wilde investigating a murder in a haunted castle. There are secret passageways, spooky portraits, levitating psychics, blind butlers, ghosts, guests wearing masks, and--oh my god!--a family crypt with coffins! Not to mention a mirror maze, a monkey running amok, a woman allergic to sunlight... Oh it's just so much fun I can't stand it!It may seem strange that I loved this book so much when I criticized other books in the genre for having too many plot points, for being historically inaccurate, for having an ill-conceived ghost story, or unrealistic characters. So what makes The Revenant of Thraxton Hall different? Simple. IT'S WELL WRITTEN.If a story is well written it could take place in a unicorn colony on the moon and I'd find it believable. If a story is poorly written it could be an autobiography and I'd question its veracity.My only complaint is that J.M. Barrie didn't factor into the story as much as I'd have liked. He was with Conan Doyle and Wilde in the beginning, and I think it would have been fun if he'd been with them at the haunted castle. They could be a supernatural crime fighting trio, with Sherlock Holmes showing up as the secret advisor only Arthur Conan Doyle can see.I'm already fantasy casting the voice actors for a cartoon version of this book (can anyone say Stephen Frye and Hugh Laurie?).Visit my blog, Cozy Little Book Journal, for more about this book and a truly ridiculous number of similar book recommendations (turns out I read this genre A LOT)...","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBAGJRL447JWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250035007#wasThisHelpful","RBAGJRL447JWE","A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WDHQ9V2E4H5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Such a great idea for a book! It's no secret that I'm a sucker for these types of books of weird facts aimed at ten-year-olds, and have been since I was a ten-year-old myself. This one is particularly great because the authors enlisted the help of actual kids (from schools across England, mostly 9-11 year olds) to submit questions they most wanted answered, then they approached various celebrity experts to answer them. The experts range from chef Heston Blumenthal to illustrator Quentin Blake, with a lot of TV doctors and hosts of science shows thrown in.And the answer to the titular question (which was not, I was disappointed to learn, the first in the book but instead buried mid-way)? Does your goldfish know who you are? Well sort of. It probably has a longer memory than the oft-quoted three seconds, and evne small fish can remember when and where they get their food, but it likely can't recognize your face.My favourite question in the book?

First of all, I thought he had cerebral palsy and had been wheelchair bound since childhood. Not so. He has ALS, a degenerative disorder that didn't present symptoms until he was in his early twenties. He was on the rowing team in university! (Though he was the person who does the shouting and no actual rowing. What's that called? I literally just read it. Oh I forget.)I also learned that Stephen Hawking is twice divorced (the first divorce was particularly complicated and sad) and that he has written a series of science books for children with the help of his daughter, Lucy. I also learned that A Brief History of Time was meant to be a populist book to explain astrophysics to the everyday person.

What I object to - and the reason this doesn't get a five-star rating - is that Maestro von Karajan treats this rather more like the Verdi Requiem than the more intimate piece I'd prefer it to be.Still, a very good recording.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FIRCGPA953SP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001GDM#wasThisHelpful","R2FIRCGPA953SP","A2LTGSJ902DI73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LTGSJ902DI73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first saw and hear Bryan Hymel on a broadcast of the Met production of Les Troyens.  I was extremely impressed and a bit surprised - how could I not have heard of a great new tenor?  Apparently, I was not alone, as Mr. Hymel has become something of an overnight sensation - though of course an opera career rarely happens overnight.Simply stated, Mr. Hymel has a glorious and quite beautiful heroic tenor.  I don't know how he'd do in the more traditional heroic tenor roles (i.e., Wagner's), but he's really wonderful in French opera - and he gives us a taste of his Italian abilities with two arias from ""Les Vpres Sicilianes"" (better known as Verdi's ""I Vespri Siciliani"").  He has it all - elegant phrasing, phenomenal breath control, high and low notes galore.  In short, I think he's bound for operatic glory.So why only a four-star rating?  I will likely get bashed for this, but the program is repetitive and therefore dull.  I'd have loved to hear his treatment of some softer, arias - perhaps (assuming he wants to stick to French opera) something from Faust or Samson et Dalila.  Of course, he's loyal to the title of the recording, and thus sticks to heroes, heroes and more heroes.  But that makes it all rather stentorian and a bit dull.I'm very much looking forward to hearing more of and from Mr. Hymel.  As I said, he's a comer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TJPDCZGOGM81/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P97SHNQ#wasThisHelpful","R2TJPDCZGOGM81","A2LTGSJ902DI73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LTGSJ902DI73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never read any of Oliver Sacks's books, so I'm not sure why I decided to read this one.  Perhaps it was that the reviews conveyed his sense of wonder, his humanity, his idiosyncratic nature, or all of the above.In any case, I am so glad that I was tempted.  ""On the Move"" is a profoundly generous, moving diary of a life spent in eternal inquiry and wonder of all that we see around us.  Sacks isn't moved merely by the disturbed patients that he's seen (and helped) over the many years of his life; he is also moved by some kinds of trees; by swimming, bike-riding and other physical activities (including his obsession with weight-lifting); by the brilliance of some of his fellow scientists and humanists; and by the humble joys of family (though his family is far from humble - his relatives included Al Capp and Abba Eban), reading and writing letters.  He's also not a perfect person, and he readily admits this; his problems with drugs; his inordinate sensitivity to what people say about him; and the fact that for much of his life he observed the world from an emotional distance - without love (and sex), among other things, are as much a part of his life as his insatiable curiosity and quest for knowledge of all things around him.Sacks discusses some very weighty topics, indeed, many of which are apparently the stuff of which his books have been made - and I've already ordered one of them in a kind of backwards pilgrimage from this one.  Yet he rarely loses sight of the reader (in fact, the only time he does this is in a rather lengthy and tedious discussion of the theories of Gerald Edelman toward the very end of the book), and as a result the book is eminently readable and enjoyable.It's rare for me to wish that a book could be longer; after all, there are so many more books I want to read.  However, this is a wonderful exception.  I wish the book could go on longer much as I wish that this incredible man could go on living.  Alas, he is dealing with terminal cancer and will likely not be with us much longer.  Having read this brilliant memoir, I can at least appreciate the sadness of his imminent death and of his absence from a world that he made a better place.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QP5HQS6NIPPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385352549#wasThisHelpful","R2QP5HQS6NIPPF","A2LTGSJ902DI73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LTGSJ902DI73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't usually read thrillers, but I was traveling and hated the book I was reading, so when I came upon this, having read Janet Maslin's review in the NY Times, I decided that some ""light reading"" was in order.I wasn't exactly right about the ""light"" part, but it was a great book to read while traveling; in fact, I read nearly all of the book on flights from Seattle to Jacksonville.  I certainly understand the comparisons to ""Gone Girl.""  It's a narrative told from the perspective of two people on opposite sides of the same facts, and neither of the main characters is appealing; in fact, they range from off-putting to totally creepy.  And of course, things turn out not to be as they seem.The writing isn't great; Ms. Knight isn't a great stylist, and her characterizations and dialogue aren't riveting.  However, she's apparently done lots of writing for TV, and it shows in that she knows how to write a good yarn.  It's really quite hard to put the book down, and while an argument can be made that she takes too long to get to the point, it's worth waiting for.

"I dont usually like political memoirs; too often they are boring (and then I did) and full of self-justifying/aggrandizing platitudes.  However, I decided to read this one because Im attending a conference at which David Axelrod will be speaking, and I thought it might be interesting to get his take on things before I listen to him in person.I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.  While Im sure Axelrod has at least a normal amount of ego (and maybe much more), he nonetheless comes across as a decent man who, like all of us, makes mistakes from time to time and has insecurities and worries.  He doesnt shy away from criticizing others views, policies and actions, but his criticisms are not nasty or gratuitous.  He also refrains from the insufferable self-righteousness of, for example, Hillary Rodham Clintons Hard Choices (surely among the worst political memoirs in recorded history).Axelrod also appears to be committed to his principles and to acting in accordance with those principles  for example, by opting not to work on campaigns of people with whose principles he disagrees.  Most interesting, however  and the reason we even know who Axelrod is and the reason he wrote this book  is his commitment to Barack Obama.  He believes in Obamas principles and in Obama the man.  Regardless of what anyone thinks of President Obama  and I know Im likely to get dozens if not hundreds of comments on this review  its refreshing to see someone who is loyal (though not unquestioning) to the end vs. so many memoirs that betray confidences and principles.Its also important to note that the title of the book doesnt just refer to Axelrods belief in Obama; it refers to his belief in our political system in general. Im not sure I can agree, given how big money has destroyed any remaining element of integrity in our political process and system, but hes a believer and I think we need some people like that.The book has some weak points, particularly Axelrods failure/refusal/inability to justify Obamas lead from behind approach, which even many liberal Democrats find frustrating to the max.  He seems to say that thats not Obamas way, but if thats true then Axelrod, as chief message-maker for POTUS, seems to have failed in doing his job.That said, this is one of the best of its kind, at least of those Ive read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18DH2LXZO3LH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205876#wasThisHelpful","R18DH2LXZO3LH0","A2LTGSJ902DI73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LTGSJ902DI73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I need to accept that I just don't love mysteries.  The problem is that once in a while I read one that I really like, and then I find myself more susceptible when the next one comes along.  That's what happened with this one.The mystery in this book is OK, and the atmosphere - Berlin in 1936 - is intriguing, to put it mildly.  However, I found the hero, Private Investigator Bernie Gunther to be a bit too much of a wisecracker than seems appropriate for that time and place, and his constant wisecracks become tiring.

"This book received good reviews when it was published, but for the life of me I can't figure out why.  First, it's touted as a book about Mr. Berg's brother's murder.  It's about that, but only partially - and secondarily.  Mostly, it's a memoir of the author.  That might not be a drawback, but the murder is really the most interesting thing about the author and his life, and by focusing on himself rather than the murder and the overarching tragedy of his family, he makes the book boring and stuffy.  And that's compounded by the fact that the author is very full of himself.  I have no doubt that the prosecutor who went after his brother's murderer did a bad job, but instead of expressing anguish or anger, the author goes into a long riff about how he would/could have done better; if that's the case, why didn't he more actively assist the prosecutor?  It just smacks of a big (Texas big) ego rather than a poignant tale about a family tragedy.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UWEUFUJMK1J7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476717052#wasThisHelpful","R1UWEUFUJMK1J7","A2LTGSJ902DI73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LTGSJ902DI73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For many years, I thought that Norma was a tedious opera.  I can't explain why I felt that way, but I recently had occasion to listen to this recording, and it changed my views.  I don't think Norma will ever be my favorite opera, but in many ways it's grand opera at its best, and this recording is the best of this piece.  I know there are those who think that each of Sutherland and/or Callas was Norma incarnate, but for me they don't compare; I find that I can no longer bear listening to Dame Joan (may she rest in peace); the horrid diction, the scooping into notes, the lack of phrasing, and the sheer size of her voice always make me think of a Wagnerian hero in drag.  And I may be committing sacrilege to some, but for all of Maria Callas's acting ability (and she was a great actress if not a great singing one), her voice is, well, let's just say unattractive.But Caballe has it all - the diction, the precision of her singing, the phrasing and the sheer beauty of her voice - with no lack of power - are all there.  Fiorenza Cossotto is equally as good and the two of them together are greater than the sum of their not inconsiderable parts.  Domingo's role may be something of a cipher, but he's in his prime here, and that was glorious.The melodies, the duets, the arias, and so on are also great.  In fact, it's just a gorgeous opera to sit back and listen to and taken in the glory of the art and those incredible voices.  Take a listen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33UN9N1C7W14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000003EPJ#wasThisHelpful","R33UN9N1C7W14","A2LTGSJ902DI73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LTGSJ902DI73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Clicking on a rating that translates into ""I love it"" is a bit weird with this book.  While I believe it earns five stars, saying ""I love it"" seems inappropriate for a book that is so disturbing.  Ms. Kim pains a very painful but very vivid picture of North Korea; it seems a truly barren country in all senses of the word - so much so that at times it's like reading a non-fiction version of 1984, with speakers blaring at you all the time and everyone spying on everyone.I note that some of the critical reviews questioned the inclusion of so much about Ms. Kim in this book, but it is subtitled ""A Memoir,"" and to have written about the school in the Pyongyang ""suburbs"" without including something about herself would have been to extend the severity and sterility of the country to include herself; frankly, I found it refreshing - or, rather, humanizing - to include something of herself.  I also noted reviews that chastised her for possibly harming the other teachers at the school because they will be ""found out"".  I suppose there's some validity to that criticism, but how else could anyone write about a society as closed as that of North Korea?  Anyway, it makes the book a bit more interesting.A very chilling book but very important for that very reason.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BJMP193KP5M6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307720659#wasThisHelpful","R2BJMP193KP5M6","A2LTGSJ902DI73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LTGSJ902DI73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To my knowledge, Leontyne Price never performed this role on stage, and I remember reading that it took every ounce of his estimable persuasiveness for von Karajan to persuade her to take on the role in this recording.  Thank goodness!  Aside from a somewhat bland Habanera (perhaps it's so hackneyed a piece that it's hard for it to be otherwise), she owns this role.  She is a sassy, angry spitfire who sings magnificently and who alone is worth the price.  The other performers are also at top levels; Freni brings her usual sympathetic persona and sings beautifully, and Robert Merrill is his customary virile self.  Many have carped about Franco Corelli - I'm among them - but I'm willing to forgive his excessive melodrama because despite that he really does sing his heart out.  (Note that I once saw him sing Don Jose in Philadelphia, where he sang the Flower Song in Italian; many booed, but given the overwhelmingly Italian make-up of the audience, most cheered.)  The conducting is von Karajan at his bombastic best as well.Oh, I know people will say this is an inauthentic Carmen, and of course that's true, but this recording is just too full of pleasures.  My favorite Carmen on disc is that of Regine Crespin, who is uniquely French and really knows how to seduce with her voice, but this recording is simply enjoyable to the max.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO43UWEI1WWII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000009W7K#wasThisHelpful","RO43UWEI1WWII","A2LTGSJ902DI73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LTGSJ902DI73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I'm not a big fan of recital discs, one must settle for them these days given the paucity of complete recordings.  And this one had quite a buzz for a while.  However, the reality is somewhat disappointing.The good news is that Ms. Borsi has a lovely voice - not great, but lovely - and she has a way of caressing the words that is nice.  The other good news is that some of the pieces are intriguing, such as the Respighi aria that another reviewer has noted.Everything else is not so good news.  As some of the other reviewers have noted, she has what I'd call a ""wide vibrato"" - not a wobble (or at least not yet).  It's acceptable if noticeable most of the time, but she comes perilously close to the ""w"" word and given her relative youth I don't see this getting better.Second, despite her ability to caress words, everything sounds the same (with a couple of exceptions) - it's all lovely, bland and largely devoid of passion.  I call this the ""Leona Mitchell Syndrome,"" except that Ms. Mitchell's voice really was exquisite, while this is merely lovely with a portent of ugly in that incipient wobble.Also, is it my imagination or are these pieces played way too slowly?  I thought my CD player was on strike or something - so much so that Ms. Borsi couldn't carry the full word ""ascolta"" in the aria from Turandot.  Shame!I give it three stars because it is, well, lovely and it's not going to the thrift store (yet), but a great recording it's not.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNK8WKBNKZNYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5VZEPY#wasThisHelpful","RNK8WKBNKZNYT","A2LTGSJ902DI73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LTGSJ902DI73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So put it in the CD player in your car and drive, or read a newspaper; you won't be riveted to it, but it will be nice to know it's there.Nina Stemme's rendition of Brunnhilde's immolation scene is a bit disappointing.

Her diction is perfect (it is, after all, her native language), and she just has a feel for the pieces.  She may be a bit too mature for Tatiana in Eugene Onegin, but others have sung it when they were older, and she could surely pull it off.

"I must agree with the other three-star review.  I've become a fan of Ms. Stoyanova, having loved her Desdemona on the recent Muti recording as well as her recital disk of Verdi arias.  She starts out a bit wobbly on this recording, though she does warm up and give a lovely performance. The other soloists are a mixed bag. The tenor, Saimir Pirgu, is unknown to me, and I'm not sure I'd like to know him better.  He's OK in spots, good in others, but really not good at all in others, bleating his way through some of the lovelier passages in this work.  The mezzo/contralto is Marina Prudenskaya, who's quite good, as is the bass, Orlin Anastassov.Which leaves us with the conducting, which is just plain odd.  There are passages that are so slow that I thought there was something wrong with the recording or my CD player, while others were up to speed and quite dramatic.  Normally, the conductor's approach to this work is consistent within itself; in other words, some conductors treat it like a dramatic opera - say, Otello - while others treat it like a choral work and de-emphasize the dramatics, but each conductor's approach is consistent throughout his work.  Jansons's approach is not; there seem to be passages where he's definitively decided that it's a religious choral work and others where it's high drama.  If he can't make up his mind, neither can I.All in all, not the worst recording of this work, but not the best either, and when you've got as many great recordings of it as I seem to find on my shelf, I don't regard this one as a keeper.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HHC0PRGA6B4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NG4B6SW#wasThisHelpful","R1HHC0PRGA6B4U","A2LTGSJ902DI73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LTGSJ902DI73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're thinking about buying this recording to hear and hold Anna Netrebko's version of the Strauss Four Last Songs, save your money.  I continue to think that she is a wonderful dramatic singer - I've seen and heard her in enough roles (most recently in Macbeth at the Met) to demonstrate that beyond a reasonable doubt.  However, lieder - even these most operatic of lieder - require nuance, subtlety and in a number of cases soft singing rather than scenery-chewing, and for that purpose Ms. Netrebko just doesn't have it.  At least not yet.  As some other reviews have indicated, the last song is a bit better than the others, but for the most part it sounds like she's channeling Lady Macbeth.  That may be a bit too harsh, but it gets the point across.The accompanying piece, Strauss's Ein Heldenleiben, is well done in my opinion, but it's an afterthought - it's not even mentioned on the cover of the  jewel box.  Instead, the cover features a photo of Donna Anna in a dramatic red gown; it may well be that she's running into the woods to hide from the reviews of her performance here.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA03FHDVF0RLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NXAA2LQ#wasThisHelpful","RA03FHDVF0RLE","A2LTGSJ902DI73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LTGSJ902DI73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mr. (Ambassador?) Muoz is a distinguished diplomat and I have absolutely no doubt that he is intelligent and sincere.  However, this book is all over the place and sheds virtually no light on the assassination of Benazir Bhutto.  He starts out by giving a quick summary of the assassination itself and its immediate aftermath; then he goes backwards in time and gives a brief history of the Pakistani political scene; he then goes back and gives a more robust history of Pakistan, including the assassinations of Bhutto's father and several others; then he dissects his UN-sponsored investigation of the assassination - noting several times that his mission was not to find the culprit.  The last section of the book is an essay on the strange (and strained) relationship between the US and Pakistan.While these sections are more or less interesting, the early ones are repetitive and the last one has nothing to do with what I thought the book would be about.  Moreover, in most cases, the sections are too detailed to serve as the general overview he seems to seek to achieve, but not nearly detailed enough to give the full story.  And the weakest section of the book is the one that discusses the investigation of the assassination, because it told me nothing that I didn't know before (aside from details that I'm not sure I needed to know).  As a result, the book is choppy and inconclusive, and it's really not clear why he wrote it - or why he wrote it in this manner.So, despite his intelligence and sincerity, the book is not what it's supposed to be about and not very good at what it is about, and not worth reading.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QRK238LPV51X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393062910#wasThisHelpful","R1QRK238LPV51X","A2LTGSJ902DI73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LTGSJ902DI73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rosenkavalier used to be my favorite opera.  I still love it, and it's still one of my favorites, but each time I listen to it I feel more and more as though I'm listening to a recording of a three-ring circus.  Of course, this is in some ways what this opera is all about, and Solti is a splendid ringmaster.  This recording perfectly mirrors the lushness (is that a word?) of the era and the score, as well as the slapstick comedy, and both are made to order for Solti's style of conducting and his showmanship.As I've noted in other reviews, I believe that Regine Crespin was among the greatest sopranos of the 20th century. Her voice was huge but gorgeous, and she was capable of singing quietly without losing any of her quality.  She was also a singing actress in the sense that she acts most effectively with her voice.  All of these pulled together make her a Marschallin for the ages. The other cast members are equally perfect for their roles, and that includes the Baron Ochs of Manfred Jungwirth, who's a great singer as well as a great buffoon in this role.  Heck, even the tiny part of the Italian Singer is sung by none other than Luciano Pavarotti.I'm devastated that this recording seems to be out of print, but perhaps it's available for download somewhere.  It's well worth it.  Listen to it with a cup of coffee with whipped cream, and you'll feel right at home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3170QG0PH1ARJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000041S4#wasThisHelpful","R3170QG0PH1ARJ","A2LTGSJ902DI73","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LTGSJ902DI73?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So coolI was honestly getting this as a gift for my mother in law, but i fell in love with it and i dont think i will be giving it away, i am just going to have to get another one because this one is mine.I love the size of it and how realistic it looks, my kids never even realized it was a cup I should have kept it that way because then maybe my son would not be drinking all my drink.I really like the included lens lid, and the top is see through, it screws on tight and I have not had any issues with it leaking.Its a great size and its perfect at keeping things hot or cold if you wanted.Easy to clean with just some warm soapy water.Overall a great product and I am happy I got it for review. *sample provided*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NY42HS8FTI7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SHKACT4#wasThisHelpful","R2NY42HS8FTI7R","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very niceI really dont know what feature I like more about this mouse, its the perfect gaming mouse and back in the day when I would constantly play wow this would have been an amazing thing to have , it would have made my gaming so much easier. It is very easy to control and it works flawlessly. Very smooth, and does not stick. Works good with my gel armrest mouse pad. I am more used to cordless mice these days but even so i dont mind that this one is corded because the cord is nice, i really like that its braided cable and it does not get tangled as a standard one does, I have also noticed that it stays in place more instead of sliding all over the place.I love that it changes colors, its light a nice light display right at my computer. I also really like the skull on it, I love skulls so thats a big plus for me. Dpi works well and its nice to have , especially if your using it as a gaming mouse or you edit alot with it because your able to control it better then your average mouse.I have been using this along with the light changing keyboard, and I just love the light display.Even if you are not a gamer the side buttons that let you go forwards and backwards in your browser are a huge selling point.Overall  its a great product and I am happy I got it for review. *sample provided*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31ZQYS2HBZGGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014OSMLU0#wasThisHelpful","R31ZQYS2HBZGGG","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love itI got something similar to this for my son and knew that my kids would fight over it , my oldest daughter has diffuser in her room that changes colors so I got this for my youngest daughter who is 8 and I know she will love it. I am keeping it for her for christmas but i tested it out and its amazing. I have always wanted to see the Northern lights and sadly this is the closest I and my family will probably get but its absolutely beautiful so i will take it.It displays a beautiful light display close to like what you would see with the Northen Lights. Then the best part the top can be removed and it projects a mini lazer light show, its so cool. It is very easy to control and switch between settings.It has a 1 hour auto shut off, love this feature my daughter will be able to enjoy it till she falls asleep and then it will shut off in the middle of the night on its own.Its not just a light projector but it also has a built in speaker very easy to connect to a phone , tablet and will be perfect for my daughter to use it with her mp3 player. Comes with all cables that are needed. The speaker is nice and loud and it is very clear, if this is taken care of it should last a long time.**Check out included video to see just how pretty the lights are**Overall its a great product and I am happy I got it for review. *sample provided*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG90O0Q1BBIFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7LPG6Y#wasThisHelpful","RG90O0Q1BBIFI","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My favoritesThe perfect set, cant get over how much I like these.I really like the ones with different compartments they provide just the perfect amount of space for different portioned foods, if you are someone who freezes meals for later these are amazing and just like having a tv dinner only with better food lol. They also work great for my husband to take his lunch in, very easy to use leftovers and  just pack lunches into in pre portioned servings.The bowls are also great and good quality. Use them for the husbands lunch , they make the perfect salad bowl and he even has used them for Chili and it was perfect , lid has a perfect seal and nothing leaked.My husband works in the oilfield and I hate him using and taking my good storage containers to work if you have ever had to deal with pipe dope you know that stuff is no joke and it takes forever to get off stuff, with these even though they are nice I dont have to worry about it he happens to make a mess on one and needs to throw it away.

"NiceThese are nice balls for small treat bags, i plan to use them for goodie bags I am giving out for my sons kindergarten class at his christmas party. They are all around 5 and 6 years old so I think they are good for that age range and up. I would not give them to kids younger who are still in the stage of putting things in their mouth cause it would be very easy to bite chunks out of these, I would also not let dogs get ahold of the balls.For the price range that they are , i would say they are a bit over priced is thats what I only gave them 4 stars.Overall they are a good product and I am happy I got them for review. *sample provided*","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DK89IQ7YPFXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W3C5LJS#wasThisHelpful","R2DK89IQ7YPFXT","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"GreatIts a nice pretty shade of blue, got this for my mom since its her favorite color.Like I have said in past reviews. This is in no way an iPod so dont be expecting that.This one has a 16 gig removable micro sd card. It is very easy to get music onto it, just place the micro card into one the of the bigger card slots and then into your computer open the file for it and then you can just drag and drop your music straight onto it, even videos and e books. I could never sit around and read from the little screen but for those who dont mind it its a great thing.I really like the built in fm radio, picks up stations with ease.The thing that i dislike about this one is the games are not on it, now thats not a huge deal breaker but i liked that the other brand had snake on it and a few other games.It is easy to navigate and came with detailed instructions.Comes with headphones nothing special but they work .Also comes with charger works with basic charging ports but to get the best charge use your computer.Overall a great product and I am happy I got it for review. *sample provided*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CVGYW0AJTZ2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBXDG1S#wasThisHelpful","R2CVGYW0AJTZ2O","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So BeautifulI love the colors they are so pretty together , and I love the unique mandala flower print of it.This is so soft, I love these fleece covers they are very thick and very well made, the stitching that is on it is perfect no loose threads, it has a hidden zipper on the side, blends well with the cover and it works good , no issue with it snagging at all.Like I said above because these are so thick they work perfect with the fluff and stuff for making your own pillows.

"So softFirst off I love just love the beautiful shade of purple it is, its a bit lighter then the stock photo but I love it , purple is my favorite color , I love anything that is purple lol. That being said even if it was not purple I would still love it. The Suede is so soft , and maybe I am weird but I just love the smell of it.It is very nice and a great size with 5 pockets  , I was able to fit my makeup brush set in it , A bigger sized brush in the first 3 slots and then 2 smaller brushes in each of the last 2, the protective flap fits over the brushes nicely so when its all rolled up they stay clean during storage and being transported. I like to keep this in my purse with me.Rolls up nicely, not all big and bulky stays in place by putting the strap around it and securing it on the clasp, a bit hard to get it on, but once you do you know its not going to slip right off so i like that its not loose.Great for my makeup brushes but would be good also for paint brushes , pens, pencils , colored pencils.Overall a great product and I am happy I got it for review. *sample provided*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AT5MK7DOWHNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WY5P112#wasThisHelpful","R3AT5MK7DOWHNT","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So cuteThis is going to be a Christmas present for my son. But i got it out and played with it and tested out the different features. He is going to love it , he is 5 and has an older set that is wooden with no where near this many doctor items in it. I really like the bright bold colors thats going to be something that gets his attention and will stand out to him.I love that it comes in a lockable carry case, the plastic inserts are just for first time use, they are pretty much junk afterwards but I am not worried about that, he will still be able to cary everything in it. The case is pretty durable.They toys are all made decent, the plastic is not cheap for sure better quality then you would get from a dollar store. The toy phone is standard to one you would get with a tool set or kitchen play set. Nothing special but still great for the little kids. Stethoscope makes a heart beat sound its pretty cool and will provide him with entertainment.Overall its a great product and I am happy I was able to get it at a discounted price for a honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R194NCZGFQNGCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGZ70ZO#wasThisHelpful","R194NCZGFQNGCD","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"NiceI love the detail in these, they are beautiful and have such pretty designs. Such pretty colors and they are bold and stand out.Since I got my kids a marble run my daughter has taken a huge liking to Marbles because of all the colors and designs on them so I figured these would be perfect for her to pick out some that she likes and of course for the marble run, I know she is just going to love them.They all seem pretty unique, I have not noticed any doubles and even the ones similar in color have different swirls in them so they are all different. i counted them and I got 50 marbles in my container. My favorite would have to the ones that are matte and stone like in appearance and texture.I need to see if my dad still has his marble board he used to have I remember as a young child playing marbles with him and my great grandma, it was one of his favorite things to do and I enjoyed it as well, I think it would be a cool thing to pass on down to my kids.Overall a great product and I am happy i got them for review. *sample provided*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17WN1GUR1O62P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016B3E2QC#wasThisHelpful","R17WN1GUR1O62P","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was honestly not so sure on how well i would like this scent, especially because it is a massage candle and I would be rubbing it into my hands and on my body but i wanted something different. I am very happy to say I love it, it smells amazing. The sweet scent of brown sugar and to me it has a very pleasant vanilla smell along with it. I am not sure where the fig smell comes into play but either way i love the scent of it.The consistency of it is great prior to this candle I have only owned one other massage oil one before, its not too oily and blends in well, leaves my skin so smooth.A tiny bit of this goes a long way the candle is a good size, so it should last you long time.I also really like the container that it comes in, the band around it that says Breathe is actually one of those rubber bracelets that are popular, so after your done with the candle you have the bracelet also.Overall a great product and I am happy I got it for review. *sample provided*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M2359S0XP3SI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0109OO1DI#wasThisHelpful","R3M2359S0XP3SI","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Love theseThese little lights are great and put off just enough light for my kids not super bright but good for if they need to get up in the middle of the night. You get 4 of them in a pack and that is perfect for me. I put one in my oldest daughters bathroom, one in the main bathroom and one in each of the other kids rooms. i love that they are auto and i don't have to worry about getting onto the kids about turning the lights off every day.They are rather large in size and kind of bulky I don't mind that and just use them on outlets that I dont need to plug anything else into.

"Work as they shouldThese were a great price and I got an assortment of colors.I have several other sets of these and they are just as good as all the others. As nice as the name brand ones and so much cheaper. Yes you have to wait for a few weeks for them to get to you but i did not mind that.Great for all different things , plants , water bead toys, arts and crafts, as advertised for the water paintball gun, or just playing with.Just apply water and watch them grow, you can dry them back out if you want and reuse but i normally dont do that.*i PURCHASED THIS*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V437Y9P35L1O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01081VFD6#wasThisHelpful","R2V437Y9P35L1O","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very prettyThese are very pretty, when in the package they look like pencils to be honest when i first saw them thats what I thought they were , the prints are beautiful and nice and bold, bright colors and they really stand out.Perfect for drinks nice thick paper wont just bend and breakMy reason for wanting these though was for cake pops, they make the perfect sticks and are very easy to use, one the main key to getting them to stick is use a tiny bit of the melted chocolate on the paper straw then insert it into your cake pop, it works like glue and then they wont just fall out. They work great and they are so pretty, got tons of compliments on them.Overall a great product and I am happy I got them for review. *sample provided*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LM284ORNPHBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010R7FO2Y#wasThisHelpful","R3LM284ORNPHBC","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very niceThis jump rope is great for my kids ages 5,8,10 , they have multiple jump ropes and they all 3 love using them, they play games and double dutch and have jumping contests all the time with each other.I love the soft grip handles they are perfect and out of the the jumpers ropes (as my 5 year old son calls them) this one is his favorite, he can hold it perfectly and does not seem to drop it as much from the handles flying out of his hands. Its perfect for him because it is fully adjustable.It is very lightweight and along with the padded handles the rope is a soft rubber, perfect for the kids and they enjoy the bright colors.The counter is easy to use, seems pretty accurate and easy to reset.Not just kids perfect for any adult also.Overall a great product and I am happy I got it for review. *sample provided*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IIEBJ8JQZESO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014XQ0ICG#wasThisHelpful","R2IIEBJ8JQZESO","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"AmazingLet me say this I would give this thing a million stars if I could because it works perfect and does as it should. As soon as i got my 2.0 i ordered the freedom clip from the main company that started it out,  and waited what seemed like forever to get it. I dont know if i had a faulty one but it would not stay in the machine, it would fall out every time we tried to use it and because its so thin it ended up cracking. I had tons of other K cups that i wanted to use, so what we ended up having to do is taking the seal from a used one and taping it to each one that we needed that did not have the right seal, it was a pain but it worked for what we needed and we dealt with it.I am happy to say, that as soon as I got this one, I placed it into my 2.0 it snapped in place and its still there and i have had no issues at all with it, I honestly dont know what the issue with the other one is unless it truly was just defaulted because this one seems to be the exact same thing, lol plus i like the purple color of it.Overall a great product and I am happy I got it for review. *sample provided*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R333G1GYFATXMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015539JLM#wasThisHelpful","R333G1GYFATXMG","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very nice caseLove this case,its purple so it gets bonus points just for that, it is very similar to my other name brand cases, almost exact. You don't see too many good top quality cases on the market that are made as well, with as much protection. Yes its going to make your phone bigger and bulky so if you have an issue with that  this is not the case for you.I cant wait to use it on my new phone, as of now I still have a galaxy but i am up grading in the next month to iPhone, so I tested this out on one of my friends phones and its great, it fits the phone perfect and once put together it stays together. All the buttons work great and it does not block the speaker, has built in dust covers.It comes in 3 pieces the front panel with built in screen protector, back panel with camera and apple icon cut outs ,those to snap together and then it goes into the outer soft rubberized part. The screen protector is good fits tight no issues with air bubbles or anything, screen is still perfect and responsive.It does come with a clip but i dont really use them , it is made well though and will work great for those who choose to do so.Overall a great product and I am happy I got it at a discounted price for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R160P3T88JPHH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01190V6FM#wasThisHelpful","R160P3T88JPHH7","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WowI hate the taste of medicine normally sometimes I think I am worse then my kids when it comes to it. I was very pleased with this, and not only the taste but the smell , it smelled like the frozen grape juice you get in a can . I love that stuff, and it tasted just as good . Like a grape freezer pop almost, so I can say that I was very satisfied just from the taste alone. No nasty after taste.Aside from that, this brand is my go to number one brand. Works great and gives me almost instant relief allergies are kicking my butt this year and flu season is just making it worse. Hard to sleep most of the time and then I keep my husband up coughing all night and its not good for either of us. Thankfully because of this I am able to get some relief and get some sleep. I take it before bed and im good till the morning, does not really make me extra tired but it helps with sleep.Overall a great product and I am happy I got it for review.

"Good itemI have a friend who does who own clothes and such and using these types of mailers all the time so I got them for her, they are on the smaller size so you cant stuff full but just for one or 2 small things they work fine and are able to seal with no issue.I don't suggest stuffing them full or anything because they are petty thin and you could risk the chance of them ripping during shipment. Best for clothes and smaller softer items.They have a warning label printed on them, thats always a good thing.Like I said we have had no issues with sealing them  and they come apart easily.You get a very good amount of bags for the price, I counted mine and I had received all 100 like i should have.Overall a good product and I am happy I got it for review. *sample provided*","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X82UTUYQAA5O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YT1A5ZG#wasThisHelpful","R1X82UTUYQAA5O","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love theseFirst off they are purple and that right there is enough to make me love them, I dont normally like glasses this big but even aside from them being purple I really like them. They are comfortable on my face, sit securely and I dont have to worry about them slipping and falling off. The nose piece is made well and fits good, arms are made well and tight, they are spring loaded and bed back a bit.They are great for blocking out the sun, I have tinted glasses but they seem to be to dark for me, and these work perfect for me in the mornings when the sun is rising and I am taking the kids to school!They came nicely packaged in plastic inside the zipper case, and come with a drawstring bag also and a cleaning cloth.Overall a great product and I am happy I got them for review. *sample provided*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GDR3E7VW7F3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UQHC5AA#wasThisHelpful","R3GDR3E7VW7F3T","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very niceThese are great for packing for vacation you can fit so much inside them, but not only that they are great for long term storage also. Summer is coming to an end and I was able to pack up all the kids swim stuff and save alot of space compared to the back pack I normally use for them.

"Perfect for my sonMy son is 5 and this is a perfect budget tablet for him. I love that it comes with the silicone skin and it has a pre installed kid zone app. I actually really like the app and how customizable it is.The tablet works great, sync's fast with the wifi and stays connected. I have had no issues with it at all. I have not had an issue with the date and time re setting over and over like i have with previous budget tablets.It comes with the normal google stuff and it takes up a bit of space, but still enough room for a good amount of games , and it also can take a micro sd card to expend memory.The camera's are not the greatest but still good enough for my son to play around and take pictures, it keeps him entertained so thats all I am worried about.The picture is clear and bright, and the sound is perfect for him.Its a great deal for the price, I paid double this for 2 other tablets and one broke within the first week and the other just broke and its not even been a year yet.Overall a great tablet and I am glad I got it for review. *sample provided*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37NQ188FCHMJH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013ZIJ176#wasThisHelpful","R37NQ188FCHMJH","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have another set of an 18 pack that used to be only mine but i have passed them down to them and now these are my go to markers.I love that its a huge value pack and you get more then just the normal 8 colors its great to have some variety and different shades.

I could never sit around and read from the little screen but for those who dont mind it its a great thing.I really like the built in fm radio, picks up stations with ease.The thing that i dislike about this one is the games are not on it, now thats not a huge deal breaker but i liked that the other brand had snake on it and a few other games.It is easy to navigate and came with detailed instructions.Comes with headphones nothing special but they work .Also comes with charger works with basic charging ports but to get the best charge use your computer.Overall a great product and I am happy I got it for review. *sample provided*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31KNO4CYNZIVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOVDSBS#wasThisHelpful","R31KNO4CYNZIVF","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And the hat is just adorable with eyes nose and antennas.I gave this to my sister in law for her baby shower, my nephew should be here any day now and I can not wait to be able to see him in this, she was so excited and plans on getting his pictures done as soon as she can.Overall this is a great product and I am happy I got it for review. *sample provided*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6T064E0CJ22Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011QCJ5Y2#wasThisHelpful","R6T064E0CJ22Z","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very niceGot these for my mom and she loves them , previous to this she only had the one original band and at times she would loose it so i figured she needed some more, and now this way she has a variety of colors she can choose from.These are made good and she has had no issue with them, easy to fit the fit bit in and out of the opening and the metal clasp is nice and keeps the band on secure. The bonus fasteners are nice to have if its something you are wanting.I got her the small size since she has smaller wrists, I have larger wrists and can hardly get it on mine so i would say they are true to size.The colors are all nice and bold.Overall a great product and I am happy I got them for review. *sample provided*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FDU9YZJSBXDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UMXXLA6#wasThisHelpful","R3FDU9YZJSBXDL","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"AmazingThese picks are amazing and not only that they are beautiful, I just love the unique design of these each one is different and the really like the dragon symbol on them.I got them for my husband and he loves them. He is able to play around with them and get the perfect sound for everything he wants. Yes they are a bit thick but dont let that discourage you.3 different areas to pick from to give you a different tune, and 4 different types of picks, he really likes them all and after hours of use there is no wear at all on them.He loves how they feel in his hands and he is able to get a good grip, they just fly over the strings of his guitar flawlessly.I dont think he will ever go back to using cheap picks again. These are a great deal and well worth the price.Overall a great product and I am happy I was able to get them at a discounted price for review. *sample provided*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R8YCBR1OVCON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y3Q7YPG#wasThisHelpful","R3R8YCBR1OVCON","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Looks like its going to fly off the coverThe print on this one is so beautiful, the reds and yellow that make up the Phoenix just pop right off the case and makes it look almost 3D. With the whiteish grey moon just lingering in the back. Such nice bold colors. Pictures dont do it justice.No fading at all after washing. The beautiful print is on the front and the back is a solid black ,it is all made out of very soft fleece material.This is so soft, I love these fleece covers they are very thick and very well made, the stitching that is on it is perfect no loose threads, it has a hidden zipper on the side, blends well with the cover and it works good , no issue with it snagging at all.Like I said above because these are so thick they work perfect with the fluff and stuff for making your own pillows. A larger pillow insert fits in it great but the smaller one does not look all that good. Another great idea for pillows like these is stuff them with old towels you no longer use small blankets or clothing you can use about anything and get it stuffed to however your feel is prefect.Overall a great product and I am happy I got it at a discounted price for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KPNJFDF1TD2R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZIY32US#wasThisHelpful","R3KPNJFDF1TD2R","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good glovesThese are nice and they are made well.I dont always wear gloves when i wash dishes, but when I am washing my plastic containers I like to use bleach so I tend to wear some type of gloves so the bleach does not irritate my skin, and these gloves work perfect for preventing that.I have decent sized hands for a woman and these fit well, not too snug and and not to tight a perfect amount of room to still be comfortable not big and bulky like a lot of other gloves on the market.  The pink fingertips add a nice touch to the gloves, i can look stylish while cleaning lol.I am able to get a good grip when holding items and they dont slip out of my hands.They are reusable and dry fast.Overall a great product and I am happy I got them for review. *sample provided*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R316CLN2JBV89C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RMX0UEE#wasThisHelpful","R316CLN2JBV89C","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Husband loves itI have several of these and have gifted a few also and have to say out of all of them this is one of the best ones, i dont know if its because its built man tough or what but this model just seems to be built better and have stonger motor and the grinding stones are alot better.My husband is always making fun of mine and how girly they are but he loves using them, so this was a perfect item for him and now he has a manly one. I no longer have to worry about him using down all the heads on mine, he just has to worry about me wanting to use his.It is easy to charge and comes with an included charger. Holds a charge for a long time.Like I said this is made very well, not only that but it is also waterproof. Easy to turn on and has a safety switch, just push in the middle button and push the switch up.This one is a box set, you get the Callus remover that comes with 2 heads, and a cleaning brush, plus then you also get another 2 roller heads and a jar of foot cream which is a great bonus and an amazing product as is, its one of my husbands favorites and its great for putting on when you are done using the callus remover.Overall a great product and I am happy I got it for review. *sample provided*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HKC512AFFC2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013M4XWQO#wasThisHelpful","R2HKC512AFFC2T","A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IGLPZ7KWZD7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Although the container holds slightly over an ounce of product, it will go a long way because you use so little.I really feel like my face looks more alive and radiant.  Believe me, as an overworked mother and nurse, I need all the help I can get.  I will definitely purchase this product.Follow up:  After wearing this for under a week, I have received compliments.  Yesterday at work a woman asked me what I have been doing to my self.  Did I get my hair done?  Something is different.  I look younger, she said.  There is nothing else but this cream.

"This cute dog toy is shaped like a candy corn, and it's smiling!  It measures 5 inches tall and 3 inches wide.  It has the standard squeaky toy sound when pressed.  The fabric has the texture of wool.  The only bad thing about fabric like this is that is picks up hair.  When tossed, it kind of drops and spins around a little bit because of its shape.  My dog didn't care about it, but she's not a toy fan.  My cats batted it around and tore up the tag pretty quickly. I'm not finding any laundering instructions, but I gather the company doesn't expect this novelty item to last long enough to be washed.Overall it's a cute novelty dog toy.  I think a puppy would shred this thing in minutes, resulting in a mess and perhaps even a trip to the vet to remove the candy corn contents from the pups GI system.  If you have an older dog that like likes toys and is gentle with them, I'd say go for this item.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QKLMKGPQMMMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V07CHQW#wasThisHelpful","R2QKLMKGPQMMMO","A2YB7DLC3FOR7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YB7DLC3FOR7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nutro Company Lite Adult Dog food is made of chicken, brown rice, & oatmeal.  The high fiber content allows dogs to feel full after eating, which can contribute towards a healthier intake (less) and weight loss if your dog consumes less dog food.  Our dogs (we have 3) are not overweight because we exercise them on a regular diet, and none of them really care for dog food, especially in summer.  They eat this dog food, but aren't scarfing it down like they do with some other high end brands of dog food.  Of course, they prefer any kind of wet food or people food to any kind of dry food.  I would suspect an overweight dog has weight issues related to people food, too.  But just like people, dogs need exercise and balance with their diet.If your dog is overweight, this is a good choice of dog food for them to eat. The fiber makes them feel full and they don't eat as much.  My dogs are all eating it and they are pretty picky.  I recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTGLDWMGR2MTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQRL9T4#wasThisHelpful","RTGLDWMGR2MTJ","A2YB7DLC3FOR7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YB7DLC3FOR7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Suave Firm Control Sculpting Gel works pretty well to keep my short hair in place.  For days when I don't feel like blow drying my hair, I can just wash it, towel dry it, and put some gel into it wet.  This particular gel dries pretty stiff but can be combed out pretty easily, which softens my hair and gives it a bit of body while holding its shape.The gel is clear with little bubbles in it.  It smells floral, but the scent doesn't really stay in your hair.  Gel like this is similar to the old gel - Dippity Do.  Those of you raised in the 60's and 70's will remember that gel.  It can be applied to your damp hair, roll it, dry it, whatever, and your hair holds its shape better.Is Suave Professionals my favorite hair gel right now?

"The infant stim-mobile is marketed as a developmental mobile.  Unlike mobiles of days gone by, with nursery rhyme themes, music, and wind-up rotation that keep the images spinning and the music playing, this mobile is simply educational.  The images are simple, with a babys face, a butterfly,  circular spiral wheels, and a fish, for example.  The colors are basic black, red, orange, white, etc.  The mobile doesn't spin or play a tune to keep baby's attention; the pictures hold baby's attention.This mobile is recommended for babies newborn to about 5 months.  They can't see well or far during that time period, so they aren't enjoying the cute cartoon  characters anyway. They can't really focus on them visually.  This mobile, with its simple pictures and colors, are all a baby needs at that age to entertain themselves for a few minutes at time while laying in bed.The distance the picture discs are from baby can be adjusted over time, and when baby begins to push up on his hands and knees, the device needs to be removed from the crib or playpen.  It's done its job by then as now, baby can see better.  They are also past the mobile stage.I recommend this to any parent that isn't focused on the design on their baby's nursery, but wants a mobile to stimulate their newborns vision and brain.  I will miss the smiling lambs and elephants of mobiles gone by though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NFLZ6WC1W1PG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W89SX2S#wasThisHelpful","R2NFLZ6WC1W1PG","A2YB7DLC3FOR7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YB7DLC3FOR7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have 3 dogs and none of them will taste this dog food for me.  I can't say that I blame them; it doesn't look appetizing to me either.  Small, squarish, tanned brown pellets that are similar to bird pellets or feed probably aren't appealing to a dogs appetite.  While I as a human being appreciate the fact there is no artificial colors or dye in the dog food, the dogs probably needs some more color to it to make it seem more palatable to them.  Also, there's no real odor to it.  Just a bit of a grainy smell.  Also not what my dogs want.I guess the whole weight management theory comes into play because they won't eat it.  However, I am pretty sure overweight dogs aren't overweight because they scarf down too much dry dog food.

I simply applied gel to my wet hair and then tried to blow it straight - couldn't do it.  From the instant I put the lovely feeling & nicely scented cream into my hair, my hair became wavy.

"I like these puzzles pretty much.  As an American, I am occasionally unfamiliar with a reference as they are written by an Aussie for an Australian readership, but that is understandable.  I am an experienced cryptic crossword puzzler, who does not like the puzzles with extra complexities.  For me, these puzzles are about right in level of difficulty - I can solve about half of the puzzle pretty quickly and then have to work harder on the rest.  This is precisely the level of difficulty I like.  By way of comparison, these puzzles are comparable in both format and difficulty to the two that run in Games magazine every month.  (Am I the only person who buys the magazine just for the two cryptic crosswords?).My one quarrel with these is that the solutions do not provide explanations.  Most cryptics do, and they provide an insight into the author's thinking and his/her clue construction.  With MacCallum's puzzles here, I sometimes can figure out the right answer, but still do not understand the cryptic clue's relation to the correct answer.

"This book had been on my shelf for a while, among my other WWII and Holocaust volumes, and I just happened to pick it up immediately after finishing Lipstadt's book on her libel trial in England.  So, I understand the reviewers who observe that this book includes numerous references to her trial.  For me, that was part of the value of the book, and it makes a fascinating read after the other work.I have read several books previously about the Eichmann capture and trial, and at first, I wondered whether there was anything new to be said about it.  I now know that Lipstadt does have much to add to the scholarship about Eichmann, including an extensive, detailed, and nuanced analysis of Hannah Arendt's famous work on the case (despite the fact, as I learned from Lipstadt, that Arendt actually attended very little of Eichmann's trial!).  I consider myself pretty knowledgeable about these topics, but I learned many new things from Lipstadt . . . e.g. Simon Weisenthal is the source for the much repeated but completely untrue assertion that the Nazis killed 5 million non Jews in the extermination camps.Events such as the Eichmann trial benefit from being revisited from time to time as time goes by.  Lipstadt explains all of the effects that the Eichmann trial has had on subsequent history and on the historyof the Holocaust.  I think this is a really excellent piece of work and it makes me want to read more from Lipstadt.  She seems so reasonable and factual, while at the same time candid about her own emotions and biases.  I am curious about her statement that comparisons of the Nazis' treatment of Jews to Israel's treatment of Palestinians are absurd.  I disagree and would love to hear/read her explanation for this broad statement, which surprised me, coming from her, and does not seem supported by the facts in the Holy Land.That one open question, which, of course, is in many ways beyond the scope of this book, does not detract from this work.  It is a thorough explanation of the Eichmann trial, with astute observations about the court process and clashes between the judges and the prosecutor (as a trial lawyer, this really interested me, and I would have sided with the judges, but I appreciate how Lipstadt uses the passage of time to demonstrate that the prosecutor may have been wiser than he was given credit for at the time), and about the history of the history of the trial.

I found this book compelling due to (1) the subject matter - the blatant invention and perpetuation of lies about the Holocaust and other historic events; (2) the description of how the British legal system works in a civil defamation case; and (3) because I am a trial lawyer, the insight into how our courtroom judgments and tactics can seem incomprehensible to even the brightest of clients.Not the finest piece of non-fiction writing, but kept my attention and I read it in about a day.A question I am left with... Holocaust deniers, like David Irving (who is the subject of this book), seemingly greatly admire Hitler and also despise Jews and other non-Aryan types.  Given their antisemitism, why do they try to claim Hitler wasn't behind the Final Solution and/or that there was no Final Solution?  Why don't they embrace the final solution along with Hitler?  It doesn't make sense to me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NJH6DMMBNKSC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060593776#wasThisHelpful","R2NJH6DMMBNKSC","A2HZ3Z494VS1KG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HZ3Z494VS1KG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can only evaluate cat food on two basic criteria.  First, do the ingredients seem like they are healthy and good for my cat?  and Second, does my cat like and eat this food?On the first criterion, the ingredients seem to be fair for a cat, at least the turkey part.  On the other hand, cats are supposed to be carnivores, so the rice and cranberry components, while making for a nice Thanksgiving menu, do not seem particularly appropriate for felines.On the second criterion, taste, I must report that my elderly inactive male neutered cat does not like this food at all.  It has been sitting untouched in his food bowl for four days.  I purposely did not put any other food out for a while, and I knew he was hungry from his behavior, but he still would not eat this food.  So, with reluctance and apologies to the manufacturer, I must give this cat food a low rating.Two stars for the turkey component.

"I've always wondered about what went through Alexander Butterfield's mind when he became the person who revealed the existence of the taping system in Nixon's White House Oval Office and elsewhere.  This book provides answers, and is a fascinating and new angle on what took place back then from the beginning of Nixon's presidency through his resignation in 1974.I also had hungered for detail about how Butterfield came to tell the committee staff about the taping, and this book, i think for the first time, spells it out clearly.  Butterfield says he went into his interview with Congressional staff prepared to not volunteer anything, but to tell the truth if asked clearly and unambiguously.  Staff came very close to not asking the right question, and ultimately it was a Republican staffer, ironically, who phrased his inquiry in such a way (picking up on John Dean's offhand remark that he thought Nixon had behaved one day in the Oval Office as if there was a taping system in place) that Butterfield had no choice, having decided to be honest and truthful, but to tell what he knew.  Had the precise question not been posed, and/or had Butterfield been prepared to lie, the tapes may never have been revealed and the proof needed to remove Nixon from office may never have been acquired.  Amazing.Author Woodward got Butterfield to trust him enough to share personal recollections and a huge trove of documents which provide a very candid picture of the oddity that was Richard Nixon.  Butterfield's anecdotes provide detailed descriptions of Nixon's awkwardness and also his resentment of many who he thought had done him wrong, and/or who had been born into privilege.  The portrait of Nixon as a person in this book is fascinating.As is typical in books of this prominence, Woodward cites and thanks numerous people who edited and reviewed drafts.  Makes me wonder how so many awkward sentences got by.  There were numerous times in the text where I could not discern the person to whom a pronoun referred, for example.  Hard to imagine so many readers left so many  poorly constructed sentences in the final version.  Next time, call me, Bob!Another criticism is that the documents in the back are not indexed to the place in the text where they are discussed.  I enjoyed reading the documents, but didn't know that they were there as I read the text, and then, when I found the documents at the end, it was laborious to try to find where the discussion had been located.  How about some help for the reader?  Cross reference the pages, perhaps????  I also could not figure out why some, but not other, documents were included.  I would have liked to see the one where RN wrote to his wife, referring to himself in the third person, regarding his need for a larger bedside table.  No historical value to that memo I suppose, but another glimpse of Nixon as a human being.Because of the need for improvement in editing and the failure to cross index the documents to the text, I have deleted a star.  The content, however, justifies the remaining four stars.  As others have said, this is a very quick read that will hold your interest and amaze you if you are interested in the history of those times.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RHYJJQ3ATASG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501116444#wasThisHelpful","R2RHYJJQ3ATASG","A2HZ3Z494VS1KG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HZ3Z494VS1KG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I like that you put it on in the morning, under your makeup; I'm not so good about night time face rituals, but we all have to wash our faces in the morning, and it has been easy for me to dab some of this on every a.m., whether or not i am putting make up on.  So, the convenience of when it is advisable to use it (they recommend twice a day), works really well for me.

"This kettle has bells and whistles I never imagined.  It heats water very quickly, and tells you what the water temp is.  You set the target temp, so if you don't want the water to boil, you can adjust the target temp down.  When you pour some boiling water out, it shows you that the temperature temporarily drops, but then it works to reheat the remaining water back to boiling.  I just love it.  and it automatically turns off or you can set it to stay on and keep the water warm.  The cord wraps around the base (underneath), so you only have to expose the amount of cord you actually need and don't have an extra length of cord cluttering up the counter top.

"I picked up this book to add to my growing library of works on Israel and Palestine, and I am glad that I did, because it adds the voices of people on the street, and not just any street, to the mix of history and scholarly opinion found on my bookshelf.Nissenbaum follows the history of one unique street in the city of Jerusalem, a street that inadvertently and unintentionally became a demilitarized zone during the first years of the State of Israel, and then morphed back into a street after the Six Days' War in 1967, and has become a microcosm of the plight of the Palestinians at the hands of the Israeli government and radical Israelis since.I was in Jerusalem this summer and I personally observed many of the kinds of things Nissenbaum describes in the book, so I do not doubt any of its veracity.  The story of how the lines were originally drawn between Israel and Jordan was new to me, and fascinating.  And I particularly appreciated Nissenbaum's general approach of using oral histories, for they revealed the humanity, warts and all, that persists in surviving while the Israeli government continues to hope that somehow the Palestinians will just give up and go away.  (note to Netanyahu: ain't gonna happen!).The candor found in the oral histories, including all of the prejudices expressed and the cluelessness evident, is an important contribution to the literature on these issues.  And the stories of cross-cultural friendship give hope for the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29CX6N6DF5EFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250072948#wasThisHelpful","R29CX6N6DF5EFO","A2HZ3Z494VS1KG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HZ3Z494VS1KG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mixed feelings.I did learn a great deal from this work.  It gave a practical reason for inner city folks not knowing one another's last names (which I have found to be true).  It explained how jail is sometimes a safe haven, how braggadocio does not always equal reality, how the women who know men are wanted can and do use that knowledge as power, and how commonplace arrest and release are in some communities.I read the 2015 version which includes a last chapter on some of her methodology and the personal changes she experienced while living in the neighborhood.  I would have appreciated, however, an explanation of the moral code, if any, of an ethnographer.  Like other readers, it seemed to me that, if true, Goffman's activities included aided and abetting a variety of crimes at a minimum (& i am a retired career prosecutor, thus fairly confident in my ability to recognize a felony when I see one).  What do the rules of ethnology say about participating in crime in pursuit of one's study?My other criticism is editorial.  I understand that a wrap up paragraph in each section or chapter can be de riguer, but I found the obigatory summary paragraphs in this book to add nothing but length to the text.

"GoodGrips GreenSaver, where have you been all my life?  I am the queen of buying healthy in bulk, and then having the majority of my purchases of fresh fruits and vegetables go bad before they've been consumed.  So, this product is something I have needed for a long time, to keep my grapes crisp and edible and my greens fresh for salads. I think i'll get a second one, so that one can be designated for fruit - with the air holes open - and the other can be for veggies with the air holds closed.  The device uses a carbon filter which must be replaced every 90 days.  These kinds of requirements usually undo me, as I forget to make the replacements, and then I forget the interval involved, and then i forget what I am supposed to buy and where.  Fortunately, OXO must have had me and my kindred spirits in mind when they figured out we need reminders!  So, by signing up at greensaver.oxo.com, I will now get timely reminders via email when it is time to replace the filter!

"I think this is an important work of legal history.  I am a federal trial attorney who is very interested in the legal battles being waged in favor of Marriage Equality, so this book taught me a lot about what has gone on in lead up to the cases argued from my Circuit (the Sixth) in the Supreme Court just this week, on April 28, 2015.I was fascinated by all the detail about the maneuverings behind the scenes by various groups and entities who share the common goal of marriage equality; despite their agreement on what the prize should be, they have had many differences of opinion as to how to seek said prize, both in substance and in strategy and timing.  These same types of discussions and disagreements were part of the fabric of the legal efforts to seek equal rights for African Americans, from way before Brown v. Bd. of Education,  to way beyond.  I enjoyed learning about the ways in which various marriage equality constituents have agreed and disagreed, and about how Boies and Olson went ahead and did what they thought right (in bringing the case to challenge California's Prop. 8, in pretty much utter disregard of the carefully crafted, deliberately slow and methodical plan others had crafted and expected everyone to adhere to.I also LOVED the author's recognition that trials, governed by the Rules of Evidence, where witnesses are subjected to the greatest engine for truth yet developed -- cross-examination -- conducted ideally under the authority of a judge who requires responsive answers to proper questions are perhaps our only and best hope for finding fact.  I would guess that the author shares my frustration at every congressional hearing which purports to be fact-finding, where none of these rules apply.  In such hearings, the questions ramble, are filled with unproven allegations, no one requires witnesses to be responsive, and what results, though touted as fact-finding, is usually grandstanding, politicization, and a record filled with unprovable allegations masquerading as facts.  I so wish the the crucial issues of our time, Climate Change being the foremost, could be tried in a court of law in a similar way; the ridiculous unprovable allegations of deniers could be put to rest so that we might then unify in the need to act now to save our planet.  I can dream, can't I?That said, I don't know that this is a book for many lay readers, except those determined to master the legal nuances of the various approaches to winning Marriage Equality.  As a federal trial lawyer, I got so much out of this author's effort, and I commend him for recognizing the need for such a history and for writing it.I'm curious what the author thinks about Chief Justice Roberts' attempt to reduce the marriage question to one of simple gender discrimination?  I must admit, I am drawn to the simplicity of the position and the fact that it doesn't depend upon creating a new class based upon sexual orientation (not that I don't agree that sexual orientation should have elevated status for other situations).  I hope the CJ sticks with that view if it will allow him to join a majority ruling overturning CA6.  Read this book if you want to gain more nuance about the issues facing the Court.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PX05UFBFYL6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385348800#wasThisHelpful","R2PX05UFBFYL6R","A2HZ3Z494VS1KG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HZ3Z494VS1KG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read it, every page, every word, and at the end I wondered why I did, and more importantly, why the book was written and published.  I'm taking off the gloves that other reviewers have kept on, I guess, but I found this book to be a very long drawn out detailed account of the author's life to date, wherein she gained very little useful insight about any of the events in her life, despite stewing in them ineffectively for decades.  I wanted to shout out to her ""Just get some traditional therapy and anti-depressants for god's sake!"" and I still recommend both to her if she is continuing to wallow.  In her view, her dad could never atone for his past absence in her life, yet she failed to see him for the odd fellow he is = three hours a day breathing through a snorkel while not swimming?  She failed to see that his life long quest for the magic new age answer to all of his problems was completely and utterly ridiculous.  She in fact also bought in to every non-traditional self-help treatment that came her way, with very little success or reason to ignore time proven methodologies.  The book has no story arc, nor any resolution  In fact, when I read its last words (before the acknowledgements) I did not realize that it was the end.  The book just stopped (at the author's present age I guess) with absolutely nothing much changed from the first pages in terms of her ability to function in relationships.  It had way too much detail about just about everything, and taught me absolutely nothing except how clueless the author remains.  And, despite the fact that there was very little arc in the story, she ended without letting us know if dad got new teeth (here or in Germany), if dad's prostate cancer was cured by his unorthodox approach to it, or if Marya succumbed to brain cancer.All this book consisted of is a tedious chronology in micro-detail of a person seeking insight in a variety of ineffective ways without making much progress.  I consider the time I spent on this work a complete and utter waste of time.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QLWQ4069CEFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476748969#wasThisHelpful","R1QLWQ4069CEFA","A2HZ3Z494VS1KG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HZ3Z494VS1KG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"All I can say is ""incredible"" how bright it is. It makes my 6v sealed-beam lantern look dim by comparison. The sealed beam is also bulky and heavy while the LED light is easily carried in a pocket or clipped on your belt.I like the slide focus that allows a very narrow long beam or spread beam for closer lighting. The narrow beam is a bit strange because it's square (like the LED source itself). The charger is junk, which I'm going to upgrade... It would have been better to order the light and charger separately. Also, the light needs to cycle through all modes (dim, flashing, etc). between uses.

"This is very nicely made, with thicker materials and higher quality clear panels compared with the Classic brand cab I used on my prior machine, and it fits my HS928TAS very well. I've been using snow thrower cabs for more than 15 years and it makes a huge comfort difference by reducing wind-chill and keeping me drier. Of course, it also prevents getting a face full of blow-back snow when the wind is wrong.With the auger height of my 2014 Honda HS928TAS set in ""normal"" position, the inside height of this cab (off the ground) is 79.5"" at center, and 77"" at the sides.I originally rated this 4 stars because some of the pieces needed slight twisting to line them up together with the length bolts provided. But I have upgraded it to 5 stars because after using it I really appreciate the quality vs. other snow cabs.  This is not an easy install, nor difficult.  I would consider it moderate for a seasoned DIY type, or difficult for someone working alone who isn't handy with tools. It would help to have two people (to hold parts in place while fastening) but I was able to do it myself.  You should have a ViceGrip, metric socket set (10mm,11mm and 12mm sockets), adjustable wrench or 11 and 12mm spanners.  I also strongly recommend an electric driver for the sockets, to save a lot of time/effort.Edit -- BTW this is made to fit Hondas by Original Tractor Cab in Arlington, Indiana.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ARWEWP6W5JRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073W3D8E#wasThisHelpful","R3ARWEWP6W5JRN","A1AK3CPQK4ZCG5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AK3CPQK4ZCG5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update 3/11/15: Bought a second case because the original started to tear (the vinyl covering the metal clip started to separate). This new one is a different size, and too thick for an iPhone 6 with slim TPU case.  Not worth the money to return but going to order something different.Original Review: This fits an iPhone 6 with slim TPU case. It's a nice case sized right, but the belt clip slides up and pops off, and the loops are inconvenient.  I don't like any case that has these belt loops or clip style.  I tried using only the clip, but the phone worked its way off my belt twice in a week and landed on the ground. Fortunately not lost or damaged, so I switched to the loops.In order to use the loops its easier to wear it on the right side, because if you want to wear it on the left side it must be threaded through the belt after it goes through the first pants loop and before it goes through ALL the other pants loops. Inconvenient!There is a problem wearing it on the right side if you drive a left-hand-drive car, because it will be directly beneath the seatbelt buckle and the buckle will press on your iPhone 6 (possibly hard enough to break it or bend it).  If you wear it on your left side, the seat belt is up over the left shoulder and down behind the seat, and there is no buckle on the left to interfere.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK4WMZSMYXMEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NE4XDEE#wasThisHelpful","RK4WMZSMYXMEI","A1AK3CPQK4ZCG5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AK3CPQK4ZCG5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was purchased about 5 or 6 years ago to remove bottom paint from my boat. I have found it stands up well to the hard use that such a big job requires. The motor is powerful and smooth.  It's a bit heavy for overhead use and sometimes I find myself switching to the smaller palm sander due to weight and ease of handling with one hand, but that doesn't have this level of power. If you want to sling a big pad and use two-handed power to handle the big jobs -- weight's the compromise for the greater power. It's still controllable with one hand though, and much more compact and lighter than my grinder, but this is best used as a two-handed machine.Overall I can't think of a criticism. For this class of machine I find it well-designed and built.

"Not much to write about a replacement bulb: It works or it doesn't. It was as described, packaging was good, and it included a full wire harness (not needed in my case but nice that they included it). Shipment was prompt and packaging appropriate.Why 5 stars?

"This is the fifth book in the Pegasus series. I absolutely loved it!Emily is The Flame of Olympus. She thought she was an ordinary girl, but she is very special. She is a fantastic character, who has faced many challenges in the previous books and triumphed. I really like her. She is full of determination and spirit. However, she may be facing her hardest challenge yet! Can she survive?I have a soft spot for Emily and Pegasus, and when I heard that this book was due for release, I immediately pre-ordered it! This is a fantastic adventure, filled with danger and amazing twists and surprises. It was wonderful to meet all the previous characters like Pegasus, Joel, Paelen, Chrysaor and Chiron. However, there were new characters introduced: Fawn, a young girl who is a night dweller (where the myths of vampires come from), Lorin, a girl with her own piece of the flame and Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess.*Minor Spoiler!*After Emily helped defeat the Titans in the past (book 4), time reset and a new timeline was created. Lorin awakens from a deep sleep and finds herself trapped in Tartarus. And Emily makes another shocking discovery that changes her life once again.I started reading this book and read it in one sitting as I couldn't put it down! I found myself on an emotional roller coaster ride from beginning to end, as there are some very sad scenes that had me shedding a tear or two, but there is also a few witty scenes that had me smiling or laughing out loud. I love the imagery created by Kate O'Hearn, as it felt like I was actually there. I love the incorporation of several mythical creatures too, the descriptions of which were vivid enough for me to picture them quite easily. The action is intense and had me sitting on the edge of my seat. I felt sad when I reached the end because these characters have become my friends and I will miss them. I don't know if there is another book due in the series, or if this was the last one as it does not finish on a cliffhanger. But, if there is to be another book in the series, I'm on it like white on rice!Kate O'Hearn has created a world for Pegasus and the other Olympians that is completely believable. I love her writing style, which is very descriptive and the story flows beautifully. She is now one of my favourite YA authors. I have another one of her books from another series sitting on my Kindle, and I hope to get to read it soon.I highly recommend this book (and series) to children of 11+ and to adults alike (who love reading YA), as this is one of the most exciting stories I have read in a long time. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37E5O6J83GIF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1444922386#wasThisHelpful","R37E5O6J83GIF5","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was recommended this book from Audible due to my browsing/reading history. I read the synopsis and decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did because I loved it!I downloaded this as an audiobook after listening to the audio sample. I loved the narrator, David Rintoul. He brought the story and characters to life with his clear and precise reading.Thomas Fool is a wonderful character. He is an ""Information Man"", a policeman to you and me, who investigates things when the denizens of Hell cause chaos or misbehave. I really liked this person. I don't know what he did in his previous life to end up in Hell, but I got the impression that he was a good man. Perhaps he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. When a denizen is found murdered in a very brutal way, Thomas and his fellow Information Men are sent to investigate and quickly find themselves facing a dangerous adversary.Though I am not a huge lover of horror, I love detective stories. I started to listen to the story with no idea of what to expect. What I got was an unexpected journey through the eyes of the main protagonist, Thomas Fool. Hell is not a pleasant place to be in this book, and the demons are not exactly puppy dogs either. I love the descriptive quality of the horror in this book, though it can be pretty graphic and a little shocking. Some readers may find it too gruesome. Then again, my imagination can be a little too quick to paint vivid pictures and some may find that it may not be graphic enough for them. As only a moderate reader of horror, this story definitely shocked me (in a good way). I was quickly hooked and sat entranced as the story unfolded. It was a pleasure to see Thomas Fool's character grow throughout the story. He has to make some hard decisions in the course of his investigation. I wasn't so keen on his superior, Elderflower, though I only met him a few times. He reminds me too much of a government official, which I suppose he was to some degree. The Angels' Adam and Balthazar are interesting characters in their own way too.The story has several twists and turns that kept me guessing for quite some time. I am a huge fan of detective novels, and this story has several red herrings and distractions cleverly placed so that when the culprit is revealed, the reader is surprised. There is another surprise near the end that I never saw coming but, after thinking about it, it made perfect sense. I felt sad when I reached the end of the book because Fool has become a friend and I will miss him. I wonder if he will be investigating anymore incidents in Hell in the future? I sure hope so.Simon Kurt Unsworth has written a fantastic debut novel. I love his writing style, which starts slow but quickly picks up speed. I also love the flow of the story, the scenes flowed seamlessly from one to another. This author has found a fan in me and I would definitely consider reading more books written by him in the future.Due to the use of graphic horror and gore, as well as the use of foul language, I do not recommend this book to younger readers and to those who have a nervous disposition. I do, however, highly recommend this book if you love horror, suspense and detective stories. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YS97P3QN4JME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PI0OZ5S#wasThisHelpful","R2YS97P3QN4JME","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a complimentary copy of this book from the author in return for an honest review.This is a touching and heartwarming story. I loved it!I am not one for reading many true life stories, but when the author contacted me about reading this book, I decided to try it. I am glad I did. Unfortunately, due to my rather large reading list, it has taken me quite a while to get to read it, for which I am truly sorry.This story took me on an emotional roller coaster ride. I am a highly emotional person when it comes to animals anyway. I have had my share of pets over the years (four dogs, one feral (turned tame) cat, a rabbit and a hamster. Oh, and some gupies - fish) and, although I currently don't have any at the moment, I would love to have either another dog or cat. Unfortunately, it is not possible at this time as I cannot afford to have one.Nevertheless, I fell in love with Leaf, who has a fantastic character. This dog has not had an easy life up until the Anderson's adopt him, and reading about their experiences with him made me laugh and cry. Gaining the trust of an abused or wild animal is one of the most rewarding experiences a person can have. The affection and love they share is more precious because it takes bravery to trust after being hurt. Leaf is one of those dogs that you wish you had found at the pound. However, not many people would have been brave to take on Leaf with all his issues. The Anderson's are that brave. This story is a mix of heartwarming and touching events, together with some very sad ones. However, it is mostly a story of hope, love and happiness. Animals are a gift; I believe they have souls and when they give their trust and love, we should grasp it and hold on to it for dear life.Allen Anderson has written a deeply touching story that captured my heart. I loved the photographs that were sprinkled throughout. They gave the story a visual insight into Leaf's character. I did feel that the story, although well written, to be a little slow paced for my taste. However, I am used to reading fiction, which is embellished to include fast paced action. A slower pace is sometimes good for the soul. I would definitely consider reading more books written by him in the future.I highly recommend this book if you love true life stories, memoirs or stories about dogs/animals. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TEF6OVQBIDU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0762781653#wasThisHelpful","R2TEF6OVQBIDU3","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the fifth book in the Eye Of The Storm Series. I loved it!Lydia is a fantastic character. I have really liked her from the start. She is a strong and stubborn woman, but she has not had it easy being a storm-wielder, mated to three sexy werewolves. After the battle with the Tridents, she is now grieving the death of her best friend, Brendon, and her father. However, there is more challenges to come. Will she manage to keep her family together, or will Selena get her revenge?I have been eagerly awaiting the release of this book for months (almost a year)! I started reading this story and couldn't put it down. In fact, I read this in one sitting! The story continues from the end of the fourth book and is again told from various points of view. I have missed these wolves a lot!I am still a little speechless about this book. It completely blew me away! In this book we get to see a little of Gladys's past. She has been a mysterious woman for most of the series, so being able to see her history in the manner of flashbacks or dreams brought her more to life. Her story is not a particularly nice one. I really felt for her as she dealt with some really nightmarish and hair-raising events and made me understand her a little more. However, it's the shocking revelations that are revealed later in the book that completely left me breathless. Now I'm worried what this will mean for the quartet in the near future.Selena is not my most favourite of characters, but even I felt for her as she had to make a most difficult choice. Again, I wonder what the future holds for her.I love how the relationship between the four: Lydia, Lawrence, Ryan and Taylor has grown even more.Lawrence is not one to show his vulnerability much, as he hides behind a wall he erected to protect himself. However, it touched me deeply that he would drop his defenses to show his vulnerability to Lydia. He has come a long way since his arrogant facade in book one. I don't normally include quotes in my reviews, but I love what Lydia says to Lawrence, ""They never got you, don't you know that? You irritating, charming, stubborn, evolved, intolerable, sweet, complex, caring, melodramatic bastard with your heart of gold. They never got you. You're wholly you, and you're perfect."", and it's true.Ryan and Taylor. What can I say? I love these two men as individuals, but as they become closer, I love them as a couple; they made me envious. I love the scene in the van. It made my knees go weak, it was that hot! The bedroom scene is just as sensual. I love the way the author has written those scenes, as it shows the love these characters have for each other. I haven't read many m/m stories, but those I have read pale in comparison.The story has several twists and turns, not to mention shocking revelations, and is masterfully told. The sensual heat factor in the story is hot enough to start a fire, and the ending has left me wanting more! I cannot wait to read the next book as soon as possible!Dianna Hardy is one of my favorite authors. I love her writing style, which is fast paced and fluid. Reading her books are a joy, and I will continue to read them for as long as she keeps writing them.Due to the explicit sensual content and some bad language, I do not recommend this book for younger readers. However, I highly recommend this book (and series) if you love HOT erotic paranormal romances with sexy werewolves. Please note there is m/f and m/m action in this book, as well as violence, and may offend some readers. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AR3XYZBYNKP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0164VASP0#wasThisHelpful","R2AR3XYZBYNKP1","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a complimentary copy from the author in return for an honest review.This is the fourth book in The Master of Whitehall Saga. I loved it!Charlotte Ann Erikson is a fantastic character. I liked her very much. We were first introduced to her in the first book, The Master of Whitehall. This is her story and follows her journey from being a young daughter of a sea faring merchant in 1625, to one of the most enchanting but deadly immortals still alive today. I really liked getting to know her better, and enjoyed watching her growth as a character worthy of respect.Having read the other three books in the series, I was excited when the author contacted me and asked if I would be interested in reading this one. I jumped at the chance and was not disappointed.I was quickly pulled into the story and was swept away into the past. The author has done a lot of research into the history of not only countries, specifically the European continent and the United Kingdom and lastly America, but the important events within those countries through the centuries. His descriptions brought the past to life, as well as certain characters. I loved meeting Ferdinand, Charlotte Anns future mate, though his history is a bit of a mystery even to this day. He seems to be warm and loving though, so I hope his story will be told one day. I also loved meeting Jemison. He may be a mortal, but he (along with his family) plays an important role in Charlotte Anns life. Immortals seem to have no concept of time, unless certain events or people they meet interact with their normal day to day existence. Jemisons character definitely makes an impact on Charlotte Anns life and gives her a reference point for time. Another character that makes an impression on her life is James Dubois (The Master of Whitehall, book one in the saga). He becomes her child, lover and friend. However, her heart still belongs to her mate and one true love, Ferdinand.This book is told through the eyes of Charlotte Ann and it took me on a roller coaster ride of emotion. I found myself empathising with Charlotte Ann as she dealt with the terrible loss of a parent. It is not easy to lose someone you love. I also felt her happiness in finding Ferdinand and the sadness at their parting. I also was a little envious of her for finding a wonderful companion and friend in James. But I was totally ecstatic when a surprise visitor makes a return. Charlotte Ann has lived a long and sometimes turbulent life, and I have thoroughly enjoyed taking a journey through history and her memories of them with her. I hope that she will have many more years to make new memories in the future.Rick Veal has written an intriguing series of love, loss, friendship and emotional growth that will take the reader on a roller coaster ride of emotion. His characters are lifelike and likable. His writing style has improved a lot and is faster paced than ever before. The flow of the story is wonderful, and this kept me turning the pages. I do not know if there will be any more books in this series, but even if there are not, I would definitely read more of this authors work in the future.There are some scenes of a sensual nature that are a little on the hot side (although not as explicit as some books I have read), so I do not recommend this book for younger readers. I do, however, recommend this book (and series) if you love paranormal romances with sexy vampires or immortal beings. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TF1QWVIGH6GE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015Y2R1UA#wasThisHelpful","R2TF1QWVIGH6GE","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a complimentary copy of this book from the author in return for an honest review.This is the third book in the Seven Forbidden Arts series. I loved it!Lann Dran is a complex character. I liked this man very much. He can come across as cool and aloof at times but, this hides his deeply felt emotions. He knows that if he lets his emotions out, his ability to control air could cause serious damage. He entered a contract with Katherine White, never expecting to see her again after thirty days, but when she comes to him with some unexpected news, he finds himself having to protect her from a dangerous foe.Katherine White is a wonderful character. I liked her very much but felt that she wasn't given enough rein by the author to fully explore her strengths. She came across as strong willed, but seemed to submit too easily to Lann's authority. I don't know if this is a good thing or not. Maybe it has something to do with their contract/relationship in book two.Having previously read 'The Astronomer' which was written by this author, I was pleased when she contacted me, asking if I would like to read this one. I quickly took her up on her offer. However, I think it would have been better for me to read the series from the beginning, rather than from just book 3. This is because there are references made to events that happened to the characters in book one and two which completely went over my head. There are also conversations between characters that seem to be continued from earlier too. But, this is only the small gripe I have.Once I got over the confusion, I was quickly pulled in and I didn't put the book down until I had finished it. There are many paranormal romances out there that touch on the elements of fire, air, water and earth, but this series seems to be unique. The author has created a world where wielding an element is forbidden. If found out, dire consequences follow. The characters come alive on the page and I found myself on a roller coaster ride of emotion, especially when Katherine finds herself in a very difficult situation. I really felt for both protagonists as they came to terms with something that could potentially break their spirits, if not take their lives.There are also a couple of interesting characters introduced. I didn't like the creepy Adam; he made my skin crawl. However, I did feel sorry for Nicholas and the way Adam treated him (as if he was a bug under his shoe). Joss and Clelia return in the book and, although I haven't read their story, their love is palpable. Speaking of palpable, the heat generated by Lann and Kat is definitely hot. There are explicit scenes in this book that had me wanting to grab a cold drink to cool off! Talk about scorching! There is also a lot of danger and intrigue mixed in to make this one series I am looking forward to continuing. However, don't make my mistake. Read the first two books in the series before starting this one.Charmaine Pauls has written an entertaining standalone erotic romance. Her characters are lifelike and come alive on the page. I love her fast paced writing style and the flow is wonderful. I would definitely consider reading more of her books in the future.Due to the explicit nature of some of the scenes, as well as use of foul language, I do not recommend this book to readers under the age of 18. I do, however, recommend this book if you love science fiction, erotica, erotic romance or paranormal romance genres.

"This is a fantastic tale. I loved it!Abbie is a wonderful character. At first, Abbies abrasive behaviour rubbed me the wrong way and I didn't like her very much. However, as the story unfolded and I began to understand that she used verbal slights as a way of protecting herself  a thorny disposition to hide her true self. After being kicked out by her mother at seventeen, a pregnant Abbie finds herself living in a trailer park. When her mother dies fifteen years later, Abbie finds herself facing memories she would rather forget, but desperate to claim the locker her father left for her before his death.Having previously read 'The Jewel Box', when I heard that this book was being released, I quickly bought a copy. I started the book and didn't put it down until I had finished it. I found myself quickly caught up in the story and intrigued with the various characters introduced. Though I didn't care for Julienne (she's a stuck up, money grubbing piece of work in my opinion), I fell in love with most of the other characters. I think my favourite, outside of Violet, Geoff and Bryan, is Kevin. He is Violet's son, who has slight brain damage and, though he's in his twenties, has the mental capacity of a thirteen year old. He has a unique ability to make me laugh with his enthusiasm and joy of life.This is a very touching story of loss, sadness, joy and happiness. Although I have never lived in a trailer park, the sense of community within the pages of this book made me feel very envious. Violet is the matriarch and glue which holds it all together. I must admit that I have always had a close relationship with both my parents, so reading about Abbie's lack of one with her mother made me feel quite sad. But, she finds a mother figure in Violet and it made me glad. As you can tell, this book took me on a roller coaster ride of emotion from beginning to end. There is a lot of sarcasm and wit from not only Abbie, but from Geoff too. Their verbal sparing made it difficult to understand if they hated each other or not, but their mutual respect shone through near the end. There are some twists and turns that kept me wondering, but there is one huge surprise that had me shedding tears. I'm not saying whether they were tears of joy or sadness, because you'll just have to read the book for yourself to find out. I must admit that I did a little fist pump when a character got their comeuppance and is outed. I reached the end of the story and had a bittersweet reaction. I was sad that the story had ended, but happy that all issues had been resolved.C. Michelle McCarty is an author with a talent for writing a captivating story. I love her descriptive writing style, which brought the characters to life. Though it is not as fast paced as other books I have read, the pacing makes it easier to get to know the characters better. The story flows wonderfully from scene to scene. I look forward to reading more of this author's books in the future.I highly recommend this book if you love contemporary fiction. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QRTHI1KSGIOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013MNAS3A#wasThisHelpful","R1QRTHI1KSGIOB","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first book in the Shadow Kissed series. I loved it!Kaye Brand is a fascinating character. I liked her a lot, though at first she didn't enamor herself to me. She comes across as a bitter and sarcastic drunk, but as I got to know her better, I grew to like her, though I wanted to slap her on occasion for the way she treated Jack. She has not had an easy childhood and this affects her behavior and attitude. She is a fire mage, and wielder of shadows. Selling her talent to the highest bidder in order to survive, she finds herself facing a past she would rather forget when she meets Jack Bastian, a man who is meant to be her enemy.Jack Bastian is a wonderful character. He may be an angel, but he has his own share of secrets. I enjoyed getting to know this warrior better. He can be a little arrogant at times, but this is part of his charm. When he hires Kaye to help him, he knows he could get burnt, but there's something about her that draws him to her.This is one of the books I have been wanting to read for some time. When it was first released, I added it to my wish list and bought a copy as soon as I could. Unfortunately, due to my rather large reading list, it has taken me a while to get to read it. I feel rather bad about the delay, because as soon as I started reading, I didn't put it down until I finished it.I must admit that when I first started to read this book, I felt like I was reading from a book in the middle of a series rather than the beginning of one. This turns out to be partially correct. There is a series prior to this one called ""Shadow Series"" which, although I haven't read them, has many of the other characters in them. However, when I first bought this book, I didn't realise it at the time. So when I began reading this book, I had a feeling I was missing something. Some of the characters, especially those like Jack and Adam Thorne, have a history and their interactions gave me the impression that they were continuing a conversation they were having from previous visits. This is not a bad thing, though it did make me curious as to how the two met. Nevertheless, this story hooked my attention from the first page and didn't let me go until the last.The story is told from both Kaye's and Jack's points of view, which I liked. This gives the reader an insight into both their thoughts and feelings.There are several twists and turns in this story too; just when I thought I knew where the story was going, something would occur that completely threw me. I was expecting a romance story, but it is so much more than that. There is an undeniable spark between the two main characters and their chemistry is hot! They compliment each other quite well; perhaps it is good that Jack is ice to Kaye's fire, because they could definitely set something on fire with the amount of heat they generate! However, it is the intrigue and danger of Kaye's mission regarding her former fiance, Ferrol Grey, that sent shivers down my back. I took an instant dislike to this man. It may be a little unfair of me to hate him instantly, but I have never liked what I call ""snake charmer salesmen"". You know the type of person - so smooth and charming, though undeniably evil, it turns your stomach - that you shudder at the thought of them? Well, that was my reaction to Ferrol. I love the way the story took me on an amazing roller coaster ride of emotion, so when I reached the end I felt quite sad; I felt I was leaving some new friends. Though this story doesn't end in a cliffhanger, I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series as soon as I can.Erin Kellison has written a fantastic paranormal romance. I love her fast paced writing style and the flow was wonderful. She has created a fascinating, believable world where fae and angels live amongst humans, though hidden by spells and enchantments for the most part. Her characters come alive on the page and I could picture the scenes in the book quite clearly. I would definitely consider reading more of this author's work in the future.Due to the heat level, I do not recommend this book to younger readers. However, I highly recommend this book if you love older YA or erotic paranormal romances. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GKSRRMIDT5EB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006YBREOO#wasThisHelpful","R2GKSRRMIDT5EB","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first book in the Lux series. I loved it!Katy is a normal, everyday teen, who also happens to be an avid reader, book blogger and reviewer. She is full of angst after moving to West Virginia with her mother after the death of her father. I liked her a lot, though her (sometimes) bitchy inner monologue, as well as her constant swooning over Daemon grated on me at times. After meeting Daemon, her new next door neighbour, things begin to get interesting.I bought this book (in paperback format) from http://Amazon.com way back in 2013 (though there seems to be no record of it in my account now?), as I had heard good things about it. Unfortunately, due to my rather large reading list, I have only recently been able to read it.I began to read and was quickly hooked; I managed to read this book in one sitting. The story is told from Katy's point of view (in first person). This gives the reader the opportunity to watch things unfold from Katy's perspective. I really liked this, but often wondered what Daemon was thinking or feeling. However, reading between the lines, I got an impression of Daemon's character. He can be a total arrogant jerk, but he can also be a caring person. I must admit that I felt like slapping him a time or two myself, but I also realised why he was acting the way he was - he was protecting not only himself but his family too.In a way, this story reminded me of my favourite YA TV programme as a teen, Roswell, which was also based on a series of books. You have a gorgeous guy, who happens to be an alien, and a teenage girl who lands herself into trouble. Throw in a lonely sister and you have a recipe for an exciting YA adventure/romance. Speaking of Dee, I liked her a lot more than Daemon. She is enthusiastic and bubbly, nothing like her sterner twin. The story is a little predictable if you have read a lot of similar YA stories *cough* Twilight *cough*, but if you are new to this genre, this has to be one of the best books to begin with. There are several twists and turns that kept me riveted from beginning to end, and the ending left me wanting to keep reading. I am hoping to read the next book in the series as soon as I can. Hopefully, it won't be another two or three years; it's sitting on my bookshelf, staring at me, so I had better get a move on and read it!Jennifer Armentrout has written a fantastic YA romance. I love her fast paced writing style. The dialogue is sharp and snappy, though some of the characters are not as well developed as they could have been. However, the flow is wonderful and scenes flowed seamlessly from one into another. I would definitely consider adding this author onto my favourite authors list, and I will be reading more of her books in the future.I highly recommend this book to teens aged 14+, and to adults who love reading books in the YA genre. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VMOSBSPB2XRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620610078#wasThisHelpful","R1VMOSBSPB2XRS","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review 6*This is the third book (and concluding story?) of the Legends Saga. I absolutely LOVED it!Ireland Crane is twenty four years old and a relation of Ichabod Crane of Sleepy Hollow fame. I liked this stubborn, witty woman very much. She is still struggling with having the spirit of the Horseman inhabiting her body and coming to terms with the loss of her friend and mentor, Rip Van Winkle. Now on a mission with the father of time travel, H.G. Wells, Ireland will have to face her deepest fear, letting the Hessian take control in order to break the curse.I have been eagerly awaiting the release of this story. As soon as it was downloaded onto my Kindle, I dived right in and didn't put it down until I had finished it.I have fallen in love with all the characters. The story is told through various view points, but mostly though Ireland's, Preen's and Noah's eyes. We are introduced to several new characters, of which Peyton, a nun and descendant of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Malachi, who has secrets of his own and Preen, a young and powerful Wiccan living during the time of Salem Witch Trials are but a few.The story has action and adventure, death and murder, but there is also romance and tragedy. The characters' are very lifelike and the heroine is full of wit and sarcasm, which I like. There are several twists and turns that surprised me in places, and one huge scene near the end that completely had me in tears. I ended up cursing the author's name and crying 'I hate you!' at the emotions she managed to pull out of me. It has amazed me at how quickly these characters have burrowed under my skin. This motley crew of characters have become my friends. Therefore, I highly recommend you keep a tissue handy! I did have an unanswered question with regards to Preen, but I will not say what it is for fear of giving unintentional spoilers.I reached the end of the book with great sadness as I wanted the tale to keep going. However, all good things must come to an end and I can honestly say that Ireland's journey has touched me deeply. She is most definitely a legend in my eyes and I will never forget her.Stacey Rourke has written a fantastic dark fantasy, which is slightly darker than her YA Gryphon series. I absolutely love her writing style, which is fast paced and witty, and the story flows wonderfully. I was worried that the scenes between past and present would make it seem jumpy and disconnected, but I'm glad to say that it didn't. This author has the amazing ability to draw you into a story, make you love the characters and then rip your heart out and leave a bleeding mess where it once resided but leave you begging for more; I hate this about her, but I also love her for it too! I am a huge fan of this author and will read anything she writes in the future.Although this is not really a YA story, I highly recommend this book to teens aged 15+ and adults who love dark fantasy. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RATUDIPGF9X91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0158S7DM6#wasThisHelpful","RATUDIPGF9X91","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was gifted a complimentary copy of this book from the author in return for an honest review.Jet and Falcon are identical twins. However, they both have slightly different temperaments and outlooks on life. I liked them both, but struggled to connect to them. They were somewhat one dimensional and didn't come across as believable as I would have liked.This is a very difficult review to write, as this is my first DNF (did not finish) book ever since I began writing reviews. Having previously read one of the author's other books, Millie Reinvented, I had been looking forward to reading this one. However, I found myself disappointed. The characters were wooden, the dialogue clunky and the slow flow had me wanting to pull my hair out. I managed to get through 51% of the book (where nothing much had even happened) before calling it a night. I was getting headaches from the author's essay type writing style; I prefer that the characters tell the story but, the author wrote it as if she was narrating it. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but I found this to be a little off putting. This affected the flow in my opinion and gave it a rather jerky feel. Other readers may have a different opinion, so I will leave it to you to decide for yourselves. The author does use wonderful descriptive prose, which helped me picture the scenes quite clearly. However, I have decided that this book was just not my cup of tea.Elodie Parkes has written a story that could have been a lot better if she had changed the story into either first or third person narrative, rather than second person. However, although I wasn't very enamoured with this book, I would consider reading her other books in the future.As I did not finish this book, I cannot say whether or not there were any explicit scenes in it. However, as I have read one of her other books that did contain some, I do not recommend this book to younger readers. I do recommend this book if you love steamy contemporary romances. - Lynn Worton","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WBUT5BXCRSTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RBJXOI#wasThisHelpful","R1WBUT5BXCRSTI","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novella is an excellent addition to the Eternal Guardians Series. I loved it!Aristokles (Ari to his friends) is a fascinating character. He was briefly introduced to the reader in Twisted and came across as a thrill seeker, although dangerous and a little unstable. I was glad to get the opportunity to get to know him better. He has faked his death and is living outside of Argolean society, so that he can attack Zeus's Sirens with no interference. When he meets Daphne, sparks fly.Daphne is a wonderful character. She is a nymph and a Siren-in-training. I really liked her. She is feisty, stubborn and determined. She is sent on an assignment by Zeus, but can she complete it without losing her heart?When I heard that this novella was available, I quickly bought my copy as I have fallen in love with this series. You could call this Eternal Guardians 7.5, but it is a stand-alone story in it's own right, with a slight sidestep from the original story arc. However, this story brought a new twist to the tale. I fell in love with these characters, even Sappheire, who replaced Skyla as Athena's second-in-command of the Sirens. She came across as being jealous of Skyla in Enraptured, and was quite witchy (substitute the w for a b) at times. However, in this story, she is more accessible and likable. I also liked meeting Silas, a Misos, who is Ari's friend. He has a sense of humour and it made me grin.This story is full of twists and turns, and to say that it's only a novella, it was just as detailed as if it was a full blown novel. There are several shocking twists that caught me unawares and one big one that I never saw coming and it left me in tears. I do hope that the situation gets resolved in the next book of the series, because I felt like I had been hit with a tidal wave of disbelief and grief. How dare the author do that to me! Grrrr! *Smile*As I have previously said in my other reviews about this series, I love the world building. It has a wonderful mixture of fantasy combined with myth and reality. The characters' are extremely lifelike and they feel like my friends. The story ends on another cliffhanger and I can't wait to read/listen to the next book as soon as possible.Elisabeth Naughton has written an exciting paranormal romance series. I love her fast paced writing style and the flow is wonderful. She has definitely found a fan in me!Due to scenes of a sexual nature that are on the explicit side, I do not recommend this book for younger readers. However, I highly recommend this book if you love erotic paranormal romances with sexy heroes and strong female characters. Although this book can be read as a stand-alone, I do recommend you read the other books in the series first before reading this one. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZP5GFCDI7P4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZXFSFK#wasThisHelpful","R1ZP5GFCDI7P4L","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the seventh book in the Eternal Guardians series. I loved it!I downloaded this as an audiobook, as I had previously enjoyed listening to the first six books in the series in audiobook too.Twisted is again narrated by Elizabeth Wiley. She does another fantastic job in telling the story. Her narration is crystal clear and her interpretation of the characters brought them to life, she has given each character their own tone and inflection of voice, which I liked.Nick is an enigmatic character, so I was excited to get to know him better. He is the leader of the half breed Misos, half Argolean/half humans, who live together in a colony for safety against the Daemons of Atalanta. He also happens to be the brother of Demetrius, one of the other Guardians, and the son of Kronos.Cynna is a remarkable character. I wasn't sure what to make of her at first. However, I knew there was more to her than first met the eye when she was introduced near the end of book six. This is one tough lady! She has basically volunteered to live in Hell, under the command of Zagreus as a slave. But she is also full of secrets. However, I did feel that Cynna wallowed too much in self-pity at times, which drove me crazy.The story continues from the end of book six and it quickly swept me up. This is another fast paced, action packed story that had me sitting on the edge of my seat! The story takes the reader through a roller coaster ride of emotion from beginning to end and is told through various points of view, which I really liked. This story is focused mainly on Nick and Cynna, though the story arc opens up even further and surprising revelations are made.The reader also gets to see a little more of Hades's son, Zagreus. He may be a twisted and perverted character, but I have a feeling he's not completely ""evil"" and doesn't take after his father, thank goodness. Although he hides it under his perversions and doesn't wear it on his sleeve, I think Zagreus has a huge heart, dark though it may be. I wonder if he will be the subject of the next book?Nick and Cynna have their own demons to deal with; they both have a lot of baggage, but they are more than capable of carrying their burdens. I love their chemistry, which fairly sizzled on the page. They make a wonderful couple and compliment each other's strengths and weaknesses.As I have previously said in my other reviews about this series, I love the world building. It has a wonderful mixture of fantasy combined with myth and reality. The characters' are extremely lifelike and they feel like my friends (apart from Hades - he's still a pompous ass in my opinion). The story ends on another cliffhanger and I can't wait to read/listen to the next book as soon as possible.Elisabeth Naughton has written an exciting paranormal romance series.

"This is a chilling short story. I loved it!Cambria is a babysitter, looking after a little girl called Missy while her parents are out. When she catches her charge making grotesque faces, Cambria realises that something is not right.This is an atmospheric short story that sent chills down my spine. I am not a huge fan of horror, but having previously read this author's debut horror story and enjoying it, I knew that I would be in for a ride. However, even I was surprised at how easily I was drawn into this tale. It is extremely easy to picture the scenes as they unfolded due to the descriptive prose. I felt empathy with Cambria as her sanity was called into question. Was the house haunted? Or is it just a wild imagination that leads to an unravelling mind? I don't know the answer to those questions, but this story sure captured my imagination and I was very grateful that I read this during my lunch half hour and not at night. I would have had nightmares otherwise!I would have liked the story to be a little bit longer, but I'm not sure if the intensity would have been kept if it were. That being said, I am looking forward to reading more of this author's work in the future.Angela Yuriko Smith has written an intriguing short horror story.

"I received a gifted complimentary copy of this book in audio format from the author in return for an honest review.This is an intriguing romantic mystery short story set in historical London. I really enjoyed it!The audio book is narrated by Marcus Hyde, who had previously narrated another one of this author's books, ""See No Evil, My Pretty Lady"", which I also loved. I love his narration, which is clear and precise. He brought all of the characters to life and gave them their own tone of voice and personality. I would definitely listen to this gentleman's voice in other audio books in the future.Penelope is a wonderful character. She is a housekeeper in Lord Wellington's household. She receives a letter, which sets her into an assignation with a mysterious stranger.This book is only one and a half hours long, but it is a very entertaining story to listen to. I was quickly thrown into the danger and the action, but felt a little lost at first, as there was not a lot of context in the beginning. It was only as the story unfolded that the mystery reason for the first letter, which saw Penelope and the stranger first meet, began to make sense. What puzzled me was: Why would Penelope meet someone she didn't know in an ill-reputed street without at least a chaperon, especially in the historical setting? It just wasn't done in those days, as far as I know. And, how did she and they mysterious stranger end up being assaulted to begin with? That not withstanding, the short story was a fantastic romantic mystery full of twists and turns. The mysterious stranger only known as ""Soldier"" is an intriguing character. His mystique remains through most of the story and is only revealed close to the end. I must admit that his identity was a complete surprise! There is romance, intrigue and espionage in this fast paced tale. I reached the end of the story and heaved a happy sigh. I love a good romantic mystery and this story is one.Miss Mae has written a wonderful mystery. I love her writing style, which is fast paced and exciting, and the flow is wonderful. I am a huge fan of mystery novels, and one of my favourite authors in this genre is Agatha Christie. However, Miss Mae is an author that I will be keeping an eye on in the future.I highly recommend this book to young readers who love mystery and suspense, and to adults who love a classic who-dun-it's and are looking for a quick, but highly entertaining read. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30P03H4W1HDZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1479314307#wasThisHelpful","R30P03H4W1HDZ3","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third book in The Night Watchmen Series. I loved it!Faye Middleton is a wonderful character, although I didn't like her very much when I first met her in Everlasting. She is a teenager who has had some major angst in her life. She has faced the culling and found out that she not only does she have affinity to both witch and hunter powers, she is the only one able to handle the Dagger of Retribution. Now older and wiser after her run in with Clara, Faye finds herself facing an even bigger challenge: dealing with Evangeline Gramm and fighting a war she's not sure she'll survive.The story is again told through Faye's point of view. It is an emotional roller coaster ride from beginning to end. There are some new characters introduced into the story and they each bring their own personalities and problems, from werewolves to vampires. Evangeline Gramm did what she thought was right in order to protect her boys, but I'm not sure if she did the right thing or not, as she left them with some deeply scarred emotional baggage, especially Jaxen. However, it was the introduction of the other rebels where things begin to get interesting. I loved getting to meet Chrissa. She is a wonderful character, with an innocence that made me want to hug her; she is very sweet. It was also nice to meet Weldon, Jaxen, Gavin, Jezzi and Cassie again. Faye's friend Katie also returns, but she is now emotionally scarred from being held captive and tortured in Ethryeal City.There is excitement, danger and adventure aplenty in this book, with lots of twists and turns and more than a few surprises. The relationship between Faye and Jaxen moves on to a new level and their intimacy is sensual without being too explicit. The end of the story has a surprising twist and, although it doesn't end in a cliffhanger, it does give the reader the feeling that there are some unfinished loose ends that require tying up. I do hope that there is another book, because I would love to see if Clara and Bael get their comeuppance!Candace Knoebel has written a fantastic continuation in this YA paranormal romance series. I loved her writing style, which is fast paced and it flowed wonderfully. I haven't read her other series, Born In Flames Trilogy yet, but having read this book, I will definitely be doing so at the earliest opportunity!I highly recommend this book if you love YA paranormal romances. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GBA70PYT1EGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGRCMMU#wasThisHelpful","R1GBA70PYT1EGE","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Book Review of Quantum Level Zero by Ted GroschWinston Churchill stated that history is written by the victors. Germany terrorized Britain's civilian population with V1 and V2 rockets. The Nazi historians would have a legitimate rational for that had they won the war. Quantum Level Zero takes place in a dystopian society of the near future Earth, where fanatics are about to win the war on terror for the good for the people and the good of society.Their leader, Matteen Al-Rama has outgrown his fanatical roots. Once an ambassador and secretary General of the United Nations, he now leads a fundamentalist revolution that uses cloud computing, holographic CGI recruitment rallies, computer worms, rootkits and Trojans, advanced communications, and cybernetic enhancements to spread apocalyptic chaos across the globe. If that weren't enough, rumor of an alien race wanting to begin diplomatic relations with Earth threatens to solidify Al-Rama's global stranglehold.Quantum Level Zero follows three people at the pivot point in the war on terror, one who has knowledge, one who has great need, and one who has the courage to make a difference. Elijah Baraki is a scientist and former official of Al-Rama's revolution. Eight years ago he lost his wife and three children in a suicide bombing meant to show the world that nobody leaves Al-Rama's organization. Since that bombing, Eli has concentrated on research and radial technology with the intention to wage war on the revolutionaries. In a world where reasonable people become dissidents, Eli is joined by two-hundred other scientists, engineers and soldiers, all of whom have their own reasons to leave their former lives and battle the growing chaos.Trevor Hadley sabotaged his own laboratory to prevent the authorities from confiscating his zero-point energy research. Now wanted as a terrorist, Trevor has been working on Eli's secret project for the past few years as a lab assistant. Eli sends him to reconnoiter an Al-Rama outpost and is almost killed. He teams up with his brother, Eli's former boss, and Sharon Murphy, a former army helicopter pilot also on the run, in a race to report back to Eli and join the fight to free Earth.Forces of reason have the edge in the war, but will that remain the case if First Contact goes to the revolutionaries? Quantum Level Zero opens as the world awaits the arrival of Al-Rama's latest ally, an advanced alien race offering anti-gravity, zero-point energy, and faster-than-light travel. Al-Rama won't be satisfied with anything less than world domination. Eli won't be satisfied with anything less than total destruction of Al-Rama's empire.Review 5*I love reading science fiction, so when I was recommended this book, I decided to try it. I loved it!Elijah Baraki is a likable character. He is extremely driven and determined. He is a scientist on a mission. After his family's death at the hands of a terrorist, Eli finds himself distrustful of the current leader and, wanting to get as far away from his influence, gathers together other like minded individuals. But it's not as easy as he first thought.Trevor Hadley is also a likable character. I must admit I liked this character more than any of the others. He too finds himself on a mission after blowing up his own research lab to stop it falling into the wrong hands. Working with Eli is a challenge, but what he stumbles upon could spell disaster of epic proportions for the whole world.This is a fantastic science fiction novel that captured me from the first page. It took me on a roller coaster ride of emotion from beginning to end. The story is told from various points of view, mainly Eli's, Trevor's and Sharon's. I am very technically minded but, unfortunately, some of the more technical aspects of the story flew over my head. I never did anything more than high school physics, and trying to understand the more challenging aspects of quantum mechanics written about in this book gave me a slight headache. Nevertheless, the storyline gripped me and didn't let me go. The world building is shockingly believable and sent a shudder through me at the thought of our society (in the not so distant future) being slowly and systematically won over by a charming and charismatic personage like Al-Rama. There are a lot of other characters in this book that I haven't mentioned. However, I really liked getting to know most of them (apart from the bad guys, of course). They all come alive on the page and bring the story to life. They all have interesting, if complicated, lives.This story is also full of action, adventure and danger that had my heart pounding and my adrenaline pumping! The author delves into some really chilling subjects, such as fanaticism and belief which can be manipulated to create terrorism. There is a saying, ""One man's soldier is another man's terrorist"", depending on which side of the fence you stand on. This is how cults and other religious groups can become radicalized and terrorism grown in my opinion. Politics also plays it's part and those disenchanted with governments or organisations can also spawn extremism and terrorism. The author has woven these real life issues into a future dystopian backdrop, but it could easily be written in today's world. The scenes are well written and some of them can be a little upsetting in their descriptions. The moon scene with Trevor is a little violent and made me shudder with revulsion at what was happening within the moon base. I must admit that I did enjoy the scene where the spaceship Eli designed and built suddenly disappears. It certainly left a lot of people scratching their heads, including me! I will leave it to you to find out what happened to it. *evil grin*There are several twists and turns, and a couple of surprises that completely caught me unawares. I reached the end of the book and found myself with a book hangover. I love books that do that, but it also frustrates me at the same time; when a book just won't leave you alone even after several hours or days afterwards, then you know it was a good book. And this one certainly was good.Ted Grosch has written a fast paced debut science fiction thriller. I love his writing style, which is fast paced but not rushed. The flow of the story was wonderful too. I was worried that the alternating view points would cause the book to be jumpy, but it didn't affect it at all. I would definitely read more of his books in the future.Due to the technical jargon and the violence in this book, I do not recommend this book to younger readers under 16. I do, however, highly recommend this book if you love science fiction, dystopian or thriller genres. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EW3KGNXVCDWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H4L1EKS#wasThisHelpful","R3EW3KGNXVCDWX","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I won a copy of this book in a competition a while ago. Due to my large reading list, I wasn't able to read it until recently. I loved it!Ally Giordano is a wonderful character. I admit that she comes across as a little straight laced and severe at times. It's like she has a rod placed down her spine and is unwilling to bend a little in case she has fun. In a way, I can understand her wanting to control things around her when things are unraveling into chaos. Meeting the charming Sam Carson throws a spanner in the works and sparks fly.Sam Carson is most definitely a charming rogue. I fell a little in love with him myself. He has an easygoing manner that I liked, along with a wonderfully warm heart. Meeting an elderly lady in distress, he takes it upon himself to rescue her, but her stuffy granddaughter is another matter altogether. He realises that, just maybe, she's a worthy risk to his heart.This is a sweet contemporary romance that completely charmed me. The story combined two of my favourite genres - historical and contemporary romance. It took me on a roller coaster ride of emotion. I started to read it and didn't put it down until I had finished it.I fell in love with Ally's grandmother. She may be a little confused about which era she is living in, but she is still sharp as a tack when it comes to the important things - mainly her granddaughter and her happiness. The story is told in such a way that I felt I was actually there. I could picture all the scenes clearly and I fell in love with all of the characters. The story is told mostly through the eyes of Sam and Ally, but Mateo (the coach driver) and Ally's grandmother also have something to share. I loved the soccer scene, though I'm not a fan of the sport myself. The game can be brutal and the author didn't pull any punches with the description. I also loved the scene where Sam reads the historical romance novel that started the whole debacle. His reaction to it made me giggle. There are some incredibly touching moments in this book and I found myself shedding a tear or two, as well as laugh out loud moments; I'm glad I was at home alone and not out embarrassing myself with my sniggers. The chemistry between Sam and Ally is palpable and it is fun watching them bicker and banter. I also love how Sam persisted in breaking down Ally's walls and making her see that a little fun doesn't hurt once and a while. There are some scenes of a sensual nature that are not as explicit as some of the books I have read in the past, but are a little on the hot side. I reached the end of the book and felt sad. Not because it had a sad ending (it doesn't), but because the book had finished. I wanted the story to keep going!Diana Holquist has written a charmingly sweet contemporary romance. I love her fast paced writing style and the flow was wonderful. Her characters come alive on the page. I have never read any of this author's books before, but I would most definitely read them now. She's found a fan in me.Due to scenes of a sensual nature, I do not recommend this book to younger readers. However, I highly recommend this book to readers over the age of 15 who love contemporary romances with a little heat. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R311NV01LNJ5WA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FOSATZO#wasThisHelpful","R311NV01LNJ5WA","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the sixth book in the Eternal Guardians series. I loved it!I downloaded this as an audiobook, as I had previously enjoyed listening to the first five books in the series in audiobook too.Bound is again narrated by Elizabeth Wiley. She does another fantastic job in telling the story. Her narration is crystal clear and her interpretation of the characters brought them to life, she has given each character their own tone and inflection of voice, which I liked.Titus is one of the more intriguing of the Guardians. I liked him very much. His gift sets him apart from his Guardian brothers and they rely on it to gain an upper hand against their enemies. He has the ability to read any mind without touching someone. Which also comes in handy as he has been cursed by a witch and cannot touch anyone without being overcome with the emotional overload and unbearable pain. But when he meets the mysterious Natasa, he is shocked and surprised to discover that he can't read her thoughts or feel her emotions when he touches her.Natasa is a wonderful character. I liked her very much too. She first appeared in Enslaved, looking for Malea and I was intrigued by her appearance. Now on a mission to locate a Titan called Prometheus, she crosses the path of Titus and sparks fly.This series seems to be getting better as it goes along; I am completely hooked! The story continues from the end of the fifth book.**** MINOR SPOILER ****Now that Atalanta is dead, the Guardians have been busy decimating the ranks of her daemons. They have also stopped searching for the rest of the elements that go into the Orb of Kronos to guard the Misos taking refuge in Argolea after the battle at the island colony from the Council. However, things are about to hot up and, as the temperature rises, will Titus and Natasa find happiness, or will the Fates pull them apart?This is another fast paced, action packed story that had me sitting on the edge of my seat! The story takes the reader through a roller coaster ride of emotion from beginning to end and is told through various points of view, which I really liked. Not only do we meet all of the Guardians and all the other characters from the previous books, we get to see a little more of Hades's son, Zagreus. He may be a twisted and perverted character, but I have a feeling he's not completely ""evil"". I wonder if he will get his own book next? The story arc is now opening up more and there are several shocking revelations that threw me for a loop. There is one character that has been in the majority of the stories, but up until now I haven't mentioned her. She is Lachesis, and has been guiding (although the Guardians would say meddling) in the affairs of the Guardians for a purpose only known to her. She is the Fate that shapes destiny. I wonder what web she is spinning now?Titus and Natasa's chemistry is sizzling on the page, and virtually melted my iPad app for Audible! I love their chemistry. They make a wonderful couple and compliment each other's strengths and weaknesses. Hera's curse doesn't seem to be working this time, but when disaster strikes and things go pear-shaped, I was left totally devastated. I didn't expect that twist in the tale! I just hope that the issue can be resolved soon. It makes me wonder if Hera planned this all along, or if it's their fate to suffer even more than normal. I guess I shall have to wait and see.As I have previously said in my reviews about this series, I love the world building. It has a wonderful mixture of fantasy combined with myth and reality. The characters' are extremely lifelike and they feel like my friends (apart from Hades - he's still a pompous ass in my opinion). The story ends on another cliffhanger and I can't wait to read/listen to Twisted as soon as possible.Elisabeth Naughton has written an exciting paranormal romance series. I love her fast paced writing style and the flow is wonderful. She has definitely found a fan in me!Due to scenes of a sexual nature that are on the explicit side, I do not recommend this book for younger readers. However, I highly recommend this book if you love erotic paranormal romances with sexy heroes and strong female characters. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R247JTR58DQYKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C00I95G#wasThisHelpful","R247JTR58DQYKG","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in The Grenshall Manor Chronicles. I LOVED IT!Jennifer Winter is a wonderful character. I liked her very much when I first met her in Oblivion Storm. However, she was a bit of an enigma and I wanted to get to know her better. This story offers me that chance. She is a very driven person, with her own demons from her past. Severely injured in a fight against a dangerous foe from book one, she is now on the road to recovery. However, that challenge is nothing compared to the one she's about to face.This is a fantastic continuation of the Grenshall Manor Chronicles. The story follows on from the first book, but rather than continuing to follow Mary, this story follows Jennifer Winter. She has amazing abilities and strength, but even that may not be able to stop a criminal mastermind hell bent on locating certain items to enable him to control the supernatural realm and beyond. Told mostly through the eyes of Jennifer, although Mary and Kara have their view points too, this story takes the reader on exciting rollercoaster ride of action, adventure, danger and fantasy. I was quickly hooked and found myself sitting on the edge of my seat as the intensity and intrigue increased. This story is full of twists and turns. Just when you think you've got the story sussed, along comes another twist to throw a spanner in the works! I must admit, however, that this story just didn't seem to gel as well as the first book. Maybe because it was more of a personal journey for Jennifer as she discovers where her powers come from, rather than an all out battle against good and evil, although there was plenty of that. I enjoyed getting to know Jennifer better through her backstory, but felt that the ""evil"" characters introduced were not as well utilized as they could have been in the present. The Grey Lady is a dangerous assassin, but doesn't see much action until near the end. Manta is a megalomaniac, determined to rule over the supernatural world; I felt he didn't feature as prominently as I thought he should. However, there is one character I didn't expect to meet, considering I thought them dead. Their appearance was a complete surprise and sent a shiver down my spine! I'll leave it to you to find out whom I am talking about.I loved the introduction of another character called Christobal Sergides. He too, like Mary, is a guardian of a dark portal, but in France. He is a charming but lonely man. What his role will be in the next book of the series has me intrigued. I reached the end of the book with mixed emotions - happy about the outcome, but sad that it had finished. Where book one dealt with death, this book focuses on life, specifically nature/earth power. I am intrigued about what book three will offer. I can't wait to find out!R.A. Smith has written a fantastic, fast paced and action packed sequel to his debut paranormal/urban fantasy. I love his fast paced writing style and the flow was wonderful! I had never heard of R.A. Smith before, until a friend of mine mentioned him. But now that I have, I look forward to reading more books written by him in the future. He has found a fan in me!Although this book is not aimed at the Young Adult age group as such, I think that this book would appeal to readers aged 16 upwards who love dark urban fantasy. I also highly recommend this book to adults who love horror, paranormal or dark urban fantasy genres. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RODOOTXRYGGVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZX7CTW#wasThisHelpful","RODOOTXRYGGVQ","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the first book in an intriguing trilogy. I really enjoyed it.Gabriel Emerson is an intriguing character. Although I did like him, I did think he tended to be a moody jerk at times. He is a well respected professor, but he has dark secrets hidden in his past.Julia Mitchell is a likable character; I liked her a lot. She is a graduate student enrolled in Professor Emerson's class. When she catches the attention of Gabriel, sparks fly.I have been wanting to read this book for a long time. In fact, it had been sitting on my wish list ever since it was released back in 2012. I received this book as a Christmas present in 2013 and have only now had a chance to get to read it due to my rather large reading list.I started to read this book and couldn't put it down! However, saying that, this book also disappointed me. I liked all the characters, especially Paul, but the story itself was rather drawn out and long winded at times. The story alternates from various points of view, mostly Gabriel's and Julia's, but Paul and a few other characters' also have a say. This story is a smoldering seduction, but it never blazed hotter than a spark (in my opinion) until near the very end. The attraction the two main characters have for each other is palpable, but there is the pesky issue of the teacher/student taboo which tempers it. However, I got the distinct impression that Julia was not completely innocent in the seduction stakes, and when a secret is revealed later on in the book, this confirmed it for me. I was looking forward to watching their relationship bloom and get spicy, but this has got to be one of the tamest erotica romances I have read in a long time! I was expecting something kinky like BDSM or some other fetish that Gabriel was hiding in his past, but his dark secret was nothing like that at all and made me wonder how he managed to remain employed! I'll leave it to you to find out what his secret is. There does seem to have been a lot of research done on renaissance art by the author. I love it when an author shares their passion for a subject with the readers through the characters. This gives the reader an insight into an author's soul and personality. I reached the end of the book and sighed; not a bad sigh, but a satisfied one. Although this book does not end on a cliffhanger, it is left open for the second book in the trilogy to take over.Perhaps it gets spicier as the trilogy goes on, but this book turned out to be a bit of a damp squib in my opinion. Other readers may disagree with me, so I would hope that if you do decide to give this book a try, you make up your own mind. As for me, I am not not sure if I will read the remaining books, but I am keeping my options open.Sylvain Reynard has written a wonderful contemporary romance. I loved her writing style which, although fast paced, seemed to be a little long winded at times. I also loved the flow, which carried me smoothly through the tale. I would definitely read more of her books in the future.Due to a scene of an explicit nature, I do not recommend this book to younger readers (under 17). However, I recommend this book if you love contemporary romances. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OIJJZASBETGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=042526596X#wasThisHelpful","R3OIJJZASBETGO","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an intriguing YA Horror story. I loved it!Peter Wharton is a wonderful character. I loved him as soon as he was introduced. He is a half-werewolf. ""How can he be a half-werewolf?"" I hear you cry. Well, for that answer you will just have to read the book to find out for yourself. He has a wicked sense of humour that just screams ""practical joker"", but he has a more serious side which I loved too. He is a bit of a rebel, but he has a strong sense of duty and loyalty to his family.Lucy Beaumont is a wonderful character too. I liked this feisty young woman. She is a very powerful witch and is also Peter's only friend and confidant that knows who and what he is. She also happens to have a girlfriend. When several murders of supernaturals begin to threaten to expose their world to the humans, Peter and Lucy find themselves on a race against time to find and stop the murderer.Jewel Hudson is a difficult character to describe. She is likable enough I suppose, but I felt there was many layers to this young woman that were not fully explored within the story. She does seem to have a sensible head on her shoulders, but I felt that she was way out of her depth within this storyline. She is an ordinary human teenager (or is she?) thrown into a dangerous world of murder and supernatural beings.I had the great honour of being one of the first people to read this book in it's raw form whilst editing it. This review is my own honest opinion and I have not received remuneration for it.I fell in love with most of the characters and laughed and cried as the story unfolded. I found myself on occasion reading it instead of editing, so had to go back over it at times. However, what struck me about this book was how well developed most of the characters were. They came alive on the page. The story is told through various characters' points of view, which made this book most intriguing as the reader gets to see their thoughts and feelings. I liked meeting Dante (a vampire policeman/investigator) and Scott (a wizard) too. They are like chalk and cheese, but when they team up with Peter, Lucy and Jewel they make a formidable team. However, I felt that Jewel's character (who is meant to be the lead character in the book) is over shadowed by Peter and Lucy. They are such strongly written characters that they (I felt), rather than Jewel, should have been the leads. I mean no disrespect to the author when I say this. I felt a little envious of Peter and Lucy's friendship. They are fun to be around and the love and respect they have for each other touched me deeply. They have been best friends for years and have a tight bond that has seen them through some rough times. I wish I had them as my friends!This is a dark tale of murder and mayhem, not to mention horror, that had me completely riveted. There are a whole array of supernatural beings in this story, from vampires to werewolves, witches and even zombies and a ghost! The mystery, suspense and uncertainty of who the murderer was kept me hooked, as well as their motivation for the gruesome deaths. I must admit feeling completely surprised at finding out who the culprit/mastermind was. I certainly didn't see that twist coming! However, I couldn't make up my mind whether this person was evil, or completely insane! I did think that the rationalization the killer used for the murders fell a bit flat and not entirely believable. But, then again, if they are insane, it doesn't matter if their motives are believable to anyone but themselves. Right?I loved the descriptions of certain scenes and giggled or laughed at quite a few, but there are some decidedly chilling and creepy ones that had the hairs standing up on my arms and a chill running down my back. The chase in the library was especially terrifying! I also found myself shedding more than a few tears during one shocking scene as my heart broke, and I cursed at the author for doing that to me. I had to put the book down long enough to mop up my tears whilst shouting ""NO! WHY!!"" up at the ceiling.This story took me on a roller coaster ride of emotion from beginning to end. Speaking of which, this book does end in a cliffhanger, but this just made me want to read the next book as soon as possible.Please note: This book is written in British English, so some terms and spellings may confuse American readers.Lee Ferrier has written a fantastic debut YA horror story. I love his fast paced writing style and the flow was wonderful. This is an author who is not afraid to tread into dark places and kill off characters. In this respect he is similar George R.R. Martin (so I have heard, as I haven't read his books yet). This is one British author whose career I will follow with interest and would definitely read more books written by him in the future.There is a lot of violence (fighting and/or bloodshed) and, on occasion, gore that may upset sensitive readers. There is also mention of sex (M/F and F/F), though implied and not explicitly shown). Therefore, I do not recommend this book to those who would be upset by this. However, I highly recommend this book to teens aged 15/16 upwards and those adults who love dark young adult supernatural/paranormal horror novels. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37JNCE4SEVGHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0108GGLW6#wasThisHelpful","R37JNCE4SEVGHT","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a complimentary copy of this book from the author in return for an honest review.This is the second book in the Josh Anvil Series. I loved it!Josh Anvil is a fantastic character. I liked him very much. He is a smart and curious fourteen year old. Unfortunately, he doesn't see himself the same way. He has low self-esteem, which is caused by his dyslexia and being bullied at school. However, he is an excellent story teller and basketball player, has a vivid imagination and incredible powers thanks to the aliens that saved him after an accident in the swamp where he lives. (Read book 1 to find out how that happens). But he's about to embark on a journey full of danger and adventure. Can he save his planet from a vengeful alien?I have been wanting to read this book for some time (ever since I read the first book in the series, Josh Anvil and the Cypress Door, way back in 2013). Unfortunately, due to my long reading list, I have only now been able to get to read it. I must admit, it was worth the wait!This story continues on from the end of the first book and I was quickly drawn back into the tale. *Minor Spoiler Alert!!* Josh and his best friend Troy are sucked through a portal and find themselves on an alien planet or five. Here, they find themselves facing several challenges and making new friends, as well as enemies. This story is just as fast paced and exciting as the first book. There are several twists and turns, and a few surprises that kept me hooked from beginning to end. The descriptions of the planets visited and the characters on them are vivid enough for me to picture them with ease. I also liked meeting Kodi, Lonnie, Libby, Jana, Axel, Sadie and Marty, who are humanoid aliens from the different worlds that Josh and Troy visit, plus a few others that bring this story to life. There is also a surprising familial reunion in a twist I didn't see coming. I found myself in tears on more than one occasion, and in shock at the end of one scene. I couldn't believe that what I had read was true, so had to re-read that part. Once it sunk in, I felt like bawling like a baby! Luckily, I managed to control my sobs long enough to keep reading. I liked reading the scene where Josh learns how to fly an alien spacecraft. It made me giggle! In fact, there are several scenes of comic relief, courtesy of Josh's friend Troy. He has a laid-back attitude that belies that he takes things seriously, but he does have a serious side which I admired. He is also incredibly brave and faces several dangers that most fifteen year old boys would never dream of with grace and good humour. This book took me on a roller coaster ride of emotion. When I reached the end of the book I felt sad, but this was only because I wanted to keep reading! I am now looking forward to continuing this series by reading the third book, Josh Anvil and the Gathering Storm, as soon as possible.Bruce Arrington has written an exciting fantasy adventure. I love his fast paced writing style and the flow is wonderful. I would definitely read more of his books in the future.I highly recommend this book to young readers aged 10-18, but I also recommend this book to adults who love to read YA fantasy books filled with action, adventure, danger and aliens. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRXWD74EZAAJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CZC09PM#wasThisHelpful","RRXWD74EZAAJP","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not a huge fan of horror, but having read another book by this author (Chain Reaction: Phenom League), I couldn't wait to read this book. This is an intriguing horror. I loved it!Gerald (Gerry) Forstner is a fascinating character. I did like him, but felt his character was not as fleshed out as he could have been. He is a police detective, leading a task force charged with catching serial killers. He and his K-9 partner, Hargrave are thrown into a cat and mouse game that has roots in an old Norse religion. As the body count rises and old religious practices come to life, will he be able to figure out what the killer's next move will be in time? Can he catch the killer before more victims are found?This book is split into four sections. Each section was released separately, similar to a serial. I bought this as the whole collection and I am glad I did, because it would have driven me crazy to finish one section without having the next one to start straight away!This book caught and held my attention from the first page. It is not easy to describe this book without giving any spoilers, but I was quickly pulled into the story and found myself intrigued by the way it unfolded. There seems to have been a lot of research done on Norse mythology, but the author has added a supernatural twist to it, which made me sit back and think, ""This may be entirely possible!"". I loved this aspect of the story. However, I did think that some of the characters could have been a little more fleshed out. I was intrigued with Freyja/Sula. I would have loved to know a little more about this woman warrior. She had a rather brutal experience to become what she was, but I would have liked to know more about her before she became a Valkyrie. Though she only appears a few times throughout the story, the impact she had on me, as well as Gerry, was profound.Gerry's ex-wife Brenda, however, really ticked me off. I would imagine that it's hard being married to a cop, but it bugged me that she would be so bitchy/spiteful to Gerry with regards to their son. I know that good marriages can sour, but using a child to emotionally blackmail an ex is disgusting in my opinion and hurts not only the affected ex spouse but the child too.This book took me on an emotional roller coaster ride from beginning to end. There are several scenes of violence and, in some cases, gore. The mystery surrounding the killer and the connection to an Icelandic cult over one thousand years before kept me riveted. There are several twists and turns that I didn't see coming and a few red herrings scattered through the story that had me constantly guessing. Some of the violence is a little shocking and could disturb some readers. I did find that because this book is in four sections, some of the continuity and pace was affected. However, I think that could be easily fixed by having it re-edited as one book and give it a bit of a polish to smooth the rough edges. I reached the end of the book and felt a little sad, because I wanted to keep reading! I hope that the author is working on book two, because I would love to read it as soon as possible!T.C. Archer has written an intriguing story that is part horror and part crime thriller. I love this author's (or should I say authors' as there are two of them writing as one?) fast paced writing style and, although the flow and continuity was a little off at times, I enjoyed that too. I look forward to reading more of their books in the future.Due to the violence and the mention of sexual abuse (alluded to and not explicitly shown), I do not recommend this book to younger readers or those of a sensitive nature. I do, however, highly recommend this book if you love horror or crime thriller genres with a supernatural or paranormal twist. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30OG9RZ9YR4O4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y375VUU#wasThisHelpful","R30OG9RZ9YR4O4","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I won a complimentary copy of this book from the author in a competition.This is an extremely hot historical romance. I loved it!Lady Riana Ellis is a wonderful character. I really liked this feisty, determined woman. She is basically a slave, forced into prostitution by the Duchess of Arundel in order to protect her younger sister from the attentions of the Duke. When Sir Bryant Cullen enters the room instead of the expected knight, all of her secret plans go up in smoke. Can this knight save her and her sister?Sir Bryant Cullen is also a wonderful character. I liked this knight very much. He is an honourable man, though he can be ruthless when needed. When he finds Lady Riana in his bed, he can't believe his luck.I was extremely excited when I found out I had won this book. Having read two other historical romance books by this author, I knew I would be in for a roller coaster ride of action, adventure, danger and romance. I was right, because when I started to read this book, I was quickly hooked and didn't put it down until I had finished it. This book is told through both Lady Riana's and Sir Bryant's points of view. I love this, because it allows the reader to get to see their thoughts and feelings.But, one thing I was not expecting was the sheer heat that this book has! The author did put a warning in the book for me and I quote, ""This one is hot. Keep something cold nearby to drink when you read this book."". The chemistry between Lady Riana and Sir Bryant is sizzling! Their passion is so hot, I'm surprised the pages didn't burst into flame! There is also one scene that contains anal action, so if you are offended by this, this book may not be for you, but it's done in such a way that it feels natural. This is definitely one of the hottest, erotic historical romances I have read so far this year.I also love the historical aspects of the story. Set in the Scottish Highlands in 1338, this book takes a reader back to a time where England is still at war with Scotland and knights roamed the land. The vivid descriptions of the scenery and clothing, as well as the characters, brought the story to life. The Duke and Duchess of Arundel are perverse in their sexual predilections; the Duke is a pedophile and the Duchess is a voyeur. In a way, they deserve each other. I did like the older knight, Sir Neas Dunbar. He is a canny warrior and a kind man. This book is also full of action and danger. There are sword fights and attempted assassinations, which kept my heart rate high. There is also one scene with a prison warden that made me shudder and left me feeling a little uncomfortable. However, this did not ruin my enjoyment of the story. I reached the end of the book and was saddened, I wanted to keep reading!Tarah Scott has written a wonderful historical erotic romance novel. I love her fast paced writing style and the flow is absolutely wonderful. I have another one of her books, not a historical romance but a paranormal one, sitting on my ""want to read"" list. I need to read that book soon! I am a huge fan of this author and look forward to reading more of her books as soon as possible.Due to sexual scenes that are a little on the explicit side, I do not recommend this book to readers under the age of 16. I do, however, highly recommend this book if you love historical romances with sexy men and stubborn/strong females. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12B5ENVJXN2T8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692322094#wasThisHelpful","R12B5ENVJXN2T8","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a complimentary copy from the author in return for an honest review.This is a wonderfully sweet romance. I enjoyed it.Millie is a likable character. She works in the human resource department of a large advertising agency. She is married to Peter, but only realises that their marriage is not as it should be when a co-worker kisses her under the mistletoe at the Christmas office party.August is also a likable character. He is attracted to Millie. When he kisses her under the mistletoe at the office party, he realises that the attraction he feels for her could lead to love. However, there's a tiny complication - she's married.This story is told through various points of view, though mostly through Millie and August's eyes. I loved the plot to this story, although I don't condone adultery. Being in an unhappy relationship is not very nice, and finding someone new who likes or loves you can make all the difference to the way you feel.Unfortunately, I struggled to connect with the characters in this story. They were very likable, as I said above, but felt they were a little two dimensional. I would have loved to had a bit more depth to them. I also struggled with the almost essay type writing style the author uses to tell her story Rather than allowing the characters to tell the story, it was as if the author was narrating it. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but I found this to be a little off putting. This affected the flow in my opinion and gave it a rather jerky feel. Other readers may have a different opinion, so I will leave it to you to decide for yourselves. The author does use wonderful descriptive prose when describing the kisses (as well as other romantic moments) Millie and August share. The romance is sweet and the seduction builds into heated scenes that definitely scorch the page. If you love happy endings, then this book will satisfy you, as it did me.Elodie Parkes has written a steamy contemporary romance. Her writing style is fast paced, but the flow is not as smooth as it could have been. Even so, I look forward to reading more books by this author.I do not recommend this book to younger readers due to the explicit sexual scenes. However, I do recommend this book if you love steamy contemporary romance. - Lynn Worton","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OUZU7H15IEQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008H5IF7U#wasThisHelpful","R2OUZU7H15IEQJ","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fascinating YA Action/Adventure. I really enjoyed it!Ella Stone is a wonderful character. She is thirteen years old. I liked her very much. She can be a little too curious for her own good, but she is a kind and caring person. Sent to a boarding school with her step-brother, Jack, after the disappearance of their parents, Ella finds herself embarking on a mysterious and dangerous adventure.I heard about this book on a Facebook post. The author was looking to raise funds to get this book published. I have crowdfunded a few books before, so decided that the synopsis sounded interesting enough to help out. I am glad I did, because this book had me riding on a roller coaster of emotions. I did find some of the plot to be a little cliche, such as the setting of a boarding school, but there is a uniqueness to the story that kept me totally hooked from beginning to end. This story is told through different points of view, mostly Ella and Jack's, but as Ella is the main character, she has the most say.I loved meeting Jack, Ella's step-brother. He is thirteen years old too and is quite laid back and less intense than his step-sister, which made me like him a lot. He is a thinker. Rather than rushing into things, he gives thought to his actions and is less inclined to get into trouble. Oliver and Harriet are also orphans boarding at Blackcrowns. They are both likable characters whom I liked. George is an enigmatic character; I wasn't sure whether I should like him or not. He is the son of the governor or headmistress of the school, Mendra Mordel. Or is he? Could he be another orphan? I felt sorry for him, as he seems to be both physically and mentally abused by his parent. Mendra Mordel is not the most welcoming person, and has a forbidding countenance that instantly had me hating her.This story is a mixture of action, adventure and dark fantasy. The characters are well developed and the story intriguing. I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat during some scenes, as the suspense or danger in them held me captive. As I said above, I did find some of the plot a little cliche, but there are several twists and turns that surprised me and didn't see coming. This is a classic good versus evil story, combined with the excitement of an action adventure tale. When I reached the end, I was a little disappointed as I wanted to keep reading! This book does end in a cliffhanger, so I hope that the author is well on the way to completing the second book, because I want to read it as soon as possible to find out what happens next!P.S. Ferns has written a fast paced, exciting debut novel. I love his writing style, which is fast paced without being rushed, and the flow was wonderful! This is an author to watch. I would definitely read more of his books in the future.I highly recommend this book to young readers aged 12 - 18. I also recommend this book to adults who love reading YA Science Fiction and Fantasy genres. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV5M3PF6TLJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYNLFF8#wasThisHelpful","RV5M3PF6TLJT","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a complimentary copy of this book from the author in return for an honest review.This is the third book in the Clay and Tanner Thomas Series. I absolutely LOVED it!Clay and Tanner Thomas are both fantastic characters. Clay has become more at ease with using his special abilities of telekinesis and being able to communicate with the dead. His son, Tanner, also has special abilities such as being able to hypnotize people or influence them just with a thought. These abilities are caused through a genetic anomaly within their brain and come in handy when solving mysteries, but this one becomes personal when a robbery goes wrong and Clay's father is accused of committing it.I have been wanting to read this book for some time, but due to the length of my reading list, haven't been able to until now. I am kicking myself for not reading it sooner, because I really love this series and the characters within the pages. I picked up the book and started to read; I did not put it down until I had finished it in one sitting. The story is told through various points of view, but as Clay and Tanner are the main characters, they have the most say. I am not a huge sports fan, but I love the way the author has woven his love of sport into this story. His attention to detail made the games come alive and I felt like I was there, watching the games from the bleachers too. I also love the paranormal (or is it supernatural) aspects of the tale; I love a good ghost story!It was also wonderful to meet some old faces again, as well as some new ones. Jasper, Clay's friend and lawyer, happens to have a short temper to go with his short stature (he's one of the little people or, if you want to be politically incorrect, a midget). In a way, this character is one of my favourites, because he's more bark than bite, though he can get rather violent when riled. This also leads to almost comical events that made me smile and, on occasion, giggle over.Zander Fauss is a character I liked from the start. He is a neurosurgeon and one of Clay's friends. He has been studying the Thomas's abilities in the hopes of understanding why they have manifested.There are more than a couple of new characters introduced, but I really liked Sherman ""Septic"" Tankersley. He's a plumber, who happens to be a little intimidating due to his large size. He has many issues, but as I got to know this man a bit better, I realised that he is a gentle giant hiding behind a gruff facade to hide his loneliness.This story is another fantastic mystery/thriller, full of twists and turns to keep a reader guessing. There are some quite dark moments within the story that made me shiver, but the author also added some lighter moments which had me giggling or laughing out loud. There is mention of religion which may upset some readers, but it is not written in a preachy way. This is a fast paced, roller coaster ride from beginning to end. I hope that there will be more books in this series in the future.Jeff LaFerney has written a fantastic mystery/thriller. I love his writing style, which is fast paced and exciting, and the flow is wonderfully fluid; each scene flows into the next seamlessly. He is one of the few male authors who has made it onto my favourite authors list and I am looking forward to reading more of his books in the future.I highly recommend this as a ""MUST READ"" to everyone who loves paranormal thrillers or mysteries. This book can be read as a stand-alone, but I highly recommend reading the first book, Loving The Rain, first. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFT3XZ657274H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSETUUQ#wasThisHelpful","RFT3XZ657274H","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a complimentary audiobook code from the author in return for an honest review.This is the second book in the Others of Edenton series. I really enjoyed it!This book is again narrated by Kelley Hazen Story Teller Productions. I really enjoyed her interpretation of the characters. Kelley Hazen's reading voice is lovely to listen to. I love her diction and she gave each character their own voice, which brought them to life. This helped me see them clearly in my mind's eye. I would definitely listen to more books narrated by this lady in the future.Hayden Hunter is a very enigmatic character. I wasn't sure whether I liked him or not when I met him in the first book of the series, In Too Deep. He is extremely taciturn and mysterious, so I was looking forward to getting to know him a little better. He is a powerful Earth Fae, but doesn't seem to use his magic much. Being the Sheriff of the town of Edenton is not an easy job, but he makes it look like it is. He is well respected by the residents and, by the end of the book, I respected him too. When he meets Amethyst, attraction sparks fly.Amethyst Lakes is a Water Nymph. I liked her, but on occasion found myself wanting to shout at her and tell her to pay better attention about things happening around her! She can be a little self-centered and a little self-pitying, but she has a good heart. Because she is a nymph, her power comes from sex and lust. She is not ready for a new relationship so soon after her ex killed himself, but after meeting the sexy Sheriff, he is a temptation she is determined to avoid. However, fate (or destiny) has other plans.Having listened (as well as read) In Too Deep, I was eager to continue the series. I started to listen and was quickly hooked! I must admit that I was a little confused at first, because the story started by following a character called Sapphire, who was a very powerful Water Nymph. But, then I realised that it was a backstory for one of the characters and gave both Hayden and Amethyst a connection, even though remote. The story is told from several characters' point's of view, which gave it an interesting twist. We also get to know Preston, one of the council members, a little better. I must admit that I did feel sorry for him as the story unfolded. He is a really nice guy, who deserves to find happiness. I hope he does in the future. Carl, Amethyst's ex, is (or was) a warlock and a real piece of work. *SPOILER ALERT!!!* His ""death"" allows a Shadowfae to escape the prison Sapphire had imprisoned him in hundreds of years previously, and sets off a series of events that endanger the lives of several of the Edenton residents.This story is just as fast paced as the first. There are several surprising twists that I didn't see coming and danger lurks in the corners. However, the only issue I had with this story was with the dialogue. I still felt that the dialogue was a little too ""teen/angst ridden"" for supposed adults and I found myself rolling my eyes on occasion. Yes, Amethyst is a young nymph, but I felt that some of her dialogue made her seem rather naive and a little immature for being in her early twenties. However, she does grow as a character and it was nice to watch her bloom. This story took me on a roller coaster ride of emotion, with lots of danger and action. I loved how the final showdown between Amethyst and the Shadowfae unfolded. It was extremely exciting and it had me sitting on the edge of my seat! The ending left me looking forward to continuing the series and will read or listen to the next book in the series, Falling Into Place as soon as possible.Brandy L. Rivers has written an intriguing sequel in the series. I loved her fast paced writing style, and the flow was wonderful. Unfortunately, the melodramatic dialogue was the only thing that let this story down in my opinion. However, with that being said, I would definitely read more of her books in the future.Due to explicit scenes of a sexual nature, I do not recommend this book to readers under the age of 18. However, I do recommend this book if you love hot erotic paranormal romances full of werewolves, vampires, fae, druids etc. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W71RSIRQVSY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FO65AK0#wasThisHelpful","R2W71RSIRQVSY","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in the Gwynn Reznick series. I loved it!Gwynn Reznick is a wonderful character. I really liked her when I first met her in The Cost Of Crude. However, I still wanted to shake some sense into her when she took unnecessary risks. I'm surprised that Ruben's temper didn't flare more often at her recklessness. But, saying that, she is quite resourceful and thinks quickly on her feet when in stressful situations.Having read a couple of other books by this author, I couldn't wait to read this one. I started to read and didn't put it down until I reached the end. The action starts right from the beginning and doesn't let up. There are several surprising twists full of danger and excitement. This is a fast paced roller coaster ride of suspense, mystery and action. I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat during certain scenes. The story is told through mostly Gwynn's point of view, but a few other characters have their view shown too, especially Ruben and Holly.It was nice meeting some of the members of Ruben's team again. I liked Holly, who certainly got the town talking! However, don't underestimate her, she's extremely deadly to boot! It did disappoint me that Ruben was not as prominent in this story, but I can understand why he wasn't.I loved the way Gwynn has grown as an investigator, but she still has a lot to learn and I hope to find out what she has learnt in the next installment of the series.Inge-Lise Goss has written an intriguing thriller full of danger, mystery and suspense. This is the third book I have read by this author, and I find her writing greatly improved compared to her first book. I love her fast paced writing style and the flow of the story was wonderful. I am now looking forward to reading more of her books in the future.Due to some violence, although not too graphic, I do not recommend this book to younger readers. However, I highly recommend this book if you love thrillers full of mystery, suspense, danger, action, adventure and romance. This book can be read as a stand-alone, but I would definitely recommend you read The Cost of Crude first. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWOXMN9OYUU25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VS8WIY4#wasThisHelpful","RWOXMN9OYUU25","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a wonderful historical romance. I loved it!Lady Rhoslyn is a character I liked a lot, but she also annoyed me at times. She is quite headstrong and determined, but she is very much a lady of her time. She tends to go kicking and fighting into a situation, but gets nowhere fast. I love her fiery Scottish temper, but she gets points knocked off for crumbling too quickly! Scots are not generally known for backing down easily. I know I'm from a different time, but I also really wanted to reach into the book and shake some sense into her at times, especially when it came to her not listening to her own intuition. It drove me crazy!Talbot St. Claire is also a wonderful character. He is an English knight, who has faithfully served King Edward, and has been commanded to wed Lady Rhoslyn to ensure that his king's hold is tightened in Scotland. I really liked this character. He is a very honourable man, with a wit and charm that even I fell in love with. He believes in duty, but is also his own man and is not a push over. He is dangerous, most certainly, but he also has a heart that he tries to shield from the world in which he lives. He is a warrior, through and through.Having previously read another historical romance by this author, I couldn't wait to read this one. I started the story and was quickly pulled into it. I loved the descriptions of both the scenery and the people. The imagery allowed me to picture the scenes quite clearly and the story ran like a movie in my mind's eye. I was also fascinated by the historical details that were sprinkled within the story. I think that, although the author used quite a lot of poetic licence with this story, the history into the clothes and houses/castles was also well researched. The characters' all seem well developed too. So much so, that I wouldn't have been surprised if they had walked through my door. However, I certainly wouldn't like to meet Dayton, Talbot's brother. He is a nasty piece of work! Jealousy, even between brothers, is never a good emotion and Dayton is extremely jealous and bitter about his brother. Why is he? I hear you ask. You will have to read the story yourself to find out. My lips are sealed! However, I will say that he got what was coming to him in the long run.This story made me laugh and it made me cry. It took me on an emotional roller coaster ride and left me feeling like I had been in a riptide - pulled in different directions at once. I can't wait to read more books by this author in the future.Tarah Scott has written a wonderful historical romance novel. I loved her fast paced writing style and the flow was absolutely wonderful. I have another one of her books, not a historical romance but a paranormal one, sitting on my ""want to read"" list. I am going to have to add her historical romances onto there too! She has found a fan in me!Due to a scene of sexual abuse (implied but not shown) and some sexual scenes that are a little on the explicit side, I do not recommend this book to readers under the age of 16. However, I highly recommend this book if you love historical romances with sexy men and stubborn/strong females. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDASH5MOQ28B2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKJCOWE#wasThisHelpful","RDASH5MOQ28B2","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a complimentary copy of this book from the author in return for an honest review.This is a very thought provoking and thrilling science fiction novel. I really enjoyed it!Peter is a character I really liked. He is a physicist who is now a contract engineer. He has a very analytical mind and is determined to figure out why his brother committed suicide. His journey into discovering his brother's secrets brings him into contact with Doug, a university student, who is dealing with his own problems and secrets.I am very sorry that I have only now managed to read this book, as it has sat on my Kindle for some time due to my rather large reading list.This story is told through various points of view, which kept me interested from the first page. The story has a lot of musical, as well as scientific and spiritual philosophy mixed in with the mystery, suspense and danger the characters encounter. I have always been intrigued with the innermost workings of the mind and how music and light affects the brain chemistry. This story takes the reader through some of the science behind this, but doesn't befuddle the less scientific reader by using large words and scientific terms. There is also a sub-plot that lies beneath the story, but doesn't actually come into the forefront until late in the book. However, this sub-plot and the way it was woven into the main storyline sent a shiver up my back. I know that the human brain is still not fully understood and that we seem to use only a fraction of the computing power that could potentially be available to us, but what scares me is that when we unlock the full potential of our brains, will we better off knowing things, or is ignorance bliss? The author of this story explores not only the good side, but the bad as well. Could we (as a society) be controlled more or less as our brains' capacity increases? This I cannot say for certain, but the way this story twists and turns had me guessing. The characters are all well developed and they felt quite real to me. I must admit that I was completely shocked at a twist near the end that I certainly didn't see coming and I ended up in tears. This twist made me wonder if we are evolved enough yet to continue to push the boundaries of science and scientific discoveries and not become insane. Some will argue that it's a state of mind and we are all insane anyway, but if the incredible advances we make in understanding how the brain works could (and possibly has already) be turned against the populace as a weapon, then I shudder in horror. In the wrong hands, the ability and technology to control or alter the perception of the human brain is an incredibly dangerous endeavor and should never be allowed in my opinion. Men, greedy for money and power, however, will always be looking for a way to do just that. The story ends on a hopeful and happy note, which left me also feeling hopeful for the future. In any case (and I may be a little naive in thinking this), I am crossing my fingers that even if we do make giant strides in scientific discoveries (such as those explored by this author) that could potentially be used as weapons in the future, common sense will prevail and the ""bad guys"" (this includes any government in power who wants to keep their citizens in line) never get their hands on any of it.Simon Denman has written an extremely thrilling and entertaining read, which took me on an amazing journey. I found myself on an emotional roller coaster ride from beginning to end. I love his writing style, which is fast paced and exciting, and the flow is wonderful too. I would most definitely consider reading more books by this author in the future.Due to the technical aspects, as well as the deeply philosophical nuances within this book, I do not recommend this to young readers. I do, however, highly recommend this book if you love science fiction, suspense or thriller genres. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q463VVS55ZZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089YQPI0#wasThisHelpful","R2Q463VVS55ZZP","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free sample from the supplier in return for an honest review.I am more used to writing book reviews than I am for electronic equipment, so when I was approached to review these headphones, I was a little intimidated. However, I decided to try these headphones, as my current ones (which shall remain nameless) do not sit nicely in my ears and keep falling off.I have been listening to a lot of audio books through my headphones recently, so I decided to give these ones a try. I will say that I was extremely impressed with the presentation of the box. They looked so cool sitting in there that I didn't want to take them out but, that would defeat their purpose. I opened the box and the first thing I noticed was the yellow cord that is woven over the plastic casing surrounding the wires. This is very eye catching and completely different to most other headphones I have come across. There is a mic and on/off tab on the cord, which means you can use this on a wide variety of electronic devices that require headphones such as smart phones, MP3/4 players, E-Readers with text to voice capability, iPads, iPods, Kindles, Nooks and so on. The second thing that struck me was how the wooden ear buds looked more elegant than their plastic counterparts. The soft plastic ear pieces (of which there are 3 pairs) come in two different colours, brown and white/opaque, and also come in three different sizes to make a more comfortable fit, depending on the size of your ear channel.I used the ear buds that were already installed on the headphones, which happen to be the smallest size. I plugged these into my iPad and put the buds into my ears. I was very impressed at how comfortable they were. They also did not fall out of my ear channels, even when I talked to someone. I also noticed that the sound seemed sharper than through my old ones, but that could be because they (the old ones) were on their way out speaker-wise. But, I did notice there was a reduction in noise, such as hissing from blood pumping in my ears, and ambient noise from people talking or the TV blaring. This made my listening experience a whole lot better. The only con I found was when I moved or shifted in my seat. The yellow cord rubbed against my clothing and it transferred the sound through to the earphones, which then became loud scraping noises through the ear pieces. Perhaps this is one of the reasons other headphone manufacturers only use plastic casings over the wires? However, this still has not spoiled my experience too much, but only time will tell if I get too frustrated and annoyed with it.I am hoping that these headphones will last a long time but, when they finally do go the way of the Dodo, I would definitely consider buying a pair of these to replace them again. Though without the cord wrapped around the wire casing perhaps?I highly recommend these if you are looking for a set of headphones that not only look stylish and elegant, but are multi-functional and comfortable to wear. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22PEYH00ZXOC3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T56VLWQ#wasThisHelpful","R22PEYH00ZXOC3","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in The Ignited series. I really enjoyed it!I downloaded this book in audiobook format, as I wanted to listen to it after listening to the first book, Ignited, not so long ago.The audiobook is again narrated by Lisa Larsen. She did another great job in reading this story and she brought the characters to life. Her voice, I felt, suited the character of Kris and her interpretation of the story kept me hooked from beginning to end. Her reading pace was neither too fast, nor too slow, which allowed me to picture the scenes perfectly. I would definitely listen to other books narrated by her.Kris Young is a great character. I liked her very much when I first met her. She is very level-headed but, she can be a little stubborn and gung-ho at times, which I found a bit irritating. I have enjoyed watching her come to terms with her newfound identity as a Skotadi. It's not easy finding out that you are not who you thought you were, and that you were living a lie. But now she will face an even bigger challenge. Can she control her dangerous demon, or will she let the darkness consume her?I started to listen to the story, which continues on from the end of the first book, and was quickly drawn back into the tale. Kris, Nathan, Callie and Alec are on the hunt for the mysterious boy who haunts Kris's dreams. Their search leads them to a small town where they finally meet Micah. There is something about this character that I just couldn't like. He came across as very manipulative, secretive and arrogant, and not in a good way. There are a few other characters introduced, but they didn't seem as well developed and felt a bit one-dimensional compared to the main ones. The story is full of several twists, which kept the story entertaining. I loved getting to know the original characters better, especially Alec, as he is struggling with his own inner demon. I still think he's hotter than Nathan, but then again, what do I know? The war between the Skotadi and Culla is still heating up, with Kris as a prize. Her destiny is still shrouded in mystery, but it has been extremely enjoyable watching her grow more confident in controlling her darker side.In my review of Ignited I said I was not fond of love triangles and this still is true. I think I can now add love squares to the equation too! It's all very nice having three guys falling for you, but it is stretching my imagination just that little bit too far! I am sorry, but I just can't understand why the author would introduce a third suitor into an already crowded romance! I really wanted to give this story top marks, because the story was exciting, dangerous and full of twists. But adding another character into the romance mix is making an already complex situation even more difficult to follow. However, other readers may not have the same reaction as I did, so I will leave it to them to decide for themselves.I reached the end of the story, which again ends on a twist, and I am looking forward to reading/listening to the next book in the series as soon as possible.Desni Dantone has written an exciting, pulse pounding sequel. I love her writing style, which is fast paced but not rushed. Her characters and the scenes come alive through her descriptions and they are easy to picture in the mind's eye. The flow is wonderful and each scene runs seamlessly into the next. She has mixed ancient myths of Greek gods into a modern YA paranormal romance that will completely hook you in. This is one debut novelist to keep an eye on!There is some sexual content in this book and although I highly recommend this book to young readers who love books like the Percy Jackson series, with Demi-Gods and myths mixed in with a little romance, the scenes may be a little too explicit for those under the age of sixteen. I also recommend this book to adults who love to read YA paranormal romances. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WL3BZ99LJDMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JCH1UC4#wasThisHelpful","R2WL3BZ99LJDMM","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first book in The Heckmasters series. I absolutely loved it!First off, I absolutely love the cover! It fits the story perfectly.Rhia Duke is a wonderful character. I liked her very much. She is a schoolteacher by trade. She is a very determined woman, with a stubborn streak a mile wide. Desperate to leave her past behind, she sets off, along with her young sister and a companion they pick up en-route, to answer an advertisement in the newspaper for a job in New Mexico. But things are not all they seem and danger lurks in every corner.Wystan Heckmaster is a fantastic character. I liked this man very much. He is quite gruff and tough, but as I got to know him a little better, realised that he hides a softer, gentler, not to mention honourable, side. He is the sheriff of a town where the citizens are reformed demons. Being a half-demon himself, his life has not been easy. However, he has taken it upon himself, along with his two brothers, to keep the earth and humans protected from the demons trying to escape through a portal called the Pit. When Rhia appears in his town, he realises that things are about to change forever.This is a fantastic supernatural/paranormal romance! Set in the late 1800's, this book quickly swept me up and carried me away. The story is told through various points of view, which made it very interesting. There is excitement, danger, mystery and suspense mixed in with the hot romance.I liked meeting Sylvie, Rhia's twelve year old sister. She is full of curiosity and is extremely bright. I also liked meeting Beryl Brookshier, a young woman the two sisters had befriended on their journey. However, she is also a mystery and, when her secret is revealed, it completely threw me. I certainly didn't see that twist coming! I also loved meeting Wystan's two brothers, Eban and Tell. Eban is the healer and Tell is the hunter. The three Heckmasters make a formidable team as they tackle the evil escaping from hell. We also get to meet the other residents of Berner, some of whom I liked and some not. The heat between Rhia and Wystan fairly sizzled on the page and their chemistry is extremely explosive! The story has several twists and turns, not to mention a villain that sent a shiver down my back. Noem is a vile character, but even he pales in comparison. You'll have to read the story to find out for yourself as to whom I'm talking about. However, I will say that I didn't suspect a thing and their betrayal actually brought a pang to my own heart. Although, in hindsight, I should have realised that they were up to no good. There is a battle between several demons and the Heckmasters that is quite intense, with a surprising twist that had me sitting on the edge of my seat! I finished the story and sat for a while as I contemplated and absorbed what I had just read. I love books that make you go ""wow"" at the end, and this is one of them. It took me on a journey that I didn't expect. I am now looking forward to reading Eban's story as soon as possible.Allison Merritt has written a wonderful paranormal/supernatural romance. Her characters come alive on the page and her descriptions of the scenes made me see them in my mind's eye with ease. I love her writing style, which is fast paced and exciting. I also love the flow of the story, the scenes flowed seamlessly from one to another. I have never read any other books by this author, but I would definitely love to read more of them in the future.Due to scenes of an explicit nature, I do not recommend this book to younger readers under the age of 16. However, I highly recommend this book if you love erotic wild west type supernatural romances filled with sexy half-demons, or paranormal romances with strong characters. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7LQOPHL6L92Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L501TJK#wasThisHelpful","R7LQOPHL6L92Y","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wonderful YA paranormal romance. I really enjoyed it!I was recommended this book by Audible due to my reading/listening history. The blurb sounded intriguing, so I listened to the audio sample. I decided that it would be something I would enjoy, and I was right.The audiobook is narrated by Lisa Larsen. She did a wonderful job in reading this story. Her voice, I felt, suited the character of Kris and her interpretation of the story kept me hooked from beginning to end. Her reading pace was neither too fast, nor too slow, which allowed me to picture the scenes perfectly. I would definitely listen to other books narrated by her.Kris Young is a great character. I liked her very much. She is a normal teen, going through the usual teenage problems, but with one difference. She has had to contend with a lot in her seventeen years - her parents' dying in an accident for one. She is very level-headed but, she can be a little stubborn and gung-ho at times, which I found a bit irritating. She joins forces with Nathan, her guardian angel, and realises that there is no such thing as ""normal"". Kris finds out something about herself that completely shocks and terrifies her. She is a pawn in a war that could change the balance of power between the Scotadi and Culla. These two groups have been at war for millennia.I have read quite a few YA books over the last couple of years or so. This story is very similar to others I have read but, also completely original. This book has a unique take on good and evil that had me thinking about those concepts. There are shades of grey, rather than black and white in this story, so one never knows whose side to cheer for!We are introduced to several different characters that come to life as the story unfolds. I really liked Nathan. He is a bit of an enigma at first, as he has always been in Kris's life but only on the periphery. He has saved her several times throughout her life, but as I got to know him better, I realised that he is a hero in more ways than one.I also liked Callie Sanders, who has been her best friend since the sixth grade. She is fun to be with, changes her boyfriends (and her hair colours) often and loves shopping.Alec Sierra is also a wonderful character. I liked him too, as he is a great guy. He has a wonderful sense of humour and has a warmth to him that instantly charmed me. However, he has a secret that, when it is revealed, completely threw me. I didn't see it coming and thus, my conundrum with the good and evil aspect of this book. This story is full of twists and turns, action and danger. It's exciting and enthralling. However, I am not overly fond of love triangles and this story has a definite love triangle thing going on. Both Nathan and Alec are completely opposite from each other, which is why I can understand Kris's dilemma. But, it made it extremely difficult for me to pick one to like more! It reminded me of the Edward/Jacob debates that ruled the social media sites for years, when those books first came out. However, I love a bad boy and Alec gets my vote, even if Kris disagrees with me. Or does she? Her confusion over her feelings for both of them made me empathize with her. I felt sad when I reached the end of the story, because I wanted to keep listening to it. It ends on a twist rather than a cliffhanger, so I am now looking forward to listening to the next book in the series, Sacrificed, as soon as possible.Desni Dantone has written an exciting, pulse pounding debut novel. I loved her writing style, which is fast paced but, not rushed. Her characters and the scenes come alive through her descriptions and they are easy to picture in the mind's eye. The flow is wonderful and each scene runs seamlessly into the next. She has mixed ancient myths of Greek gods into a modern YA paranormal romance that will completely hook you in. This is one debut novelist to keep an eye on!I highly recommend this book to readers aged thirteen up who love books like the Percy Jackson series, with Demi-gods and myths mixed in with a little romance.There is no explicit sexual content, apart from a few steamy kisses, so if you are looking for a little more heat, this book may not be for you. I also recommend this book to adults who love to read YA paranormal romances. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYK07U81I9X9O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D1VPR8U#wasThisHelpful","RYK07U81I9X9O","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fantastic contemporary comedic romance. I loved it!Aubrey Evans is a wonderful character. I liked her very much. She is a romance novelist, who lives a vicarious life through her characters. She is an introvert and mostly shy, but due to her success on the bestseller list, her books are very much in demand. Now one of her books, True Love, is being made into major motion picture and her life may never be the same again, especially when she meets Kole Camden, the director, and sparks fly.This is a fantastic romance story. The story is told narration style by Aubrey to a national reporter as an exclusive. This is certainly a unique way to tell a story. I fell in love with all of the characters, including Mateo Cruz, whose slightly sleezy, never mind cheesy dialogue had me grinning and shuddering in equal measure. Tandy Owens is a great friend and personal assistant to Aubrey. Her more flamboyant personality balanced Aubrey's shyness. I loved their scene in the limo together as they arrived at the movie studio; I could picture that scene with ease. Greyson Meyers is the swoon-worthy star of the movie, whose ego is ginormous but, he also is a very nice man underneath his persona and he takes Aubrey under his wing. The one mystery was Kole Camden. This is one character I really wanted to get to know better. I wanted a bit more of Aubrey and Kole interaction, as their chemistry is extremely palpable. The disagreements were heated and the passion between them burned hot, but they didn't act on their feelings as much as I thought they should have in private. It was like they were friends and not potentially a couple. I think, for me, Kole should have played a bigger role in the story than just someone for Aubrey to throw temper tantrums at when the movie script didn't correspond to her original story line. I wanted him to shut her up with a kiss, but that didn't happen either! However, there is one scene that had me smiling and that's the one with the golf cart, a feather duster and a bottle of milk. Once you read that scene, you'll know what I mean. I seriously thought ""O.M.G.!"" and burst out laughing. I could picture that scene quite clearly, along with a few others in the book. The story is peppered with the sarcastic humour and wit that I have come to love from this author, and has several twists that kept things interesting. I reached the end of the story and smiled in satisfaction; it almost had a ""riding off into the sunset"" feel to it with an optimistic happily ever after, which a good romance story should always have. I would love for this book to be actually made into a movie, either for TV or for the big screen. Now, how ironic would that be if it was?Stacey Rourke has written a fantastically comedic contemporary romance. I love her characters, who are extremely lifelike and feel like friends. I love her writing style, which is fast paced, and the story flows wonderfully. I am a huge fan of this author. The wit and charm she brings to her books makes them a joy to read. I am looking forward to reading more of her books, whether they be YA like her Gryphon Series, Dark Fantasy like her Legend Series or Contemporary Romance such as this one, or any other genre she attempts in the future.Although this is not really a YA story as such, I highly recommend this book to teens aged 15+ and adults who love light hearted contemporary romances. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCLGE0W2QYOL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQ7FV4I#wasThisHelpful","RCLGE0W2QYOL5","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the fifth book in the Dragon Fury series. I absolutely loved it!First off, I would like to say that I love the cover! Venom's eyes! *Sigh!*I downloaded this book in both Kindle and audiobook format, as I have the other books in the series in this way too. This gives me the opportunity to either read or listen to the story, depending on my mood. The audio book is narrated by Cole Ferguson, who does a wonderful job in bringing the characters to life. I must admit I was a little disappointed that Benjamin L. Darcie was no longer narrating the books, but Cole Ferguson's voice sounded just as sexy, so all in all, I wasn't disappointed for long!Venom is a fantastic character. I have enjoyed getting to know this particular dragon. He has a multitude of layers that get peeled back and revealed as the story progresses. This made me even more intrigued with him, as he has a few secrets that I never would have guessed, and a vulnerability that surprised me, as he struck me as a very confident man who is not afraid of much. That is, until he meets Evelyn Foxe.Evelyn (Evie) Foxe is also a wonderful character. I liked her very much. She is normally an emotionally strong woman, who usually knows what she wants and goes for it, but now she's desperate. She is a forensic accountant, who has had the rug pulled out from under her feet and is struggling to find a job, and keep a Russian mobster off her back. Can Venom be her ticket out of the situation she finds herself in? Or will she be in more danger?I have been eagerly waiting for the release of this book for some time. It was well worth the wait! I started to listen to the story and was quickly hooked. I have become totally addicted to this series! The story, in a way, continues on from Fury of Desire. There is a definite story arc beginning to appear and gather pace, as this story is told through several points of view and not just Venom's and Evie's.All of the dragons from the Night Fury pack are worried about Gage and Hadar, who have gone missing in Prague. These two dragons have not featured much in the story up until now, but as the story arc opens up and the reader gets to see what is happening in Prague, they suddenly become extremely important. There's some seriously sick things happening in that part of the world, and Gage and Hadar find themselves in serious danger. I know it sounds a bit strange, but I really enjoyed their story, even though it's not very nice. There is lots of violence and danger, but these two are a force to be reckoned with. I must admit that Nian is not too shabby himself!Back in Seattle, Ivar is waiting for results on his experiment, but even he is shocked at the results. Venom and Evie's romance is fraught with excitement and danger. However, I felt their story, although integral to the plot, got a little sidelined due to the larger story arc. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but if you compare the first story to this one, they have less page time together than Bastian and Myst. But, it makes a nice change to have an interracial coupling. I haven't read many books where this occurs, and it brings a different dimension to the story. It also makes me wonder about Sloan's story. Will we ever get to read it one day? I hope so. I reached the end of the story and though it doesn't end on a cliffhanger, it made me look forward to reading/listening to the next book in the series as soon as possible. I just hope I don't have to wait as long for it though!Coreene Callahan has written another fantastic paranormal romance. She is fast becoming one of my favourite authors to read. Her books are fast paced, exciting and extremely addictive! I love her writing style and the flow is absolutely wonderful!Due to the use of bad language and the explicit sexual scenes, I do not recommend this book for younger readers. However, I highly recommend this book if you love erotic paranormal romances or books with sexy dragon shifters! - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FLB1V3TBO9YU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NUD0O5K#wasThisHelpful","R3FLB1V3TBO9YU","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a chilling horror story. I loved it!Kate Spradlin is a character I neither liked nor disliked. She came across as rather ordinary and boring at first. However, she has a deep secret hidden in a past that is not so happy. But destiny (or is it fate?) will bring her and Carl to an old house where evil lurks.Carl Spradlin is Kate's husband. He is a wonderful character. I liked him a lot more than Kate. I don't really know why. I just felt that he is a good man, who is willing to work hard to provide for his family.This is a genre that I very rarely read. However, I had the opportunity to help edit a rough draft of this book, and wanted to see what the finished article looked like.When I first read that rough draft, I had felt chills run up and down my spine, but reading the final story had the hair standing up on the back of my neck.This story is told through various characters' points of view, which I really enjoyed. The story is peppered with weird and wonderful characters. Alfred Packer is one of the first serial killers and lived in Williamsburg in 1887. His exploits are rather gruesome, and some of the details of his actions are a little graphic. Therefore, readers beware. He is the original owner of the house which Carl and Kate move into.I really didn't like Rex Fontaine, Kate's ex. He is a creepy character, who is obsessed with his former wife. He is incredibly cruel and abusive. However, I felt his character could have been utilised better by the author as the story progressed. Nevertheless, his presence is chilling and carries a menace that had me sitting on the edge of my seat, wondering what he was planning next. I really liked Mrs. Goddard, she is a wonderfully sharp character whose feud with one of the ladies from the Historical Society called Jane Dillard made me smile, though it's no laughing matter. Secrets are revealed and lives are in danger, but watching Kate grow into her potential as a powerful witch has been an adventure that I wouldn't have missed for all the world.The difference between the rough draft and the complete story is amazing. The story has changed in various ways, but also remains the same. There are several twists and turns which were not in the original draft I read, and I found myself swept into a story that is suspenseful, atmospheric and chilling. The ending has a twist that definitely sent a shiver down my back. I wonder if we've seen the last of Alfred Packer?Brad Lee Hayword has written a chilling debut horror story. His writing style is not particularly fast paced, but his ability to describe scenes with such clarity made the story stand out. The flow of the story could have been a little better, as some of the scene changes (I feel) caused the pacing to be a little jerky. I found this story to be highly entertaining, though there is room for improvement, and I am looking forward to reading more from this author in the future.Due to scenes of violence which are on the graphic side, I do not recommend this book to young readers, or those of a nervous disposition. I do, however, highly recommend this book if you love classic dark thriller or horror genres. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K9SHER3XEZJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TM3Y1E2#wasThisHelpful","R3K9SHER3XEZJK","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in the Eternal Guardians series. I loved it!My sister recommended this series to me as she had read them all (that have been released so far) and thought I would enjoy it, and she was right! I downloaded this as an audiobook, as I had previously enjoyed listening to the first book in the series, Marked, in audiobook too. Entwined is again narrated by Elizabeth Wiley. She did another fantastic job in telling the story. Her narration was crystal clear and her interpretation of the characters brought them to life.Zander is an interesting character. I really liked him, but he has a serious issue with self-pity at first, which I found a bit off putting for a hero. He is one of the oldest of the Argonaughts and, as he is from Achilles bloodline, believes himself to be immortal. Nevertheless, as the story progresses, he pulls his head out of his you-know-what and is actually a great person to know, who realises that everyone has their weakness and his happens to be his soul mate.Callia is a wonderful character. She is the King's physician and has the power to heal. I really liked this strong willed woman. She has had to endure a lot over the last ten years, but her spirit has not been broken. But when Zander volunteers to marry Isadora, her world comes crashing down around her ears.This story is another roller coaster ride, full of action, adventure and danger. Adalanta is busy preparing her demons for war with the Argonaughts, and has a secret weapon in her arsenal, though he's not very willing. This secret weapon is a young boy by the name of Max, who is ten years old. I really liked Max. He is a very resourceful young man, who has had to endure years of abuse and cruelty at the hands of Adalanta, and has had to do some terrible things to survive. His courage and determination to escape his ""Mataras"" to find his real mother had me cheering him on. Callia also finds out a secret about herself which, although it surprised her, didn't really surprise me. But it made me look at the King in a slightly different light!As the story progressed, I fell in love with all of the Argonaught warriors, and the story in general. This is a fast paced, action packed adventure from beginning to end.As I said in my review for Marked, ""This story is mostly a typical paranormal romance, with lots of action and danger mixed in. However, there are several twists and turns that keep one guessing at what is really going on."", but after listening to this story I realised that there is a bigger story arc within each storyline, and I am looking forward to finding out what that story arc will reveal. One thing I will say about this story (and series) is the world building is excellent. The characters are well developed and extremely lifelike. I have always been intrigued with Greek gods and their offspring such as Hercules, whose exploits became legend (or are they myth?) over time. So reading about his descendants, who were with Jason on his voyage for the Golden Fleece, excites me. I am also a huge sucker for paranormal romances in general, so I am looking forward to continuing with this series and I will (hopefully) get to read/listen to Tempted as soon as I can.Elisabeth Naughton has written an exciting paranormal romance series. I love her fast paced writing style and the flow is wonderful. I will be continuing to read this series, but I do have one of her romantic suspense novels sitting on my Kindle, which I hope to now read in the near future too!Due to scenes of a sexual nature that are on the explicit side, I do not recommend this book for younger readers. However, I highly recommend this book if you love erotic paranormal romances. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YVLAOYOR2490/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006LACIY4#wasThisHelpful","R1YVLAOYOR2490","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was recommended this book through a reading group I am in. Although it's not in my normal, preferred genre, I decided to give it a try. I did enjoy it though.Brianna Garcia is a character that a lot of women who have been in abusive relationships can relate to. She has an inner strength that gets hidden deep inside when her marriage becomes a waking nightmare. To save her children and herself from more pain, she will have to dig deep to reach that strength.This is a deeply emotive story, which I cannot relate to much as I have never been in such a relationship. However, I could certainly empathize with the character of Brianna. I could feel her hurt and confusion as she struggled to find a way to escape from Mike, her husband. What intrigued me about the story is that it got me wondering about relationships, and what it was in men's lives, like Mike, that created the switch from a loving husband to a bitter and angry man. In this story, this aspect was not explored by the author much as she focuses mostly on Brianna. Certainly, there is no such thing as a perfect relationship in the real world and this story reflects this. However, there is usually a motive or reason for this change in attitude. Yes, alcohol plays a part in many abusive relationships, but there is usually something else lurking in the background like stress, dissatisfaction in a job or in a situation. In Mike's case, his attitude changes due to a perceived alcoholic injustice, which quickly spirals out of control.I liked watching Brianna grow and flourish in her new life. I also liked meeting Officer Ryker Danner. He seems like a nice man, but felt his character wasn't as well developed as it could have been. I'm all for instant attraction and all that, but I didn't feel the chemical spark between the characters; instead of a raging inferno, all I got was a glowing ember. This is not necessarily a bad thing though. There are many different types of love, and passion is only one aspect of this mysterious emotion. Other readers may disagree with me, but you are welcome to read this book and decide for yourself. I loved meeting Dominique, the hairdresser. She is a wonderful character, full of warmth and wisdom. She made me laugh at times too.Cheryl Seagraves has written an emotional roller coaster ride from start to finish, but I feel that this book could be made better by having a professional editor or proofreader go through it to give it a bit of ""spit and polish"". Her writing style is not especially fast paced, but the story's flow was wonderful and it made the book seem shorter. I would definitely consider reading more books by this author in the future.I recommend this book to readers who love women's fiction or contemporary romance. - Lynn Worton","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FK5P21L2XF9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D5XRH3C#wasThisHelpful","R3FK5P21L2XF9U","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the seventh book in the Eternal Mates series. I loved it!Anais is a wonderful character. She is a human warrior, working along side Sable at Archangel, a type of paranormal police/research agency in the mortal realm. I liked her feisty attitude, though felt that she took chances that were extremely dangerous. I was first introduced to her on the battlefield in the second book in the series, Claimed by a Demon King. However, she was only a secondary character at the time. I am glad to now to have the opportunity to get to know her better.Loke is a dragon shifter. I loved this sexy man! He has all the traits of an alpha male - protective, loving and possessive. However, I also found him to be incredibly sweet. He may be a dragon, but he has a sensitivity which made me melt!I have been eagerly awaiting the release of this book. The story is told through the view points of Anais and Loke. Their story hooked me from the first page, and didn't let me go until I had finished it. The heat factor between these two characters is just as steamy as the other characters in this series. I love their stubborn butting of heads, which I found quite entertaining. I was also quite amused by Loke's disdain of a female dragon and her attempts at seduction; it made me giggle, though the situation was anything but funny.There are no battle scenes as such, but there is a fight scene between Loke and two other dragons which is just as intense; and another one in Underworld which I found quite funny, as I could picture the fracas quite easily. This is one of the things I love about the author - her ability to build believable paranormal worlds, and her descriptive ability to bring a reader into it. I felt like I was there, amongst the action, smelling the dust and sweat, and hearing the clash of weapons and fists.We get to meet the other characters in the series again - Prince Loren, King Thorne, Sable, Kyter and Cavanaugh, just to name a few. We are also introduced to new characters. An angel who has no name, but is of the Echelon (whatever that means!). I am now wondering what his story will be? I can hardly wait to find out! And Cavanaugh's brother, Harbin, makes an appearance! All this testosterone is enough to get any red blooded female's hormones racing!*Minor spoiler*The end of the book has a bit of kink in it, but it's not full out BDSM, only bondage. However, this is in keeping with the story and makes for an unforgettable ending. I am now looking forward to reading the next book in the series!Felicity Heaton has written another fast paced, sexy paranormal romance that I thoroughly enjoyed! I love her writing style, which flows effortlessly from scene to scene. She is number one on my favourite authors list!I do not recommend this book to younger readers due to the extremely HOT and explicit sexual scenes. However, I highly recommend this book (and series) if you love sexy paranormal romances full of vampires, elves, werewolves, cat shifters, succubi, incubi, angels, dragons and demons. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27B1E48GZNJ1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKIBH82#wasThisHelpful","R27B1E48GZNJ1B","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.This is a very emotional read. The book is in a genre that I normally read, but the synopsis intrigued me. I am glad that I did read this book, because I LOVED it!Margaret (Maggie) Gray is a wonderful character. I really liked this lady. She has grit and determination to succeed. She has not had an easy life, but she has worked hard to become a renown and successful author. However, she is haunted by her past and in an attempt to vanquish the demons, she sets on a journey of discovery to find out what happened to her best friends, Elizabeth, Lucy and Randolph by hiring a private investigator, Damon Depre.I realised from the start that this book would be an extremely emotional read. However, what I didn't expect was what Maggie's journey would stir up in me. I found myself so proud of all of the characters, as their struggles have shaped them into wonderful people.Elizabeth has a big heart and a loving family, which made me feel very envious of her. Her life has also not been easy, but it has been filled with love and laughter. I love her children, Randall, Meg, James, Sarah and Katie, not to mention her loving husband, William.Randolph is another wonderful character. He too has worked hard and has become a successful businessman. He has a wicked sense of humour, but he still seems lonely to me. His success isolates him, which made me feel sad. I am glad that Margaret manages to find him, and this allows him to feel relaxed and part of a family again.Lucy is one of the not so lucky ones. She has had an even tougher life out of all of them, and her story is not an easy thing to read. She is the one that I am most proud of though, as she has had to climb hand over fist to overcome a lot of bad events and an addiction to alcohol.I was, however, a little disappointed that there was not more in the way of romance between Maggie and Damon in the story. There was a definite spark there, but I suppose mixing business with pleasure wouldn't have been a good idea. I did, however, love Denise, Maggie's secretary and assistant; she keeps Maggie alive and organised. She is very down to earth, but she also has a warmth about her which instantly made me like her.This story is full of heartache and regret, but it is also full of love, happiness and hope. I really loved getting to know these former orphans of Bishop Street. I have no idea what living in an orphanage is like, but these four people created their own family within an institution when they were abandoned by their own families. They have not had an easy life, but they have survived, and are a lot stronger for it. They may have been ill-treated and damaged by their experiences, but it is their ability to love that remains one of the true miracles of their upbringing. I found myself in tears quite often as their stories were told, but by the time I reached the end of the book, my tears became tears of joy.Rene D. Schultz has written an extremely touching and emotional story that will stay with me for some time to come. Her writing style is not especially fast paced, but her descriptive ability brought the places and characters to life. The flow is absolutely wonderful. Each scene flows into another with seamless precision. I would definitely consider adding this author to my favourite author's list.I highly recommend this book as a MUST READ if you love heartwarming contemporary fiction. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAQLLRWOIYU3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DL3QBBK#wasThisHelpful","RAQLLRWOIYU3Z","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a complimentary copy of this book from the author in return for an honest review.This is a most intriguing, thrilling and suspenseful journey into shady world of the celebrity. I really enjoyed it! However, if I saw this book in my local book store, I'm not sure I would have picked it up. The cover just didn't grab me as it should have. Keep it simple is my motto, but this cover is perhaps too simple in my opinion. It needs more ""bling"" to catch a reader's eye. This story, after all, is about celebrities and should have a bit more ""flash"" to it.Jack Stamp is a character I found to be rather arrogant and a bit of a jerk. He's a notorious womaniser, who's sexual innuendo and ""playfulness"" would have seen him in an employment tribunal for sexual harassment in any other job. I didn't really care for him that much. Although, he has some likable qualities too, such as loyalty and determination, and he has a nose for a good story. But, he has been riding on his reputation as an ace showbiz reporter for quite some time and has become lazy, and he knows it. When a desperate pop star enlists his help in exposing a sex slave ring, he jumps at the chance of salvaging his career with the biggest scoop of his life.I am not one who actively follows celebrity gossip, as I feel a person's private life should remain that - private. Therefore, when I started to read this book, I had an open mind and had no preconceived idea what I would find within the pages of this book. What I found was an exciting, thrilling and shocking roller coaster ride that kept me hooked from beginning to end!The story is written from the point of view of Jack Stamp, who's jaded and cynical view of the celebrities he writes about to be quite insightful and frightening at the same time. The story takes the reader through the shadier side of the celebrity life which, although it saddens me, doesn't completely shock me. Drugs, blackmail, prostitution and sex seem to go hand in hand with greed. Greed (or should I say lust?) for power is just as dangerous as greed for money. Both of these deadly sins run rampant throughout the story. The mastermind behind the sex slavery business is shrouded in mystery for most of the story, and it kept me guessing for quite some time. However, my own ""spidey"" sense, honed by reading dozens of mysteries over the years, tingled, and my suspicions were proved correct as to who the culprit was when they were revealed.What struck me most about this story is how complicit the pop star was in all of this. Her motivation in contacting Jack, and then diving straight back into the seedy underbelly, confused me. I don't want to sound harsh, but if someone is asking for help, they usually want to get out of the mess they are in, not go jumping back in without a backward glance! But, I suppose, that's the only life she knows and is too scared to change. Unfortunately, the abused don't always seek safety - better the devil and all that.As I have said previously, I am not one for reading celebrity gossip magazines or articles in the newspaper, so most of the ""real"" celebrities supposedly sprinkled throughout the story made no difference to me with regards to the tale. However, to say that this book is Joe Mott's debut novel, you can tell he has been in the writing trade for many years. His characters are very lifelike and his descriptions of places and scenes were extremely vivid; I had no problem in picturing them in my mind's eye. Though the story is fast paced, I did find some scenes slowed the flow down a bit; especially those with the mysterious mastermind and his henchmen in. Nevertheless, I would definitely consider reading more of this author's books in the future.I recommend this book if you love mysteries, thrillers or suspense novels. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XBOCUM176QPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008LDQ26Y#wasThisHelpful","R1XBOCUM176QPL","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third book in a series that follows Jessie, a teen with a hearing impediment. I really enjoyed this story!Jessie McIntyre is a character I could relate to easily. She has faced many difficult challenges over the last couple of years, what with being bullied at school and competing at Karate tournaments. Now heading towards her eighteenth birthday, Jessie is finding life even more complicated. Will she overcome the obstacles placed in her way? And can she find out what her destiny has in store?After finishing Compass, I was eager to start reading Destiny and started reading it as soon as I could. I have thoroughly enjoyed watching Jessie overcome more than her fair share of problems over the series. She is a very determined young woman, but I found her insecurity caused by her hearing is one issue that seems to hold her back at times.This story sees Jessie trying her hand at working, first at a art class as an assistant, and then as a volunteer candy-striper at the hospital. I can remember my first attempts at the job market; I remember how nervous I was, worried I would make a complete idiot of myself. Therefore, I could certainly understand and sympathize with Jessie as she tries to figure out the intricacies of those jobs and the people she interacts with.She also is determined to get her black belt in Karate, which I admire her for. It takes a lot of dedication to attain a black belt, and Jessie seems to have that in spades.However, as I was reading this story, I couldn't help but feel that Jessie is actually suffering with depression. I don't know if I am reading too much between the lines into the story by saying this, but I had been reading a presentation my sister had asked me to look at on her behalf about depression. It got me to thinking about Jessie (as I was reading this story at the time) - the bullying, her hearing issues and her attitude at times, and it all seemed to fit. However, as I am not meant to be psychoanalyzing her, but reviewing the book, I will leave that for another day.The story is again well written, and the scenes are very easy to picture. I did, however, feel that the scene with the stalker was wrapped up a bit too quickly. I think I would have liked to see a bit of a tussle between the guy and Jessie, where she did Karate to protect herself. But, as this promotes violence, even in self defense, I suppose it was best to leave it out. The character development is fantastic and I could see each character, whether already known or new, in my minds eye with clarity. I certainly didn't think much of Bob, another volunteer at the hospital, but I really liked Nicole and Sarah. They seemed nice enough and likable.I have enjoyed watching Jessie and Ethan's relationship grow closer over the series. They have had their ups and downs, as most couples do, but I love the way they interact; you can almost feel their love for each other, it's that palpable. There is a twist that I didn't see coming in this tale, and it made me feel rather sad. I will not say what it was, as I feel that would be a spoiler and will leave it to you to decide if you would like to find out what the twist is. I reached the end of the story and felt sad that it had ended. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find there is a bonus short story called ""Happy Holidays... Or Is It?"" to read. I really enjoyed that story, as it gave Jessie a chance to do something on her own, away from her family and even Ethan. I think it gave Jessie the opportunity to explore her environment more, and become more confident and ""grown up"" as she did things for herself.Jennifer Gibson has written an intriguing and interesting YA story based in truth. I found the story a quick read. I love the way the story flows from scene to scene; it's extremely fluid and the descriptions were described in such a way that I could picture them with ease. This is an author I am looking forward to adding to my favourite authors list.I highly recommend this book to young readers aged 12 to 16, and to adults who love reading younger YA romance or coming of age novels. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SLIQ78X6T2ON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DYAPLDO#wasThisHelpful","R1SLIQ78X6T2ON","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in a series that follows Jessie, a teen with a hearing impediment. I really enjoyed this story!Jessie McIntyre is a character I could relate to somewhat. I really liked her when I first met her in Sway, but also didn't like her at the same time. In Sway, she had built a wall around herself to prevent being hurt emotionally by bullies and could be rather surly and unfriendly to people in turn. Meeting Ethan brought her out of her shell somewhat and, along with her hobby of Karate, she finds herself opening up to new experiences. In Compass, we find her facing new challenges.I think I like this book a lot better than Sway because of Jessie's growth, both emotionally as well as physically. She is not as inwardly focused on herself, and is taking interest in things and people around her. Her angst at being bullied is quite understandable, and watching her deal with that, and entering Karate contests to test herself and her abilities, made me feel quite proud of her. But watching her teaching Karate class (along with Ethan) at Camp Balsam (a summer camp for kids with various disabilities or disorders) is where she began to shine; showed me there is so many layers to this young woman. She has a natural talent and ability to teach. This book (and story arc) has an almost spiritual feel to it, especially Jessie's dreams of her spirit guide, who also happens to be her cat, Peter Parker.The story is not especially fast paced, but when I reached the end I felt quite sad; I wanted to keep reading! Luckily, there is a bonus story called Awake, which is in the form of a dream, but I really enjoyed reading it. I'm looking forward to reading Destiny, the next book, soon.Jennifer Gibson has written an intriguing and interesting YA story based in truth. I found the story a quick read.

"This is a wonderful young adult romance/coming of age novel. I loved it!Jessie is a great character. I did like her, but hated her attitude at times, especially when she is full of angst, as she comes across as bratty. She is a fifteen (turning sixteen) year old teen with a hearing impairment. This is her story as she deals with school bullies, her hearing issues and the possibility of having a boyfriend.This story is very easy to get into. The characters are well developed, and the story is very relatable. The scenes are very well described, and I could picture them with ease. I could understand Jessie's angst at being bullied, having been bullied myself at school for wearing glasses. However, I felt that the bullies would have picked on her regardless of her ""disability"". Children, especially those of middle grade and teenage (not all, I grant you) years can be extremely hurtful or judgmental about their peers due to differences that they see as ""not cool"". I think that Jessie herself is extremely judgmental towards her classmates in turn. She doesn't go out of her way to be friendly, and is extremely prickly towards anyone who even tries to befriend her. She has an almost visible brick wall built up, which I am surprised that Ethan manages to get through. The closest she has to a friend is her cat, Peter Parker. However, Ethan does get through her brick wall, and we get to see the inner Jessie as she opens up.Not having a hearing impairment myself, I couldn't quite relate to the story, but I did find myself intrigued at how someone like Jessie relates to the rest of the world. In a way, there is no difference (in my eyes) whether you have a hearing impairment or a sight one. We, as human beings, see the world in similar but completely different ways. Our experiences shape our lives, but we have the ability to either go with the flow, or stand ridged and be set in our ways. Jessie is still trying to find out where she fits in the world, and it is interesting watching her character grow throughout the story.

"This is the sixth book in the Eternal Mates series. I loved it!Owen Nightingale is a fantastic character. I really liked him. He is charming and likable. He is a very determined person, who refuses to back down from a fight to protect weaker humans, fae, shifters and demons from bullies or other undesirable characters. He is a shifter hunter turned mercenary, with a secret that, if exposed, could bring unwanted attention. When he sets eyes on a sexy shifter in a bar, Owen realises that his life may never be the same again.Cait is also a fantastic character. I really liked her. She is a Hellcat, one of the most rarest of the cat shifters. She is feisty and extremely independent, and has no intention of being captured and collared. Whilst evading a Hellcat male intent on doing just that, she meets Owen and enlists his help.I have been looking forward to reading this book for some time. So much so that when I found out that it was up for pre-order, I quickly bought my copy.I started to read the story and was quickly sucked in. The story is told from the points of view of Owen and Cait. The chemistry between them is electrifying; sparks fly almost immediately. I love the scene in the bar with the Hellfire drink, I could imagine that scene quite clearly. I love the description of the Hellcats; they sound absolutely beautiful, and made me wish they were real! The scenes are written in such a way that I could picture them with clarity. There are a few previous characters who make cameos: Kyter, Cavanaugh and one of my favourite elves, Bleu. I am looking forward to reading Bleu's story; his and Taryn's. The little bit which is slipped in to this story piqued my interest.Marius, I'm sad to say, didn't strike me as villainous as he should have done. He is an opportunist and a piece of scum, but not especially evil. But, the unnamed fallen angel is one mean dude!The fight scenes are back to their normal exciting and nail biting descriptions; I found myself completely hooked!I reached the end of the book and was a little disappointed that it had finished; I felt the story was too short and I wanted to keep reading. However, I am now looking forward to reading Taken by a Dragon as soon as possible.Felicity Heaton has written another fast paced, sexy paranormal romance that I thoroughly enjoyed! I love her writing style, which flows effortlessly from scene to scene. She is number one on my favourite authors list!I do not recommend this book to younger readers due to the extremely HOT and explicit sexual scenes. However, I highly recommend this book (and series) if you love sexy paranormal romances full of vampires, elves, werewolves, cat shifters, succubi, incubi, angels, dragons and demons. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R152BHRK6OYEIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOS5Y0G#wasThisHelpful","R152BHRK6OYEIY","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been wanting to read this book for quite some time; in fact, ever since it was first released way back in 2012. I bought a paperback copy of it. However, due to my rather large reading list, it has taken me this long to get to read it. This is Megan Miranda's debut novel and has, since I bought this book, been re-released. Therefore, I can only review the copy I have; I really enjoyed it!Delaney Maxwell is a wonderful character; I really liked her. She has a very down to earth personality, but I felt that I would have liked a bit more character development for her, as she didn't seem to have the reactions a normal human would have done in her situation i.e. anger, grief, sadness etc. She is a normal teen, enjoying a day out with friends when a freak accident brings her life crashing around her ears. What happened to her during those eleven minutes beneath the ice?I started to read this book, and did not put it down until I had finished it five hours later. I found myself completely enthralled by the story. I have read about, and watched documentaries of real life stories of people who have had a similar (but not the same) experience; it is a miracle that those people escaped the jaws of death with only some or very little in the way of damage caused by the extreme cold. Others have not been so lucky.The heroine in this story is a walking, talking miracle in her own right. Being ""dead"" for eleven minutes has given Delaney the ability to be able to detect when someone is about to die. I'm not sure if this is a curse or a gift in Delaney's eyes, as I feel the author didn't go into enough depth about this, which gave the character an ambivalent feel. Her reactions felt wishy-washy and not strong enough. Where was the anger? The fear? If I was the one affected, I'm sure I would have had tantrums or be totally scared out of my mind and be a snotty mess. Delaney didn't have hysterics, but carried on as if it was normal to have this ability. Personally, I think she took it too calmly.Troy Varga is a very enigmatic character. I couldn't make up my mind as to whether he is a good guy who is emotionally damaged by his ""gift/curse"" and makes bad choices, or the bad guy; his actions were dubious at best, and murderous at worst.I did, however, find myself liking Delaney's friend and next door neighbour, Decker. He may act like an idiot at times, but he has a good heart and I fell a little in love with him myself.The story is full of twists and turns, with lots of suspense as to who Troy is and what he wants with Delaney. There is also a few shocking moments, and one scene containing Carson which had me in tears. Therefore, a tissue may be required for some readers. I did find the scene prior to the ending a bit of a let down, as I didn't expect it to end in that way. However, I can understand why Troy did what he did, even though I don't agree with the way he went about it. I love Delaney's and Decker's growing relationship, even though there were a few sticky moments where angst got in the way; I am glad that they managed to sort out their issues.Megan Miranda has written a wonderful debut YA romance novel. I did find some of the characters a bit lacking in development and needed fleshing out a bit more. Her writing style was fast paced enough to keep me hooked, but the flow was not as fluid as it could have been. However, I cannot say if these issues have been fixed since I read the original and not the re-released version. I am now looking forward to reading her other books, Hysteria and Vengeance, as soon as I can.I recommend this book if you love YA romance novels full of mystery and suspense. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X75N97KGF0QB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006RHB3P6#wasThisHelpful","R2X75N97KGF0QB","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A friend of mine recommended this book to me, as she knew I loved Young Adult Fantasy. I'm glad she did, because I LOVED it!Nick Hawthorne is a normal fifteen year old teen. I liked him a lot. He is full of himself, as teens tend to be and a bit angst-y. But when he becomes involved in a dangerous quest in a parallel world called Albion, Nick finds out that monsters are real and he's braver than he thought.I started to read this book and was quickly hooked. The story is told from several points of view, although Nick is the main character. Sir Benedict Harkness is a fabulous character. He is a father figure to young Nick and takes him under his wing. Eyes of The Wind is Sir Benedict's brother, who is also known as The Rider, and is enigmatic and stoic, but incredibly brave. I liked this character too. I really liked Steel and Feydeau; they have completely different temperaments, but are fast friends. And they, along with Sir Benedict, Gwyn ap-Rhys (the Dodman) and Eyes of The Wind make up a team that strongly reminded me of the motley crew of J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Lord of The Rings'. There are several other characters that have a cameo in the story, such as the hermit Crystaljack, and the foxy (literally) Bracken-le-Rose, not to mention Harlequin, but they all left an impression on me and had me wondering if I would see them again.The character development is wonderful; I felt like I knew them all, even the scary and deadly witch, Nightshade - who doesn't make an appearance until late in the book - but whose presence is felt all the way throughout the story. The world development of Albion is wonderful too. The author gave it a medieval feeling to it, with it's horses, wagons and fire torches; I loved it! There is plenty of action, danger and adventure, which kept me turning the pages. However, I did find some of the words the author used (correctly I may add) an odd choice. I have an extensive vocabulary, but even I had to look up a couple of words that are actually old English in origin and are not widely in use today. But, in a way, these old words gave the story an authenticity and originality that is missing from today's fantasy novels.The final showdown between Nick and Nightshade is a little anti-climatic (or so I felt) after a huge battle scene between Eyes of The Wind and the Ilnure (Nightshade's familiar), but it left me wanting to read the next book in the series as soon as possible to find out what happens next!Craig Booker has written a fantastic debut young adult fantasy.The author blends English myths and legends, cultural history and fantasy in such a way, it sucks a reader in. I love his fast paced writing style, but found some of the story did not flow as well as it could have, due to abrupt changes, or slower flow, in scenes. There is one scene which seems to slow the story down a bit too much in my opinion; this scene is where Sir Benedict visits his home and he finds a magickal book. I understand the importance of this scene, but the slower pace it portrayed threw the story off it's pace. Other readers may not feel the same way, so I will leave it to them to decide for themselves. This is an author to watch, and I will follow his career with interest.I highly recommend this book to teens aged 14 and above, and to adults who love reading YA Fantasy. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12RFJ2AMO6IR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJRJYD0#wasThisHelpful","R12RFJ2AMO6IR3","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a fan of Miss Mae's work after listening to Ahoy Gum Drop on audio book. When I found out that she had a who-dun-it also on audio, I was intrigued and downloaded a copy. I am glad I did, because I LOVED it!The story is narrated by Marcus Hyde. He did an impressive job in bringing this story and characters to life. His speaking voice was clear and concise and his interpretation of the characters mannerisms and affectations came across strongly. His villain's voice sent shiver's down my spine! I don't think I would like to meet that character in a dark alley!Dorcy Edwards is a wonderful character. I liked her very much She is a young lady who has only recently been employed as a kitchen maid to Mr. Davenport. After finding him murdered, she flees the house and finds herself thrown into a maelstrom of mystery, suspense and danger. Oh, and a hint of romance!This is a relatively short story, lasting only four hours and thirty-four minutes, but there is a lot happening in that time! It is packed with suspense, mystery and danger, with the glimmer of a chance at romance for the main character. This story is set in London, during the time of Jack The Ripper in 1888. The story is told from the point of view of Dorcy Edwards. There are several interesting characters in this intriguing tale. Mr. & Mrs. Butterfield, the couple who sponsored Dorcy when she first arrived in London. Mr. Garath Davenport - the son of the murdered man - who makes Dorcy's heart flutter, but he has secrets of his own. Can she trust him? And Alice, another maid from Mr. Davenport's house.This is an excellent who-dun-it. The plot is wonderfully described in such detail. I could picture the scenes with clarity. I loved the way the story unfolded. The story is full of twists and turns, with red herrings aplenty. Suspicion and fear makes Dorcy unsure who to trust, which makes the reader feel the same way. I had no clue as who attacked Dorcy for quite a while, but I took an educated guess before the culprit was finally identified. I am glad that my deductive reasoning proved correct; I would have been completely shocked if I had guessed wrongly. But, the author certainly knows how to keep the suspense and mystery going! I reached the end of the book and felt sad that it wasn't just a little bit longer. However, it only made me want to read more of this author's books in future.Miss Mae has written a wonderful mystery. I love her writing style, which is fast paced and exciting, and the flow is wonderful. I am a huge fan of mystery novels, and one of my favourite authors in this genre is Agatha Christie. However, Miss Mae is an author that I will be keeping an eye on in the future.I highly recommend this book to young readers who love mystery and suspense, and to adults who love a classic who-dun-it and are looking for a quick, but highly entertaining read. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QEBNPC3E5LAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1452808155#wasThisHelpful","R3QEBNPC3E5LAF","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a complimentary copy of this book from the author in return for an honest review.This is the second book in the Redemption series. I really enjoyed it.Franco Callahan is a fantastic character. I first met him in the first book of the series, Logan's Redemption, but he only had a cameo appearance in it; he was only in a couple of scenes. I was glad of the opportunity to get to know him better. He is a playboy, but only on the surface. Underneath this facade, he is a very serious and determined man, with a surprising gentleness which made me melt. He has now taken over the family business, but a threat against his life has him scared. That is, until Jo Fortune stepped into his life. Now he's afraid of losing his heart.Josephine (Jo) Fortune is also a fantastic character. I really liked her; she is very capable and determined, and is dangerous in her own way. Again, this is another character which made a cameo appearance in the first book. Jo is more comfortable in her fatigues and combat boots, but to keep her boss's brother-in-law safe, she will have to step out of her comfort zone. Falling for her charge is not in the plan, but as she gets to know him better, she finds herself more and more attracted to him. However, Jo has not had a happy childhood and an event in her past threatens to drive her into running away before her heart gets broken by the sexy playboy.I started to read this story and was quickly swept into it. The story is told from the points of view of both Franco and Jo. I am a sucker for romance novels with a bit of mystery, intrigue and danger in them; this book has it in spades. The action and danger begins almost straight away and grabbed my attention. The mystery and suspense surrounding the threats to Franco's life kept me wondering. There are several twists and turns, as well as red herrings, which kept me guessing right up until the end. I loved the way the characters interacted; Franco's arrogance and Jo's stubbornness kept each other in a pressure cooker filled with passion. When it erupts, both of them are scorched. There are some other characters in the story, but they somehow feel like background extra's, with very little character development. But, we do get to meet Franco and Doriana's cousin Anita again, and Harris, Jo's partner and friend. We also get to meet Detective Dave Morelli, who is in charge of the investigation into the attempts on Franco's life. Again, this is a rather formulaic romance and similar to many other romance novels I have read over the years, but I really did enjoy it from beginning to end. I am now looking forward to reading Luke's Temptation as soon as possible.Cara Marsi has written a wonderful contemporary romance. I love her fast paced writing style and the flow was wonderful. Her characters are not perfect and have flaws, but this makes them seem more realistic and alive in my opinion.

"This is the fifth book in the Eternal Mates Series. I loved it!Cavanaugh is a fantastic character. I was intrigued by him when he was first introduced in Kyter and Iolanthe's story, Hunted by a Jaguar. It has been a pleasure getting to know him better. He is a snow leopard shifter, who has left his pride and his responsibilities as pride Alpha, so that he could be with the woman he knows to be his fated female. When Eloise unexpectedly turns up in Kyter's bar, Underworld, Cavanaugh finds himself facing a difficult decision.Eloise is also a fantastic character. I liked her very much. She is also a snow leopard shifter and has travelled a long way to find Cavanaugh and bring him back to the pride. Can she convince Cavanaugh to take back the title of pride Alpha in time?I have been eagerly awaiting the release of this book, as I have come to love this series. I started to read the story and was quickly pulled in, and didn't put the book down until I had finished.The story is told through the points of view of both Cavanaugh and Eloise, which gives the reader a chance to see their thoughts and feelings. The story is very well told and the descriptions of people and places brought the tale to life. However, I don't know why, but I found the fight scenes not as vibrant or as exciting as they would normally be. The author is usually very good at describing battle scenes, but I felt there was something lacking in the action on the main fight scene. However, I think it's because it was only a fight and not an all out war that made me feel a bit short changed; I'm used to epic battles in this series! That being said, the story was full of the usual heat and passion I have come to expect from the characters in this series. I'm surprised that the snow didn't melt due to the heat generated by them!This story had a gentler romance arc compared to the other books in the series, as Eloise is more subservient in demeanor (that is, unless she forgets herself and speaks her mind), due to her belief that this is how a lower-ranked female should behave towards her Alpha. Cavanaugh, on the other hand, wants an equal to be by his side, but he is too scared to push Eloise due to the trauma she faced at the hands of the stand-in Alpha. I think he underestimates her inner strength; I wanted to egg him on to push her into standing up to him more.I reached the end of the book and gave a huge sigh of satisfaction. I am now looking forward to reading the next book in the series, Bitten by a Hellcat, as soon as possible.Felicity Heaton has written another fast paced, sexy paranormal romance that I thoroughly enjoyed! I love her writing style, which flows effortlessly from scene to scene. She is number one on my favourite authors list!I do not recommend this book to younger readers due to the extremely HOT and explicit sexual scenes. However, I highly recommend this book (and series) if you love sexy paranormal romances full of vampires, elves, werewolves, cat shifters, succubi, incubi, angels, dragons and demons. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q7V8MV7Y9S8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RS3GF9W#wasThisHelpful","R3Q7V8MV7Y9S8K","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent a book recommendation by a friend for this book. I read the blurb and became intrigued, so I decided to give this book a go. I am glad I did, because I loved it!Katherine Anderson is a wonderful character. I liked her a lot. She is a food critic, with the power to make or break a restaurant or caf. After coming home early and finding her fianc in a compromising position, she decides to take the honeymoon trip to Italy in an attempt to figure out what to do. Meeting a charming Italian man wasnt part of her plans, but Tony Bertalucci is unlike any other man she has met.Massimo Tony Lupito Bertalucci is also a wonderful character. I liked this charismatic and charming man. His family has been involved in the production of olive oil for several generations, but after an attack by a black market cartel that left his family dead and him running scared, he sees Katherine as his salvation.I started to read this story and found it to be an exciting and thrilling read, which hooked me from the first page. I could fully picture the story in my own mind with clarity, due to the descriptive writing of the author. I have never been to Italy, but the way it is described, especially the city of Florence, I felt like I was there. But, the descriptions also made me feel sad that I really wasnt! I am seriously considering visiting Italy for real.The story is told through not only Katherines and Tonys points of view, but also through the eyes of an American FDA agent, Special Agent Daniel Thompson. I liked this agent, as he is dedicated and seems to be honourable. He and his Italian compatriot, Agent Andreo Manchetti are investigating the cartel and the connection to the Bertalucci family. The story is full of twists and turns, and has a villain that chilled my blood! He is completely psychotic, and his identity is a total shock! The feeling of terror, paranoia and disbelief that Tony feels is palpable and had me jumping at perfectly normal noises at home. It also had me feeling sorry for Katherine, as she had no idea through most of the story about the danger following Tony. But, once she is involved, I was completely in awe of her level head and inner strength. I am not sure if I would be so calm in a similar situation, but I suppose since her life had already imploded, she just took it in her stride. I did find myself in tears several times throughout the story, so a tissue may be required. I reached the end of the story and nearly screamed out loud in surprise, because there is a huge twist. I couldnt wait to see what happens next, so I have downloaded Shattered, the next book in the trilogy, and I hope to start reading it as soon as possible.Jennifer Burrows has written a fantastic, intense and suspenseful thriller. I love her fast paced writing style and the flow of the story is wonderful. I am definitely planning on reading more books by this author in the future.Due to scenes of a sexual nature that are a little on the explicit side, as well as scenes of violence, I do not recommend this book for younger readers or those of a sensitive nature. However, I highly recommend this book to readers who love romantic thrillers, mysteries or suspense novels.

"This is an intriguing, mystery/thriller. I saw a review for this book on a blog I follow. The review was rather scathing of it, which piqued my interest. I decided to see what all the fuss was about and downloaded it in audio book format.The book is narrated by Tanya Eby. Other people who have listened to the audio book have commented that her narration was too slow, but I found her narration quite enjoyable. I do admit that her attempt at the British accent was off, but I thought she deserved kudos for trying. Not everyone is gifted with the ability to mimic accents, which is the hardest part to achieve when speaking or reading out loud; even trained actors struggle. Nevertheless, her speaking voice is pleasant to listen to, and is clear and concise.Deborah Miller is a wonderful character. I really liked her. She is a museum curator, who usually sits behind a desk, but has been sent to a remote village in the Mexican Yucatan to oversee the excavation site of Ek Balam. She finds herself involved in a thrilling mystery, with danger lurking not too far away.I started to listen to this book with an open mind, even considering the rather poor reviews on Audible. I found myself quickly pulled into the story and enjoying it. It's a thrilling mystery, with several twists and turns. The story is mostly told through the eyes of Deborah, but there are a few other characters who have a say. This, I feel, gave the story a more intriguing view, as it allows the reader to ""see"" what is happening elsewhere. However, as some of the other reviewers have stated, the story tends to be a bit long winded and seems to drag at times.The history and Mayan artifacts seem to be well researched and described by the author, but some of the plot or sub plots seem a bit implausible. I can understand how jewels may have been transported to Mexico from England all those years ago, but I couldn't see what the CIA, MI5 and a Serbian arms dealer would want with a gem which had no monetary value or even material use outside of costume jewellery. Even if it could be used in a weapon, the refractory capability of such a poor quality gem would render the weapon useless. Only flawless gems with glass like qualities would work in modern lasers, not cloudy ones (or maybe I am mistaken to believe this is the case, as I was never very good at physics). That being said, the story kept me hooked and, after a thrilling chase from the jungle to England and back again, it crescendos into a massive gun fight between several characters, with Deborah trapped in between. The mystery of who the killer in the camp was had me guessing for quite a while at first, as there were several red herrings along the way. However, when their identity was revealed, I wasn't really surprised; I had a feeling it was that person for most of the story as they had a motive.The story ended satisfactorily and left me feeling happy.A.J. Hartley has written an intriguing thriller, which I really did enjoy. His writing style wasn't particularly as fast paced compared to other authors I have read, but his descriptive ability allowed me to picture the scenes with clarity. The flow was okay, but some of the scenes were a little on the long side, which made the story drag. However, I would definitely consider reading more of his books in the future.I recommend this book if you love mystery, thrillers or suspense genres. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BRET3TAIKP8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007CJUA84#wasThisHelpful","R1BRET3TAIKP8A","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a complimentary copy of this book from the author in return for an honest review.This is the first book in the Redemption Series. I really enjoyed it!Doriana Callahan is a wonderful character, although sometimes I wanted to knock some sense into her. She is a single mother, with a rebelling teenager. However, her stubbornness in accepting help of any kind, didn't endear her to me. Her family are supportive of her, but she seems to resent their meddling (which I can understand up to a point) and is terrified that her family would find out the identity of her son's father. After sixteen years, I doubt they would even care anymore, but who can say? When her father employs Logan Tanner to investigate the sabotage of his business, Doriana's life is thrown into turmoil.Logan Tanner is also a wonderful character. He is very determined, focused and dangerous in his own way. He left town sixteen years ago after an event that made him run. He may have done something bad in the past, but he was only protecting himself in self defense. This, amongst other things, convinced me that he is a good and noble man. Now living in Tuscon, he runs a very successful private investigation and security business. He's back in Philadelphia, but being near Doriana reminds him of what he left behind. Can he find the saboteur and leave with his heart intact?I started to read this story and was hooked from the first page. The story is told from the points of view of both Logan and Doriana. I am a sucker for romance novels with a bit of mystery, intrigue and danger in them; this book has it in spades. There are some interesting characters in this book. Dan Callahan is an extremely sharp businessman. I liked him a lot. Franco is Doriana's brother and a bit of a playboy, who never seems to take anything seriously. And then there is fifteen year old Josh. I liked this troubled teen. He is trying to find where he fits in and, although he makes a few mistakes, he has a good heart.The danger is not as imminent and right there as if this is a thriller, but the intrigue and mystery as to who is sabotaging the business had me turning the pages. The chemistry between Doriana and Logan is definitely smoldering, even after sixteen years apart. Their sexual tension permeates the story and when they finally get back together, it's extremely HOT. I did find Doriana's incessant worries about Logan finding out about Josh being his son to be a bit of an overreaction on her part. I don't have any experience with having children, but I don't think that Logan would have ever considered taking Josh away from her; it didn't fit in with my impression of his character. This is a rather formulaic romance and similar to many other romance novels I have read over the years, but I really did enjoy it from beginning to end. However, there are a few twists that surprised me. I am now looking forward to reading the second book in the series, Franco's Fortune, as soon as I can.Cara Marsi has written a wonderful contemporary romance. I love her fast paced writing style and the flow was wonderful. Her characters are not perfect and have flaws, but this makes them seem more realistic and alive in my opinion. I am looking forward to reading more of this author's work in the future.Due to scenes that are a little explicit in nature (although not as explicit as some books I have read), I do not recommend this book for readers under the age of 16. However, I highly recommend this book if you love steamy contemporary romances. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SEN91RIBOXJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0040JI3PG#wasThisHelpful","R2SEN91RIBOXJ9","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a complimentary copy of this book from the author in return for an honest review.This is the first book in a trilogy. I absolutely LOVED it!Renee the Righteous is a character I wasn't sure I liked or not. One moment I wanted to slap her, the next I was cheering her on! She is shockingly self-absorbed, even arrogant to the point of rudeness; no wonder she has very little in the way of friends. She sees people as total idiots and not worth her attention, that is until she needs to find someone to help her find and claim the ""Sword of Power"". When she meets Guy Smokes, a young barkeep with dreams of owning his own pub, she gets him to agree to help her.Guy Smokes is actually a fantastic character. I really liked him. He is gentle and kind. I don't know if it was his naivety of the world (he had only ever been in Mudville), or he had been affected by the family business of being ""weedmen"" (yes, it's what it sounds like), but when he agreed in helping Renee, I wanted shake him and ask what he thought he was doing! Nevertheless, he doesn't realise what he's gotten himself into. But he soon finds out!This story is very difficult to review without giving out any spoilers, but I will do my best.It is told in the fashion of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy; I was hooked from the first page. However, I felt like a rabbit or deer, caught in the headlights of a car which is heading in my direction - completely transfixed. It is a highly entertaining read, with lots of humour and laugh out loud, witty events and comments. However, it also made me cringe with the dark humour that also dotted the story. There are so many different characters I lost count, from fairies to trolls, dwarves, unicorns and even a dragon. However, the most scariest characters were the lustful nun assassins! Nuns' and assassins are two words you don't normally see together in a sentence, but the author has combined them to create a group of religious zealots who will attack and abuse unwary men and force them to have ""relations"" with them. I was like, ""huh?"", but they actually were much more terrifying than any dragon I have come across. I certainly wouldn't like to meet these nuns! If I ever had the misfortune to travel to Quaal, I would hightail it out of there faster than the speed of light! I would suggest you do the same. Unless, of course, you want to be ravaged by nun assassins that is!There are plenty of sword fights, danger and action, with several twists and turns to keep it interesting. Lord Asher Dark is a rather pathetic villain in my opinion. He is incredibly narcissistic. In fact, he and Renee would have made an interesting romantic match. I found myself putting the book down whenever there was an eye-rolling moment, which was often, but I would quickly pick it back up again to find out what was happening next. What really got to me was Guy's friendship of Renee. Even when she was being a total donkey's bottom to him, he stayed. He is a truly good man, with a huge heart and a tonne of loyalty; I wish he was my friend!When I reached the end of the book, I was slightly devastated, but I am looking forward to continuing the trilogy and reading the second book, An Affair with Wizards when it is released.Melanie Hatfield has written a fast paced, entertaining and humorous read that had me giggling and smiling from ear to ear. I love her writing style, which is full of wit and snarky comments, and the flow was wonderful. As this is her debut novel, which combines her love of comedy and fantasy, I can't wait to see what else she comes up with.Although there is mention of ravishing and other sexual situations, there is nothing explicit. There is also mention of fighting and violence, but it is not gory. Therefore, I recommend this book to readers from the age of 15 upwards and to readers who love humourous fantasy like or similar to The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFO8ZM793PLAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008DGH8HG#wasThisHelpful","RFO8ZM793PLAZ","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A friend recommended this book to me, but I also received a recommendation from Audible due to my taste in YA dystopian science fiction. Therefore, with my curiosity piqued, I downloaded an audio copy to listen to; I really enjoyed it!This audio book is narrated by Phoebe Strole and Brandon Espinoza. They both did a wonderful job in bringing the story and the characters to life. Although, I did find the switch from female to male voice a little jarring at first (I am used to listening to one narrator only in most stories), but soon enjoyed the different points of view.Cassie (short for Cassiopeia) Sullivan is a sixteen year old girl on the run from ""the others"" - aliens who have invaded the bodies of certain humans, and are the start of the 5th wave in a war to take over the planet. I really liked this character, she has a lot of spirit and determination. However, she also has an irritating habit of being a bit whine-y. I suppose teen angst is expected in characters this age, but what really bugged me about this character is her issue with trust. I won't go into specifics, as that will be a spoiler, but her easy acceptance of a character after all she had been through just didn't sit right with me.There are three guys as main characters in this story, and each of them have their own quirks and, in the case of the older boys, secrets.Evan Walker is not all that he seems. He hides a dangerous secret, but when he meets Cassie, something within him changes. However, this character is still a mysterious enigma, even when his secret is revealed. What was it about Cassie that made him change his mind? Why was he alone, rather with others like him who argued against colonization? These and other questions that buzzed in my head remain unanswered as the story continued. Perhaps they will be answered in the next story? I hope so, because I would love to get to understand what he and the others hope to achieve.Ben ""Zombie"" Parish is a young man dying from a deadly virus they call ""the Plague"" from the fourth wave when we meet him. Rescued and healed, he joins the fight in the war against the ""infected"" - humans who have an alien infesting their brain. I really liked this character. He is quite bright and determined, not to mention charming. He also has a huge heart and takes a young five year old boy under his wing.Sam (Sammy) is Cassie's young brother, who finds himself being part of Squad 53 and being called ""Nugget"". I really loved this character! He is so sweet, and what he goes through at such a young age made my heart wrench; I wanted to give him a huge hug! It made me wonder if children this age are as resilient as they say, or would he have problems later on in his life? And then there is bear! I love bear. He is Sammy's one comfort in a world gone to hell, but he gives it to Cassie; I cried when he did that!This story is very compelling and the characters are quite lifelike. However, having read a few other dystopian novels, some of the scenario's didn't quite ring as believable (mostly the alien invasion and their motivation behind it). But, there are some scarily possible human ones that I could see happening in the not so distant future. Cassie's and Evan's relationship also doesn't seem to have the ""spark"" necessary to be believable either, which I was surprised at. However, this may because I was listening to the story and not reading it.The fifth wave is actually about trust, or the lack thereof. Do the characters believe and trust everything that they have been told or shown by those in power? Or do they question everything and find themselves actually fighting in a war where lines are blurred and things are not as they seem? This theme runs through the whole story. And there are several twists and turns that make you, as the reader, question everything too, never mind the characters. I found myself riveted by the tale. And, even though the audio book is over twelve hours long, I found myself thinking it was too short! I will still have to wait until 2016 before the movie is released though. In the meantime, I can't wait to get my hands on the sequel, The Infinite Sea.Rick Yancey has written an exciting, fast paced dystopian novel that kept me hooked from the beginning to the end. I love his fast pace writing style and the flow of the story was wonderful. I will definitely read more books by this author in the future.I highly recommend this book if you love YA dystopian novels like Divergent and The Hunger Games, or TV series like Fallen Skies. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21FV5SMBETWU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPSDTNU#wasThisHelpful","R21FV5SMBETWU0","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the fourth book in the Eternal Mates Series. I loved it!First off, I would like to say that I absolutely LOVE the covers used in this series. Every one of them that I have seen are extremely drool worthy, and I would seriously consider hanging these up on my walls if they were available as posters. However, as they are not, I will just have to drool over my Kindle.Kyter is a character who was introduced in the first book of the series, Kissed by a Dark Prince. He intrigued me from the start, so I am now glad to have read his story. I really liked this intense cat! He's so sexy! However, he also has a vulnerability about him I couldn't help but fall in love with. He may be a jaguar shifter, but he has a dark secret, which is not so secret to his pride. He has endured and survived terrible abuse because of this secret, which drove him from his home in the jungle to the bright lights and urban sprawl of London where he runs his nightclub, Underworld. When he sees a mysterious beauty in the street and their paths cross, Kyter is stunned. Can he convince her that they are meant to be together as Eternal Mates?Iolanthe is a fantastic character. I really liked her feisty, take-no-prisoners attitude. She is very independent, and hates giving up control of her life. She is a treasure seeker (think a female Indiana Jones), who has been tasked with finding an artefact for a dangerous client who happens to be a demon. When she meets Kyter, sparks fly, but can she overcome her fear of losing control long enough to find true happiness?I have been eagerly awaiting the release of this book, and pre-ordered my copy as soon as it became available.I started to read it as soon as I could and was quickly swept away. The scenes were so well described that I felt like I was actually there, in amongst the action. I really wanted to get my hands on the village elder of Kyter's pride, due to what he perpetuated and allowed to happen in Kyter's formative years. Sadly, since he is a fictional character, I cannot. But, if these events not happened to a younger Kyter, would he be the same person he is today? I am not so sure. However, as the events did happen, it gave me a deeper appreciation for the man he is now.There is a cameo appearance by Payne, one of the characters from the Erotic Vampire Theatre series. He is only in one scene, so if you blink, you may just miss him. I enjoyed that scene though. Another character makes a welcome appearance in this series, and that character is Bleu. At first, I was surprised by his appearance in the story, but since he is friendly with Kyter and when his relationship to Iolanthe comes to light, it made perfect sense. The reader is also introduced to Cavanaugh, another cat shifter, who works for Kyter at Underworld. He has issues of his own, and I am looking forward to finding out what they are in the future.The story is full of action and danger in the form of demons who happen to also be assassins. What was not fully explained, I felt, was what the demons wanted with Barafnir. However, that was a minor irritant to me. Other readers may not have the same reaction. There are several twists and turns in this tale, which kept me hooked from beginning to end. I found myself on an emotional roller coaster ride throughout the story. There is a fantastic fight scene featuring Kyter, Iolanthe, Bleu and Barafnir, which had me sitting on the edge of my seat. This is one thing I love about this author - her flair for describing battle scenes in such detail that I can not only picture it, but smell it and feel like I'm actually there! I cannot wait for the next book in the series, Craved by an Alpha, which is due to be released soon.Felicity Heaton has written another fast paced, sexy paranormal romance that I thoroughly enjoyed! I love her writing style, which flows effortlessly from scene to scene. She is number one on my favourite authors list!I do not recommend this book to younger readers due to the extremely HOT and explicit sexual scenes.

"This is the first book in the Eternal Guardians series. I really enjoyed it!My sister recommended this series to me as she had read them all (that have been released so far) and thought I would enjoy it. I downloaded this as an audiobook, as it was also recommended by Audible due to my browsing history. How's that for a coincidence?I started to listen and was quickly pulled into the story. The narrator, Elizabeth Wiley, did a wonderful job in telling the story, but I'm afraid her attempt at foreign accents sounded a bit odd and I would have preferred if she hadn't attempted it at all. Nevertheless, her narration was crystal clear and her tone and modulation for the various characters brought them to life.Acacia ""Casey"" Simopolus is a wonderful character. I really liked her. She is not your average wimpy type. She is more kick ass than mousy, which helps when dealing with unruly drunks at the bar she works part time in. But when a mysterious stranger saves her and she later returns the favour, she finds herself thrust into a dangerous world where immortal guardians protect the human population from demons sent from the Underworld.Theron is a character I wasn't sure if I liked or not. To me, he comes across as very controlling, arrogant and sexist (mostly old fashioned sexism) at times, which made me want to punch him, and I'm not normally a violent person. He is a descendant of Hercules and the leader of a group of guardians, who ""police"" the demons sent by Hades to the human realm. He and his fellow Argonauts live in Argolea, a city which is in another dimension. When he meets Casey, his life takes an unexpected turn. Could he kill his soul mate to protect his home?This story is mostly a typical paranormal romance, with lots of action and danger mixed in. However, there are several twists and turns that keep one guessing at what is really going on. There are a few characters other than Casey and Theron who have their say in this book too, which gave this story a more rounded feel. I was intrigued with Isadora, who, although a princess, seemed to have a very weak character and let herself get pushed around, especially by her father King Leonidas. However, she has a core of steel that she did not expose for most of the story, and I actually wrote her off as pathetic because of her lack of back bone. BUT, when she did show her metal, WOW! I certainly have now changed my mind about her! There are also a few other intriguing characters, both in the human world and in Argolea who have caught my interest, but I will leave it to you to discover them for yourselves.One thing I will say about this story is the world building is excellent. The characters are well developed and extremely lifelike. I have always been intrigued with Greek gods and their offspring such as Hercules, whose exploits became legend (or are they myth?) over time. So reading about his descendants, who were with Jason on his voyage for the Golden Fleece, excited me. I am also a huge sucker for paranormal romances in general, so I am looking forward to continuing with this series and I will (hopefully) get to read/listen to Entwined as soon as I can.Elisabeth Naughton has written an exciting start to a series. I love her fast paced writing style and the flow is wonderful. I will be continuing to read this series, but I do have one of her romantic suspense novels sitting on my Kindle, which I hope to now read in the near future too!Due to scenes of a sexual nature that are on the explicit side, I do not recommend this book for younger readers.

"This is the third book in the Thorne Trilogy. I loved it!Monroe Jacobs is a fantastic character! I loved her when I first met her in Redemption (The Redemption Trilogy). She is the best friend of Dayton Blainey. She also happens to be a witch, a very talented one, who is now tied to Luther ""Thorne"" Craig, a hybrid demon.Luther Craig is a complex character. He is very arrogant, power hungry and decidedly sexy! He is also attracted to Monroe (and her soul) more than he would like. I was unsure about this character when I met him in the Redemption series, but getting to know this contrary demon has been great fun!I have been wanting to read this book for some time, but due to a rather large reading list, it has taken me longer to get to read it than I would have liked.I started to read it and was hooked from the first page; I read the book in one sitting. The story is full of action and danger, and kept me turning the pages.Luther is still power hungry, even after winning his mother's kingdom, and even I was surprised at how ambitious his plans were in acquiring more. Monroe is still a powerful witch, but she will have to embrace all of her inherited power to be with Luther and keep them alive from the seven Princes of Hell, who reign over the territories relating to the deadly sins: Pride, Covetousness, Lust, Anger, Gluttony, Envy, and Sloth.Monroe and Luther have a chemistry that burns white hot, even in Hell, and fairly scorches the pages! Their love is passionate and intense. But, they both seem to thrive on it. Some of the bedroom scenes are a little on the explicit side, but not explicitly graphic.I found myself rooting for a demon against other demons. I'm not sure that this is normal, but Luther is one of the ""bad boys"" that seems more good than bad - better the devil (or demon in this case) you know. He may be evil, but he has a charisma that makes him a compelling character and I can see why Monroe is in love with him. I too have a soft spot for him, along with his brother Marcus. There is something about bad boys that women find irresistible. It must be a hold over from the primitive ""survival of the fittest"" gene. However, these boys are definitely knee trembling, even if they are a little darker than the norm.The ending was a little bittersweet. I was sad to reach the end of the book, as it is always sad to say goodbye to characters in a series. However, the story finished satisfactorily and left me feeling happy. I am now looking forward to read more about the Craig brothers (Marcus and Luther) in the fourth book in the Redemption series, Revelation as soon as it is released.R.K. Ryals has written another fantastic YA Paranormal Romance Series. She is one of my favourite authors, and I will read anything written by her. I love her fast paced writing style and the flow was wonderful. However, my only complaint is that I felt that this story was a lot shorter than the previous two books and could have been a bit longer!Due to the use of bad language and violence, as well as scenes of a sexual nature that are a little explicit, I do not recommend this book to younger readers (under 17). But, I HIGHLY recommend this series if you love YA Paranormal Romances with demons, angels, gargoyles, witches and strong characters that come alive on the page. I also highly recommend that you read The Redemption Series (to find out how it all began) and Acropolis Series (Conor Reinhardt's story) too. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD36SKO46I8FH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P4GJ9MK#wasThisHelpful","RD36SKO46I8FH","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a complimentary copy of this book from the author in return for an honest review.This is a collection of poetry written from the heart of the author.I find reading poetry to be a very difficult and subjective experience, which is why I very rarely pick up poetry books. This is one genre I struggle to read and relate to. However, I decided to give this book a try.I started to read the poems and found myself quickly becoming depressed by how they made me feel. I understand that poetry is a tool to express one's thoughts and emotions, but when a poet/author is projecting their darker emotions on a reader who is neither severely depressed or had experience with those darker emotions, it sucks all the enjoyment out of the experience (or so I have found). Granted, the author accurately expressed her emotions into her written words, which was the whole reason for them to be placed into a book in the first place. There are some poems that are not so dark which I liked. One of them was The Old Scottish Bagpipe Player and another was The Moon Dancer. All of the poetry contained in this volume is very descriptive, and the scenes conjured by the author's words are quite vivid in the mind's eye.I am relatively a happy person most of the time and very rarely suffer with severe depression. This makes it extremely difficult for me to relate to the author and, although I sympathize with her emotionally with regards to the issues she has faced in the past, or is facing now, I cannot empathize. Perhaps if I had felt some of the emotions expressed by the author at one time or another, I could relate better to her words. Just like a sad song will resonate with people who have a broken heart, poetry can do the same for people dealing with emotional issues, but only if a person is feeling, or has felt, the same emotions as the author. Unfortunately, the poetry, although well executed, did nothing for me except to make me feel sad and depressed.Melina Turner is a talented poetess and writer. Although this book of poetry is not for me, I am looking forward to reading her short story collections in the not too distant future.I am sorry to say that poetry, especially when it is from the source of a tortured soul suffering with deep depression and loneliness, is not my cup of tea. However, that doesn't mean that other people will not enjoy or relate to this poetry. Therefore, I recommend this book if you love deeply emotive poetry. - Lynn Worton","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RTPKO5KKRH4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFQ61M0#wasThisHelpful","R3RTPKO5KKRH4M","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A friend of mine recommended this book to me, but I was a little bit skeptical about it, as it is not my usual choice of genre. However, I decided to give this book a try. I am glad I did, because I really enjoyed it. I was riveted from the first page.I do not see myself as an especially religious person, but I try to keep an open mind about all religions. I have come to the realisation that I am more of a spiritual believer than I had previously thought. Reading this book has opened my eyes to this. I am not a huge fan of memoirs or even books about religion and spirituality, but this book somehow spoke to my inner being.This book is one woman's journey to find spiritual enlightenment to God using various methods such as prayer, meditation, past life regression and mixtures of East and West religious practices. Her journey is truly inspirational.In a way, her journey has made me realise that things do happen for a reason. I was faced with a life altering decision earlier this year to leave my full time job and pursue my dream of working for myself as an editor and proofreader. I kept having a prodding feeling towards this and, once I finally did put in my notice, the total feeling of rightness that flooded me was freeing. I don't know if this was God's (or the angels') way of saying ""go for it"", or if the universe was doing the same. However, having read this book, I have come to the conclusion that perhaps there is a higher power (call it whatever you will, depending on your religious belief (or lack thereof)) watching us all, directing people who are willing to listen towards the paths they should be on. I am not sure if I believe in fate or destiny, but I am grateful to my friend for recommending this book to me.Patricia Brooks's story is an inspirational tale. Her journey to find her Higher Self has made me want to do the same. I am not sure that my journey will be any easier than hers, but one can only hope that once the journey is over, my life will be richer (spiritually) than it is now.I highly recommend this book as a MUST READ, no matter what religious beliefs you may or may not have. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GOTVPFNWLNFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NRCDRIK#wasThisHelpful","R1GOTVPFNWLNFY","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a complimentary copy of this book from the author in return for an honest review.Dr. Fraya Riber is a fascinating character. I liked her a lot, but she has a tendency to overreact and whine at times. She is a dedicated astronomer and is very much a workaholic. After being saved by a stranger, she finds herself attracted to her rescuer. Unfortunately, there is a side affect from this experience she didn't foresee.Emilio Larran is also a fascinating character. I wasnt sure if I liked him at first, as I found him to be a very domineering and arrogant man. However, he does have some good points; he has a romantic side that made me melt as I got to know him better. Saving a damsel in distress wasnt planned, but Emilio finds himself strangely attracted to her. Could he have found his perfect mate?This is an unusual erotic romance novel, with a unique storyline that captured my attention and held it from the first page. This story is set in the future, 2165 to be precise. The world has survived a biological war, which has created a mutation in the survivors. This mutation has lead to a change in the way people choose their life mate. Suffice it to say, that once someone has found their perfect mate, its for life.The story is told through both Frayas and Emilios points of view, which gives the reader a better understanding of their thoughts and feelings. I did, however, find some of their attitude towards each other a little baffling; they were attracted to each other, but they also seemed to hate each other too, or maybe it was the situation they found themselves in. As the story unfolded however, I really wanted to shake Fraya (or maybe give her a swift kick) to get her to open her eyes instead of being so tunnel visioned about her career. Yes, it is nice to have prestige and be able to work in a field which is still relatively male dominated (even in the future?), but I found her incessant inner monologue about this to be a big irritant and made her seem very selfish; I am not sure who she was trying to convince, the reader or herself.I really liked meeting Emilios grandmother. She is a force to be reckoned with! She has a determination and drive most people would be scared to cross. There are also some other very interesting characters that are introduced. However, I found Gene (Frayas boyfriend) to be a bit insipid and lacking in several ways. His character came across as rather weak and disloyal. I suppose this is why Fraya and Emilios connection seems so intense.The sexual chemistry between Fraya and Emilio is extremely volatile. If they were a Molotov cocktail, they would have caught fire and exploded! As it is, they fairly scorch the pages with their antics in and out of the bedroom. Be warned, its steamy and rather on the explicit side.The story has a few twists and turns that surprised me. There is one scene near the end that completely threw me. I wont go into details, but it is an intense scene full of action and danger. Who knew that ancient Peruvian customs would still be practiced in the future? Certainly not me! The ending felt a bit anti-climatic after all the action, but it finished off the story nicely.Charmaine Pauls has written an entertaining standalone erotic romance. Her characters are lifelike and come alive on the page. I love her fast paced writing style and the flow is wonderful. This is the first book I have read by this author, but I dont think it will be my last. I look forward to reading more of her books in the future.Due to the explicit nature of some of the scenes, as well as use of foul language, I do not recommend this book to readers under the age of 18. I do, however, recommend this book if you love science fiction, erotica or erotic romance genres.

"This is a fantastic, dark and gritty contemporary romance, which happens to be a short novel or novella. I absolutely loved it.Norman Smithson is a fantastic character, although he doesn't see himself in that way. He sees himself as a nobody. However, I didn't see him in that light at all. He has something special in his character which I found charming and appealing. He is steady and dependable, and is genuinely a nice man, who has had a really bad run of luck - he's been made redundant and finds out that his wife has been cheating on him. But, one moment of danger will change his life forever.Rosa is also a wonderful character. I liked her spunk and determination. She is a waitress in a bar and has not had an easy life; she has been trapped in an abusive situation. When a stranger rescues her from her abuser, will she find her ""happily ever after""?I downloaded a copy of this book as soon as it was released and started to read it as soon as I could. I didn't put it down until I had finished it; I was hooked from the first page!The story is told from both Norman's and Rosa's points of view, although Norman seems to be the main character. The characters are very lifelike and the situations they find themselves in are quite realistic. The descriptions of the events and situations brought the story to life and I could picture them with ease.I could relate somewhat to Norman's character; his feelings of inadequacy and impotent rage at the hand that life had dealt him struck a chord in me. However, I have never really been in the same situations as he, so I cannot say whether or not I would have reacted in the same way. I really enjoyed the first scene, where Norman is made redundant. I know that the scene where he was made redundant is not really meant to be comical, or even enjoyable, but it was the juxtaposition of the seriousness of the situation and Norman's thoughts which I found really entertaining. Don't get me wrong, I could feel my heart wrench when his life gets turned upside down, but the way it was written lightened the darkness of the moment wonderfully.The danger Rosa faces in the alleyway is something that a lot of women who are abused are aware of - they live it every day. Not everyone is lucky enough to have a ""Norman"" rescue them though, and many end up dead or worse, hooked on drugs and still living in Hell. What surprised me about Rosa's character is that, although she has been living in her own Hell, she still manages to keep her independent and stubborn streak; she is a fighter and a strong survivor. I found myself in awe of her strength of character as she tries to survive one day at a time.The two main characters both have broken lives, but when they come together and begin to get to know each other, they make each other whole. This story is about loss, hope, love, and finding that one special someone who is worth fighting for. What I love about this story is that these two characters actually rescue each other. It has been a privilege to journey with them as they try to fix their shattered lives.Dianna Hardy has written a fantastic story that touched me deeply.I loved her fast paced writing style and the flow of the story was wonderful. I love reading this author's books, whether in the contemporary or paranormal genres; she has a way of weaving a story together which makes it not only believable, but extremely entertaining. She is one of my favourite authors and I can't wait to read more of her books in the future.Due to scenes of physical abuse and a sensual scene which is a little on the explicit side, I do not recommend this book to younger readers or those of a nervous disposition. I do, however, highly recommend this book as a MUST READ if you love dark, gritty contemporary or new adult romances. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WXP9EJAK1ID7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1GSQ48#wasThisHelpful","R1WXP9EJAK1ID7","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a complimentary copy of this book from the author in return for an honest review.This is a wonderful paranormal romance. I loved it!Elliot Hensworth is a fantastic character. I think I fell in love with him, just a little bit! He made me swoon! He is a warrior and typical alpha male with a large heart, which he tries to hide behind a mask of indifference. He is one of the warrior guardians and works as a type of bounty hunter, tracking the magical creatures who escape through the barrier between the mortal world and the magical one he calls home. When a new neighbour moves in next door, he is unprepared for the attraction he feels towards her.Kelly Jackson is another fantastic character. I liked her a lot. She is spunky and full of sass, but her life hasn't been a bed of roses and has been on the run from her abusive ex. She wasn't looking for romance, but fate (or is it destiny?) has other ideas.This is a wonderful story, which has a similarity to another paranormal romance I read recently in that there are two worlds linked together but separated by a magical barrier. However, this story is completely different from the previous book I read.I started to read this book and was quickly hooked. The story is told through both Elliot's and Kelly's point of view, but a few of the other characters have their say too. I loved the scene where Elliot and Kelly, as well as her children, first meet. I could picture it in my mind's eye perfectly. In fact, the whole story ran like a movie in my head. I love it when I get so engrossed in the story that I feel like I was there, in the midst of the action. And what action! There are a few fight scenes and a terrifying chase scene which kept me glued to the pages. My heart just about broke when Elliot went looking for Rea in the forest. I won't say why, but suffice it to say I shed a few tears during this scene.I fell in love with Kelly's twins, Rea and Renee; they are adorable, and I love how they call Elliot ""Yelliot"" because they can't pronounce his name properly. I lost track of how many times I wanted to sweep them up and give them great big hugs! Like any four year old kids, they get into all sorts of trouble, but I think my heart just about stopped in my chest when they faced Daemon Draco, a dragon from the Realm, who also happens to be their father. He's a nasty character I would love to hate! He's a misogynistic bully of the first order. I would have liked to have given him a piece of my mind! But alas, he is a fictional character and I cannot.I also loved meeting Elliot's family. I was not so keen on Elliot's father, the Commander, as I felt he was a bit of an arrogant jerk; I was not alone in this though, the other characters in the story did too! However, his mother and his sister are lovely and I wouldn't have minded meeting them in the flesh. Their characters give more depth to the story and, although they are from a magical realm, they are his family and give the reader a better understanding of Elliot's character and what makes him tick, so to speak.I loved the ending, as it made me feel happy, as any type of romance story, whether paranormal or contemporary, should.Brianna Hughes has written a fantastic paranormal romance. I love her fast paced writing style and the flow was wonderful. I am looking forward to reading more of her books in the future.Due to scenes of a sensual nature that are on the explicit side, I do not recommend this book to younger readers.

"This is a fantastic contemporary western romance. I loved it!Charlize ""Charlie"" McCloud is a wonderful character. I liked her a lot. She is a young widow and mother, who is still mourning the death of her husband. Afraid to face the future without her college sweetheart, her world revolves around her children and the ranch. That is, until eighteen year old Hunter Bowie (pronounced like the knife), turns up and throws her life upside down. Hunter's entrance onto the scene makes Charlie realise that although her dreams of being a songwriter had been placed on the back burner, they were still there, waiting to be released.Having read and loved another one of this author's books, I was looking forward to reading this book. I downloaded this book and started to read. I was completely hooked from the first page and didn't stop reading until I reached the end!I have always had a soft spot for cowboy romances, but this book is so much more than just a romance. It is a story of hope and dreams, love and family. The story is told through three character's points of view: Hunter, Charlie and Cage, but Creek, a longtime ranch hand and Libby, Charlie's mother-in-law and Cash's and Cage's mother, have their say too.The story has a few flashbacks to Charlie's and Cash's past, starting from their college days. I loved getting to know Cash in this way. I could see why Charlie would fall in love with him. He was charming and caring. The story took me on a roller coaster ride of emotions. I found myself shedding more than a few tears. A handful of tissues will be required whilst reading this book! There are some funny moments, as well as some sweet ones. I love the scene where Hunter has his musical debut at the record store and Ella and Dylan (Charlie's children) are collecting money for the cuss jar; it made me giggle. However, it's the sexual tension between Charlie and Cage that just about smolders on the page. Cage is a bit of an enigma, I would have liked to know him a bit better. He looks very much like his younger brother and Charlie finds herself attracted to him, but hating herself for it. However, Cage has been harbouring a dark secret of his own. When the secret is revealed, I found myself in complete shock; I certainly didn't see that one coming! However, love makes us promise to keep secrets, even from others we love. This can be very hard for those keeping their promise, so I fell a little in love with Cage myself. I loved watching their relationship grow and develop. I also loved the interaction between Cage and his niece and nephew. He would make a fantastic father, as he is loving and attentive towards them.Brooklyn James has written a fantastic contemporary romance. I love her fast paced writing style, and the flow was wonderful. I am now looking forward to reading her other books as soon as I can.Due to scenes of a sensual nature that are on the explicit side, I do not recommend this book to younger readers. However, I highly recommend this book if you love contemporary romances with sexy cowboys. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6LQL7H1MYQAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGO82WU#wasThisHelpful","R6LQL7H1MYQAD","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first book in the Others of Edenton paranormal romance series. I really enjoyed it!I downloaded this as an audio book, as I wanted to read this book, but due to time constraints was unable to. This story is narrated by Kelley Hazen, who did a fantastic job in bringing the characters to life.Fallon O'Shay is a wonderful character. I really liked her. She is a tattoo artist and a druid. She is a very stubborn, feisty and determined woman. After leaving her ex-boyfriend and accidentally running into a werewolf, she finds herself in Edenton, where danger awaits.Brody Dean is also a wonderful character. I liked him a lot too. He is a mechanic and second in command to Slater, the Alpha of the werewolf pack in Edenton. Fleeing a vampire attack, Brody literally runs into Fallon's motor cycle and falls hard for the feisty druid.Having previously read the prequel to the series, I was looking forward to continuing the series. I started listening to this book and I was quickly pulled in. This book is told through several points of view, but Fallon and Brody have the most say. The melodramatic and ""teenage angst-y"" dialogue of the prequel was not as prevalent in this tale, although some of the characters still managed to sound too young and juvenile despite being mature adults.I still found myself hating Fallon's best friend Jess, whom I had met in the prequel. She has a tendency to whine and Kelley Hazen's interpretation of this character was spot on in my opinion. However, Jess had a bit of competition on the whining front. I didn't take a liking to Fallon's ex, Isaac, either; he is the biggest drama queen I have ever come across! I can't believe I am saying this, but I agree with Jess when I wonder what Fallon ever saw in the weretiger. He came across as a pathetic, self-pitying wimp.But, it was the romantic tension between Fallon and Brody that kept me hooked and enthralled as I to listening to the story. Their instant attraction fairly sizzled and sparked as the story progressed. I love the interaction between them. They make a wonderful couple.There are other characters that make this story interesting. I liked getting to know them all better. Hayden is the Sheriff of Edenton and a Fae. Then there is Dacia. She is a character whom I wasn't sure of at first, as she had set her sights on Brody and her jealousy of Fallon made her do some really dumb things. However, she redeemed herself in my eyes with her actions later on in the story.Malachi is a dark villain, but his presence is not really felt until later in the story and I was left wondering what he and the Dales had against the werewolves. Unfortunately, that was one thing that was not really explained properly by the author in my opinion.The story is a mix of romance, magic and danger, and takes the reader on an emotional roller coaster ride from start to finish. There are some fantastic fight scenes, as well as some steamy bedroom scenes, which were very descriptive; I could see the scenes quite clearly in my mind's eye. However, it was the training scene where Fallon and Dacia come to blows that I found quite memorable; it was intense, if short-lived!There are several twists and turns in the plot that surprised me and I didn't see coming. Though this book does not finish on a cliffhanger, it left me looking forward to continuing the series to find out what happens next!Brandy L. Rivers has written an intriguing start to a series. I love her fast paced writing style, and the flow is wonderful. I would definitely read more of her books in the future.Due to explicit scenes of a sexual nature, I do not recommend this book to readers under the age of 18. However, I do recommend this book if you love hot erotic paranormal romances full of werewolves, vampires, fae, druids etc. - Lynn Worton","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL5ZPSNQ256M1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CDVYFP0#wasThisHelpful","RL5ZPSNQ256M1","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a complimentary copy of this book from the author in return for an honest review.This is the first book in a new series by this author. I really enjoyed it!Skylar Rome is a character I wasn't sure whether I liked or not. She is a typical teen, full of angst and attitude. She is reckless at times, as well as stubborn, which gets her into trouble more often than not.When she meets Mason Grand, her life takes a twist into the mythological.Mason Grand is a character whom I would have loved to know more about. He is a wonderfully warm character, with a great sense of humour. Maybe it's Zeus's blood in his veins, or loosing his mother, but he holds himself aloof at times, which makes him seem rather arrogant.Having read another YA romance series by this author, I was excited to get my hands on this book! I started to read this story, and I didn't put it down until I had finished it. This is a intriguing young adult paranormal romance, which kept me hooked from the first page. The story is told from the view points of both Skylar and Mason. I liked meeting Skylar's cousin, Kayla. She is also a typical teen, keen on shopping and hanging out with her friends. I also liked meeting Mason's brother Nick. He's charming and fun.Unfortunately, although this story was full of danger and adventure, not to mention romance, I thought some of the plot got lost and overtaken by the sub-plots. For some reason, I was more drawn to Kayla and Nick's romance rather than Skylar's and Mason's. Not only that, the mythology of the Greek Gods' descendants, although adequately explained, seemed to have a few holes in it. I hope that, as this series continues, they will get filled in.That being said, there are several twists and turns I didn't see coming. There are also some intriguing characters I am looking forward to get to know better, especially Noah and Tim, Poseidon's offspring. I am also not sure what the Oracle is planning, but it can't be good! The book ends on a cliffhanger, which has me looking forward to continuing this series.Mary Ting is an amazing author! Her characters are extremely lifelike and likable. I added her to my favourite authors list a while back. Her books are a joy to read (when they're not making you cry that is!).

I LOVED IT!I normally do a character breakdown in the reviews I write, but there are quite a few characters in this book to do one for all of them, so I will just jump straight into my review.I love dark fantasy novels, and because I really loved the first book in the series, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one!The story continues from the end of the first book, and is told through several points of view. I loved this, because it gave the story an almost film-like quality. I loved meeting not only the previous characters, but new ones too, who give a different perspective on events.The Fae are continuing to break through the Wyrde, which has been holding them back from the human world. When Ylsriss's and Klss's child gets kidnapped, in an attempt to rescue him, Ylsriss finds herself trapped within the twilight world of the Fae. It was interesting to have such a contrast between the ""normal"" human realm and the Fae's darker, scarier one; it's moodiness and alien-ness sent shivers down my back!The story also has a lot of political machinations and bureaucracy, not to mention a lot of posturing that Selena has to deal with. There are also several twists and turns in this story, which kept me sitting on the edge of my seat. I especially found the tension of Ylsriss's and Joran's escape attempt to be very exciting. I kept wanting to look over my own shoulder for the Satyr hunting them!There are also epic battle scenes in the human world between the Bjornmen and the citizens of Anlan that, because of the vivid descriptions, I could see in my minds eye with ease. There are also several revelations that were hinted at in the first book, which get revealed. However, there are a lot more secrets to be discovered and revealed, so I am now looking forward to finding out what they are in the next book!Graham Austin-King has written an exciting fantasy novel that kept me turning the pages! Although it can be more difficult to better the first book in some cases, I think that this book is more cohesive as a story and shows this author's growth in confidence with his characters and storyline. I love his fast paced writing style and the story flowed wonderfully from beginning to end. The characters came alive on the page, and I could imagine the scenes in my mind like a movie. With the right casting and director, I could definitely see this working on the big screen.Warning: This is NOT a children's fairy tale! I do not recommend this book to young children or those of a nervous disposition, as there are scenes of violence and abuse that could be very disturbing to some readers. However, I highly recommend this book to older teens and adults alike if you love dark fantasy novels. - Lynn Worton","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R729VCXKIPFC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QPMNXVK#wasThisHelpful","R729VCXKIPFC7","A2K5MN1OE6UPXF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K5MN1OE6UPXF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The harness sizing was a bit awkward for my dogs. At 12 lbs and 7 lbs, the XS was too big or too small. For the smaller dog the armholes were really large, but they were perfect for the larger one...and opposite for the girth.What I did really like about it was that it was soft and didn't irritate their coats.My largest issue, and this is a very personalized issue because my dog is a chicken, is the metal rings clank loudly against each other and the plastic clasp.

"Pre-apocalypse names have no use for survivors of the alien/zombie invasion. Instead, names like Baby Bitch, Wart, Rag, and Whore graced the pages of March the Damned. It was difficult to identify the protagonist because, try as I might, I just couldn't find a single redeeming quality in the characters. They each evoked a strong emotion from me...revulsion. The only hint was in the title itself.The concept, however, was intriguing. Aliens sucked people into the sky and infected them with the zombie virus by attaching to their hosts. Like War of the Worlds, these aliens use humans as a food source and, without a host, they quickly die of starvation and thirst. The challenge I faced while reading was there was just too many ideas used, which made the story a bit overwhelming.Additionally, some of the situations and reactions seemed highly cliche. Booze, drugs, sex, rape (both human and alien), mind control, zombies, aliens, and even references to gay vampires. Anyone that knows me would likely agree that I have quite the potty mouth, but even I cringed at the extreme language.Characters are callous and violent, and the author makes much use of physical assault on women, displaying a general literary disrespect for the gender. Females are either scripted as weaklings or masculine. It is my sincere hope that these generalizations are a mere bit of fiction, and not how the author actually feels about the gender.A good story is one that makes you feel something. So, in that respect, the author has succeeded. Unfortunately, it was all a bit too much for me to handle. Perhaps because I'm a woman and the female characters didn't ring true for me. I mean, what woman feels ""sexy and confident"" during their period?On a positive note, though, I very much enjoyed a particular quote bit of dialog.""There's no room for bitches in the apocalypse.""I tend to agree with that sentence. :)Please find this complete review and many others at bookie-monster [dot] com[If this review helped, please press YES.

"Honestly, the first half of this novel worked really well for me, as author Jeffrey Littorno created a unique protagonist in high school English teacher turned newspaper reporter, Kevin Turner. Consequently, the story is told almost entirely from first person point of view; this is one of books caveats as the reader undoubtedly questions the narrators reliability, especially during the second half of the story, as he fuzzily slips in and out of manic episodes and possible emotionally-induced psychosis. Kevin Turner is by no means Holden Caulfield, but his thinking out loud episodes become somewhat unclear as the story unfolds. Even with the aforesaid, maybe this is purposeful, and quite possibly the reader will gain clarity come book two in the series.  There was a subtle shift in point of view at approximately the two-thirds mark of the story line, and it read a little clumsily as the timing and sequencing of events were a tad awkward.The general conflict of this zombie-apocalypse novel begins at an airport in San Francisco, where Kevin schedules an interview with an airport employee to discuss an incident that occurred recently.  Events quickly unfold in and around the airport, setting the table for an exciting start to the storys rising action.  The first examples of violence and gore presented by Mr. Littorno were subtle, and I really applaud that. Oftentimes, simple and restrained violence has a more realistic and complimentary effect than overdone, clichd brutality that screams B-movie quality.  The harshest scenes in the book are by no means obtuse, and I believe even gore hoarders will have full bellies after reading Mr. Littornos fight scenes.Even though the prose is a little rough in spots, its apparent that this book isnt Jeffrey Littornos first rodeo since he is a master of characterization and flashback. For instance, the realistic childhood allusion to blanket forts as the main character reflected upon his brother was brilliant. Subsequently, a barrage of other solid methods of characterization brought Kevin and a few of the minor characters (e.g. wife Bonnie, Father Glen, and Detective Lawrence) to life. The inclusion of some solid figurative devices should appeal to the literary fiction fans.  The metaphor of Mr. Wus father living through his special porridge was strange, but a variety of other examples were spot-on.  For instance, this extended metaphor was one of my favorites:At the edge of the water next to the deck, we found a trail of ants.  The black line led from a soda can next to a trash can across the dirt to the trunk of an elm tree and up into the branches.  We amused ourselves by putting impediments such as rocks and moats in the path of the ants and then watching with glee as they struggled to get pastWe watched as the ants frantically streamed out of the can up the twig. Instantly, the end of the twig became a ball of wildly squirming ants.  Then they were not ants.This particular metaphor was packed into another childhood flashback scene, and it solidly described a horde of shells trying to climb a detached ladder, trying to reach Kevin and Father Glen as they hid on a rooftop. Another assumption Im making is that Mr. Littorno is a funny guy as his episodes of comic relief are well placed and never grow tiresome. His characters have more chuckles and giggles than a laugh factory, but as mentioned previously, maybe this also plays into the readers questioning of the main characters psychological state.Even though this is a zombie-apocalypse book, readers will find some underlying themes; for instance, the role of God in the universe is a concept touched upon in a few locations.  The reader will discover the connection to the uncommon cold through the eyes of the narrator approximately halfway through the meat and potatoes of the book.  Truthfully, the first half of the story was paced really well; the second half dragged a little bit for my liking.  The aforementioned rooftop scene lagged as most of its action was stale and expected.  What was strong was the local color dialect and mannerisms shared between the main character and Father Glen.The reader may find a few instances of overly dramatized sympathy, but where Mr. Littorno thrives is in his flashbacks to the up-and-down relationship between the main character and his wife.  An interesting love triangle was revealed, leaving the reader to question the extent of it.I can already tell that Detective Lawrence is going to play a significant role in this books sequel; readers will readily identify with this character, and my only admonition is how the good detective was brought into the story because it occurred awkwardly.  Just as the pacing of this story picks up, the reader may be shocked to find it ending abruptly.  Will this be deemed as a setback for some readers?  Undoubtedly, it will, but if youre a glass half-full bookworm just sell yourself on the understanding that this immediate ending should nicely segue itself into book two.Part Zombieland, part World War Z, and part The Walking Dead, zombie enthusiasts who crave the traditional undead antagonist with a side of comedic satire should give The Most Uncommon Cold ISurviving the Zombie Apocalypse a read.3.5 starsPlease find this complete review and many others at bookie-monster [dot] com[If this review helped, please press YES.

"Imagine there are 6 billion of you in the world. Nothing different, nothing that distinguishes one from one another aside from the job you do. Your houses are the same, you drive the same car, eat the same food... it's all exactly the same. Each clone lives for exactly one year and on your 366th day of life you are slurried and a new iteration is sent into the world for the next year. But on the day that William 790-6 was sent to be slurried, a freak accident prevents his death and allows him another day to live. Since he has nowhere else to go, he spends it with his replacement. Perhaps it's the reason that clones are sent to their demise after one full year, but Will begins to question everything about the life he has lived and why he has to die. In an unexpected turn of events, his replacement is sent to the slurry machine in his place and he will get to live another year.Will finds out about an abandoned windmill just outside of town and sets out to find it. There are stories of Wills who have gone crazy and run away and are living in the wilds, but nobody can verify those stories. Could this windmill be the hideout of such a rogue clone? On his first visit he doesn't find out much, so he makes a return visit and can clearly hear talking within the structure and decides to wait outside until they invite him in. What Will (who begins to call himself Billy as a show of rebellion) discovers and is taught is almost too much for him to take in.During his adventure of self-discovery there are many shocking revelations and dreams of a better world, not only for him, but for all the Williams of the world. But can those dreams ever become a reality? The ending of this book made me go ""Whaaaaaaa..... just happened here?"".At first I wanted to say that this story is ""cute"" (and I""ll probably get lynched for that comment), Billy really does turn out to be a goofy, lovable character and I swear if I could find one to adopt I would so own a Cloneasaurus! But when you stop and think about it, there are a lot of parallels to the story and what is really happening in the world around us.While there is not much in common with Kozeniewski's other books, the same sharp writing style and easy flow is evident.

"Lewis wasted no time before delivered her one-two punch in the beginning of book five. I suspect more than a few readers will take in a gasp of shock. Not this reader, though. I was pleased with the cuts.Lewis' fifth installment has a case of baby fever. They're in...they're out...alive...dead...albino. No, seriously. I've got to hand it to her, though, writing the zompoc with babies is a hard thing to do. I know, I tried!The ending left me with a big Ooh (no spoilers here folks) and I'm itching to get my hands on the next one to see where Lewis takes things.Her story has a strong theme of change. As in, it's evolving right before my eyes. The characters progress and regress in a great big transition curve throughout the entire thing. This may have been an issue had Lewis not jumped ahead in time a bit to show the characters did indeed have a bit of respite. There's only so much intensity a reader can take without the story feeling weighty, and Lewis did the series right by giving us a bit of a breather.This is a welcome addition to the Grace series, and I'm chomping at the bit for more. Lewis' take on the zompocalypse is fresh, gritty, and raunchy. And I love getting lost in her fictional world.

"One of the things I struggle with when reading multiple books by the same author is a presumed assumption that there will be connections between releases. So I went into Resolution with the hopes that I'd be whisked right back into the Alaskan Undead story and unravel in a linear fashion.I feared it would be a reluctant read once I realized this was a mix between the original characters a fresh set of tales of the outbreak. But after a short time, I was too engrossed in the vignettes to give it much thought. There's something intriguing in the timeline, as it jumps the track of events between initial outbreak of new characters and still gives glimpses into existing ones.One of the more successful stories for me is the tale of a cabbie whose fare was bitten prior to hailing the cab. It's tense and fast paced and provides a great amount of depth in characterization.Another fun perspective was that of couple that met on an online dating site.""She could guarantee an Alaskan adventure that he wouldn't forget.""Understatement of the decade!It took me a while to realize there was indeed a connected story to be told, and that the seemingly disjointed vignettes in the beginning were to tie into a bigger story. And after about 20%, the pieces fell into place and I got into rhythm with the story.I enjoyed the read, but in prefer the format of the first two books. What made those such a standout read was the intimate connection Schubert forged between reader and character.  The predominant connection between stories is the setting, and while definitely a cool idea to set it in Alaska, I'd have liked to see the author bring it back more to the earlier story line.--SHANA FESTA, THE BOOKIE MONSTER & AUTHOR OF TIME OF DEATH","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22KFS6ZX4M8XI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYHS0AE#wasThisHelpful","R22KFS6ZX4M8XI","A343B32JX1SMDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A343B32JX1SMDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being able to sense the dead is both a blessing and a curse. There's no doubt it would be a benefit to know before entering a house if it harbor end refuge to a rotting meat sack, however, being forced to see through their eyes and feel their hunger would freak me out. Not to mention, experiencing them eating a person.Boggs is still salty about Gus & Zoe, but the inner strife is dampened a bit. It's hard to stay mad all the time when there's no rest for the weary. Grace Fallen is packed with action. Lewis does a great job when switching gears. Her writing style is edgy and descriptive, and I can close my eyes and envision her scenes.An author after my own heart, Lewis holds nothing back when deciding to do away with a character. No one is safe, and she has no problem giving readers the grisly details as they meet their maker not once, but twice-dead.I much enjoy the first person narration, and now, four books in, it's delightful to see the character progression and growth in her three dimensional characters. The series resonates with me, and my five stars are well-deserved. It's worth mentioning that I was nervous going into this read. I'd read the first three before starting on the path of becoming a reviewer, during which time I've learned to look at a book for critique as opposed to just simply reading for enjoyment. I'm pleased to say (and relieved) that the book held up well against my scrutiny.It took me a bit to get up to speed, but that's only because i took a long break between books. My only potential feedback would serve to help my own personal whims. I could have benefited from a bit of recap before diving in.Had I paid closer attention, I'd have noticed the building climax, but I was too engrossed in the story and was blindsided by it. Honestly, I'm okay with it...without giving a spoiler...I secretly hoped something like that would happen. It's not often I get to say 'I didn't see that coming', so kudos to Lewis for getting me to say it!However, that's only a personal preference. This series is a must-read for fans on zombie fiction and I'm ecstatic that book five is already available. If you haven't started the series yet, you may consider picking up the first book on Audible and jumping right in.Now, if you'll excuse me...it's time to start the next book in Lewis' journey.--SHANA FESTA, THE BOOKIE MONSTER & AUTHOR OF TIME OF DEATH","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24FAKP5N7K6ZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HIIMO2E#wasThisHelpful","R24FAKP5N7K6ZY","A343B32JX1SMDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A343B32JX1SMDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An eerie purple haze interrupts Alan's peaceful day spent enjoying the company of his family. As the haze engulfs him, Alan loses consciousness, only to wake to discover the body of his son and daughter in law. The shock and horror of seeing his family dead is quickly replaced with relief at the sound of Libby, his granddaughter's, voice. Now all Alan can focus on is keeping Libby, and himself, safe from the effects of the haze.Easily recognizable as a UK novel, After the Haze begins fast-paced. No long and drawn-out character building is done, which can be both good and bad. The zombies, not named until close to 30% into the book, are slow and shambling; my favorite kind.While not identified by the characters as zombies, they quickly figure out that it takes a blow to the head to kill the ""things"". Early on, Alan comes a across Rob killing the zombies, and the encounter reminded me of a Terminator moment: ""Come with me"" he said to Alan...in my head, the ""if you want to live"" was tacked onto that sentence and it gave me a good laugh.Instead of following the small group in its day to day survival, time jumps. A week here, six there. Bad luck puts them in harms way and The clutches of a group of angry teens.Nine months later, Yvonne is introduced. The transition is rough, and the question of whether or not there would be a tie-in kept pulling me from the story. It was almost like the author had changed the channel abruptly. The main issue I found with After the Haze is that there are long periods of time that pass without dialog. For me, as a reader, it makes a story heavier and requires exceptional writing to get my buy-in. The writing isn't bad by any means, and I like much of the plot...but without that dialog to break things up, it became harder to read for any length of time. What I mean by that is this: dialog helps push a story along for me, especially with dark content. Without the natural breather it provides, a reader has to take their own by stepping away from the book.Please find this complete review and many others at bookie-monster [dot] com[If this review helped, please press YES.

"Cover art is one of those things that I find extremely important when selecting a book. I hate criticizing someone's hard work, because I know all too well what goes into trying to do the artwork, but I have to admit the cover art for this one needs a redesign in a major way.The first person narration contains an abundance of swears, which is something I tend to utilize in my own writing, but I remember some advice a well known author gave me early on. Cussing in a book shouldn't be done as a novelty. It should convey the strain, and should be used sparingly. If I drop the F-bomb every other sentence, it loses impact and lessens the effect of times when it's used to get the heightened emotion across.I found some difficulty with the writing style of Shamblers. There was a lot of telling, but not much showing.""The zombie groaned. Flakes of spit flew into my face.""As a reader, I find it difficult to form a mental image of the scene when time hasn't been spent to fully describe something. There were times I felt the dialog could have been funny, but the delivery was off. Again, due to a lac of setting up the punch line.All in all, I can see the light at the end of the tunnel with Shamblers, but it didn't quite get there for me. I'm not one of those reviewers that enjoy skewering a book and calling out its flaws. I go into every book believing it will be a five-star read, so I'm disappointed when I can't sing its praises.I wanted to love Shamblers, after all, the title is excellent, but the story itself is stilted and short. Could it be excellent? Yes. But not in its current state.Please find this complete review and many others at bookie-monster [dot] com[If this review helped, please press YES.

"Deadlocked describes the infection as a sting. Inflamed bumps...urban legend theories on the spread, a throwback to some of those annoying chain mail warnings sent over the years. I really enjoy the way the author builds up steam with the infection. It feels realistic with its wild speculation and populous reaction.Once again, my lack of maturity astounds me and I had a full belly laugh when reading the second book in the collection that revolved around poop and farts. The witty banter between brothers, Hero and Mark, is a nice bit of comic relief in the story.Normally, a series with new main characters each release goes over like a fart in church for me, but the way Wise tied in each character, and continued to build connections with new characters, without leaving previous characters behind, is impressive.The only time I was pulled out of the story was a few reactions of Billy. Billy's character comes off a lot more mature than the average teenage boy and several times I had to remind myself of this fact. It could just be the consequences of being forced into an extraordinary situation, or it  may have been a bit of over-estimation of the boy's capacity to rise to the occasion.This is the second time I've read the series, and it was just as enjoyable as the first. Definitely worth picking up.Please find this complete review and many others at bookie-monster [dot] com[If this review helped, please press YES.

"Novellas are the hardest for me to rate because you are almost always left with that ""What just happened?!"" feeling.  Everything happens super quick and there isn't any time to delve deep into characters or the world around them and usually the conflict isn't resolved.  But, they do serve a purpose.  Most of the time they are a quick glimpse into a longer story.  Either a much-needed view of the past, to show character relationships or perhaps explain how our characters found themselves in their current situation.This is a solid, albeit very quick, read.  And judging by what I read in the preview for the second book, questions will start to get answers.  This is a quick snippet into how our group of survivors came to band together and make their way in this post-epidemic world.  They don't understand what is going on and each have their own theories as to ""why"" and ""what next"".These zombies are a little different from the average story within the genre and I expect that we'll continue to see them evolve as the story goes on.  Lovers of the genre will enjoy Bangkok Z and crave more.  The writing style is smooth and there is no lull in the plot unfolding.  We get a quick glimpse of the characters and so far they are all likeable and it seems that each one will bring something unique to the group.  I look forward to the rest of this series.Please find this complete review and many others at bookie-monster [dot] com[If this review helped, please press YES.

"Reading this, my fifteenth Tufo book, I had an ah-ha moment. Something I'd never paid any attention to before. One of the reasons I think Tufo's writing resonates so well with me is that while he writes in first person narration, he still manages to sneak in some inner dialog of other characters. This, for me, really helps round out his already three-dimensional characters.Only Tufo can introduce the Knights Templar & Illuminati into a story with zombies, vampires, and corrupt old hags, and make it work. I enjoy Tufo's ZF series so much, that I always reread the previous book before starting a new one so I make sure I'm completely caught up and the story is fresh in my mind.If you're not reading Tufo yet, you need to be. The dialog is always fresh, able to make me laugh out loud, and when I'm done, I'm always ready for seconds.Please find this complete review and many others at bookie-monster [dot] com[If this review helped, please press YES.

"My dogs are both under 12 pounds. So, their mouths are too small to get a good grip. But that doesn't mean they don't love to play with these toys.

"I'll admit, I hadn't read the first two books in the Z-Boat series when this puppy landed in front of me. Normally, I won't pick up a book without reading the back story. I was elated to find this book didn't lose me in the details. I didn't feel lost, or like I was missing some vital information.I was also surprised that I very much enjoyed the sci-fi, futuristic dystopia Robb penned. I usually chuff at adding in more aspects to a zompocalypse. But IT WORKED! And it worked well. On more than one occasion, I found myself holding my breath in anticipation of how characters would get themselves out of a sticky situation.The antagonists were loathsome, and I loved that they created such a visceral response in me. After all, if you're going to write a bad guy, you really want it to resonate with readers. And the world-building...my God was it fantastic. Picture Costner's Waterworld with some of the most savage zombies ever written and scary mutations treading just out of view under the water's surface.Z-End is a compelling conclusion to the Z-Boat series. Skillfully crafted to build tension and evoke emotion. With monsters of absolute and undeniable terror, Robb serves up a mouthwatering dystopian wasteland.I realize this is the closing act of the Z-Boat world, but maybe if we beg, Robb will gift us with more!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XAM22FR7EJV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MG1DOI6#wasThisHelpful","R2XAM22FR7EJV8","A343B32JX1SMDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A343B32JX1SMDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think we all shudder a little bit at the constant parade of sequels, prequels, and reboots that have taken over Hollywood in recent years. For me, I think its because these endeavors often feel like tired regurgitations of the original or sloppy love letters to what made the genre good in the first place. When done right, however, when those tropes are subverted or so perfectly reinvented, it feels like youre discovering a long lost third act to a story you thought youd finished. In its own way, Children of Wrath provides the next chapter to a series that reinvigorated the post-World War 3 fiction genre for me.The story picks up a little while after the events of the first book with William Fox living the quite life of a family man in Utah. Naturally, such quiet does not last and William finds himself pitted against a religious zealot bent on revenge for a perceived slight against him. Tension soon explodes as William is reluctantly thrust back into an effort to prevent further destruction in an already broken world.I made no secret about how much I liked Objects of Wrath when I reviewed it for The Bookie Monster, and Im happy to say that this book is just as pleasurable as the first. Its another dose of nostalgia for the grand set piece Post-A action fiction of yesteryear, but skillfully updated for the modern reader.As is typical for Permuted Press, the editing is good and like the first book, the writing is great. Action sequences are both grand and tense at the same time and Smith mixes large battles with small unit firefights as well. The verbiage never grows repetitive or cliche and the action is hardly the only thing going for this book. The moments of quiet where William reflects on topics as diverse as nature, family, religion, and evil are skillfully managed with only one or two times where these musings felt less than natural. For such large, all-encompassing topics though, Smith almost completely avoids the artificial arguments often used to drive a point home. His construction of dialogue continues to be good, and his knowledge and use of information about military equipment (often an important component of this genre) has grown since the first book. The only thing that some reader might notice is that this story is more about William with less focus on some of the secondary characters than the first book. This is not an issue or handled poorly, just a change.My complaints are few. One thing that I enjoyed about the first book was how there was a good sense of what was going on around the US. That is slightly less so in this book, though with good reason  with the breakdown of mass communication, I suppose that would have to be expected. All the same I would have enjoyed a little more about what was going on in the rest of the country and world. Some might find the religious aspects of the book a little imposing, but as someone who is not particularly religious they did not bother me personally. To his credit, Smith uses them more to define William than engulf him. He is clearly a product of his upbringing, but he is not defined by it.In the end, its a fantastic book and I cant wait for the next one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROKT1YTQ6RKOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MW8AZHG#wasThisHelpful","ROKT1YTQ6RKOP","A343B32JX1SMDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A343B32JX1SMDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best part of this case is its sleek and almost futuristic appearance. The volume and power buttons are covered by black buttons that sit flush to the case. The buttons still function, and while the power button has a bit more resistance than I'd usually like in a case, it serves a function. The iPhone 6s power button is now located on the side. Without the case, I was constantly hitting it by accident. With the case, it doesn't happen.I like the minimalistic and nearly imperceptible stands at the corners because it saves the case from getting dirty when put on surfaces.I want to give the case 5 stars, however, an issue prohibits the extra star from being awarded.The price. I purchased the case for $25. At the same time, I purchased it in another color for my husband's phone for $15. The only difference is the added slit in the back of the case to slide in a credit card sized card to give users a stand. It's difficult to get the card in, and it stands the phone up at an odd angle. The card was so ineffective that I threw it away.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCEICLHGZFM4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LL63WH0#wasThisHelpful","RCEICLHGZFM4N","A343B32JX1SMDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A343B32JX1SMDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Earthed is the background story of some of the characters that were introduced in End Storm.There are a series of homicides that all seem to lead detectives in the direction of Martin Webb. Problem is, Martin seems to have disappeared:  gone off the grid, doesn't want to be found.  Detectives track down his former social worker and ultimately they find him, but is it too late to stop whatever is killing people? Whatever it is that is killing people thrives on darkness and it can take over the body of anyone it kills. Along with the murders, the child of one of the victims has been kidnapped. Detectives are in a race against time to solve the homicides, stop this unknown thing from killing people, and find the missing child.I have to say that much like humor and comedy, the British version of horror differs from the American version. Where it seems that the American form is more slash and gore, the British form is much more Gothic, more cerebral, more psychological (not saying this is always the case, so don't come chasing after me with pitchforks or anything... just usually).  That is certainly the case here. While there are some gory details shared about the murders, the author gets into your head and touches on those deep, dark places that scare you.The story is excellent and keeps you on the edge of your seat with each turn of the page. Once I got about 3% into the book, I couldn't put it down and even stayed up much later than I should have to finish it! As I said, the author gets into your head, touches on those things that we fear and holds you captive with each page. I've no idea if the third book will pick up where this book ended, or if books one and two will be tied in together; but we were given a warning at the end of this book, ""Protect the boy"".  Does that mean they have to find the missing child in order to stop this?  There is one other avenue the warning could lead us down; Martin had a friend and even though we were never given intimate details about their relationship, is it possible that she is carrying his child and that's what was being referenced? I guess we'll find out in book three.If you love Gothic horror you won't be disappointed with Earthed.

"This was a very well written book, plot and character development moved seamlessly. There were connections between the reader and characters with each page. Once  you begin reading this book, you will not be able to put it down.A beautiful family preparing to celebrate Easter and their lives together find themselves caught up in the end of the world - blinding lights, explosions, chaos and mayhem are their world now. Gone are the days of laughter and the luxury of simply being together. Their lives become one of struggle and fear. What was to be their trip to Devil's Dyke for fun becomes their destination for a safe haven and a chance to be reunited as a family.Robert McEwan is patiently watching the clock: ""Thirty more minutes to wait before he could head home to his wife and son, and relax, knowing that the Easter weekend was upon them.""  The connection with Robert begins early on - how many of us have watched our clocks waiting for Friday at 5 PM to come around?The beginning of the end becomes apparent as Robert sees the pandemonium below from his office window. He is  unable to reach his wife and struggles to exit the building to find his way home from downtown London. Upon reaching his mother-in-laws house, Robert learns that his mother-in-law sent his wife and child packing, so she could embrace the end.  Robert also discovers that he has become the target of a 6-foot tall creature who hunts him down every step of the way until one of them takes their last breath. Fox, a dog that joins Robert, seems to have the ability to sense creatures and protect those around him.His wife and child, Emma and Steven, decide to meet Robert at Devil's Dyke - their common get away place - far from downtown London, the chaos, and most importantly from the creatures.  Their travels by foot take them to a number of locations where they meet up with folks who have not yet lost their humanity.  Their journey to the Devil's Dyke is filled with fear and desperation. Kyle, a young man with his own demons makes Emma and Steven his mission.  He vows to protect them. Problem is, he has never been successful at protecting anyone ... until now.At the end of the book, Robert meets the tall, vengeance-seeking creature, and squares off in a battle one can only surmise that Robert will lose. He's exhausted and knows that his wife and son are just up the hill, but will the Euthonal in his pocket help him? Marik's borrowing from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is well done!  I caught my self saying out loud, ""No!""What one may assume is a zombie book at times, there is no doubt that these are not mindless zombies but actively thinking creatures driven with animal rage attacking and eating everything in sight.  The creatures are vicious, eating and ripping flesh, strong beyond a doubt, and able to toss bodies as if they are rag dolls. One is left to ponder their existence - are they humans possessed by aliens? Smart zombies? Or ...?Often I found myself visualizing these creatures as the Aliens found in the Sigourney Weaver Alien series only to be jerked back to remembering these were once humans who have changed.This book will stay with you for days; it is not for the faint of heart.Please find this complete review and many others at bookie-monster [dot] com[If this review helped, please press YES.

"Beyond the Dark, the final installment in Patrick D'Orazio's The Dark Trilogy, hits the nail directly on the head, so long as that nail was inserted directly into either your lower intestine, or possibly an ear.  The story starts a little past where we left our intrepid band of survivors, stacked like cordwood in a retiree's RV, on their way to a road trip along the highway to hell.  You're welcome for the earworm.  This installment centers on the survivors, our buddies, Jeff, Megan, George and Jason, and their new pals, a cut-throat business executive with delusions of grandeur and a new found S&M thing, his daddy-didn't-buy-me-a-pony-so-f-you-world girlfriend, a redneck, some teenagers, a wise ol' grandma, a giant with a heart of gold and some sure to need a sh*tload of therapy kids, and their escape from their former sanctuary, now deathtrap.The survivors flight is as tense as can be written.  As Jeff and some others risk themselves to try and keep the group safe, one can only pucker as something as simple as rounding a corner becomes cringe-worthy.  As the book goes on, the group is whittled down, both by human and zombie.  Some of these final confrontations are heart-wrenchingly, soul-crushingly, painful.  One was just so clich that I could not have cared less.  D'Orazio's description of a couple of particular deaths were so gut-wrenching that I damned near put the book down, cried and then damned near vomited on my shoes.  That was just about my ""say when"" moment.  Alas, I had to know what happened to everyone, so see where their travels took them.Needless to say, I continued on and finished the journey.  Now, I almost wished that I had put it down.  Our story ends with the future uncertain for most of our crew, without any real iota of hope.  Okay, maybe one, in that some people aren't dead yet.  Or should I say, YET!  Remember, our survivors have been together only a few days by t his point, how much can one take? .  Yes, I like my books to end with at least the chance of a happy ending.  D'Orazio seems to have eaten at the Martin/King table, which is in a restaurant that does not have an umbrella stand at the door, instead it has a trash barrel for your humanity.  And then you hit the epilogue.  You root for the good guys, and then they smile and get eaten.  With that in mind, the fact that I had such a reaction to the ending shows that I engaged with the characters, at least some of them, quite well and thoroughly.One of my biggest complaints throughout the series is that the characters seemed a bit thin and the books a bit short.  I did not like the coda style character stories after the fact.  I felt and still feel, that some of their ideas should have been incorporated into the main body of the story itself, that way you gave a hoot as to what was happening to the characters as it happened, rather than looking back and saying, ""Oh, now I get it.""Overall, I found Beyond the Dark, and the entire Dark Trilogy, quick, afternoon reads that were entertaining and engaging.  I would like to see something a bit more concrete and feel that maybe another few volumes are in order, since we still don't know WTF is screaming!

"Red Tides, the second book in Mikhail Lerma's Z Plan Series, picks up right where the first book left off.We find our main character, Cale, being ""rescued"" (if you wanna call it that) by what's left of the Egyptian Navy.  Cale is taken aboard their submarine rather than left for dead in the middle of the sea, and he soon becomes sort of ""enlisted"" with them....which basically means that he's forced into making scavenger runs for them because his captors are too afraid to do it themselves.  Bound by chains to a fellow captor by the name of Naeem, the beginning of Red Tides follows these two in their troubles as they fight the dead on their forced scavenging trips and manage to escape at the last moment when things take a turn for the worst.I found that Lerma's decision to pair our main character with someone that spoke absolutely no English was very interesting.  Cale and his companion Naeem have no trouble communicating using everything but words.  In the apocalypse, survival is a universal language and Lerma does this well, never over-complicating the communication between the American and the African.After the two part ways, Cale continues his journey, through France this time, on a quest to return to America and make it home to his wife, Lauren, and their daughter, Marie.  A huge part of Cale's driving force is not only getting home to Lauren and Marie, but the constant reminder that his best friend Zach is dead, and Cale still blames himself for it.  It also doesn't help Cale out that Zach has now become sort of a ""ghost"" and appears from time to time to keep Cale company or give him some sh*t.  Zach's appearance is more of a manifestation from Cale's ever increasing mental instability than a ghost, but I like to pretend that Cale isn't crazy.What Lerma does with the second book that I really enjoyed was switching perspectives between Cale and his wife.  We jump from time to time from Cale's adventures across the world to Lauren's experiences State Side.  Lauren has managed to survive, holding on, day by day and pushing forward; unwilling to let go of her husband and somewhere deep inside, she knows he's coming back to her.  She's with a whole ""colony"" and together they all work together to make it in the apocalypse.  There are dangers lurking for Lauren, and I'm not just talking about the undead.  Without giving away any important plot points, let's just say I was extremely satisfied when those dangers were laid to rest...All in all, Red Tides was a fantastic follow up to the first novel, which I absolutely loved!  I'm always nervous when I read follow up novels to books that I adored because they've really gotta prove themselves to me, but Lerma has done it again with Red Tides; a non-stop zombie adventure that any horror fan will enjoy.Please find this complete review and many others at bookie-monster [dot] com[If this review helped, please press YES.

"Adrian's back, and he's pissed! Hell hath no fury like a trinity scorned.The Trinity is the seventh book in Chris Philbrook's Adrian's Undead Diary series. With this being the second to last installment in the saga, Philbrook takes some time to slow down and let readers smell the roses...or is it the decay?Like with any sequel, there may be spoilers from the previous books, so if you haven't read them, you may consider stopping here.This one's a bit different than the others. A traumatic injury puts Adrian out of commission for a good chunk of the book and the spitfire, Abby, picks up his journaling slack. I like Abby; she's one of my favorite characters in the series. Though, at times, she may be written a bit mature for her age in both thought process and the manner in which she speaks. But since I'm completely invested in the AUD series, it's a small incongruous tidbit I can easily overlook.One of the reasons I hold this series is such high esteem is its realistic writing style. When Adrian writes in Mr. Journal, I believe him. There's no question, at least in this reviewers opinion, that every line from Adrian rings true. (See what I did there?)Evaluating the complete saga to date, The Trinity is my least favorite. But that should really be put into context...I still enjoyed the read, but some others have resonated more with me. If I had to analyze why, I think it would be a culmination of things. Not enough Adrian-let's face it, he steals the spotlight. And the action was minimal. The Trinity was more reflective, almost setting the tone for the grand finale. Which we really do need, but my personal tastes steer more toward the chaotic frenzy of undead.That said, The Trinity has left me dying to get to the end. And I just know once I get there, I'll go into withdrawal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QTL67ZG0U5Q9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MIA6BX0#wasThisHelpful","R2QTL67ZG0U5Q9","A343B32JX1SMDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A343B32JX1SMDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What do you get when you mix a couple hackers, a baby, a zombie overlord with no bowel control, a cheese-sandwich loving dog, and an autistic giant of man with a thing for boobies? Zombie Slaver...the fourth book in the Zombie Botnet series.The tone of this series continues to be following the trend of the third book. Less humor, but when added, it makes a big splash. Alfred, the new mayor of zombie-ville, reminds me of a functioning alcoholic. He's maintained a semblance of humanity but has some slip-ups. And I'm not just talking the inability to hold his bodily functions in...let's just say he has to change his pants quite often. Do zombies do laundry? Something to think about...Zombie Slaver introduces the 'hive mind' of the hordes, and Alfred is the one pulling the strings. We're only two weeks into the epidemic. Ven has really let herself go but manages to pulls herself together.The group finds a fairgrounds where the food and drink is still flowing, the rides are still operating, and the carnies are still swindling visitors. Al finds himself a buxom love interest, which could have gone terribly wrong, but instead provided the comedic relief in this installment. Watching Al become a lovesick puppy and swoon at some cleavage was more than entertaining.I love where the series is going with baby Tomas and can't wait to see how it continues! Keep em coming!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSR4CYLQ7ZGEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5S4DMM#wasThisHelpful","RSR4CYLQ7ZGEV","A343B32JX1SMDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A343B32JX1SMDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought Keep Your Crowbar Handy nearly a year ago, when it was a self-published title and before it was picked up by Permuted Press.Back then, I gave the book four stars, but I've got to hand it to Durnin and Permuted, they worked through the small issues I had with the book and the editing quality really improved.Keep Your Crowbar Handy is unique. It's zombies, for sure, but the characters are intriguing and unique. Do-good journalist, Jake is standing in line at the pharmacy with his elderly neighbor when a woman starts berating the employee attempting to help her. Jake steps in and gives the woman a verbal tongue-lashing in defense of the blue-haired Asian girl behind the counter. Kat sets him up with her roommate, Laurel, the Irish redhead, and it's love at first sight. Don't worry about Kat, though, the sexy vixen hooks up with Jake's daredevil best friend, Allen.Lucky for Jake, his ex-military landlord George is prepared for everything, including the zombie apocalypse! Durnin does a great job starting out with action right off the bat. The tension builds parallel to character development until the two meet in a clash.I also enjoyed the fact that there is no pussyfooting around. The character's first reaction to the chaos is 'zombies'. They don't question what is going on, or try to come up with any cockamamie excuses. So there is no time spent in denial.The first thing I did upon completing Keep Your Crowbar Handy was ask the author how long I had to wait until the next book. That, in my opinion, is the true testament to a good book. It engaged me enough to keep reading straight to the end and left me wanting to know what happens next. The characters are solid, the plot is well-structured and merely pushes at the boundaries of realism, making it just believable enough that the zompoc could really go down that way. Oh, and the zombies are plentiful.If you enjoy fun zombie fiction with just a hint of a military feel, and want an easy read, Keep Your Crowbar Handy is the book for you. 4.5 Stars from The Bookie Monster.Please find this complete review and many others at bookie-monster dot com[If this review helped, please press YES.

"I bought these on a whim at the airport while waiting for my flight. A $150 purchase for earbuds was not a decision I came to lightly, but these are well worth the cost in my opinion.The Good:The sound quality is amazing. Truly. I sat in the store just plugging things into my phone and giving some heavy metal a good listen. These earbuds were hands down the best of the bunch.The packaging is great. Much more than I'd expect from such a small item. And in the package is a bunch of great accessories. (case, extender, buds, etc).Once these babies are in, there is no chance they're falling off.The Not So Good:I find it rather difficult to get them around and in my ears. It requires a bit of fancy fingerwork once I've got the lip over my ear to get the bud in my ear...I think this is because the bud is at an angle to fit into the ear canal.The only area I feel is not on par with the overall quality is the microphone/volume buttons on the cord. It is plastic and feels a bit chintzy. I use it sparingly for fear of breaking it with even the slightest touch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTUQKGBYLEUM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008CQVWN8#wasThisHelpful","RTUQKGBYLEUM3","A343B32JX1SMDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A343B32JX1SMDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Be careful of deals made with The Gentleman, as the terms are steep and binding.To say that James Greene is having a bad day, or let's clarify that to a bad year, is a bit of an understatement. A deal made with The Gentleman continues to haunt him. Literally. No matter where he tries to hide, it never seems far enough. What can a person do when everything that is attempted fails?This book drops you right in the middle of the main character trying to flee. Ever had those nightmares as a child where something is after you and your feet feel as if they're stuck in mud, and no matter how hard you try you can't get them to move fast enough? Welcome to The Gentleman. Where those nightmares are now real and the dawn of a new day is no longer your escape.You learn of James' past through snippets and memories. It's a mix of past and present that allows you to learn just enough of the character to understand some of his trauma, yet still leaves you wanting to turn the page to learn more. The writing is very good, the pace excellent and the attention to detail is evident.This was an excellent read and one that should be added to everyone's collection who enjoys a good bit of horror with their evening cup of tea.Review by Mona Markham for bookie-monster (dot) com","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J8WKTLTXS75F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQC0FDK#wasThisHelpful","R2J8WKTLTXS75F","A343B32JX1SMDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A343B32JX1SMDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Atmosphere: 3 out of 5. There's not really much to say but it is there at times, usually amid brands and cigarette smoke.Characters: 3 out of 5. The characters are well-constructed. Where they do not necessarily have hidden depths of personality, their histories have layers enough to make up for it.Plot: 3 out of 5. The characters and story are well-integrated. No complaints on that account. The pacing is also good. The Phineas Priests and BFA are, however, hardly compelling villains. The story leaves things open for sequels without making the book feel incomplete.Writing Style: 3 out of 5. Some technical errors. Sometimes the paragraphs seem to be put together weirdly, usually when they're describing characters. Infodumps are usually handled well.Worldbuilding: Not applicable.Details, details: [here there be spoilers]The BFA want to improve their image so they insult people and call them sheep?As I mentioned above, the villains leave a lot to be desired. They're... ""safe"" villains, I suppose, the kind that hold together every bad thing that you can be sure will get a jeer from your readers. They're just the regular baddies, here to say mean things and do bad things.They don't necessarily do this badly, so to speak, but I feel that the author is capable of handling villains of greater complexity, even villains that could make us wonder, if only for a few minutes, just how wrong they actually are, and so I feel a great loss on account of what-could-have-been.Perhaps in the sequels.I would buy the ebook, perhaps, but not the hardcopy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25XE3UHD8J7VI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FGUVK44#wasThisHelpful","R25XE3UHD8J7VI","A343B32JX1SMDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A343B32JX1SMDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The action and adventure continues in Stephen A.  North's Dead Tide Rising, the follow up to the first book in the Dead Tide series.  The book begins at the beginning of the zom-pocalypse with the addition of yet another character, Dead Eye Johnny, and we are then hurled head first back into the continuing saga of the first book as the undead rip through the Tampa Bay area.Again, as with the first novel, it's definitely a fun read.  I love the blood and guts, the storytelling is adventurous and risky, and there is plenty of zombie action and death scenes to go 'round.  But just like the first novel, the follow up was just as confusing.  In addition to the already overwhelming number of character view points, North has added the president of The United States, Dead Eye Johnny the cart pusher, the president's wife, and so on and so forth.  I can only say so on and so forth, because after now reading two of North's books in the same series (nearly back to back) I can barely recall all of the characters' names and I couldn't begin to tell you anything other than their occupation.My favorite kind of story is one in which I can identify or relate with at least one of the characters.  I truly enjoy and have the ability to immerse myself into a book  in which I genuinely care about someone in it.  Unfortunately that is not the case in Dead Tide Rising.  For however much I enjoyed the content of the book, I never truly found myself ever caring about the characters and I found that if any one of them were killed off and the third book in the series has an entirely new cast of characters, I would be fine with it.  I never truly got to the point in which I wanted to see any of these peoples' stories played out, and again, as with the first book, I never found that ""hook, line, and sinker"" protagonist that made me root for them in any way.I'm not bashing North's books by any means, if that were the case I wouldn't have finished them.  In fact, I still have the desire to read the next book in the series.  I just wish there weren't as many characters, or that at least the characters were defined by something more than their name.Another quick thing to point out if you're planning on reading this zombie adventure, is that there is quite a bit of sexual tension between everyone all of the time, and rape tends to gets brought up quite a bit.  Something that just didn't seem to fit well with the story was the fact that during the end of the world, everyone seems to want to have sex with everyone that they meet, at all times.All in all, Dead Tide Rising entertains.  It's not a book that bores you and it's definitely a book you'll be able to finish and enjoy.  Again, North creates dialogue that is believable and genuine, something that matters a great deal to me when reading a book in any genre.  I think this is another great addition to any zombie lovers collection.  Just don't expect to remember the differences between different people unless you're really good with names.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXNDWMMZAOI0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E6IA4N0#wasThisHelpful","RXNDWMMZAOI0Z","A343B32JX1SMDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A343B32JX1SMDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This isn't your typical tale of a ""psychic detective"".  George is the real deal.  He isn't in it to solve the crime, but to help the spirit that is trapped in a plane of existence and needs to move forward.  Erin is his partner.  It seems that most of the time she ends up running interference for him because he's gone into a meditative state and if someone were to try to rouse him from that state too quickly he could suffer severe physical and mental repercussions.For the most part I liked this book.  The story was solid, the characters pretty well fleshed out.  There were a few references of either George or Erin's past that sort of left me scratching my head because were weren't really given any information on that.  Erin says at one point that she has ""abandonment issues""... well, did her father leave her as a young child... is it just bad experiences with boyfriends... the reader doesn't really know.  I felt the characters could have been made a little more three-dimensional. at parts they really did fall flat.  But, as I said, the story was solid.  There's a mystery surrounding a murder.  It seems that no one is really interested in solving the murder and bringing the murderer to justice, because they all felt the victim deserved it.  He was a monster; a drug dealer, a child molester, and an all around nasty guy if you got on his wrong side.  And the victim's mother has the town wrapped around her fingers, so just about everything he's ever done has been brushed under the rug and forgotten (legally anyway... his victim is never forgotten).George deals with the local police, but his goal is to help this soul move on to where he is supposed to be, not solve the crime and catch the killer.  There are a lot of secrets in this town.  This murder has the capability of bringing a lot of people to ruin if all those secrets were to get out.  So obviously, the police aren't really pursuing it as they should.Near the end of the book there is a conversation between George and a police detective working the case involving what it is that George really does and how it all works.  While I do find it interesting, it felt more like a school lesson than a story that I was reading for enjoyment.  Thankfully that was near the end and it was only one chapter, so I pushed on through to the end.  Aside from that, my only issue was the amount of drug use... ok, so they smoked some hash, some weed, some things that were unknown to me and at one point Erin did snort some pure ecstasy.  But it seems like everyone within their circle did it (not the ecstasy, but the smoking).  Now, trust me, I don't judge... personally it's not for me and I've never really enjoyed books where the drug use was tolerated.  But those are the only things I can point out that I didn't enjoy about the story.Overall, this was an interesting book with a solid story and likeable characters.  I did actually learn a few things and didn't even realize it until I was done and telling my husband about it!  That's always a good thing when the author can educate a reader about a subject but not have it feel like it's just been a lesson (except for that one chapter).  It's a relatively quick read, the story is not really heavy--great if you have a few hours to fill with reading. 3.5 ","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ARKH8OKGASFT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H6UOLOI#wasThisHelpful","R2ARKH8OKGASFT","A343B32JX1SMDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A343B32JX1SMDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are a Stephen King Constant Reader, sit back and enjoy or, if you are new to the King phenomenon, this is a great volume with which to get acquainted.  ""The Bazaar Of Bad Dreams"" is a compelling compendium of 18 short stories and two poems , some old and revised, some new,  ranging from 10 pages to 50 pages each.Some have a supernatural influence while most portray horrors associated with real life rather than ghosts, aliens, and monsters.  This seems to bother some of the reviewers but in reality, King has broadened his genre considerably over the past two decades.  The offerings are somewhat connected by King's comments on when or why he wrote each story and by related themes of death, afterlife, guilt, and remorse.King never shrinks from utilizing the English language as attested by some of his monumental tomes and continuing series.  Yet he is equally renowned for his ability to write shorter concise and gripping stories as seen in his various collections of short stories and novellas over the years, many of which became screenplays.Caveat:  if you read and absorb everything King as I do, you will encounter tales in this collection that you have encountered before in one form or another--such is the nature of collected short story volumes.  But each has been revised and updated where appropriate.  Having enjoyed King's tales of haunted cars, such as ""Christine"" and ""From A Buick 8"", I especially enjoyed  ""Mile 81"" which should make any driver rethink stopping at a rest stop along any public roadway.  ""Afterlife"" presents a thought provoking choice that newly departed spirits must make.  And ""Obits"" is a fascinating tale of horror that while not new, is imminently re-readable.If you have read King's works over the past decades and matured in life as his legacy continued to grow, you should enjoy and appreciate this new collection; indeed, the new material makes the volume worthwhile to me regardless of whether I have previously read some of the stories.  I am only rating it with four stars as I selfishly would have liked to see a few more original offerings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31CPDOUKAACD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501111671#wasThisHelpful","R31CPDOUKAACD5","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ""HP Officejet 3830 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner and Copier"" competently fulfills the two needs that motivated me to acquire it;  It prints wirelessly and, it prints from both my iPad and iPhone (as well as my laptops).  My desktop is linked to a high end Canon printer so I wanted this ""HP"" for quick and convenient printing to my mobile devices.  This all-in-one unit (fax, print, scan, copy) has impressed me with its ability to meet these simple expectations.  I would recommend it for a college student, home, or low volume use office. HP only recommends it to produce 100 to 250 copies monthly.The ""HP Officejet 3830 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner and Copier"" is an all-in-one ink jet printer and I quickly state that I was surprised with how much more efficient and efficacious ink jet printers are now compared to pre-laser color printer days.  I find it much better for document reproductions than photo or intricate color copies.  It comes with one black and one color cartridge and pesters you to join its ink subscription service that ""monitors"" your ink usage and sends you replacement cartridges as needed.  It does not come with a USB cable for direct connection so you would have to provide your own if you want to go that route. It does come with a quick start guide but a detailed user's manual has to obtained from the HP website.  The software for the scanner is available for download at ""iTunes"".The unit was easy to set up and easily linked with my home wifi system.  A walk-you-through-it CD is provided for easy set up, although each mobile unit needs to be individually installed.  The 2.2 touch display is clear and responsive.  HP suggests that printing time is ""up to 8.5 ppm for black and 6 ppm for color"", so again, this unit is intended for light home or dorm room or office use.  Colors are close reproductions but not exact and the paper tray is a low capacity 30 pages.  As with everything we buy, know your needs, set your expectations, and buy this unit with confidence if it meshes with what you are looking for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26CPNQ4BC45WG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013SKI4EM#wasThisHelpful","R26CPNQ4BC45WG","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In his new novel, ""Orphan X"", Gregg Hurwitz introduces a character that rivals Jack Reacher and other well trained individualists and vigilantes who remain off the grid while helping others who seek relief or justice.  The Nowhere Man as he is called uses the name Evan Smoak and his skills bring to mind Jack Reacher,Jason Bourne, and Liam Neeson in the ""Taken"" series.  He was recruited as a 12 year old orphan by a handler named Jack Johns to become a future black ops government assassin after years of training in martial arts, weapons, surveillance, and avoiding detection; indeed, he grows up to become a deadly assassin who lives off the grid, having no backstory and no entangling relationships.Sadly, this means he also has no one to turn to when his handler is eliminated and he decides to disappear from the Orphan Project and begin righting wrongs of his own choice.  His protocol is to help someone in desperate need for his services and then admonishing that person to give his number to only ONE person someday who may also be in desperate need.  Consequently, Evan is rocked when less than a week after helping Morena escape the clutches of a despicable police officer, he receives calls from TWO people claiming to be in desperate need of his help and claiming Morena as their reference.  Which one is telling the truth, or are both telling the truth, or both lying--and, more importantly, why?""Orphan X"" starts strongly and becomes a gripping can't-put-down book by the end of Chapter one.  It is well plotted, suspenseful, and filled with intrigue and violence as someone as shadowy as the Nowhere Man begins a cat and mouse pursuit that will culminate in a heart stopping page turner ending filled with tension and surprises.  Clearly, Hurwitz has created a character with a popular future should he continue the series.Hurwitz capably builds Evan's character as he matures from bewildered orphan into deadly assassin and I found Evan's personal growth as a man to be as compelling as his growth toward assassin.  As ""Orphan X"" unfolds, we see Evan balancing his loneliness and training with an inner need to belong, to have an emotional anchor with others, to feel love and a sense of belonging.  Hurwitz employs a mix of neighbors, some old and nosy, some attractive and supportive, a hero worshiping child, etc. to reveal Evan's emotional growth through interpersonal interactions.I am a great fan of the loner-who helps-those in-need sug genre of action/suspense thrillers and I enjoyed this novel immensely and do hope it becomes Hurwitz's signature recurring series.  I unequivocally recommend it to those who equally enjoy this genre of escapist literature.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSORTBX4Q5FV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250067847#wasThisHelpful","RSORTBX4Q5FV7","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Connolly is one of the elite story tellers and thriller writers in literature today. His work with the Charlie Parker novels reflects great plotting, deep intense characterizations, flawed heroes, psychological entanglements and moral complexities, and often, a tasting of the paranormal, if not, supernatural. Connolly is much more than a pulp writer hurrying to produce several novels every year. Instead, he is a master wordsmith, an intelligent manipulator of prose and language designed to affect the reader's sensitivities both in context and in presentation; indeed, I often find myself rereading a paragraph or a description of a place or person that is so lyrical as to demand a second reading. Connolly is a master at creating a sense of forboding or a palpable feel of evil with only a few well chosen words. He is a master at creating forbidding locations and evil incarnate. His dialogue is usually spot-on and often times humorous, especially when Charlie Parker, Angel, and Louis are interacting and one-upping. Connolly's plots within the Charlie Parker series are tightly woven and filled with enough characters and red herrings to keep most diehard readers guessing until the end.In ""A Song Of Shadows"", Connolly develops a plot contrasting a battle between good and evil that has its roots in the Nazi concentration camps of WWII.  Parker is slowly recovering from his near fatal wounds from ""The Wolf In Winter"" in the small town of Boreas, Maine when he meets an enigmatic woman named Ruth Winter and her young daughter, Amanda.  Soon he is consulting on a case of a body that has washed up on a nearby beach and is equally intrigued by a family massacre, and a missing suspected killer--all of which may be interrelated and which leads inevitably into a morass of evil that began with a hideous plot of murder and thievery in a specialized Nazi concentration camp called Lubsko.Who among the inhabitants of small town Boreas is actually somehow related to the horrors of Nazi concentration camps and who protects them?  What other evils from Parker's past are active in Boreas?  Can the veteran Nazi hunters truly be trusted?  Parker, with the help of Angel, Louis, and other old allies including, surprisingly, his young daughter, Sam, begin linking recent events to past atrocities leading to an attempt to assassinate Parker.  Now in a race against the clock, with his life in jeopardy and confronting the ire of local police, Parker methodically seeks the answers that will lead to the closure of all the loose ends surrounding the deaths in Boreas.It is to Connolly's credit that the Charlie Parker tales, while often tinged with touches of the supernatural, are still enjoyable for the character development, suspense and thrills, and ultimately, for the ongoing struggle of good versus evil.  I unequivocally recommend this entire series to anyone who enjoys suspense thrillers with a touch of the paranormal/supernatural.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDLKGKZQMHXUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501118285#wasThisHelpful","RDLKGKZQMHXUD","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I have collected watches most of my life, the ""Invicta Men's 21480 Pro Diver Analog Display Swiss Quartz Grey Watch"" was my first experience with an Invicta product outside of their seemingly endless televised sales promos.  I have been pleasantly impressed by the workmanship, quality, and appearance of this timepiece.As stated in the title, this watch is a pro diver model purported to be water resistant up to 330 feet.  It is a stainless steel Swiss Quartz analog presented in gunmetal grey with silver tones and white hands and hour markers.  About 30 % of the bezel is in a light green tone that compliments the basic grey tones.  The band is a stylish grey made of calfskin and seems very adaptable to any wrist size.This wristwatch has 3 sub dials including 24 hour, day-of-the-week, and date, and noticeably, they blend in nicely without looking overly garish or crowded.  This Invicta also contains a tachymeter tool for measuring speed in MPH as extrapolated from elapsed time.  It includes a one year warranty.Be aware that as is the case with most Invicta watches, the ""Invicta Men's 21480 Pro Diver Analog Display"" is a very large timepiece.  The case is 48mm in diameter which will completely fill the wrists of many men.  Additionally, it is 13 mm thick and weighs nearly 13.6 ounces.  Although a large watch, it is not unusually so for a pro diver watch or compared to many of today's larger timepieces.  I am enjoying this Invicta as a casual everyday watch and so far I am pleased with both its quality and time keeping ability.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21Y3Y4LSAJUQK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146HVMP4#wasThisHelpful","R21Y3Y4LSAJUQK","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Killing Season"" is a debut action/thriller novel from Mason Cross featuring a new series character, Carter Blake, a loner who specializes in finding people who don't want to be found.  Some are comparing Carter Blake to Jack Reacher and while there are similarities, there are also clear differences; indeed, suffice it to say that fans of Lee Child's Jack Reacher series should welcome Carter Blake to the same genre.Carter has little backstory to this point as he is called upon to join an FBI task force searching for Caleb Wardell, ""the Chicago Sniper"", who has escaped jail and is planning to continue his deadly serial killing.  Of course, being an outsider without law enforcement credentials makes him an unwelcome addition except for Elaine Banner, an ambitious Special Agent, more willing to trust Blake as things unfold than just following ""the book"".Carter employs ""tricks of the trade"", an insightful intuition, and just focused people skills to track and/or predict where Wardell may strike next as he hopscotches around the country.  For his part, Wardell, despite being a depraved serial killer without a conscience, is intelligent enough to engage in a cat and mouse pursuit with Blake and Banner as he begins executing his evil plan.  But who is the behind-the-scenes accomplice of this stone-cold killer and what is his/her motive?  Soon Blake is not sure who to trust as he and Banner are ordered off the chase.  And who is Wardell's ultimate target and why?  These questions are all answered in a pulse pounding conclusion that will have readers stopping to catch their breath.""The Killing Season"" is well written and executed for a debut novel and the Carter Blake character has great promise to develop a wide following of fans of the action/thriller suspense genre.  And similar to the Jack Reacher series, a conflict inevitably arises spotlighting the bureaucratic ""by the book"" form of justice and the ""no holds barred"" form of street justice--often highlighting how modern rules of engagement and judicial restraints leave some criminals ""untouchable"" until a loner who doesn't play by all the rules appears to exact justice of a different kind.  I greatly enjoyed this debut novel and I can recommend it and the planned series to fans of action thrillers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RKHCN9U33QLY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1605986909#wasThisHelpful","R2RKHCN9U33QLY","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Promise"" is Robert Crais's latest Elvis Cole/Joe Pike thriller and Crais surprises the reader by bringing in their black ops mercenary friend, Jon Stone and LAPD K-9 officer, Scott James and his dog, Maggie (see ""Suspect"" by Crais).  With all his signature characters in one novel--it better be a good one.  And it is!  It a little slow getting off the ground, due in part to introduce so many characters, and then it takes off on a wild white knuckle ride to an intense but satisfying conclusion.""The Promise"" is generally about the strengths of promises, loyalties, and commitments to justice and to one another.  Elvis is hired by an aggressive woman who wants him to find a grieving mother, Amy Breslyn, whose son was killed by terrorists in Nigeria.  Amy may or may not have embezzled a large sum of money from her firm and may or may not now be trying to sell explosives to Al Qaeda.  If so, what is her goal, and why?  Before Elvis can even really get rolling, he is peripherally involved in a search for an escaped killer that somehow makes him a subject or suspect of intense interest by the LAPD and Homeland Security.  Also, it brings him, Scott, and Maggie into the same case.Soon, Elvis, Joe Pike, and Jon Stone realize they are in a case filled with lies and liars.  Few of the players are really who they seem to be--and what are their true motivations.  Who can really be trusted outside of Elvis and his friends?  And why has Scott and his dog, Maggie, been subject to assassination attempts?  Elvis and his pals team up with a reluctant Scott James as they discover the attempts to kill Scott emanate from the crossover of the cases they have been individually working.  Remember this--no one should ever try to kill an LAPD officer NOR his dog, especially a rehabilitated ex-marine dog who is instantly accepted by war vets, Elvis, Joe, and Jon.As usual, Crais has written a tight but complicated plot which makes this as much of a mystery novel as it is a thriller.  The dialogue is terse and credible but first time readers may be at a bit of a loss regarding the main characters'  back story since Crais moves rather quickly in this one at the expense of characterization, instead, relying on the reader's familiarity with Cole, Pike, and the others to facilitate and move the plot along.  I never miss a Cole and Pike novel and once you get into the series, I doubt you will either.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLIVVAG22A4TY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=039916149X#wasThisHelpful","RLIVVAG22A4TY","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ""BLACK+DECKER PureOptics Summit Zoom Magnifier 5.5W Flicker-Free Natural Daylight LED Desk Lamp"" is a great resource for hobbyists and professionals who work with tiny or detailed items such as stamp and coin collectors, fishing fly makers, jewelers, model makers, crafters, etc.  The unit utilizes LED lights to simulate soft natural daylight to lessen eye strain and is advertised as glare free and shadow free.It features an ""Easy One Touch Control"" that opens the lamp to the same brightness level it was on before shutting off; subsequently, users can then hold down the power button to scroll through all 5 brightness levels.  This magnifying desk lamp/task light sports a 5"" 5 X optical grade glass magnifier to allow very close work with a wide magnified field.  It also features a USB power/charging port in the base that works whether the light is turned on or not.My only significant caveat to the casual buyer is the utter size of the unit and its lack of flexibility.  It is almost 3 feet tall when fully extended as it has two 16"" sections connected by hinges to each other and to the lamp/magnifier.  Its footprint is large for an office desk at 6.5"" by 9"" and it weighs 12 pounds which certainly provides stability but limits maneuverability.  Once assembled, this magnifier desk lamp is really flexible in only one up/down direction unless the base is physically moved or swiveled into a new direction since it cannot be rotated from left to right.  Due to its size, I speculate it would be optimally useful in a dedicated work desk area or in a workshop.  But anyone requiring a lighted magnifier for close up work would be happy with this unit as long as its restrictions were not a deal killer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KK4K7U4NOVBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRW75FY#wasThisHelpful","R3KK4K7U4NOVBA","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ""Bose SoundTouch 20 Series III Wireless Music System"" is a classy looking and audio pleasing addition to the Bose Audio product line.  I am in no way an audiophile--just a consumer who enjoys crisp clear sound without a lot of setup or matching systems etc.  I have owned a Bose Wave machine for years, have enjoyed it immensely, and find this new sound streamer to be a very compatible product in sound quality and ease of use.Simply put, the ""Bose SoundTouch 20 Series III Wireless Music System"" is a music streamer designed to link or access most modern music playing devices--computers, tablets, smart phones,internet services, etc.  It is featured as a wireless system that can link to your WiFi home system or bluetooth; indeed, it also sports an aux input which allows for plugging in devices directly.  Normally, it is tethered only by a power cord and at 7 pounds, it can easily be moved around a home or office.  Its dimensions reflect its small footprint--17"" wide, 9.5"" tall, and 7.25"" deep. It comes with a power cord, a USB cable, and a remote.  Regrettably, it does not support earphone usage nor does it have an AM/FM tuner or an equalizer.The unit works in concert with the SmartTouch app designed for smartphones and tablets.  Set up is relatively easy as you link your phone or tablet to the device and then, with the SmartTouch app operating, complete the electronic link between the device, the app, and your smartphone (tablet) by synching with your local WiFi signal.  Now you can link or synch to any bluetooth sound device.On a front panel, a OLED displays the artist, track, album information, if known.  The remote is typically Bose in that it is simple, uncomplicated, and, while effective, you wish it did more.  Significantly, there are 6 presets that can be linked to music services (Pandora, iTunes, etc,), internet radio, or your personal music library on a computer or storage device.  This gives users one touch access to the source but maneuverability within the source is left to the app on your device or to the remote.As mentioned earlier, the sound quality is crisp and clear for me and can easily fill a large room with satisfying sound.  Initially the bass was a little too heavy for my liking but the app does offer a ""tuner"" for bass control in absence of a legitimate equalizer.  I am enjoying my Bose music streaming system and recommend it to non-audiophiles who don't mind speakers contained within a unit rather than strategically placed several feet apart.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1170FNOWCW3MC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IH6E26#wasThisHelpful","R1170FNOWCW3MC","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fans of the Nathan McBride adventure series by Andrew Peterson should be excited and pleased with ""Contract To Kill"", the fifth in the series.  It is perhaps not the best place for new readers to get on board as too many former characters with little back story are presented in this fast paced white knuckler,Toby Haynes, a friend of Nathan's, witnesses what appear to be cold blooded murders by his boss, Tanner Mason, head of security for a large Private Military Contractor (PMC) organization dedicated to eliminating drug and gun trafficking along the Mexican border and seriously destroying the deadly Mexican Cartels.  Toby shares his experience with Nathan McBride and his partner, Harvey Fontana, who are veteran CIA special operatives now running their own security company.  Soon, Nathan and Harv find themselves neck deep in a world wide conspiracy that includes North and South Korea, the U.S., and Mexico.Teaming up with a former series character, FBI agent, Mary Grangeland, Nathan and Harv must thwart a potentially devastating smuggling conspiracy involving the Koreas and Mexico but also must contend with perhaps the most deadly and dangerous foe Nathan has faced so far--a mirror image of himself in planning and execution.  This all builds to a suspense filled conclusion that fills the last 90 pages of the book as the Koreans, the Mexican Cartel, Nathan's team, and Tanner Mason's crew all descend on an abandoned quarry where each step and counter step is recorded and monitored in cat and mouse fashion until the somewhat surprising final violent confrontation.As mentioned earlier, there are appearances by a number of series regular characters but with the action so fast paced, there is not a lot of new characterization, although long time readers will recognize the philosophy and personal choices Nathan and Harvey make as they seek their own brand of justice.  There is also a sub plot involving Nathan and his girlfriend, Holly, who has been promoted to a major role in government inter agency planning that puts her at the ear of Nathan's father, Stone.  I strongly recommend this book and the entire series to interested readers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LEFTJG0AJIIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477827668#wasThisHelpful","R3LEFTJG0AJIIF","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Surely, someone somewhere thought of using baby wipes to clean and freshen their dogs' coats-but it wasn't me, doggonit.  The ""Pogi's Grooming Wipes - 100 Unscented Wipes - All Natural, Extra Large, Earth-Friendly"" are a clever and useful product to clean and condition your dog's coat.  They are all natural and earth friendly in that they contain no alcohol or irritating chemicals and instead, are based on the bamboo plant, along with Aloe Vera and Vitamin E.  They are considered earth friendly in that break down within weeks so as not to clog drains, landfills,  etc.  They are certainly generous in size (8"" by 9"") and sturdy enough to remain moist after using on two small short-haired dogs.The Pogi's Wipes appear very similar to baby wipes, only larger and neutral in odor.  They are packaged in hundred wipe bundles with a resealable opening.  They are also advertised as being hypoallergenic due to the absence of harsh chemicals and irritants.  After using the wipes on my two 25 pound schnauzers, I feel safe in saying that they seem to live up to the marketing hype.  They are basically odorless and as I said earlier, one wipe allows me to wipe down both of my dogs and still remain moist enough to use again.  Neither dog seemed irritated or agitated by the wipe or any potential residue (I have experienced no residue at all so far).  After wiping down each dog, I noticed a clean smell and a smooth looking coat; however, I have not yet been required to use them with a muddy or very dirty dog.  After using this product twice so far, I can recommend Pogi's Wipes based on my experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AAP4TMMSE9Z0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MVG6ZY#wasThisHelpful","R1AAP4TMMSE9Z0","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ""Health o meter nuyu Water Resistant Activity Tracker with Bluetooth 4.0 Technology and Long Lasting Battery"" is an acceptable entry level activity monitor when one considers the price point against the efficacy of the device.  I had hoped this monitor would replace my stolen Fitbit but was disappointed in some ways and pleased in others.  To be effective, this activity monitor needs to be paired with the nuyu smartphone app in order to track and monitor your daily activities;  steps, caloric usage, distance traveled, and sleep patterns.It has a sporty enough appearance although the rubberized band does not give me hope for its long term durability.  It can be worn either on a wrist band or attached to a magnetized waist clip and is touted as waterproof.  It sports an OLED touchscreen display that while clear enough in display mode can be a bit difficult and troublesome to maneuver and it employs Bluetooth 4 for connectivity.  The monitor predicts a 4 month battery life although syncing often to the smart device app will definitely shorten that lifespan.I found the nuyu Activity Monitor to be less effective than I anticipated.  The touch screen is annoyingly inconsistent and the accuracy of steps and distance taken was also irritating as they were sometimes 25% off from known route distances assessed with other devices and pedometers.  BTW, this unit has no GPS on board so it is really a fancy pedometer and not a particularly accurate one at that.  I have not explored the sleep aspect of the monitor as yet.Also worthy of mention is the truly invasive privacy policy of nuyu that must be accepted before using.  It is so encompassing and intrusive as to be truly scary and off-putting.  By agreeing, the user allots permission to the company to access your photos and files, to use your real name, address, email address, and photos without any further permission or any compensation if ever used i publications etc.  Wow!When assessing the efficacy of electronic devices such as the nuyu Activity Monitor, I usually measure three things:  ease of use, quality, and accuracy.  While I have discussed quibbles above about each of these three elements, all in all, the nuyu would be an acceptable entry level  monitor for a first time user wishing to match price to effectiveness.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AXHCJ1QHJMGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XRPT6Z0#wasThisHelpful","R1AXHCJ1QHJMGP","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ""AmazonBasics Apple Certified Lightning to USB Cable - 6 Feet (1.8 Meters) - White"" is recommended as an improvement over the standard supplied Apple cable.  I find it to be stronger and more durable than the standard cable; indeed, Amazon states that it is tested 4000 times with a 95 degree bend.  It feels more heavy duty with stronger, enhanced connectors that should protect the cable from coming apart at the connections.It is Apple MFi certified and charges and syncs all Apple devices that accept lightning connectors.  I especially appreciate the 6 foot length as there are multiple times when I need a little more length than the 3.5 to 4 foot cords.  The slightly larger lightning connector fit all my devices and Apple cases perfectly but if you have a very narrow connector space in your case, you might want to check the fit before buying (if possible).  I strongly recommend this cable for those seeking a replacement or a longer alternative to the standard Apple supplied cable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXAJ4CWGIUMB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010S9N6OO#wasThisHelpful","RXAJ4CWGIUMB7","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For me, the ""Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite Plus Rechargeable Toothbrush"" is a definite winner.  Many years ago, I tried an electric toothbrush but quickly discontinued it due to its cumbersome size, noise, and inadequate cleaning.  I returned to using a manual toothbrush until I received this Philips Sonicare.  I truly love it so far.It is slim, lightweight, and easy to maneuver in one's mouth--all the facets that were a concern to me in my previous attempt to usse an electric toothbrush.  The vibrations of the unit, calculated at over 31,000 brush strokes per minute by the manufacturer, make my teeth and, more importantly, my gums feel cleaner and healthier.  Having once had gum surgery, that is a very important aspect of the Sonicare.The product claims that it removes up to 100% more stains and that it removes 7 times more plaque than a standard toothbrush.  It has a clean and a white mode ostensibly for different purposes.  The clean mode is for a normal brushing and cleaning for the recommended 2 minute use (timer included), and the white mode is designed for teeth whitening with product claims that of two shades whiter in one week.  Indeed, I have noticed my own teeth appear whiter and more polished since I began regular use of the Sonicare.  Similarly, the unit comes with a ""DiamondClean Brush Head"" that is designed to wipe away stains and plaque; however,even though I find it effective, it should not be used exclusively-especially if you have sensitive teeth.This model comes with a charger for the lithium ion battery and claims a 3 week usage on one charge.  A two color battery charge indicator visually cues users into recharging.  It also boasts of 3 intensity settings for the unit to meet cleaning and comfort demands of individual users but I have not tried them mush as I enjoy and am satisfied with the standard setting.  I periodically will employ a manual brush just as a change of pace and as a monitoring of the effectiveness of the electric unit--but I am totally committed to the ""Philips Sonicare"" for my cleaning and whitening needs at present.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F1Q1C1Q37P3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAR86BY#wasThisHelpful","R2F1Q1C1Q37P3A","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ""Belkin MFi Certified 4-Foot Flat Lightning to USB Charge Sync Cable for iPhone 6 / 6 Plus, iPhone 5 / 5S /5c and iPod touch 5th Gen (Blue)"" is a quality product that I recommend to anyone seeking a replacement for or an alternative to the standard Apple cord that accompanies each device.  It is, of course, a lightning to USB cable designed for charging or synching iPhones, iPads, and iPods.The cord certainly appears and handles as much sturdier and more heavy duty that the standard Apple cord.  At 4 feet long, it is longer than the standard cord but still not long enough to provide true flexibility to the user; however, the extra length does come in handy in autos and in certain space challenged areas.It is certified by Belkin to meet Apple standards and so far, I have had no problems with using the connectors at either end.  It is flat which contributes to its ability to resist tangling.  The light blue color is eye catching and easy to differentiate from other cords you may have in use.  In summary, this cord is longer and appears sturdier than the standard Apple cable and is certified to meet Apple standards.  Based on my usage to this point, I can recommend this product as an effective, even superior alternative to the standard Apple cable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JJGN7IPBHMBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SW06GXA#wasThisHelpful","R2JJGN7IPBHMBM","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ace Atkins offers ""The Redeemers"" as the fifth in his signature series featuring Quinn Colson.  Colson is a former Army Ranger who returned from the dangers of warfare on the international front to face warlike dangers as sheriff in his hometown of Jericho in Tibbeh County, Mississippi.  Johnny Stagg, Colson's nemesis and local power broker, has succeeded in getting Quinn voted out of office and, he hopes, neutralized as an opponent of his corrupt plans.  But loyal readers know that Quinn will not leave until he settles accounts with Stagg.A revenge seeker arranges for several opportunists to break into the home of Larry Cobb, a political and corrupt friend of Johnny Stagg, to steal over a million in cash and personal valuables.  Unfortunately, the safe also contains proof of Stagg's corruption within his illegal empire and, equally unfortunately, the thieves are neither very bright nor very loyal.  While Cobb and Stagg move furiously to regain the contents of the safe, Quinn, at the request of Lillie Virgil (his longtime loyal deputy) and the Cobb family, is busy working with an informant to shut down Stagg's evil empire once and for all.  Several lingering story lines and characters from past Colson novels head toward an electrifying confrontation that may or may not decide the fate of The Ranger and Jericho, Mississippi.As usual, readers are reminded of the quality touches that Atkins brings to his work.  ""The Redeemers"" is an  authentic, fast paced thriller with well- fleshed characters and believable dialogue all staged deep in the backwaters of rural Mississippi.  Atkins continues his subplots regarding Quinn's estranged father, addicted sister, and his on-again, off-again romances.  All in all, The Quinn Colson series is a compelling, well-written series that should appeal to fans of southern suspense/thrillers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXDTEID0ZV5UD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399173943#wasThisHelpful","RXDTEID0ZV5UD","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The abbreviated review of the ""AeroFryer 9349 Cooklite Aero Fryer, 1000-watt 4.6-Liter/4.8-Quart (Extended Capacity 7.1-Liter/7.5-Quart), Black"" is that it pretty much does what it claims but with annoying restrictions.  And an important consumer question would be to determine if you really need it considering what it does compared to your other kitchen appliances.  Because it does cook healthy crispy foods with little or no oil but everything else it does can already be done with other appliances and not necessarily with a great deal more time.Other reviewers have tabbed this ""fryer"" as more appropriately a broiler or a convection oven using a combination halogen and infra red heating; clearly, it is not a deep fryer as such.  It is simple and easy to use.  it comes with an instruction manual and small cookbook along with an oil spritzer and an ineffective pair of tongs.  It is easy to clean and is dishwasher safe, excluding the top with the heating element and the plastic bottom.  And it does not build up a lot of extra kitchen heat.Unfortunately, its ability to cook crispy food items like fries, onion rings, or chicken is compromised and limited by a very small cooking area in the basket that requires a single layer of fires etc. so that the hot air can reach all sides. I was able to cook only a small batch of fries or two chicken breasts at a time.  This limitation makes the appliance useful for a single person or two people at the most; otherwise, using it for larger families requires several cooking batches to acquire enough results to feed everyone (and keep the already cooked food warming somewhere).  Furthermore, you do need to flip the food to get overall consistency and crispness.While the fries, chicken,  fish will be cooked to crispy consistency and will be tasty enough to eat, it will not taste the same as deep fried food--but the trade off is healthier eating.  And except for the crispy food preparation, all the other recipes provided can be done in a crock pot, skillet, or oven/broiler.  I also found that my cooking times were surprisingly longer than the cooking times suggested in the cookbook.  lastly, it does require a large ""footprint"" when left on the counter and does need significant storage space in cabinets.I can recommend this appliance to those who cook for one or two people who desire crispier, more healthy food items.  It does perform several functions but is limited by its small cooking surface and does not do much (besides cooking crispy items without much oil) that your other everyday appliances can already do.  Three and a half to four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W4O1XF23EZ4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSL89F8#wasThisHelpful","R1W4O1XF23EZ4K","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I generally opt for cell phone cases that provide quality protection and come with a belt pouch or holster to avoid pocket stretching or sliding out of pockets while sitting.  But I decided to try a more ""classy"" looking case for use on more formal or dressy occasions.  The ""OtterBox Strada for Apple iPhone 6"" was an excellent choice as it met all my expectations without adding a lot of clunky size to the finished product.It is  part of the Strada series and features a minimalist yet elegant look  in a deep maroon leather.  The case surrounding the phone appears to have the well constructed protection that OtterBox products are noted for and  the attached leather flap snaps closed over the phone case by use of a strong magnet presenting a sleek smooth look.  The iPhone 6 easily fits snugly into the case with all ports and buttons aligned properly and there is a slot on the inside flap cover that can hold a credit card or a couple of bills.  Opening and closing the flap may be a pain for some users but I found I unconsciously adjusted to it immediately.  The flap may be somewhat problematical to some in that it must be kept open and extended when using the camera to prevent obstruction of the lens.I have quickly come to appreciate this eye catching carrying case.  It is stylish, highly functional, and offers OtterBox type protection for your valuable cell phone.  It is the type of case that imparts a touch of class to the owner when seen and used in a public place.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BOGUG4MG19GM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJK41RQ#wasThisHelpful","R1BOGUG4MG19GM","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before purchasing the ""George Foreman GFO3320GM Indoor/Outdoor Grill"", be clear on what you want or expect it to do.  It is designed to be an electric grill, similar to electric skillets, and not a more traditional barbeque or gas grill which cooks entirely differently; obviously, from reading some of these reviews, some users were apparently confused.  The ceramic grill plates will give the user traditional grill marks on meat and food items but it, of course, will not provide true open heat grilled flavor.The unit is light, easy to set up, and contains the classic George Foreman grease draining ability.  It is designed for indoor/outdoor use either as a tabletop grill or as a stand alone grill when connected to its pole like stand (think of an oversized  traditional George Foreman grill on a stand).  I found it a bit shaky and unstable on the stand but it does take a large footprint of space if used on a counter top.  Additionally, it may be difficult for some to store due to its size coupled with its dome lid.There is a temperature gauge in the lid but the lid does get a lot of condensation from grilling if closed often.  Unfortunately, the cook top of the grill does not separate from the whole unit making it impossible to use in a dishwater and problematic to clean in a sink.  It may be optimal for use in smaller apartments, condos, on balconies, travel trailers, etc.  It may be most useful on the patio or backyard either on the stand or on a table top as I currently use it.  If users are expecting clean electric grilling, and are concerned about space restraints, the ""George Foreman GFO3320GM Indoor/Outdoor Grill"" could be a valued addition.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVLATL1FNF71O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUUXO#wasThisHelpful","RVLATL1FNF71O","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Du Brul brings back Philip Mercer, geologist and adventurer extraordinaire,  in ""The Lightning Stones"".  As this was my first experience with Mercer, I found characterization to be a bit thin for a book full of ongoing characters, although it is certainly readable as a stand alone novel.  Billed as a thriller, I found it more of a mystery built around a pacing-challenged thriller.Mercer is riding an elevator deep into the bowels of a mine in Minnesota to visit an old friend and mentor, Abe Jacobs,  who is conducting a scientific experiment far from the surface.  Unfortunately, Mercer is too late as he hears gunshots and chaos, arriving to find Abe and his staff all slaughtered and their ore samples taken.  Vowing revenge, Mercer jumps into action only to see the gunmen escape leaving his next move uncertain.Thus begins ""The Lightning Stones"" which ambitiously combines the historical Amelia Earhart mystery with stolen ore samples of vast power (Lightning Stones), a wicked eco-billionaire, climate change science, and various sub plots designed to keep Philip Mercer globe trotting in his pursuit of the truth behind Abe's death.  Along the way, he is joined by an enticing young female, Jordan Weismann, who claims also to be a disciple of Abe Jacobs;  a sympathetic FBI agent, Kelly Hepburn; and an old mercenary ally in Booker Sykes, who adds a touch of humor and violence to the tale.Although confused by how his enemies seem to be a step ahead of him, Mercer and his allies close in on the forces behind the killing of Abe Jacobs and, with limited governmental resources, Mercer is forced to implement a plan of action that is several layers deep to identify finally those  behind a plot that could threaten the physical destruction of life on earth.  While an effective man of action, it is his instincts and planning that lead Mercer to a cataclysmic high seas conclusion and subsequent denouement.  Recommended for fans of Du Brul and of his Philip Mercer character, especially those familiar with his back story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZBG3772NBFF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385527756#wasThisHelpful","R1ZBG3772NBFF7","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This  ""Leather Lovers Sample Kit"" from chemical guys includes  4 ounce bottles of (1) Leather Scented Air Freshner, (2) Leather Conditioner, (3) Sprayable Leather Cleaner/Conditioner, and (4) Leather Cleaner.  No instructional manual is included but each bottle does contain directions on the label for using the product.I initially experimented with the products on a well worn and heavily used leather sofa/loveseat set that had been relegated to the den.  Each of the cleaners and conditioners did a noticeably effective job of cleaning and moisturizing my leather furniture.  As for the Leather Scent, save that for your car if you crave the odor of leather interiors.I also tried the products on a pair of leather boots and an old, well-used leather bomber jacket.  In all cases, the products met my expectations and did not leave too fine a sheen.  The products contain both vitamin E and Aloe to help in the moisturizing, cleaning, and softening of the leather being cleaned.  So far, I haven't detected any ""bleeding"" of the color but it will definitely remove old caked-on grime.  I would recommend that users try test patches somewhere inconspicuous on jackets, purses, or furniture before jumping in feet first.  At this point, I am pleased with the products (although I have little use for the Leather Scented spray).","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TZQPK9PZ0YST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OB68E84#wasThisHelpful","R1TZQPK9PZ0YST","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ""Zeetron LED Light up Charge Sync Cable For iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 5S, 5C, 5, iPad Air 2, iPad Air, iPad Mini 2, Mini, iPod 5th Gen Retail Packaging (Lightning)"" delivers on its claims.  It is a three foot USB to lightning cable with an indicator light to monitor charging.  It is well constructed and I do not get the sense it will fray at the end like a couple of my Apple cords.  The connectors fit snugly and there is no wiggle room if the cord is moved while charging or synching.When plugged into a charger or computer, the lightning connector will light up with a blue LED that will turn red while charging until finally returning to blue when the device is fully charged.  It is a convenience to glance at your iPhone or iPad and see that it is either fully charged or still in the charging mode.The one caveat for some buyers is that the rubberized casing around the lightning connector is fairly wide (apparently to house the LED's) and will not fit every case made for iPhones.  Fortunately, it does fit my case making a snug, comforting connection; however, if you have a narrow charging port opening on your case, you may want to look for something else.  I recommend this product as I am now using it full time with my iPhone charger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZLRA50EVUCRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P858XFQ#wasThisHelpful","RZLRA50EVUCRG","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first experience with the ""Old Factory Scented, Natural Soy Wax Candles"" was both positive and enjoyable.  These candle sets are made in the USA  with ""natural soy wax and self trimming cotton candle wicks"" and advertised to burn cleanly for 20 hours.  Surprisingly, they arrive with a 100% money back guarantee if the purchaser is unhappy with the fragrance or performance of the candle set.Each of the variously themed sets come in a three pack of 2 ounce candles.  I selected the ""Happy Holidays"" theme which included one gingerbread scented candle, one Christmas tree scented candle, and one candy cane scented candle.  The scents were authentic renderings whether experienced new in the jar or while burning.The fragrances are neither overpowering nor cloying--they will not linger for days after burning.  But if burned in a large room or a high ceilinged room, they struggle to fill up the space.  It is recommended by the manufacturers that two candles be utilized if burning in larger rooms to get the full effect and I discovered mixing two different fragrances from a themed set actually enhanced the overall efect--at least in the ""Happy Holidays"" set.  While a bit pricey for their size, I would not hesitate to use other themed sets and I enthusiastically recommend this product.I received free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15E5C640D34SD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NR8LA1U#wasThisHelpful","R15E5C640D34SD","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With ""The Wolf In Winter"", John Connolly continues to deliver as one of our finest writers in today's world of suspense thrillers--particularly in the subgenre of supernatural noir, to coin a phrase. Connolly is a master wordsmith who can create a sense of forboding or a palpable feel of evil with only a few well chosen words. He is a master at creating forbidding locations and evil incarnate. His dialogue is usually spot-on and often times humorous, especially when Charlie Parker, Angel, and Louis are interacting and one-upping. Connolly's plots within the Charlie Parker series are tightly woven and filled with enough characters and red herrings to keep most diehard readers guessing until the end.  Fans of Connolly and his signature character, Charlie Parker, can breathe easily because  ""The Wolf In Winter"" continues the author's history of rising to meet the increased expectations of his reading audience.Can a town be an evil entity?  Is something dangerously evil living among or in Prosperous, Maine?  What secrets are the town leaders hiding that keep the community more ""prosperous"" than those nearby?  Charlie Parker is forced to confront these questions when a homeless acquaintance mysteriously dies in an apparent suicide while trying to collect enough money to hire Parker to help him find his daughter who went missing in Prosperous, Maine.  Charlie feels compelled to look into the missing daughter and Prosperous after questioning his friend's  suicide.As Parker stirs the pot a bit in his exploration of Prosperous, he senses an underlying evilness that seems to drive the closely knit community.  His reputation precedes him and soon he is targeted for assassination to protect the town's secrets and well-being.  An attempt on Charlie's life sets a number of inexorable forces in motion that include vengeance seeking Louis and Angel, the Collector, hte Believers, and the Backers.  As internal conflicts begin to split the Prosperous leadership, Louis and Angel forge a tenuous truce with old enemies to get the information necessary to avenge Parker leading to a violent and satisfying conclusion.  It is to Connolly's credit that the Charlie Parker tales, while often tinged with touchs of the supernatural, are still enjoyable for the character development, suspense and thrills, and ultimately, for the ongoing struggle of good versus evil.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W1ZWOZJHIZIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476703183#wasThisHelpful","R3W1ZWOZJHIZIH","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a wine accessory drawer that contains a plethora of wine corkscrews of every type, model, and size.  Additionally, I have several counter top corkscrews, lever operated, etc.  However, it is time to donate all those to someone and focus on my new ""Metrokane Rabbit Automatic Electric Corkscrew"".  It has been a pleasant surprise to me and my guests often are fascinated with watching it work.It arrives nicely packaged in a cardboard cylinder with directions and pictures of how to use it.  it is designed to be an all-in-one wine bottle opener in that it includes a foil cutter on top of the corkscrew (covering the USB micro charger).  It is lightweight (less than a pound), 9.5 by 2"" by 2"", and is eyecatching in design.  One charge supposedly will remove 30 corks with a recommended 4 hour charging time.  And, fortunately, it removes both regular corks and newer plastic corks.It is presented as an automatic cork remover with no buttons to push; instead, it has a built in sensor that reacts to the pressure on the cork.  The most difficult part seems to be centering the unit directly over the center of the cork so the downward angle remains relatively straight.  Place slight pressure on the corkscrew and it begins to whine as it ""does its job"" of removing the cork.  Once the cork has been removed and pressure relieved, the unit reverses itself and expels the cork.The ""Metrokane Rabbit Automatic Electric Corkscrew"" has a manual overridein case the cork removal process fails or the unit jams.  I am definitely pleased at this point (6 bottles of wine opened) and am comfortable recommending it for personal use or for a nice gift.

"The ""URBAN ARMOR GEAR Case for iPhone 6 (4.7 Display) Clear"" is my first experience with UAG cases.  Overall, I find it stylish and efficacious with a few shortcomings--still a very serviceable and protective case for most users.  Due to Apple's paranoia regarding the secrecy of its new releases, it is exceedingly difficult for after market vendors to produce ""perfect"" cases for simultaneous release with the new phones, which is why we often have to wait weeks for well designed cases and why second generation cases are always superior..  This UAG model comes close to hitting a bull's eye on its first iteration.It is impact resistant and very light due to a composite construction.  It claims to meet military drop test standards.  It features a HD screen protector (that doesn't totally cover the screen), affords easy access to all buttons and connector ports, and sports reinforced ""skid pads"" on all four corners for added impact protection.  The rubberized lip surrounding the front screen seems a bit thin to me and may be the one risky or vulnerable area to an accidental drop.Overall, the case has a simple tactical yet stylish appearance.  The translucent ""honeycomb-like"" rear cover with transparent plastic inserts gives it a personalized, almost military look.  The connector ports on the bottom of the case and the vibrator/sound toggle switch on the upper left are all uncovered which may influence those who worry about dust entering their case.  It does feature an innovative glare free flash protector that has worked flawlessly for me.  All in all, an effective ""early release"" of an iPhone case that will provide sturdy protection from scratches and impacts along with easy access in a thin profile innovative design  that should provide users with some peace of mind until something better arrives.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C68ZCR0AJ6TW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCAVSO4#wasThisHelpful","R2C68ZCR0AJ6TW","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The ""LifeCHARGE InAir Battery Case with Wireless Charging Technology for Apple iPhone 5/5s - Retail Packaging - White (Wireless Phone Accessory)"" is my first experience with a charging case and with a wireless charger and I am very pleased with the results.  The product is intended to extend (perhaps double) your iPhone's battery life without needing a charger or outlet while at work or on the road.  If the case is fully charged, it can almost double the expected battery charge of the iPhone AND the phone itself can be recharged without any connections or wires by placing it flat on the charging pad which is, itself, connected to an outlet or computer.The case itself is stylish with a faux leather look backing with four small pinholes that light up to monitor charge capacity.  It purports to double battery life allowing 8-10 extra hours of talk time.  According to the developer, the unit was developed and is certified to meet Apple performance standards and it does align properly with all the iPhone 5 features such as connectors, switches, and microphone cut-outs.  It is powered by one Lithium Metal battery.  The product seems a bit pricey but that may depend upon how each user values convenience.One clarifying point that may influence some potential users.  The "" LifeCHARGE InAir Battery Case with Wireless Charging Technology for Apple iPhone 5/5s"" utilizes a Micro USB cable and a USB Micro Port/interface which allows users to charge the phone, the case, or both from the USB Micro Port.  Unfortunately, a lightening cable interface will not work on the unit which can be cumbersome for those who choose to link their phones directly to a computer for synching purposes etc.  The Micro USB cable is included and can be connected to any standard wall adaptor (not included).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28WX5E39XBYZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCL7XLK#wasThisHelpful","R28WX5E39XBYZA","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Invasive Species"" by Joseph Wallace is a mixed bag that can be read as a fun page-turner with a little suspension of disbelief by the reader.  It is basically an apocalyptic ""what if"" look at a futuristic scenario that unfolds when a newly evolved insect predator begins to spread its deadly presence across the world linked by an all seeing/all feeling ""hive mind"".  The wasp like predator uses humans and other mammals as nurturing ""hosts"" for their unborn, ultimately leading to madness and death of the host.  Each predator is linked to the hive mind so that each sees and feels all,  leading to their calculated efforts to seek vengeance against those who harm or threaten their existence.Wallace does a good job of making this whole notion as plausible as possible with scientific references and decent characterizations of the leading characters.  His pacing is mostly effective at building suspense and maintaining a sense of ""how can this end in a good way""; indeed, his climax and denouement make satisfying sense within his posited parameters but suffer a bit from alternatives not considered because of the reader's need for suspension of disbelief.  For example, except for one flawed major governmental attempt to ""attack"" the predators, no other alternative methods of eradication are even considered.This is part of the ""mixed bag"" I mentioned earlier.  The need for sustained suspension of disbelief and even turning one's head from the questions of ..""why didn't they try X or Y or Z""?  Also, readers are subjected to the obligatory lecture on the consequences of man's destruction of nature and the obligatory corrupt governmental officials trying to hide the truth from the people.But heck, I enjoyed ""Invasive Species"" as a fun summer read for its chills and thrills with some attention paid to the science relating to insects; indeed, when read purely as fun escapist literature, this novel can be a page turner leading some to check their doors and windows for possible insect access.  Just keep the pages turning so you don't think too critically or deeply.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VNJXHKLHJW4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425269493#wasThisHelpful","R2VNJXHKLHJW4F","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note:  I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.My experience with ""Mental Clarity Recovery Formula"" by Clarex was inconclusive at best and disappointing at worst.  I am in my ""golden years"", work out at the gym three times a week, and jog 3 miles three times a week so I hoped for the promised results.  After two weeks of the regimen, I noticed no discernible results physically or mentally--not even a ""placebo effect"".  I tried the tablets before a heavy workout or jog and after a workout but with no recognizable effects in either case.  I do not drink coffee at all and drink alcohol moderately, so I was unable to test the promised effects of clearing up the caffeine/coffee ""crashes"" nor the dreaded ""hangover"".So my high expectations were not met but that could be due to my individual metabolism and/or the effects of multi-vitamins I already take.  I personally have not had much success with ""B"" vitamin mega doses in the past.  It is a foul smelling and tasting  tablet that must be quickly swallowed to avoid the odorous effects and it will leave a brief unpleasant after taste.

"The ""Apple Mfi Certified] ZeroLemon Lightning to USB Cable"" by ZeroLemon is one of those products that makes you wonder why Apple or someone else hadn't done it this way before.  It is definately heavy duty in its look and feel and instills the confidence that the outer wire coating will not crack and separate from the internal wiring as has happened on many of the iPhone 5 cords, including mine.The cord is an amazing ten feet long and 3.5 mm in thickness which allows user flexibility in connection options (and can be controlled using twist ties) while seeming to be slightly less manipulatable than the more narrow standard cords.  The connecting points at both ends of the lightning cable appear well made and fit snugly in both my computer and my Apple devices (iPhone 5, 6 and iPad Air).The ultimate question to be answered over time is whether the cable meets or exceeds one's expectation for durability and utility.  After using the cord for two weeks, I have gained confidence that this product will continue to be effective over time and certainly exceed the efficacy of Apple's packaged cord. ZeroLemon does offer a nice two year warranty and barring some unforseen problem, I rate this product as a great functional value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G6C7NB0XGGZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M5JG8ZK#wasThisHelpful","R3G6C7NB0XGGZY","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Payoff"" is Douglas Corleone's second Simon Fisk novel and my first experience with the character (and, hopefully, not my last).  Fisk is a former U.S. Marshall who is now a private investigator specializing in child abduction cases--predominately inter-family kidnappings.  Simon's own daughter was abducted eleven years ago and he has never received the comfort he tries to provide other parents who lose a child in this manner.Hollywood movie mogul, Edgar Trenton, calls in an old ""favor"" from Fisk asking him to search for his missing fifteen-year-old daughter, Olivia,  who was forcefully abducted from his home while his wife, Emma, was roughed up and drugged.  There are glaring bits of circumstantial evidence pointing at an inside job and Trenton is soon arrested while Simon goes on an exhausting pursuit of the perpetrators that takes him to Grand Cayman, then to the underbelly of Costa Rica, subsequently to a confrontation with a cartel leader in Colombia, and finally, to Caracas during Carnival, before returning to California.  Whew!Who is behind Olivia's kidnapping and was it an inside job?  What happened to the 8.5 million dollar ransom Trenton paid and why wasn't Olivia subsequently returned?  To get the answers to these questions, Fisk must deal with sleazy children of privileged and powerful officials, a deadly drug cartel, a sex slavery ring, and crooked government and church officials aided, in part, by Mariana, a clever young lady who desires to repay Fisk for having helped free her from sex dealers.""Payoff"" is a fast-paced read that ratchets up the suspense with each new stop by the intrepid Simon Fisk.  There are areas where the reader must suspend his/her disbelief, but nothing that ruins the pacing or the unfolding plot.  Fisk is an intriguing character, haunted by his own demons yet finding a way to combat those demons by helping other suffering families.  Character development was solid for those who became important to the story.  Corleone employs a tightly plotted, fast paced approach to the action in ""Payoff"" that will keep most readers engaged until the somewhat satisfying climax.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CJ7JEX7QEFVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250040736#wasThisHelpful","R3CJ7JEX7QEFVG","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Windigo Island"" is the fourteenth installment in William Kent Krueger's well written and well crafted Cork O'Connor series set in the far North, usually in Minnesotan environs. Cork is a former sheriff turned private investigator in desolated Northern Minnesota where he raises his family, solves crimes, and proudly celebrates his Ojibwe Indian background.  Among the many attractions to this mystery/thriller series is the ongoing relationships Cork maintains with his children and his Ojibwe medicine man mentor, Henry Meloux, a wise old fox who may be over a hundred years old.In ""Windigo Island"", Cork is persuaded by the Arceneaux family to search for their missing fifteen year old daughter, Mariah, who seemingly ran away a year earlier with her friend Carrie Verga.  Alarmingly, Carrie's beaten body has washed ashore on the small desolated Windigo Island in Lake Superior.  How did she die and why?  Where is Mariah or is she already dead?Seeking answers to these and other questions, Cork, his stubborn and conflicted daughter, Jenny, Henry Meloux and others launch an investigation that leads to the shipping port of Duluth and a sex-trafficking cartel that preys on young vulnerable Indian girls.  With the indian population and the local police being mostly uncooperative, Cork and Jenny must follow their instincts as clues point to a fictional monster known the Windigo or an evil spirit known as Mishi Peshu.  Henry's knowledge of tribal lore is invaluable as an anchor for Cork in his search.A recurring theme in this series has been the entanglement of different members of Cork's immediate family into the storylines, sometimes with tragic consequences--a reliance on placing family members in peril that I hope has run its course with ""Windigo Island"".  Jenny O'Connor serves as both a determined motivator as well as a ""conscience"" for her father.  She will not let this missing person case go yet she is increasingly fearful of Cork's determination and the vengeful spirit she thinks she sees growing in him.  She is quickly confused and conflicted by the two sides of her father--the loving man who raised her and the vengeance-seeking force seemingly ready to kill, if necessary, to achieve his goals and to defeat the ""Windigo"".Krueger continues to weave amazingly well fleshed characters with pin point descriptions of life and places in the blizzard filled desolate woods and lakes of Northern Minnesota to propel his plot while maintaining edge-of-the-seat suspense for the reader. Though this effort drags in places during the first half, the white knuckle pacing of the second half  steam rolls the reader to an edge-of-the-seat confrontation between good and evil in the climax.  If you have never experienced this wonderfully satisfying series, grab ""Windigo Island"" and then go back and read the entire series. This is a highly recommended author and series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33HCUIDO9GQ5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147674923X#wasThisHelpful","R33HCUIDO9GQ5C","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using the ""Belkin Apple MFi Certified Car Charger with Lightning Connector for iPhone 5 / 5S / 5c (2.1 Amp / 10 Watt)"" for about a week and find it adequately meets its stated claims and objectives.  It works for both my iPhone 5 and my iPad Air.  It apparently is okayed by Apple as to meeting its standards.  It seems sturdily manufactured and maintains a low profile in my console connector and boasts a 4 foot cord (not coiled) which I find more than adequate for my needs.It only works in my car when the engine is running which produces a green LED light on the unit to indicate it is connected properly.  I notice a lot of mixed reviews for this product online, but this latest iteration (code # F8JO75btBLK) seems to be getting much more positive reviews so I assume it is an improved and upgraded version of an earlier flawed product.I keep my iPhone and iPad on chargers when not in use so I seldom need a travel charger but keeping this product in your console or trunk compartment seems a wise way to ensure your emergency needs are met when on a long trip or when others are draining the battery while on a long in-car trip.  So far, I can recommend this product as a serviceable basic car charger for iPhone 5s, iPad minis and iPad Airs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M63KBYC5BOR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LETJFNO#wasThisHelpful","R3M63KBYC5BOR4","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a child, my parents would take me to a barber shop that utilized this line of product and often, after my haircut and a ""pretend"" shave, the barber would splash some Virgin Island Bay Rum on me, creating an olfactory memory I never forgot.  I encountered the product again on a recent visit to a golf club in the Caribbean sparking old memories and leading me to order a bottle online.It is a scent I easily remember with a splash on ""burn"" that is refreshing after a close shave.  The odor is a little more cloying than I remember and seems to hang on far longer than most after shave lotions.  It is cool and bracing when splashed on and is somewhat ""old-school"" in the simplicity of its spicy island odor as opposed to the emergence of modern laboratory inspired floral concoctions.  I doubt this will become my ""go-to"" after shave, but it is more than adequate and, for me, possesses a huge nostalgic attraction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33RSU6JJWY2RT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000053L6W#wasThisHelpful","R33RSU6JJWY2RT","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Long ago, Lee Child developed a winning formula for his Jack Reacher series that has served him well over the course of nineteen installments.  Regular readers know Reacher's personality, instincts, and capabilities so well that they can settle in comfortably with each new novel and forget that time is slipping away as they engrossingly turn page after page.  Readers know that each Reacher adventure will be action-packed as a suspense/thriller with often an enigmatic mystery thrown in.  Things and people are not always what they seem in a Jack Reacher novel.In ""Personal"", The CIA and the military reach out to our taciturn loner to help locate an American trained sniper who may be the shooter behind an attempt on the President of France and perhaps planning other assassinations of world leaders at the upcoming G8 conference.  The suspected sniper is John Kott, recently released from prison after a 15 year term, who was initially captured by Reacher when he was still a military MP.  Reacher is prevailed upon by governmental leaders to go to Europe and find and deal with this suspected terrorist.  But who is behind the sniper?  Who might be the ""real"" target?  Is Reacher really expected to succeed?  Child uses tight plotting and increasing suspense to bring all these questions to a satisfying conclusion and an unexpected denouement.Child employs a new character, CIA rookie analyst in her first field assignment, Casey Nice, as a real time ""conscience"" whose questions and ethical barriers help readers understand Reacher's underlying belief system.  As always, Reacher's intuitive skills, coupled with his attention to detail, allow him to stay one or two steps ahead of the bad guys and the readers as well.  He always picks up several clues to the ""real"" mastermind or ""real"" motivating force that he ponders until late in the story when all is revealed.  For this reader, this was an enjoyable return to form for Jack Reader and I recommend this effort and the entire series very highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35AC0HIC7LD71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178747#wasThisHelpful","R35AC0HIC7LD71","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Black Ace"" was my first encounter with G.B. Joyce and his character, Brad Shade, a former hockey player and current hockey scout who also does some sleuthing.  Shade and his pal ""Chief"" travel to the small town of Swift Current, Saskatchewan to pay respects to the widow of their old playing buddy Martin Mars who apparently committed suicide.  But Mars' widow soon hijacks them into ascertaining if it was indeed a suicide or something else.Almost immediately, Shade finds himself unwelcome in town and is the center of fights and threats--all which reinforce his supposition that something is not right in the sleazy town of Swift Current which apparently harbors many secrets as did his buddy, Mars.  The rest of the book is the unraveling of the mystery surrounding Mars' death and the pressure exerted by Shade to find the truth and exact ""justice"" whatever that may be in his mind.  It seems Brad Shade is a philosopher of life who, while struggling with his own demons, tries to steer a path that is compatible with his own personal philosophy and the expectations of the law and society.I liked the prose and stylings of Mr. Joyce but this effort is certainly not a thriller; indeed. it is more of a character driven mystery.  There are long periods with little or no action and a lot of philosophizing and self introspection while driving long distances back and forth across Canada--there is a sense that a hundred pages could have been edited out and the story would not have been overly impacted.  And for this first time reader, the character of Brad Shade needs further refining as to who he is, what his core values are, and where he wants to go.  I will read the next effort by Joyce to see if his character and his plotting progresses with the promise I see in his writing.

"The ""Pro Edition Wrist Wraps"" are an excellent alternative for anyone seeking extra wrist support for weight training, heavy lifting at home or work, sports enthusiasts etc.  They are well made of high quality materials and come at a reasonable price making them a real value in my opinion.  They are a ""one-size-fits-all"" product measuring about 3"" wide by 16"" long (including velcro strip).  They are black with sporty red highlights and contrasts which attract interested looks from other gym-goers.  They are labeled Right and Left although each can easily be used on either wrist.  My remaining question about the enduring quality of the stretch material and velcro was answered by their no questions asked lifetime warranty.I have been a gym rat and weight trainer for over 40 years and as creeping age and wear and tear usage have weakened my wrists over time, I was eager to try these wrist wraps as an alternative to occasionally taping a sore wrist.  What a great decision.  They have a thumb loop on each unit that helps hold the product in place as you wrap it around your wrist (in my case almost two times around) adjusting it as you wrap to allow for the proper tightness and support desired.  If the user feels it to be too tight after a set of exercises, a release of the velcro strap allows for a slight adjustment in tautness followed by resnugging the velcro.I have worn this product through three total weight workouts and judge them to be excellent at support and ease of use.  I felt no pain during any repetitious exercise nor in any heavy lift; indeed, I felt secure, supported, and comfortable at all times.  I was surprised and amused at several gym acquaintances who came up to ask me about the wraps, often mentioning how sporty they looked.  I highly recommend this product to any athlete, weekend warrior, or individual in need of wrist support.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9Y3ND2SAGXE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K9T3XSI#wasThisHelpful","R9Y3ND2SAGXE5","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Among my many lifetimes ""quests"" has been the search for the perfect pillow--one not too hard and stiff,  nor one too soft and pliant.  Most of us seek a pillow that contours to our needs, is comfortable, and well made.  The  ""Advanced Foam Core and Fiber Pillow"" comes pretty close to meeting all my expectations.Its specifications state that it is 60% polyester fiber and 40% polyester foam, and its foam core is rated as hypoallergenic.  Construction specifics detail an egg crate foam core (which allows for air circulation to avoid heat builld-up) surrounded by a ""down-like"" fiberfill to help soften and contour to the head and neck areas.  It is enclosed by a 200 thread count cotton pillow cover and comes in three sizes, std., queen, and king (20"" by 36"").I have slept with this pillow for several months and am highly pleased with its utility and performance.  Is it perfect--no, but darned close.  It is every bit as comfortable for me as the highly advertised brands sold on TV informercials.  After over three months of usage, it still retains its original shape and feel with only a very slight compression area in the middle--something easy to anticipate with constant usage.  It gives me support contoured to my head and neck shape without being too firm or unyielding.  I never wake up in the middle of the night with that need to change pillows due to heat buildup or perspiration.I currently have over a dozen pillows of all sizes and types including foam filled, down filled, polyester filled, etc. with designs ranging from standard department store pillows to ""revolutionary"" egg crate to gel filled etc.  This pillow has become one of my preferred ""go-to"" pillows for a good night's sleep.  Until I find something better, I highly recommend it to those still seeking the perfect pillow.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AOLOM4WAONR8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GUTQ0FE#wasThisHelpful","R3AOLOM4WAONR8","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read all the Jonathan Quinn novels by Brett Battles except this prequel to ""The Cleaner"" until it arrived recently in paperback.  It is a true prequel in that it chronicles the metamorphous of Quinn from a rookie cop to a fledgling ""cleaner"", someone who cleans the site of an assassination by removing the body and any accompanying clues as to what might have really happened.In ""Becoming Quinn"", Jake Oliver is a young ambitious rookie cop with the Phoenix PD who is one of the first-on-scene of a burning barn with a dead body inside.  Blessed (or cursed) with an intense curiosity and eye for detail, coupled with amazing instincts, Jake quickly violates protocol and begins his own investigation following up several leads he thinks the detectives missed at the crime scene.  Soon, he is risking his job, his life, and the lives of others as consequences for his unauthorized investigation as he becomes watched and hunted by Larson, an unstable assassin, and Durrie, a cleaner extraordinaire.  Ultimately Durrie must decide whether to terminate Jake or recruit him.  Thus, the wheels are set in motion that will determine Jake's future--it is no spoiler to assume that Jake is the before and Quinn is the after--the fun is reading how he gets there.Battles continues to be one of those writers who seem to grow with each new effort--his prose is stylish and easy to read.  His character development is thorough along with credible dialogue and descriptions of places and people.  I enjoyed the young Jake Oliver fighting internally to follow police protocol while his instincts cry out for him to follow up on leads that mean something to him but apparently nothing to his superiors.  In the most fortunate of circumstances, Durrie sees the nascent talents of Jake and decides to recruit him against the wishes of ""The Office"".  However, Jake does not want to be recruited and has no idea of whom to trust.I am only assigning four stars as I have minor quibbles over the sloppiness of the hit team and with his determination to violate law enforcement protocol which ultimately has tragic consequences.  But these two points, while appearing somewhat contrived, are essential to Jake's story of ""Becoming Quinn"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L61KN7DUAKLS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497482801#wasThisHelpful","R3L61KN7DUAKLS","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never been a balm man, preferring, instead, liquid aftershaves.  However, ""Burberry Brit Rhythm Aftershave Balm"" was a convincing eye-opener for me.  It is a soothing and refreshing after shave balm with the creamy consistency of a balm but leaves no oily feeling or residue.  It claims to be infused with the scent of Burberry Brit Rhythm Eau De Toilette, which is a product I have not used; however, I found the scent to be clean, refreshing, and woodsy smelling.  The scent is strong right out of the squeeze bottle but it quickly mellows and does not seem to linger nor to be cloying.My one concern regards packaging, in that, while the manufacturers created a plastic squeeze bottle with a textured surface to combat slippery hands and fingers, it has a square screw type bottle cap that is difficult to handle with slippery fingers after spreading the balm--might have been wiser to employ an alternate type of lid.  All in all, a soothing refreshing scent infused in a moisturizing balm that I am currently enjoying in place of my usual liquid after shaves.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLB5Q3Q48EGZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EYXNODE#wasThisHelpful","RLB5Q3Q48EGZB","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reading the reviews on this book reminds me of the dichotomy that now exists among Koontz'  loyal readers.  I have come to the conclusion, as have many others, that  sometime about a decade ago, perhaps around the time that his beloved golden, Trixie, died that a new Dean Koontz arrived.  This Neo-Koontz  relies much less on the supernatural  and with far fewer of the chills and thrills that used to grab the reader in a ""can't-turn-the-pages-fast-enough"" choke hold.  His novels have evolved heavily into faith based efforts that would be comfortable sitting on Christian literature shelves.In ""The City"", a young black youth, Jonah Kirk, is soon to discover his God given talents as a musical prodigy despite the absence of his wayward feckless father.  His near poverty driven life is counterbalanced by his wonderful loving mother, grandparents, and an inscrutable Japanese tailor named Mr. Yoshioka.  Jonah's life seems to change when he meets a mysterious woman who claims to be ""The City"" itself, personified in her person.  Almost simultaneously, Jonah meets and is soon terrorized by a woman who lives on the floor above his apartment; all of which leads to his discovery of a dangerous cabal of anarchists who threaten his very existence.The rest of the book centers around his efforts along with Mr. Yoshioka, to ascertain what this evil group is up to and how to hopefully stop them.  The problem is that not much really happens for huge chunks of the book (it could have been shortened by 100 pages with no loss of coherence).  Koontz' skill as a wordsmith coupled with his tremendous ability to describe people, places, and emotions are still very much in evidence, perhaps too much so, as his multi-paragraph descriptions can get tedious.But it is with his faith-based confrontations between good and evil have devolved from the thrill ride suspenseful page turners like ""Watchers', "" Phantoms"", and ""Strangers"" into an era where faith, religion, commitment to goodness will always win out, usually with the aid of a helping spirit invested in a loyal dog, a precocious child, or in this case, a woman who claims to be The City.  According to the Neo-Koontz,  believe hard enough and live a good enough life and good people with be drawn to you and you will survive the darkness.I have no judgment for this change of styling by a wonderful author I grew up reading voraciously.  I merely attempt to explain my perception of his changed writing style in context of so many formerly loyal readers who are confused, angry, or disappointed by these changes--fans who continue buying his books expecting a rebirth of the Koontz of old.  I now read his novels with modified expectations and with less of a mindless urge to purchase each new book regardless of plot lines.  Koontz is still a fine author--just a different one from the one I grew up with.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL11OFT1C0QGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345545931#wasThisHelpful","RL11OFT1C0QGZ","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Ready To Kill"" is Andrew Peterson's fourth offering in his Nathan McBride series and it the most disappointing of the series for this reader. McBride is a former CIA operative and highly trained marine sniper who now teams with life-long buddy and fellow operative, Harvey Fontana, to run a security agency which helps provide them cover for off-the-books government work.  As regular readers know, McBride still suffers from physical as well as psychological and emotional scars from a near fatal torturous questioning over a decade ago by a fiendishly devoted Nicaraguan interrogator specializing in torture and humiliation.  Nathan is a hard, tough fighting man who also has the proverbial heart of gold which helps explain his inner turmoil and conflicts over what he is required to do in the performance of his job while, at the same time, abhorring that same violence.A cryptic message containing information regarding a former CIA top secret operation in Nicaragua that involved Nathan and Harv is delivered to the American embassy in Nicaragua.  Nathan and Harv agree to return to the Nicaraguan jungles in a reconnaissance mission to ascertain if one of their sniper trainees, code name ""Raven"", has gone rogue.  They link up with another former team member, Viper, who is sure it is Raven who is operating as an enforcement arm for gold mine owners and drug cartels.  Once the 3 former team members link up in Nicaragua, the action slows down noticeably as the whole second half of the book is a long detailed depiction of their pursuit and ultimate confrontation with the villains.Compared to the other three Nathan McBride novels, ""Ready To Kill"" has a dearth of action and thrills and the pacing gets bogged down in minutiae.  Even the dialogue seems comparably less crisp and credible.  The imagined fear of Nathan returning to the jungle where he was almost tortured to death decades before did not develop into any meaningful plot line except for a brief revelation post climax.Peterson's McBride series features a conflicted smart, tough ex-government operative in fast paced suspense thrillers often featuring dark deadly villains involved in horrifying crimes against humanity. They are usually quick reads that often involve some cringe-inducing scenes  mellowed by satisfying final confrontations and finales.  While still a very acceptable read, ""Ready To Kill"" is the weakest  of this highly recommended series for all thriller/suspense fans.  Be sure to read the other three to get a full flavor of Peterson's work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RTY0W867D9RE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477822801#wasThisHelpful","R2RTY0W867D9RE","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"David Housewright's McKenzie series remains on my ""must read"" list and I have yet to be truly disappointed in any of the novels.  ""The Devil May Care"" is the eleventh McKenzie novel and it is a fun entertaining read featuring a mystery that ultimately entwines McKenzie once again with the hated Muehlenhaus family.  Rushmore McKenzie is a former St. Paul detective who retired to accept a huge reward and has since languished in retirement except when he does favors for friends as an unlicensed PI.Riley Brodin, granddaughter of Minnesota billionaire Walter Muehlenhaus, beseeches McKenzie to find her missing boyfriend, Juan Carlos Navarre.  Wary of becoming involved with Muehlenhaus  (a man who hates McKenzie) again, but drawn to Riley's plight, McKenzie launches an investigation that soon surprises even him.  Navarre is somewhat of a ""ghost"" in that everything he supposedly owns turns out to be rented or borrowed.  Who is he really?  Is he really a multi millionaire as he claims or is he a fraud?  Who else is looking for Navarre with deadly intent and why?  McKenzie must answer these questions while avoiding the wrath of Muehlenhaus as the bodies begin to pile up and as local police agencies scrutinize McKenzie's involvement.  Without tipping his hand too soon, Housewright entertains the reader with fully fleshed characters, locales, and dialogue that seem incredibly real.  Indeed, he has a knack for painting ""word pictures"" for his engrossed readers that allow them to almost ""see"" and ""feel"" the characters and places of the twin cities of Minnesota.As usual, McKenzie must rely upon his people skills, his instincts, and his training to try to accomplish the formidable task ahead of him. And as usual, his ""inner voice"" is there to help guide him and keep him out of trouble. The novel is tightly plotted with thoroughly fleshed characters and places. ""The Devil May Care"" is a fun and a quick read that is a rewarding experience for fans of the McKenzie series.  I highly recommend this book as well as the entire McKenzie series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K6PHKBB3C0VS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250009618#wasThisHelpful","R2K6PHKBB3C0VS","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Mr. Mercedes"" is Stephen King's latest and, expectedly, some will lament the absence of supernatural forces and others will enjoy his tale of good vs. evil without paranormal goings-on.  ""Mr. Mercedes"" is, at its core, a battle of wits between a retired detective still haunted by a senseless killing of innocent people waiting in line by a madman in a Mercedes and the killer himself with the temerity to challenge the detective.Bill Hodges is unhappily retired and finding his life suddenly meaningless when he receives a letter from the ""perk"" who ran down 23 people waiting in an employment line.  The letter, meant to spur him into committing suicide, instead revitalizes him to revisit the crime and find the demented killer who is promising to kill again.  Soon, with the aid of an unlikely neighbor and a mentally unstable relative of a victim of Mr. Mercedes, Hodges engages the killer in a cat and mouse game of wits that he must win or face the lasting knowledge that his failure resulted in a great loss of innocent lives.King has gravitated toward the crime/thriller genre recently and, for this reader, he hits the mark.  Yes, some of the storyline and characters are a bit hackneyed but his great skill at word smithing and painting mental pictures brings the pursuit of a serial killer into a suspenseful ""chess game"" between representatives of good and evil.  Every King story does not have to include a Barlow the vampire, a deadly Pennywise the clown, or a Tommyknocker to be a well conceived and well plotted crime story capable of engaging a reader in a, at times, white knuckler thriller.As is often the case, King's main characters become fleshed through their interactions and he soon brings the reader along with him in a story not entirely predictable, especially considering his penchant for surprising the reader with the unexpected.  I continue to be a avid King fan regardless of genre, quite capable of enjoying an ""11/22/63"", a ""Joyland"", as well as a ""Doctor Sleep"".  Certainly, in ""Mr. Mercedes"", there is joy in watching King employ the talents of three unlikely allies to pursue a crazed killer armed with modern technology,and hell bent on another mass killing.  For me, the growth of these characters through the course of the novel was worth the price of admission.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SWZJ2KHXFWKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476754454#wasThisHelpful","R1SWZJ2KHXFWKG","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Forsaken"" is the fourth in Ace Atkins's hero-driven ""Ranger"" series starring Quinn Colson, a former ranger and army hero who returned to his hometown of Jericho, Mississippi to continue a struggle against corruption and injustice.  It is an engrossing series reflecting accurate depictions of the deep South along with deeply believable human interest studies.  Although I am getting a bit fatigued with some of the recurring story lines, particularly that of Johnny Stagg, the local master manipulator, there is much to enjoy in the Ranger series.In ""The Forsaken"", Quinn and his chief deputy, Lillie, are confronted with a cold case from 36 years earlier that ended with a rape and killing followed by a lynching of a homeless black man two days later.  A survivor of the attack assures Quinn the lynch mob hung an innocent man because she saw the real perpetrator on the street days after the lynching.  But no one else seems to want to help the law nor do they want this dead case reopened.  Who was involved and who did the actual killing, and, most of all, why?While embroiled in this investigation and fighting against trumped up charges stemming from the events in ""The Broken Places"", Colson and Lillie are forced to deal with Chains LeDoux, a former leader of the local Born Losers motorcycle gang who returns to Jericho with his gang looking for vengeance after spending twenty years in jail.  Who is on his death list and why?  Why is Johnny Stagg and his new protector, Ringold, pulling every string he has to set Colson against LeDoux?  These questions are answered as the novel ratchets up the suspense and danger with each new revelation that ultimately leads to a final confrontation that leaves several unanswered questions for the next installment.Quinn utilizes his instincts and his moral compass to ferret out the background of these deadly events from Jericho's past and is surprised when his Uncle Hamp, the sheriff at the time, and Quinn's own father, Jason, were possible participants.  For fans of this series, Quinn's father finally makes an appearance and some of the unanswered questions from Quinn's past are finally addressed.  As usual, the dialogue is spot on and highly credible and the characters are deeply fleshed out.  Atkins's portrayal of the people and the places of small town Jericho are so believable that the reader can almost 'feel"" and see them.  A highly recommended series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IQG6JO5K1M9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399161791#wasThisHelpful","R2IQG6JO5K1M9Q","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just as there are fans who believe Elvis is still alive, there are Old West enthusiasts who insist that Billy The Kid was not killed by Pat Garrett and that Butch and Sundance did not die in Bolivia.  David Fuller's ""Sundance"" is a fun speculative ""what if"" novel that is built on the idea that Sundance was in a Wyoming prison serving time under an assumed name and never died in Bolivia.  Released in 1913, Harry Longbaugh (Sundance's real name) goes in search of his true love, Etta Place, who dropped off the face of the earth about two years before his release when her weekly letters suddenly stopped.Harry follows his instincts and a questionable trail to New York City in his search for his beloved--while he, himself, is being followed by lawman Charlie Siringo, a former ally, who does not believe the legends that Sundance is dead.  Harry's arrival in NYC presents a great but largely unfilled opportunity to explore the man-out-of-time paradox as he encounters electric lights, horseless carriages, subways, and telephones.  Harry quickly goes from wide eyed wonderment at the contrast of the big city from his stark cloistered prison to total acceptance of this new world as he pursues his search for Etta.In short order, Harry is involved not only in finding Etta, but avoiding the agents of the Black Hand who also seek her for personal vengeance and Charlie Siringo who is closing in.  Harry must employ all his outlaw instincts and experiences to find his lost love and save them both from the clutches of New York's most feared gangsters.  Harry does employ some Old West survival instincts when wielding his six-gun and when using a horse off a delivery wagon in a desperate race to save Etta.  Unfortunately, there are not enough of these moments.Fuller does an admirable job of constructing an alternative history for Sundance and Etta surrounded by extraordinary scenes of an emerging behemoth NYC amid the gathering clouds of WWI.  The prose is excellent and the dialog credible and believable.  His characters are generally fully fleshed and reflective of the time period.  Of course, there are times when a leap-of-faith by the reader is necessary but that flows with the theme of the novel.My quibbles are minor considering the efficacy of the whole.  I felt that outside of solving the mystery of where Etta is hiding, Harry was not given enough to do that was reflective of his Old west character.  There is little physical violence in the book and Harry is strangely reticent when threatened at times.  Concomitantly, Harry seems to adjust and ""fit in"" to his new world much more quickly than we might have expected; indeed, we quickly lose sight of how ""new"" all these sights are to a fish-out-of-water from the old west.  But read simply as a love story wrapped around a mystery, ""Sundance"" delivers in a big way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UCFFHFPWB5LS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594632456#wasThisHelpful","R1UCFFHFPWB5LS","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What teenager hasn't imagined a team up of Batman and Robin or Spiderman And the Hulk? In the world of thrillers, many have wondered what might happen if their favorite signature character teamed up with someone else's signature character to solve a crime.  Who would be the lead, would there be intellectual competition, could two alphas get along?In ""FaceOff"", edited by David Baldacci, some of these imagined pairings are actually made real in a series of short stories.  Twenty-three top thriller writers were paired together to create 11 short stories featuring the signature character of each author. Think Jack Reacher and Nick Heller; Patrick Kenzie and Harry Bosch working together; Lincoln Rhyme and Lucas Davenport solving the same crime, etc.  Each story has a brief introduction describing the authors, the characters, and how they collaborated on the story.  A brief biography of each contributor is included at the end of the book to help new readers get a better handle on their work.""FaceOff"" contains some very interesting pairings that will bring many readers joy while reading of their favorite character and allow other readers to experience particular characters for the first time. I found that aspect to be useful since it gave me an opportunity to experience some characters from well-known authors who I had not yet explored.  Unfortunately the short story format forces a quick resolution of the plot line which can be contrived at times.The nature of short stories necessarily limits the amount of characterization and background in each of these stories; yet, our familiarity with many of the characters provides the needed character and background without having to have it explained to us.  Equally, the crimes are relatively quickly resolved again due to the nature of a 20 to 30 page short story.  Some of the pairings are handled more seriously than others which have more of a flavor of humor. But knowing that two well-regarded thriller writers collaborated to create something that encompassed both their hero characters, lends gravitas and fun to each short story.I personally enjoyed Dennis Lehane's Patrick Kenzie teaming with Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch and I found R.. L. Stine's  Slappy the Ventriloquist Dummy versus Preston and Child's Aloysius  Pendergast to be fun reading.  Lee Child's Jack Reacher and Joseph Finder's Nick Keller was a fun bonus highlighting their characters.All in all, a fun and somewhat innovative collection of team up stories. A fast read that is very appropriate for the beach or the pool.  Personally, I now have several new characters to catch up on. Recommended but limit your expectations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K6ZW1044QUAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476762066#wasThisHelpful","R1K6ZW1044QUAS","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Third Rail"" is the debut novel of Rory Flynn, featuring detective (usually) Eddie Harkness.  Flynn does a better job with characterization and locales than with action and suspense.  He writes in a stream of consciousness style that reminded me vaguely of Charlie Huston's Hank Thompson series.  While this flow of consciousness can foster gritty dialogue, it can also get the reader confused as to who is speaking.Harkness was a highly regarded leader of a Narco-Intel squad in Boston until a shooting creates enough of a furor to get him banned to the small town outside Boston where he grew up.  One night as he is fighting his demons with liquor, his police issue gun disappears and he is desperate to find it in order to preserve his future career.  Simultaneously, he begins investigating a new designer drug in the area called ""Third Rail"" which has a devastating effect on users.Not sure who he can trust, Harkness soon finds himself waist deep in dirty cops, slimy street characters, and corrupt politicians.  He is not sure he can even trust his new girlfriend who keeps him looking over his shoulder.  There are some minor surprises along the way and a somewhat satisfying conclusion but overall, I did not feel drawn to Eddie as a leading character;  certainly he is more of an everyman than a hero.  In fact, looking back, I sense that I never was invested in any of the characters or their back stories.  This is certainly something that first time author, Flynn, can rectify as he gets more comfortable.  The lack of action coupled with the shady characters drawn right out of casting 101 left me wanting more than there was to get.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I6WMNNODJYYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544226275#wasThisHelpful","R1I6WMNNODJYYK","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoy this product.  The ""Smart Weigh"" kitchen scale and timer is far superior to the kitchen scale my family previously used.  It is a sleek and ergonometrically stainless steel design that is attractive and useful.  The backlit LCD readout is clear and big enough to read easily.  It has an 11.4 lb capacity (large for most small kitchen scales) and is listed at 9.5"" by 5.75"" with a low- to- the- counter profile.It is powered by 3 AAA batteries and includes an Auto Off  timer to save battery life.  It easily shifts into differing modes for oz., g., ml., and fl.oz.  An extra most will appreciate is the built in timer that is imminently useful in most kitchens.  For those who are math challenged, there is a ""tare"" feature which allows for the accurate measurment of quantities within containers by the push of a button.  All in all, a functional and useful kitchen addition that I have quickly come to value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M6SB5U6SWVP9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IEOV4WW#wasThisHelpful","R1M6SB5U6SWVP9","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Joe Ledger: Special Ops"" is a fun addition to the action/thriller series produced by Jonathan Maberry.  Ledger is a former cop and Army Ranger who heads Echo Team for the Department Of Military Sciences (DMS) headed by the mysterious Deacon Church.  The DMS is tasked with being the last line of defense against terrorists who possess the latest in bioweapons, genetic enhancements, and even the supernatural.In ""Joe Ledger: Special Ops"", Maberry presents a compilation of Ledger short stories, some old and some new that supplement and enhance the ongoing series.  Each of the nine short stories is described as fitting into a timeline, such as occurring after the events of ""Patient Zero"" or between the novel's ""Assassin's Code"" and ""Extinction Machine"" to assist readers in referencing the context.Indeed, there is a later chapter that outlines an annotated chronological listing of each novel and short story in the Joe Ledger universe.  Another ""extra"" is a chapter on ""Inside The DMS"" which includes biographies of all the ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" along with a glimpse inside the DMS--sporadic readers or new readers of the Joe Ledger series should find this to be excellent reference material.  While most of the stories have appeared somewhere before (I had never read any of them before), there are two brand new stand alones and each is incorporated into the Ledger series' timeline.The stories are typical Maberry/Ledger tales  of Joe and Echo Team continuing their battles against seemingly insurmountable evil with the action being short and to the point as is necessary with short stories.  There is still plenty of action, violence, gore, and heartache.  There is still much to learn about one of literature's true warrior heroes and we get time lapsed stories which amplify his growing legacy.  All the usual characters are represented including Top, Bunny, Church, Violin, Aunt Sallie, et.al.  I found this a quick fun read that at best added to the Joe Ledger growing profile.  Although designed for long time fans of the series, it can still stand alone for astute readers newly introduced to the character.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R138UK7IOQWQGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940161398#wasThisHelpful","R138UK7IOQWQGH","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Discarded"" is Brett Battles latest offering in his Jonathan Quinn series and it diverges from the usual formula a bit.  Quinn, Nate, Orlando, and  Daeng are all present and accounted for but this time, the team jumps into a deep and dangerous mystery involving an old case of Abraham Delger's, Orlando's mentor.  The action heats up as Quinn's team comes to Abe's support as he becomes threatened by an unknown force much like Quinn's former employer, the Office.Abraham reluctantly delivered a frightened  4 year old child to a contact as an assignment seven years ago.  He has regretted it ever since and periodically makes a cursory attempt to find out what happened to her through a CIA contact, Eli Becker.  Becker finally calls him with information but is killed before they can connect.  But Abe has discovered that others are seeking the missing girl with deadly intentions.Enter Quinn and his team as they rally to support Orlando's trainer and mentor.  Now two separate groups are hunting the girl and each other.  Who was the girl and why was she whisked away after her mother was killed?  Who is paying the shadowy  organization to find and terminate her?  Has Abe uncovered a hornet's nest better left untouched?  Battles answers all these questions as he moves the action along at breakneck speed while ratcheting up the tension and the stakes.I particularly liked that this was a free lance effort by Quinn and Orlando to aid a friend who has opened a Pandora's Box.  They operate mainly by the seat-of-their pants employing their usual resources to find and hopefully protect the girl.  There is a lot of behind-the-scenes skullduggery common to secret organizations each pursuing differing objectives.  ""The Discarded"" is highly recommended both to long time Quinn fans as well as curious newcomers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19SOMELOTFC2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497324475#wasThisHelpful","R19SOMELOTFC2N","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Garcinia Cambogia has become a hot product in the past year or two.  Purportedly derived from the tamarind fruit with calcium and potassium added, it is marketed as the newest weight loss miracle pill in that it is supposed to block fat, burn fat, and suppress the appetite.  Scientific research is highly skeptical while anecdotal testimonies of many users are positive.  Instructions dictate that one 750 mg capsule should be taken with water twice a day thirty minutes prior to a meal.  Packaging and presentation of the product (a dark green capsule) is professional and attractive.My experience with this product has been inconclusive at best and disappointing at worst.  I tried to diligently follow instructions for 60 days and was disappointed in the results.  I must add that I suffered through a long nasty cold in the middle of the cycle that may have affected my sense of efficacy.  Since I run three times a week and work out three times a week, I had hoped for quick noticeable results; however, I never truly lost any significant weight and only occasionally felt less hungry.  Was the occasional lessening of hunger an effect of the product or simply my body reacting to less stimuli?  It is difficult for me to pinpoint the efficacy of an appetite suppressant when I ate the same amounts as normally which may be because of the exercise and running mentioned above; in other words, maybe I just build up a physical need for periodic food.  Therefore, I am hesitant to reject the claims of this product and choose, instead, to indicate that my results were inconclusive.  It seems that this product works for some and not for others which may be a function of body chemistry or of a psychological influence.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZJCPN57JV0QU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FA9D8FK#wasThisHelpful","R1ZJCPN57JV0QU","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Code Zero"" is Jonathan Maberry's latest offering in his explosively violent Joe Ledger series-although chronologically the story unfolds immediately following  ""Patient Zero"", the series' debut.  It is rife with all the elements that legions of Joe Ledger fans have come to expect; extreme violence, lots of gore, mastermind villains, strange or aberrational creatures and killers, and high tech weapons.  Deacon Church, Aunt Sallie, and the rest of the Department of Military Sciences (DMS) are included as well as Top, Bunny, and other new and old members of Joe's Echo Team.  And one must not forget Joe's warrior dog, Ghost, who may be the most endearing killer dog in literature.""Code Zero""  focuses on an  apparently anarchical cell creating murder and destruction randomly across the US led by a woman known as Mother Night with expressed desires to create anarchy and destruction but which is ultimately aimed at destroying Church, Ledger, the DMS, and the USA as we know it.  As Echo Team scrambles to find and stop Mother Night, her minions attack the DMS ""Locker"" where all the deadly bio weapons from previous encounters have been stored.  Soon, Ledger's task is magnified with the random appearance of zombies, ""berserkers"" and deadly viruses that are sudden additions to Mother Night's arsenal.Can Joe and his wounded team emerge victorious over an enemy fortified with myriad deadly bio weapons --a foe who even seems able to neutralize MindReader, the uber computer of the DMS?  And just who really is Mother Night, the diabolically evil leader who seems to know way too much about Joe, Church, and MindReader?  ""Code Zero""  embarks on a suspense filled thrill-a-minute ride to answer these questions.  My only quibble is that the series is beginning to get overly formulaic in recent efforts by recycling villains and monsters at the expense of freshness.  This series is highly recommended for fans of action thrillers and supernatural antagonists.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMV6T8SDQXPAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250033438#wasThisHelpful","RMV6T8SDQXPAF","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Showtime"" is an engrossingly entertaining retrospective look at the Showtime Lakers of the 1980s.  It is an astonishingly compelling book relating everything you thought you knew and much that you never knew about one of the most exciting professional basketball teams of all time.  This is a book not to be missed by anyone who was a basketball fan during the 80's and, in particular, a Lakers fan of that fabulous era.  Kareem, Magic, Wilkes, Michael Cooper, Spencer Haywood, Bob McAdoo, Mitch Kupchak, Norm Nixon, and so many others who transform a lethargic Laker franchise into perhaps the most entertaining, fast breaking, and dysfunctional professional team of all time.Jeff Pearlman has clearly done his homework.  There are references to interviews over a three year period with all the major characters who were part of the Laker magic and interviews with many who were involved in the league but watching from afar.  We learn that Showtime was the brainchild of Jack McKinney, an innovative yet doomed head coach, who saw his fling at fame destroyed by a terrible bicycle accident.  The lamentable Paul Westhead era that followed was controversial and certainly ugly at times,  including the feeling that Magic Johnson was the real force who got him fired.  The Pat Riley era began somewhat inauspiciously and ultimately blossomed into one of the most exciting and entertaining basketball teams in the history of the NBA.Showtime really began when Dr. Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers from Jack Kent Cooke, an owner content to be the overlord of a professional team that really didn't know its own identity or its potential.  Buss changed that with his own personal desire to see a faster more entertaining game and his devotion to acquiring the young Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson to run his team and transform it into what quickly became known as Showtime.""Showtime"" chronicles the entire history of this era including flashbacks and behind the scenes looks at the interpersonal dynamics of the team, the coaches,  and the owner.  Having lived through this era and being a Laker and Celtic fan, a lot of what is represented in the book was known or at least assumed by the media but ""Showtime"" details the animosities, the friendships, the drug use, the wild sex, and the jealousies and pettiness of individual competitors.  Norm Nixon versus Magic Johnson, the recalcitrant Kareem Abdul Jabbar, the drug addled Spencer Haywood, the front office mistakes of drafting the wrong individual, or making trades that alienated players.  So much of what we saw (and didn't see) is revealed in  ""Showtime""  to have been destructive beneath the surface.Pearlman's book can be deeply satisfying at times, depressing and sad at times, and sometimes simply infuriating when reading of the people and the times of the Showtime Lakers. But, it all happened, and it is exhaustively chronicled in this can't-put-down look at the team that changed the face of modern-day professional basketball.  If you were a fan of professional basketball and/or of the Lakers during this astonishing era of the ascendant Laker dynasty and you think you know its history, you need to read ""Showtime"".  Pearlman's book examines this transcendent team not only on its entertaining surface, but with all the dysfunction that occurred behind closed doors revealed warts and all. I cannot recommend this book highly enough for sports fans in general and Laker fans in particular.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RASQ5JEOIB5S6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592407552#wasThisHelpful","RASQ5JEOIB5S6","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Randy Wayne White's latest Doc Ford adventure, ""Bone Deep"", readers receive an education in the ancient history of Florida including Spanish explorers and even Mastodons and mammoths in even earlier times.  Equally, readers receive education in phosphate mining and its tenuous relationship to maintaining the environment and in relic/fossil hunting, both legal and illegal.  Wrapped within all this information is an intriguing yet convoluted plot that ultimately involves black marketeers, relic and fossil thieves, beautiful but conniving women, a psycho Harley-riding killer, and an old money Florida family filled with historical ""baggage"".Doc Ford is enlisted to help Tomlinson's friend, Duncan Fallsdown, track down stolen artifacts from his tribe in Montana which ultimately leads Doc into a twisted tale of greed, double crosses, weird characters, and elephants...yes, live elephants.  Wayne does a decent job of weaving the plotline through his attempts to educate the reader on the tenuous and dangerous balance in Central Florida between phosphate mining, fossil thieves in Bone Valley ( a part of Central Florida containing a treasure trove of ancient bones and ivory) and a vulnerable and fragile environment.There is not a lot of in-depth characterization among a bevy of new and minor characters although readers are very familiar by this time with Doc, Tomlinson, and Hannah.  Doc employs his instincts and knowledge of his beloved Florida to zero-in on a complex relationship between the Leland Albright family, its phosphate mining operation, and greedy relic hunters who are willing to kill for what they want.  While the plot drags a bit at times, it does inevitably lead to a violent and sometimes surprising climax seasoned with a bit of historical mysticism.While this novel is an improvement over the last several, my concerns about the Doc Ford series remain somewhat validated.  I maintain that the Doc Ford series has subtly shifted from action/suspense thrillers to unique mysteries-of-the-week focused around Doc and Tomlinson's bickering and dime store psychology.  Each new outing features Doc's constant need to rein in Tomlinson's misplaced exuberance or entanglement in a plot he cannot foresee.  Truth be told, Tomlinson has become a tedious Gabby Hayes type sidekick to Doc to the extent that I would enjoy a Doc Ford novel in which Tomlinson is off somewhere far, far away.  Doc himself has morphed from a former NSA "" black op"" assassin who struggled with repressing his alpha dog violent side into a detective who makes stupid mistakes such as forgetting to bring his weapon or misjudging people or situations that now make him vulnerable and at-risk to common bad guys.  Doc will always be a formidable force for good...but I long for a return to the dangerous undercover assassin who must constantly fight his need for violence while making ""gray-area"" decisions that test his morals and his personal code.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM2NTOY7RQU0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399158138#wasThisHelpful","RM2NTOY7RQU0R","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Dead Eye"" is Mark Greany's latest Gray Man novel and it is a dandy.  Court Gentry (the Gray Man), perhaps the world's greatest assassin, is still on the run from powerful forces in his own country who is out to terminate him using all the resources of the CIA and even independent operators. Having been recently betrayed by his handler, Gentry exacts his revenge but in the process tips the hunters as to his location.Soon Gentry is in a life-and-death cat and mouse chase across Europe in an effort to prevent the assassination of the Israeli Prime Minister, while at the same time, struggling to escape the clutches of the CIA, and another assassin, code named Dead Eye,  who may be Gentry's mirror image.  How does one escape someone who is equally trained and seemingly equally adept at manipulating people and circumstances, blending into the background, and able to read your every next move?""Dead Eye""  is tightly plotted and immensely suspenseful,  filled with thrills, double crosses, and a body count that climbs quickly.  Who can Gentry trust and who is his real enemy?  How does one survive when he is being followed and targeted by the CIA, independent contractors, the Mossad, local police, and  just about anyone including high flying spy drones?  These questions are masterfully handled by Greany in his excellent suspense thriller, ""Dead Eye"". The confluence of the Gray Man's attempt to avert an assassination while protecting himself from assassination provides thrills and suspense that keep the reader on the edge of the seat.Some readers may find discomfort and/or frustration with a 400+ page novel that pretty much addresses one assassin targeting another assassin by assuming his identity and framing him for a world class crime. Plots like this can become tedious but Greany does a good job of keeping the action and suspense at a high-level while investing the reader  in the Gray Man and another character, Ruth Ettinger, a master spy for the Mossad.  If you are a fan of action and suspense thrillers with deadly and resourceful signature characters, the Gray Man is a series you should not miss .

Thorn accidentally discovers that Flynn Moss, a son he only recently discovered, is somehow tied in with Prince and a group of eco-terrorists.Thorn seeks  the group out in an effort to find out what his son is involved in and finds himself forced to participate in a plot to disable Southern Florida's nuclear power plant at Turkey Point to protect Flynn. Members of the Earth Liberation Front, ELF, have decided to make a public statement against nuclear power by disabling the plant.Meanwhile, Frank Sheffield, a special agent in the FBI and a former acquaintance of Thorn's, is closing in on the suspected plot at Turkey Point. It appears that Sheffield has been getting information from Flynn but he has no idea that Thorn is now a part of the conspiracy. For his part, Thorn is trying to protect his son, prevent nuclear catastrophe, and keep as many people alive as possible.""Going Dark"" presents a considerable number of characters, some who are more fully fleshed than others, and many whose loyalties are questionable and/or change throughout the course of the novel. Just who can be trusted and whose side are many of them on?  There are double crosses, triple crosses, and a few other surprises that ratchet up the suspense and thrills in this latest thriller by Hall,  especially when one considers the consequences of a nuclear catastrophe in South Florida which would incapacitate the entire southern end of the state including Miami.All the loose threads and first and second level conspiracies come to a head in a violent confrontation at Turkey Point.  Can Thorne foil the plot against the nuclear plant while somehow shielding Flynn from harm or from a criminal conspiracy?  Can Thorne himself escape unscathed?  What happens when Thorn, the FBI,  the eco-terrorists, the inside plotters, and the back stabbers, all meet in one place at one time?  "" Going Dark""  is certainly an entertaining thriller that could be pulled from today's headlines. It's a little heavy on the eco-terroism message and saving the planet philosophy, but it keeps the reader engaged. Reading some other reviews, it's clear that if you have not read any of the Thorn series in the past, you may feel a little lost as to the background of Thorn, Sugarman, and Flynn Moss. There isn't a lot of new character development in Hall's happy little family that many of us have become so fond of.I recommend this especially for Thorn fans even though I feel in this and the last several books, that our protagonist has been losing his edginess. Maybe we are supposed to accept that Thorn is now slowing down in middle-age but it certainly isn't the same Thorn who would be close to violence  anytime a friend or family member was threatened and a man of action who was always on the top of his game.  Lately he has seemed to fade into the background for long periods of time.  Admittedly, in the last two novels, he mentions being out of shape and rusty.  Let's hope that Thorn's next adventure finds him back as he edgy fly-by-the-seat of his pants avenger ready to take action on a moment's notice and certainly in shape enough to deal with weightlifting muscle bound posers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30E4R5G08PC5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250005000#wasThisHelpful","R30E4R5G08PC5H","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Discretion""  is David Balzarini's first novel. It's not a bad novel but does seem to be a novel in search of an identity. I was given a copy to read and provide an honest review without any prior knowledge except a brief plot outline.  ""Discretion"" aspires to be a suspense thriller, with a touch of the supernatural,  but it's basically a novel belonging in the Christian literature section.The first 70 pages read like a promising thriller.  Colin Wyle is boating with his girlfriend Natalie and his father when she disappears while he and his father nap in the boat on the lake. Where is she? How did she leave without waking them and why? Was she kidnapped? Has she drowned?  Colin and the authorities search diligently for days with no trace of Natalie. And yet suddenly it seems Colin has a new ally. He begins hearing a voice talking to him in his mind which he names Christel. The voice seems to know things about Colin's life that no one should know. Eventually the voice leads Colin and a friend to a large boat still on the lake where a gunbattle ensues, a stranger is killed, and Natalie is found down below deck. To this point, ""Discretion"" has kept the readers interest piqued and the suspense has been palpable.""Discretion"" then fast-forwards 15 years and Colin is now a highly successful  financier and is engaged to Marisa, a beautiful woman.  Colin and Natalie  inevitably went in separate directions after her kidnapping and rescue but they remain friends and in occasional contact. But from this point on, the novel focuses on the philosophical inner battle between good and evil, right versus wrong, free choice and will versus doing the right thing or the convenient thing.  Christel has made Colin into a highly successful stock trader with inside knowledge and future predictability that seems impossible for anyone to know. Who or what is Christel? Is she good or evil? Should Colin pay exclusive attention to her commands and desires? When Christel orders him to do some very questionable things, Colin is faced with exercising free will. In other words, between the philosophical musings of Balzarini and the biblical interventions of Colin's friend Jamal, the reader is hit over the head with the religious symbolism of doing the right thing versus doing something that makes us successful and happy.Indeed, the Colin in the beginning of the book is much more interesting than the Colin of 15 years later. This older Colin  is colder, more distant, and certainly more selfish and focused upon himself. Apparently, that is part of the intended lesson for the reader. Success in life without God means the person is soulless and aimless. Find God and you become a person of good and wonder again. But none of this is particularly new, but it is heavily ladled onto the reader in ""Discretion"".""Discretion"" plays out as a private investigator hired by Colin's father to help search for Natalie when she was initially missing has continued to search for who kidnapped Natalie 15 years ago. Now he has found evidence of a criminal ring that seems to have kidnapped women to force him into sexual slavery. The FBI is also into this conspiracy at this point. However, the novel ends in a very forced and unsatisfying conclusion regarding the conspiracy and the kidnappers. The message of finding religion and finding one's own relationship with God becomes the overriding focus of the last three quarters of the book. All in all, ""Discretion"" is a somewhat muddled novel that does show potential for David Balzarini. As he sharpens his focus in future efforts, and ties together stronger characterizations wrapped in believable plot lines, he may have a great deal to offer.  Equally, this reader would prefer to make his own choices about the type of literature to be read with books like ""Discretion"" clearly labeled as Christian literature.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37J1DUXP1SEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F1F509K#wasThisHelpful","R37J1DUXP1SEU","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most users of portable electronic devices know the quality, durability, and toughness of Otterbox protective cases.  The new ""OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPad Air"" is no exception.  It is impressive in its attention to detail (with the exception of missing ""sleep"" magnets), its sturdy polycarbonate and rubber construction, and its ability to absorb minor bumps, drops, and handling.  It comes with a protective screen shield and must be assembled which is not an inconsequential task for some.  It has a utilitarian device stand with four different working positions that are accessed by swinging out the shield stand hinge.But be advised that this is not the case for everyone.  If you enjoy the sleek looks and lightweight elements of the iPad Air, you will lose those assets once this case is installed.  It is heavy and bulky which counter the very features used to market the iPad Air.  However, if you are someone who is tough on your tablets e.g. on-the-go/ out-in-the-field workers, carrying it in and out of vehicles, young children or teens who may be rougher on devices than one desires, this is the protective case you need.  It certainly will take a lot of rough handling not possible with the unprotected iPad Air.  Be reminded, this unit does not include the magnets that put your tablet to sleep or wakes it up with closing and opening--you'll have to manually switch it off to avoid battery drainage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HWILC5DGV8AX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FD5L646#wasThisHelpful","R1HWILC5DGV8AX","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Send In The Clowns"" by J. Gregory Smith is the third installment in his Detective Chang series but the first that I have read.  It is not truly an effective stand alone but a discerning reader can piece a lot of the past together from extraneous comments from the characters.  The novel is well written and edited except for the fact that it is a little long winded and the plot is sometimes labyrinthine.Paul Chang and Nelson Rogers are ex-NYPD officers now operating a PI office in Delaware who are hired by TV anchorwoman, Laura Stark, to deal with her ex-husband, Max, a former circus clown who has begun harassing her.  Max steals the book as an innovative over-the-top villain who always seems one step ahead of law enforcement and our heroes.  Chang and Nelson are promising characters and I enjoyed the interplay between their complementary skills and talents.  They are supplemented by Det. Ron Sieger, a figure out of their past adventures.While on the trail of Max, Chang and Nelson soon see their case expand as other elements including the Russian government, the Russian mob, Chechen Rebels, corrupt local governmental figures, dirty billionaires who are not what they seem, etc.  Whew!  Therein lies the novel's weakness--too much is happening at too many levels to follow logically and most of these characters are ordered right out of casting 101.  Who is the mysterious tipster that has promoted Laura's career with accurate inside information on mobsters and corrupt government?  Why is the mayor of NY brokering a truce between Russia and Chechen rebels to be memorialized in  treaty signing in the heart of NY?  What role does the local Russian mob leader Markov play in all this?  And why oh why is Max stalking Laura and tormenting Chang and Nelson?  Smith effectives ties all these threads in an out-of-control locomotive conclusion that seems both satisfying and strangely unfulfilling at the same time.""Send In The Clowns"" reads more like an overly wordy mystery suspense novel than an action thriller; indeed, our protagonist, Paul Chang is always reflecting on his violence seeking inner dragon who never appears until some 300 pages into the story.  All in all, I found Chang and Nelson to be intriguing enough to want to try them again and I would like more of their backstory and a bit deeper characterization.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXLWYP3TZUWHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477805966#wasThisHelpful","RXLWYP3TZUWHU","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read most of what Koontz has published over the years, I have remained a faithful reader throughout the changes in his stylings and novels as his work entered what I refer to as the Neo-Koontz era.  About a decade ago, Koontz' work began moving more toward spirituality, Catholic theory and moralizing about the philosophical nature of man and the world.  This era can be characterized as morality tales where goodness will always overcome malevolent evil, usually with a little help from a righteous spirit inhabiting the family dog or an innocent child. As the Neo-Koontz material develops, longtime devoted fans are usually forced to make choices between.sappy spiritually laden material often slamming you between the eyes to families in constant peril or,  very occasionally, brief glimpses of the former ""master"".  Certainly reading the many mixed reviews on his recent novels attest to the dichotomous split among his ardent readers as his work becomes less and less ""edgy"" and, often, more predictable.In ""Innocence"", Addison Goodheart (even the name is a signal) is a loner hiding in the underworld of subway tunnels and long forgotten underground hidey holes who must hide his appearance from everyone lest he be brutally attacked and/or killed by those repulsed by his facial features and his eyes.  He may be the sweetest character in literature to have bravely lived through parental abandonment, repulsion from mankind, and a miserable lonely existence.  During a middle of the night excursion into the city library, he meets Gwyneth, a girl who cannot stand to be touched and seemingly with as much baggage as Addison possesses.  Gwyneth seems to harbor answers but refuses to share them at critical junctures.  Thrown together amidst a worldwide breakout of the Plague (which is truly underplayed), this oddest of  couples  must bond to fight a common foe while sensing they are meant to be special to one another.  ""Innocence"" is at its root, a story of love in its many manifestations and the enduring character of the human spirit.For this reader, Koontz' stylings have lost the thrilling suspense and edge of your seat tension that his earlier works seemed always to generate. Now we know how the tale will end almost from the first chapter, we just have to stay on the ride to see how it gets there. For me, there was no compelling force driving me to read chapter after chapter in one sitting; indeed, one of the major weaknesses of ""Innocence"" is very poor pacing and the author's reluctance to get to the action at hand.  The entire book is ponderously slow to read with almost no action to move the plot.  Indeed, outside of their afflictions, Addison and Gwyneth are two dimensional characters plodding through a pedestrian plot until a somewhat hurried ""surprise"" ending which may or may not be its sole redeeming feature--again, it seems based on which side of Neo-Koontz one is on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IAEPGEHSHHD0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553808036#wasThisHelpful","R1IAEPGEHSHHD0","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am enjoying my ""Workshop Wet/Dry Vac"" immensely.  Every aspect of it seems bigger, better, or more powerful than my older model shop vac.  It has a very large drum capacity at 12 gallons and a powerful 5 HP motor.  The connecting cord is a generous 15 feet and the 2 and a half inch dual flex suction hose is 7 feet long and offers great flexibility while ""locked"" to the vac.  It even has onboard storage slots for the cleaning accessories (and hose) which I found very useful.The unit weighs about 19 pounds and is made of a strong plastic polymer that seems durable and dent resistant (so far).  The unit is supposedly rust proof and has a large drain for easy liquid elimination.  The ""Workshop Wet/Dry Vac"" is very easy to set up right out of the box (connecting casters) and includes a dry filter and waste bag which eliminates the filthy accumulation of dust and dirt that occurred in my older model vac.  I used it immediately after assembling to clean out my automobile and my garage and found it highly utilitarian.  It is loud but that should be expected with a unit this large and powerful.In summary, the extra large drum, generously long connecting cord, notable powerful suction, onboard storage slots, and a top carrying handle all combine to make this a highly recommended workshop wet/dry vacuum for many of your home cleaning needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTLMESTZRXZWP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FX36YJA#wasThisHelpful","RTLMESTZRXZWP","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Execution"" is prolific television writer and producer Dick Wolf's second novel, both featuring NYPD detective, Jeremy Fisk.  Fisk is recovering from wounds resulting from intercepting Swedish Muslim terrorists who were sneaking into the US across the Canadian border--yes, I know it sounds screwy.  He is assigned light duty including protecting diplomats during United Nations Week in New York which will include the presidents of both Mexico and the US signing a narcoterrorism treaty.But something evil is afoot.  Twenty-three headless bodies were discovered along the US/Mexico border and just as UN Week begins, more beheaded bodies are found on Rockaway Beach in Queens.  A Hummingbird is found carved into these bodies, a symbol representing a depraved violent Mexican killer known only as Chuparosa.  Commandante Cecelia Garza, an officer in Mexico's intelligence agency, arrives in NY to protect  Mexican President Vargas while secretly hoping to find Chuparosa for personal reasons.After some initial sparring, Fisk and Garza reluctantly team up to stop an anticipated assassination which no one else deems credible.  Distrust and suspicion slowly dies between the two as potential romantic sparks begin to build; yet, there remain unspoken secrets between them that prevent romantic action.  Garza has other agendas that Fisk can only speculate upon as they close in on the mysterious Chuparosa, all the while wondering who pulls his strings.  The climax and its aftermath finally raised the thrill level for this reader as more than one secret and more than one killer is revealed.I respect and enjoy Wolf's work immensely on television and I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Intercept"", his first novel.  However, I felt this effort suffered from pacing problems and from a lack of in depth characterization.  It read more like an hour long TV script that carried the reader along before realizing it was finally over.  I simply did not get invested too deeply into any of the characters and the plot was slow and pedestrian until the last 50 pages when the real action and thrills were finally realized.  All in all, a quick read on topics that reflect today's headlines but without the compelling elements of his first Jeremy Fisk novel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSZHS3T4P7BHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062064851#wasThisHelpful","RSZHS3T4P7BHN","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""White Fire"" is the latest installment of Preston & Child's series featuring their signature character, Aloysius Pendergast, a special agent for the FBI and a modern day Sherlock Holmes.  I found this effort to be an  outstanding, highly readable stand-alone adventure for long time Pendergast fans as well as brand new readers.  This time, the action occurs mainly in the US at a ritzy ski resort in Colorado called Roaring Fork where the ultra rich play and connive.Corrie Swanson, Pendergast's protg, is drawn to Roaring Fork in hopes of studying the remains of miners supposedly killed and eaten by a grizzly bear in 1876 that were recently unearthed when a graveyard was dug up to be moved so a new high class development could be built on the ancient site.  Something she discovers apparently threatens powerful forces and she lands in jail where her only recourse is to reach our to Pendergast.  He has been mourning in Europe and finds this case the perfect impetus to get back into his life of crime fighting and soon has Corrie out of jail as the mystery widens.  Soon Agent Pendergast is following leads developed from a rumored meeting between Oscar Wilde and Conan Doyle in the late 1800's where the horror that occurred in the nineteenth century mining town was passed from Wilde (who heard it on a visit to America) to Doyle who may or may not have later used it obliquely in one of his published and one of his ""missing"" unpublished Holmes' tales.Pendergast quickly links a series of deaths and arsons in Roaring Fork to the ghastly deaths that Corrie has been studying and even returns to England in a search for the missing Sherlock Holmes story.  Meanwhile, Captain Stacy Bowdree, a recently discharged military veteran with PTSD and a descendent of one of the dead miners mysteriously arrives in Roaring Fork where she befriends Corrie.  What is her true purpose in coming to collect the remains of her long buried ancestor?  Is she who she purports to be?  And why does the most powerful family in the area want to silence Corrie in one manner or another?In addition to the  delightful references to Wilde and Doyle (a supposed meeting is recreated), there is a most satisfying vignette between Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes that, among other purposes, reminds the reader of the similarities between Holmes and Pendergast.  This entire angle of the plot opens a pleasurable excursion into the realm of ""what if"".""White Fire"" hits the ground running on all cylinders and holds the reader's interest until the very last page through a series of twists and turns, red herrings, and ever widening mysteries encompassed by a community so artfully created that the reader can almost feel the cold as the snow piles up.  As usual, Pendergast is as taciturn and brilliant in his investigations as the voluble Sherlock Holmes once was.  Indeed, we see aspects of Pendergast that have very infrequently been on display in past novels.  This is a well crafted suspense filled thriller that will keep readers guessing until the violent finale and denouement.  I cannot recommend ""White Fire"" highly enough as a reader of all the Pendergast novels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G3CNXE6O1GS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455525839#wasThisHelpful","R1G3CNXE6O1GS6","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The new regional travel guide for the Hawaiian Islands published by Lonely Planet was somewhat of a mixed bag for this reviewer.  Unlike travel guides from AAA or Mobil etc., the Lonely Planet guide is short on details and ratings regarding multiple hotels, motels and restaurants in a particular area. However, there is a great deal of information on scenic activities and things to do. There seems to be a definite interest or focus on outdoor adventures and physical activities.  Indeed, an interesting feature are sample itineraries for each island based on the anticipated length of stay.The guide opens with a general outlook of Hawaii, a useful calendar of activities, climate expectations etc. This section includes the top 20 sites or activities in the islands. Then the guide breaks into individual sections on each of the major Hawaiian Islands covered much like they are in other travel guides with the notable exception that each Island is subdivided by geographical regions. There are sections under each community for beaches, sights (both popular as well as out-of-the way) and activities including where sleep, where to eat, etc....just don't expect the details that you might find in the AAA version as mentioned earlier.  The concluding section gives some perspective on the history of Hawaii and then focuses on the Hawaii of today with information on the population, demographics, arts and crafts, and its economy.A valuable survival guide concludes this travel guide with information on customs, health, food, money, tourist information, transportation etc. A functional index and a pullout driving map of the islands conclude the travel guide. All in all, a useful guide for the traveler who likes to preplan trips and activities and become familiar with all that an area has to offer before arriving.  Travelers seeking information on sight seeing, activities, and regional information will find the Lonely Planet Guide much more useful than the traveler who's primarily looking for a plethora of hotel, motel, and restaurant listings and ratings to choose from.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDV4A21GM3J56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1742204155#wasThisHelpful","RDV4A21GM3J56","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I deeply enjoy the Joe Hunter series by Matt Hilton as pure suspense/thriller escapism.  ""Dead Men's Revenge"" is the sixth in the series and revisits Hunter's old antagonist, serial killer Tubal Cain, who Joe thought he had killed years before.  It has been said that great villains are hard to find and I suspect that is why Cain has been resurrected...but just as comic books overdo the ""killing"" of a villain only to have him reappear again and again, I fear this is Matt Hilton's plan for Tubal Cain.  But if he reappears after this experience, I will not buy another one with him ""resurrected"".Cain has escaped from a maximum security prison and plans on exacting revenge against Walter Conrad, Hunter's mysterious employer, Hunter, and Hunter's brother.  Aided by other devious villains, Cain begins his search to kill his ""hit list"" of vengeance when Joe is coaxed back into the case without full knowledge of Walter's plans.The action is fast and deadly and the plot is plausible yet ""over-the-top"" a bit at times.  Characterization, as usual, is thorough and credible.  Joe is his usual high powered killing machine with unerring instincts.  Cain is so despicable that readers are hooked to see him get his comeuppance.  The ending seems to scream finality for Cain yet the door seems to be left a bit ajar--hence my comments in the opening of this review.Joe Hunter readers will enjoy this book if, at times, they can suspend their sense of disbelief.  But let's hope this is one villain finally vanquished because I won't ride this same train again with him.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O0408VL29W8F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062225308#wasThisHelpful","R3O0408VL29W8F","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By now, everyone knows that ""Doctor Sleep"" is Stephen King's sequel to ""The Shining"" designed to answer the burning question, ""Whatever Happened To Danny Torrance""?  After the terrible events at the Overlook Hotel in ""The Shining"", what became of young Danny, his mother Wendy, and Dick, the life saving cook?  ""Doctor Sleep"" answers those questions and provides the Constant Reader with a fascinating character study of a man anguished by his past, his paranormal ability, and his alcoholism intertwined with a white knuckle suspense thriller that, at times, has the reader setting the book down for a ""breather"".It's been 36 years since ""the Shining"", and Danny is not the same person nor is Stephen King the same writer--they have  both moved on in life.  ""Doctor Sleep"" is NOT a repeat nor a clone of ""The Shining"" which has seemed to disappoint some readers.  Rather it is an extension of the Danny Torrance character as he aged after the horrific events at the Overlook Hotel.  Danny is now Dan, known as Doctor Sleep, for his remarkable ability to help soften the deaths of patients at a hospice in New Hampshire where he ultimately settled after more than 30 years of roaming, drinking, and trying not to become his father.Early on, Dan becomes aware of a powerful individual with the most potent shine he has ever encountered and over the years, communicates with that person as she grows into a precocious 12 year old named Abra Stone.  Their interwoven fate is sealed when they discover a roving band of emotional vampires known as the True Knot who feed off the ""steam"" released by children with the shining when they are tortured to death resulting in greatly increased life spans and strength.  The True Knot is led by ""Rose The Hat"", the most powerful and, ultimately, the most flawed of the group.Rose discovers the hidden power of the young girl in New Hampshire and becomes obsessed with capturing her powerful steam setting in motion the tension and suspense of King's well conceived story line.  It is up to Dan and a couple of friends to assist the untested and untrained  Abra in defending her life and, consequently, taking on the True Knot in an all or nothing battle.The characters of Dan, Abra, and other family and friends are fully fleshed and credible.  The characters of the True Knot are less developed but mainly because they are not the focus of the story outside of maybe Rose and The Crow.  There are occasional pacing problems but these are quickly forgotten when the suspense ratchets up whenever young Abra is threatened.  Read this if you enjoyed the vulnerability of young Danny in ""The Shining"" because his life afterwards is both shocking and sympathetic.  Read this if you enjoy great suspense wrapped around a struggle between good and evil.  And read this if you love great stories told by one of our generations greatest story tellers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UAFEJ6EHPSRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476727651#wasThisHelpful","R1UAFEJ6EHPSRJ","A2838GZWXSF8KH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2838GZWXSF8KH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I normally mix wet food with her dry, but she didn't even want to wait for that. She just ate this down right away and was begging for more.

I did have to divide this bag into sealed containers because this size bag will last for months which makes it a really good value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R172P1MCVIA7DN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DRE5AHE#wasThisHelpful","R172P1MCVIA7DN","A2TBZAC0XYHLIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TBZAC0XYHLIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This collar is probably better for larger breeds.  It fits my 10lb dachshund really well but it is a bit stiff because of the plastic closure.  It does seem work really well and is easy to slip on and off.  I took my pup for a walk with this collar and I found that she didn't pull as much.  I do prefer to use a harness for walks though.  Overall, this is a quality collar that is secure and easy to use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9TL4T763WWY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013GGTX4S#wasThisHelpful","R9TL4T763WWY0","A2TBZAC0XYHLIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TBZAC0XYHLIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My son raved about the eb5 cream for men, so I had to try this one.  It has a great consistency and feels wonderful.  I have super dry, sensitive skin and this did not cause any reaction.  It does have a pleasant. light fragrance but it could just be the vitamin E I am detecting. This cream contains mineral oil and for some people that can cause break outs.  It used to when I was younger but now my skin enjoys it.  I get facials and the person who does them uses a mix of oxygen and mineral oil to help me rehydrate.  A little goes a long way and the price is very good for this quality.  I rotate through different skin products depending on the weather and since the heater has been going, I am probaly going to use more of this just for the moisture it brings to my skin.  I have paid twice as much for creams with similiar ingredients, so overall this is a good value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR7S2F1S2CO49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LHZDOB4#wasThisHelpful","RR7S2F1S2CO49","A2TBZAC0XYHLIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TBZAC0XYHLIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, love the idea for a setting in Industrial Revolution London, it adds a nice touch to the game.  The idea of taking over areas and getting Rival gangs to your side has a bit of a GTA feel to it that I am a big fan of.  The new combat moves and finishing moves that interact with the surroundings and multiple players is a really big improvement on the older, cookie cutter feel of the older fighting system. The use of two characters and the rope line to zip up to the rooftops is a nice touch that give a very dynamic feel to getting around the city.  Having said that, the controls feel very clunky and not a bit frustrating.  A lot of times you find the character going the wrong way or doing things you would not expect them to do, which can cause a lot of frustrations.  I think the combination of the new additions to the fighting system washes out compared to Black Flag because of the added clumsiness of the controls.  Maybe it is just that I havent gotten used to it, but that is the reaction that I had to the game after playing for several hours. The story line starts a bit abruptly, but I do like the tie in to the last Assassins Creed and the way that the storyline has progressed so far.  The driving through the city is a big downgrade compared to the very fun and very entertaining ship sailing of Black Flag.  I was sorely disappointed as that had become one of my favorite parts of Black Flag.  Maybe there is more coming in that regard, but from what Ive seen, it really is not very entertaining.  The ability to have gang members assist you is a really nice bonus though, big fan of that. Overall I really enjoy the game, deep story line, well thought out layout, and lots of fun to play.  The issues I have are not terribly distracting, and the game is still a ton of fun to play.  I personally prefer Black Flag so far, but I havent gotten very far into the game yet to fully pass judgment on that.  Hopefully Im in for some surprises.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IX0108Q301M4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X87MH0I#wasThisHelpful","R3IX0108Q301M4","A2TBZAC0XYHLIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TBZAC0XYHLIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sophie has never had a dream in her whole twelve years.  OK, that is not entirely true. .  With the use of dream catchers, her parents capture dreams and sell them to those wishing specific dreams. She has been told to never drink one of the distilled dreams, but when she is younger decides to steal one.  Out of that dream, she has brought back a monster and of course named him ""MONSTER"".  Monster becomes her best friend and confidant who stays in her parents book store,The Dream Shop, which also serves as her home.While an outsider at school, Sophie does manage to be frienemies with the most popular girl, Madison, at school because she suffers horrible nightmares and the dream catchers take them away.  When a new boy starts at school, Sophie recognizes that Ethan also has nightmares and slips him a dream catcher.  When her parents go missing, Ethan, Sophie and Monster band together to find them.  Along the way, they find Madison and another young girl are missing as well.  As they discover Mr. Nightmare's horrible secret, they must outwit, outplay and survive to win over this comically horrible guy.The story is filled with a lot of imagination, just enough ""scary"" to keep older readers enthralled but not too scary for even younger middle grade readers.  The humor is very sly and parents are going to love it as much as the kids.  There are several references to classics and pop culture icons that make the reading even more enjoyable.  Overall, this is one that should have everyone dreaming about this book.  Parents:  there are some mildly scary parts but ony for kids with over active imaginations and if you have a child like that, you are so lucky!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3793D2Z2RVQSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544464974#wasThisHelpful","R3793D2Z2RVQSX","A2TBZAC0XYHLIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TBZAC0XYHLIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The facecloth I use was discontinued and were made from a microfiber cotton that was super soft.  I had a hunch that these might be a great replacement for them and they are just perfect.  If you have sensitive skin, then you know anything made for a baby is safer for your face than using something specificially marketed.  I have now washed them several times and they return to that softness with little care and are really durable.  I have sheets made from bamboo and the fibers are actually a lot softer than cotton and wear much better.

"Xen Tan goes on quite easily with a really nice feel.  The day before, I used an exfoliate scrub and then the next morning applied this to my legs to get a little color.  I was worried that the box said ""olive tones"" on it because I am super fair.  I left this on for one hour and was surprised at the natural looking color I acheived.  I think if I would have left it on any longer, it would look a bit fake.  No orangey color either, but a nice warm light walnut color.  I don't wear anything more revealing than shorts and short sleeve tops, so there is no reason to do my whole body. The lotion has a nice scent as well, something I didn't find too chemical. I expected to leave stains everywhere like most tanners, but this didn't rub off on my white sheets either.  I highly recommend this for even fair skinned people and you can build a nice tan over a few weeks with this. I received the application mitt with this to make the process easier.

"OH MY - this feels so good!  I have super sensitive dry skin and a lot of my favorite products have been discontinued, so I am constantly on a search for something that can hydrate my skin without a lot of heaviness and greasy feeling. Since this is a gel, it is light and feels cool going on. The first night I used it, I got a bit carried away and used a bit too much.  My skin looked so much better the next morning and still felt moisturized.  The heater and air conditioner both remove a lot of moisture from the air, so I usually have to use heavier products to retain some moisture, but I found that I could use this even in the morning under my makeup to keep everything hydrated.  So far, no irritation or redness like some other creams, so this is a keeper for sure.

There is no greasy feeling or mess and a little goes a long way on wet skin.

"Rick (aka Riff Rotten) is in the midst of recording a new album with his band and while his bandmate and best friend is planning his wedding, Rick is trying to get over that he has just buried the love of his life.  Even though, it has been years since her passing from cancer, he cant forget about Simone and now he thinks he is having a heart attack.  It turns out that rock stars can get panic attacks and once under control, they are now taking over his life.  Not one to sit by, he decides to take action and finds yoga.We touched on Rick and his war with Adrian in Louder Than Love and Adrians romance with Kat.  Those two are both present with a few other characters from that book. You dont need to read that one first to enjoy this one.  When Ricks panic attacks start to overtake his life and he takes up yoga at his sons insistence, he has a cute meet with Sidra, an instructor.  And the age difference is believable as well as the spark between the two.  Of course, the new couple has issues, but they overcome the obstacles that are mostly themselves.Dear Dog, this sounds like it could be a self-help novel for musicians, but, nope, far from that, it is a romance that will leave you with that good feeling of happily ever after. Topper has quickly become my favorite in the rock star romance department and it is all because she can summon up a rock star on paper that comes across with the true charisma they all have.  That X factor is present in all of her books.  This one is definitely swoon worthy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10X7GFKHTIUO9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R3GARZM#wasThisHelpful","R10X7GFKHTIUO9","A2TBZAC0XYHLIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TBZAC0XYHLIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my first high end camera and what a way to start!  I normally rely on a point and shoot Nikon CoolPix but I have been dying to get into more detailed photogtraphy for a long time to take pictures of my dog for her facebook page.  Don't laugh, she has almost a thousand followers!  My oldest brother (Canon) has been a hobby photographer for decades and my other brother (Nikon) was a professional photographer for bands back in the 70's, so I have lots of resources to help me out with this. The Canon brother was really impressed with this camera.  He does only take landscapes, so he helped me out with taking stills.  Once he explained the different settings to me, I had no problem keeping up with a group of photographers. It was easy to set up, almost just like a point and shoot but has way more range in getting that special shot.  I really wanted to get some action shots of my dog and this was exactly the camera for that!  I can now just take video and get the shot directly from the video.  You can also adjust the light for exposure and get different looks for each with out using a filter.  I would recommend buying additional storage since the higher the setting the more space it uses.

"This is one of the best written biographies I have read in a long time.  It did take me a bit longer to get through this since there was so much information packed into a very small space.  That is one of the thing I loved about it.  Every word had a place, no filler, much like Petty's music - where every note counts.  I also loved that Zanes tried to be objective about his subject when you can tell he is a fan.  Yes, he recounts the bad times but explains what went wrong within the band.  He really dug down and got Petty's side of the story and then got the other band members to give their side. I can't say everything is fair and balanced, but this is pretty close.  You can tell exactly who is in Petty's camp.I had always heard rumors about the Heartbreakers, that they were somewhat reclusive and after reading this it is amazing to find out that the guys in the band are just really shy.  That all makes sense when you understand where they came from and the horrible childhood that Petty had.  I am amazed that he isn't more damaged. If the writing in the book is a bit familiar to Petty fans, it is because Zanes also did the book that accompanied Runnin Down a Dream.Overall, this is a great recap on Tom Petty and the relationship he has with his bandmates, the Heartbreakers. It reads like an honest portrayal and the fact that Zanes had access to Petty and the band makes all the difference in how the story comes off. It is a story about overcoming the odds and making in music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N6K8NEY3RJ34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805099689#wasThisHelpful","R3N6K8NEY3RJ34","A2TBZAC0XYHLIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TBZAC0XYHLIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"MY THOUGHTS2001: A Space Odyssey updated for the future with teens with a touch of Romeo and Juliette mixed with the Walking Dead thrown in for good measure.  You must get your hands on this book as humanly possibly if you are a sci-fi, romance junkie like me.  I read someplace that this will be a movie soon and I cant wait.  The story is told through instant messages, email, technical reports, schematics, and ephemera all creating a mood that lets you be there in the story.  There is never a dull moment with fast paced dialogue mixed in with thrilling action.This is basically a boy (Ezra),  meets girl (Kady), loses girl, almost dies and it is all the fault of a computer much like Hal.  When a multi-univeral corporation finds an illicit mining operation going on in an uncharted planet, they attack and take out most of the people.  There just happens to be 3 other vessels within hailing distance to the planet that picks up most of the survivors.  A war ship that contains the crazy computer, a scientific vessel and shipping craft.  Each has a purpose and a story to tell with the crew members.Ezra and Kady both escape on different ships and after an illness breaks out on the ship, the pair find they must fight for their lives after they have lost everything.

"It was recommended that I get a screen protector for my new iPhone 6.  I really didn't like the glass ones that most of my friends have since two of them had to replace them after a drop.  This one is a flexible film and if you don't get it on right the first time, it is easy to reposition it properly.  My other concern was that it would be hard to use my case with the glass protector.  This film is beveled at the edge so my case fit prefectly around it.  As far as the privacy protection, I didn't really notice anything that blocked a straight on view, but looking sideways at the screen, it was a bit obscured.

"A little goes a long way!  You only need a small amount to condition your hands with this scented cream.  If you use too much, it becomes a bit greasy but even then it soaks in if you have really dry skin like mine.  The scent is strong at first but fades after about 5 minutes.  It is floral and clean smelling.  It also lasts quite awhile, even after washing my hands, I noticed that they reamained soft.  I normally use Aveda hand cream because it stands up and is long lasting.

"This case is just gorgeous!  I have the space gray color and the gold against it looks stunning.  I usually wear a mix of silver and gold jewlery, so this combination goes with anything I wear.  The case itself is very sturdy and goes on easily.  I was in panic mode though since I couldn't get the thing off and wanted to put on a battery case for a trip.  Thanks to the Amazon members here, I got an answer on how to take it off within minutes.  Just start from the bottom wear the power port is with a finger nail and it slides right off.  I didn't think it added that much weight but it is heavier than most cases.  I even dropped it on a tile floor and nothing happened.

"Feeling depressed myself, I always turn to a memoir that will make me feel better about myself.  This one is the perfect book to make you feel that your life is a hundred times better than Korson's, but then in my case, maybe not. Korson starts out depressed and truly despondent over a best friend that has everything you could ever want as a young girl, the Barbie dream house, the Barbie camper and every outfit available.  Korson ends up with the island of misfit toys in her collection.  When her parents divorce, things only get worse and funnier.Raised on Ms. magazine by her now single mother, Korson, until she leaves for Emmerson College, she falls in like and out of convenience, she moves in with her boyfriend.  With one fateful trip to Mexico that involves wisdom teeth, a marriage proposal and a raging fever, Korson tries to end the relationshop with a giant FAIL.  In any other writer's words, this might be a real downer, but not here. I was laughing until I had tears in my eyes.Even when she gets a job at an entertainment agency, she fails upward and realizes that she is truly miserable there.  I think reading between the lines,  I got the feeling that she had brief spouts of happiness here and there.  I really felt a connection to Korson and could relate to several of her stories.  Tragedy plus time equal comedy and in this case, it is very true.

As the story winds back and forth between the accident, the missing girl and the relationships, we find out exactly what makes Nick and Dara tick.  Told in alernating view points between the girls, you can see how their relationship developed and was broken and how they are trying to put everything back together after physical and mental damages.Yes, that twist, I mentioned.  It has nothing to do with the missing girl, although that is resolved.  I think a lot people can easily guess at the twist if you caught the E, Lockhart quote in the book.  I love Lauren's work but this one just didn't catch me at the right time.  I did want to smack that plot twist right off the page and in a way I knew it was coming.

"Robyn Loxley is naturally stealthy and inquisitive, and when she avoids capture by pure luck on the same night her parents disappear, she's left to fend for herself in Nott City. As new governor Ignomus Crown restricts the civil liberties of the citizens of Nott City, Robyn falls in with a bunch of street kids and finds herself fighting against Crown by accident. Her cause starts out small--stealing food that Crown confiscates and returning it to the hungry people--but escalates quickly. As she becomes the most wanted outlaw in all of Nott City and Sherwood County, Robyn uncovers a mystery about a prophecy that is somehow connected to her parents, Crown's hostile takeover, and her own destiny.I enjoyed reading this book so, so much. Robyn is a fantastic character, and Magoon does a really great job of portraying her as the privileged kid from the upper crest who is jolted to reality when she hits the streets and learns about what life is like for the lower classes. Robyn is naive at first, and she grapples with doing what's right, but she doesn't shy away from doing what she needs to survive and help others. While she is certainly a brave and caring person who is motivated to help the less fortunate, Robyn's actions are mainly motivated by the desire to discover the truth about what happened to her parents at the beginning of the story, and solving the mystery her father left behind for her--sometimes at the risk of alienating her new friends.Fans of the Robin Hood legend will really enjoy the little nods to the original tale, but Magoon is so great at world building and creating complicated characters that this novel feels very fresh and original. Middle grade readers who are fans of The False Prince and the numerous fantasy novels based on world myths will love this first book in the Robyn Hoodlum series, but it's no stretch to assume that YA readers will be attracted as well. It hits all of the sweet spots of a good futuristic adventure novel--a controlling government, vivid details that ground readers in the world, a well-developed and fascinating cast of characters, and a highly compelling plot. I loved every page.Basically, the world needs at least five more Robyn Hoodlum books. And you need to get your hands on a copy. That is all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUQ00AXVFDH6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619636344#wasThisHelpful","RUQ00AXVFDH6Q","A3IR2O2V9V2DI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR2O2V9V2DI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When we last left Cate, she was pretty devastated. Maura erased Finn's memory so he has no recollection of Cate, and the death of her godmother still weighs heavily on her conscience. To make matters worse, Cate is exposed as a witch and forced to go into hiding, making it even harder for her to protect Tess and keep Maura from executing a morally questionable plan to take over the Brotherhood. As the tension escalates, Cate begins to wonder if there is any hope of preventing the prophecy from running its course.What I love about this book is that Spotswood explores the nuances of sexism and power through the sisters' different approaches at combatting the Brotherhood, and nothing is black and white in this world. Spotswood reveals the dangers of obtaining power at all costs through Maura's misguided attempts and Cate's struggle to balance the urgency of needing to save innocent people with her own ethics. This makes for some terrific tension and high stakes, and keeps the story moving quickly to a tumultuous ending.Spotswood is magnificent at plot twists and turns that are surprising and inevitable, not contrived. Cate's character development shines through her reactions to these twists, and as secrets come to light and character motivations are revealed, the story takes interesting, heartbreaking turns. Spotswood is not afraid to hurt her characters, and while many readers will likely be screaming ""NOOO!"" at some plot points, they are what make this third installment an emotionally resonant story.The ending is equal parts tragic and hopeful, and wholly deserved. The Sisters' Fate rounds out an unique, exciting, emotionally turbulent, and romantic trilogy that is worth reading and re-reading.ARC provided by publisher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4E3GH5267H0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399257470#wasThisHelpful","R4E3GH5267H0H","A3IR2O2V9V2DI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR2O2V9V2DI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book skips ahead ever so slightly from where Born Wicked ended, but only by a couple of weeks. Cate is living with the consequences of her actions from the previous book, and that means joining the Sisterhood, who, SURPRISE, aren't actually a religious order but a group of secret witches! You'd think that this development would be a happy one, but Cate is miserable. She's lied to Finn, left her sisters, and is now living in bustling New London where the Brotherhood is making life miserable for women. She's also being pulled in two very different directions by the secret witches--one side wants to declare war on the Brotherhood and use mind magic to gain power, the other side is up for taking a more diplomatic approach. Oh, and Maura still hates Cate's guts. Sisters.When new laws put her sisters in danger and bring them into the Sisterhood, Cate is forced to make some tough decisions. She's still against the use of mind magic to gain control of government, but she can't stand by when innocent women are being imprisoned in madhouses and abused. But knowing who to trust, and trying to protect her sisters turns out to be far more complicated than she expected, and now her actions might have even more devastating consequences to her heart and her family.Jessica Spotswood has a special talent for ratcheting up tension and stakes. In Star Cursed, we meet a whole new set of characters to fall in love with and root for, but that also means heightened danger. Now, it's not simply enough for Cate to protect herself and her sisters, but she is spurred into action and must work to free incarcerated girls--not to further a cause, but because it's the right thing to do. Morality certainly plays a large role in this installment, and the question of motivation, fighting for equal rights, and revenge plague Cate, Maura, Tess, and the Sisterhood.Star Cursed isn't without its swoony scenes, even though Cate was forced to give up her opportunity to marry Finn. The two have some serious issues to work out, and their relationship is made even more dangerous now that the truth is out but they've each joined their respective orders. As their relationship heats up, so does the danger.This book also sees characters changing in unexpected ways. Some changes will be delightful, and others not so much. True colors are shown, friends turn into enemies, enemies turn into allies, and Cate must confront the fact that her past actions, while well-intended, perhaps were not always right. This character growth is extremely gratifying, if not painful to watch. Cate can't undo the past, and she's helpless to stop the consequences.If you thought the ending of Born Wicked was cruel, then the ending to this book is downright sadistic. Spotswood doesn't spare her characters, every victory comes with a price, and you will need to have book three on hand right away!Book purchased at my indie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXUAJG4PNSX3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0147509998#wasThisHelpful","RXUAJG4PNSX3X","A3IR2O2V9V2DI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR2O2V9V2DI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Born Wicked by Jessica Spotswood is a book that suffers from not one, but two unfortunate covers and a very vague-sounding summary, so I didn't pick it up earlier because frankly, I like shiny book covers and a sound notion of what I'm getting myself into. But a friend insisted Born Wicked was great, so I started reading and at about page two it clicked that it was alternate history with witches and I was SO on board. And luckily for me, since I was so late to the game, I got to read all three books in a row!Cate Cahill is the oldest of three girls, and a witch. When her mother was alive, being a witch was easier. Cate didn't worry so much about her younger sisters Maura and Tess and the religiously fanatical Brotherhood trying them all for witchcraft. But the girls are growing up and change is inevitable; Cate must declare her intention to marry or enter a convent, and her sisters need a governess--a stranger who might easily discover their secret. Cate is all too happy to suppress her powers if it means keeping her sisters safe, but Maura disagrees. Maura is a little too confident and reckless, and Cate's caution and constant limits causes a rift in the sisters' relationship. And if an old prophecy is to be believed, this rift indicates that the Cahill sisters are capable of either sparking an enlightened era...or regressing society back to the Dark Ages.Let's talk premise. I love, love, love it. Alternate history, witchcraft, and STAKES. So much is at stake in these books--the relationship between the three sisters, their lives, their entire way of living! Spotswood sets this up so, so well. She begins with the sisters' lives in their small town, and slowly expands the story to include other local girls who are oppressed by the Brotherhood, a resistance, family secrets, the effects of the prophecy, and she throws in a surprisingly swoony love interest in the form of gardener Finn Belastra to keep things hot.The world building is skillfully done. The ruling religious order was eery and very realistic. Sexism is maddeningly strong in the Cahill sisters' lives, but the women, witches or not, are certainly not passive. The nuances of how women rebel against this sexism were fascinating, and drew me in completely. I loved the cultural diversity that Spotswood envisions in her alternate world; racial and ethnic diversity is strong, and acknowledged. Other countries are much more progressive than religious New England, and you can sense the desire for this society to grow and evolve even under all of the Brotherhood oppression.This book moves briskly, with a few inevitable (but delightful!) twists that poke fun at traditional Chosen Ones tropes. The sisters disagree and grow alarmingly more estranged, leading them to make life-changing decisions in order to preserve their secrets. The momentum of the plot takes the reader right up to the cliffhanger ending, so be warned--you'll want Star Cursed on hand the moment you finish!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5ZIY3LJZ1T3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142421871#wasThisHelpful","R5ZIY3LJZ1T3C","A3IR2O2V9V2DI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR2O2V9V2DI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seraphina by Rachel Hartman was one of those wonderfully charming, wholly fascinating fantasy novels that caught my eye at work one day and would not leave me alone. This happens occasionally--I see a book in the flesh (in the pages?) and even though I've already talked myself into waiting until it comes out in paperback, or the library gets, or at least waiting until pay day, that's it. It must come home with me. Seraphina was that kind of book.So I've been waiting and waiting and waiting for the follow-up (because the ending was so maddeningly, wonderfully wide open) for almost three years, and finally, it came. Shadow Scale. Finally.Shadow Scale picks up only a few weeks after Seraphina left off. The dragon civil war has left the human populations in the Southlands feeling very uneasy, and Glisselda and Lucian fear that Goredd could suffer heavy collateral damage. They send Seraphina and Abdo south to find the rest of the halflings, using Seraphim's mental connection to locate them. Seraphina quickly discovers that her old enemy Jannoula has terrifying mental powers of her own, and she's using them to force each of the halflings to her will. Seraphina finds herself unable to fight Jannoula on her own, she she must turn to the rebel dragons and her own troubled past to discover the truth about her own nature and how to defeat Jannoula.Shadow Scale does all of the things that a great fantasy sequel should do: expand the world on multiple levels, add depth to the protagonists, and make use of the many interesting, diverse supporting characters. Although the very beginning is a tad slow, as soon as Seraphina and Abdo have set off on their journey, the story moves quickly. Hartman takes readers to all of the three countries she only mentions in the first book--Ninys, Samsam, and Porphyry--and introduces all of the members of Seraphim's mental garden. There are plenty of twists and turns to keep the plot tilting and re-arranging, and the multitude of characters hold their own surprises and secrets.The trajectory of the plot allows Hartman to really dig deep into the geography, history, politics, and theology of the various nations that made up the Southlands. She uses little details to make the cultures and cities come to life, and follows up on informations she first introduced in Seraphina. She layers new information and details about the history of both humans and dragons into the narrative, pointing to a surprising revelation about the history of humankind and the existence of the halflings.There are no easy answers for Seraphina, and she runs up against obstacles at nearly every point in the story. Hartman isn't afraid to hurt her characters, but Seraphina doesn't give up easily. She learns that there are no answers to the challenges she faces, and that unless history is to (disastrously) repeat itself, it's up to her to find new solutions and connections between the human and dragon worlds.Shadow Scale is diverse and compelling, and Hartman's writing is elegant and witty. Seraphina's delightfully charming voice holds steady throughout her trials, although by the end she has changed: she recognizes her own value despite her mistakes and makes great sacrifices for her people.So now my only question is: Will there be a book three? I think yes. I have too many important questions about Seraphina's world for this to be the end, although I'm willing to give her a brief rest before her next adventure. After the events of Shadow Scale, she's earned it.ARC provided by publisher.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32STGY8I9ZAZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375866574#wasThisHelpful","R32STGY8I9ZAZZ","A3IR2O2V9V2DI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR2O2V9V2DI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing that smacks you in the face: This is an all-star cast. Seriously. Stephanie Perkins, Rainbow Rowell, Holly Black, Kelly Link, Jenny Han, Matt de la Pea, David Levithan, Kiersten White, Myra McEntire, Ally Carter, Gayle Forman, Laini Taylor...and yes, I did just try to sing all of those author's names out loud to the tune of The 12 Days of Christmas.It's difficult to talk about anthologies because I think short stories are more subjective to taste than novels are, and with twelve short stories, there are a lot of variables in this book. However, I've read quite a few anthologies this past year, and this one is put together very nicely, with a good balance between contemporary realistic fiction and speculative fiction. Every contributor is a great writer. For the most part, each writer sticks to the same genre as the novels they've published.Let's break it down:The FantasticalKelly Link's ""The Lady and the Fox"" is brilliant. It shines a little brighter than the rest, and it is possibly my favorite short story by her yet. Holly Black made me love her even more with her short story based on Krampus (think demon Santa, only Holly Black style!). Laini Taylor's short story about poverty and ancient magic is a little floaty, a bit meandering, but she can string beautiful words together like no one else.Jenny Han's story about Santa's daughter and the elves was extremely clever and surprisingly heartfelt. Kirsten White's story has just a hint of elusive Christmas magic and sweetness under sharp humor and perfectly deployed sarcasm. And while there isn't any magic in Ally Carter's story, it is a bit fantastical--a girl runs away from her life and discovers family and meaning at someone else's Christmas celebration.The RealisticMatt de la Pea's story about a college freshman spending the holidays alone because he can't afford to go home was a surprising story about trust and relationships. Gayle Forman's story about first impressions, misconceptions, and making the best of a less-than-ideal situation made me laugh and think. And Stephanie Perkins's story about celebrating Christmas after your life has been upended was simultaneously heartbreaking and re-affirming.David Levithan writes about Christmas traditions and the lengths we go to to help others believe in magic. Myra McEntire's centers around the grand tradition of Nativity plays and how they can go wrong, yet turn out right. And Rainbow Rowell's absurdly adorable story about a friendship told through a series of New Year's Eves parties was both swoony and smart.That's a lot to take in, but there is so much about this anthology that will appeal to readers. It's a nuanced look at the holiday season, with all of its highs and lows and the expectations people hold for that particular time of the year. It was such fun to read a story every night in December, and it's a book that I'm definitely going to give as a gift for next Christmas. If you pick it up, just know that you might have 12 new favorite authors by the time you finish!Plus, how adorable is that cover? I want to hang it on my wall.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DVFSOOFQNLW6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250059305#wasThisHelpful","R3DVFSOOFQNLW6","A3IR2O2V9V2DI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR2O2V9V2DI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"you're looking for a book that's all about the angst and excitement of love this weekend, consider To All the Boys I've Loved Before by Jenny Han. I first fell in love with Jenny Han's writing when I read The Summer I Turned Pretty (also a good pick for some Valentine's Day reading). Han has a graceful writing style that encapsulates the emotions of love and heartbreak.To All the Boys I've Loved Before may sound like a mouthful at first, but the title is a great hook for this story. Lara Jean loves deeply, but she's never been quite brave enough to reveal her feelings for any of the boys she's loved. Instead, she devotes herself to being a good sister and substitute mother. She bottles up her feelings and writes a letter to each of her crushes, seals it, and hides it away, convincing herself that she is then ""over"" her feelings. Lara Jean's carefully ordered life begins to fall apart when those letters are sent without her knowledge, and suddenly she finds herself pretending to date Peter, a guy she no longer likes, as a decoy against the guy she really does like--Josh. Her older sister's ex-boyfriend.Han navigates these twisty plot developments with soft humor and lots of yearning. Lara Jean struggles to mold an identity for herself now that she's no longer in the shadow of her older sister, one that is independent of the caretaker role she has always assumed, but not completely separate. Her faux-relationship with Peter has all of the trappings of clichd teenage drama, but Lara Jean doesn't succumb to the pitfalls. She's her own person, she asserts her will, and she doesn't do what everyone expects of her if she doesn't want to. Her clashes with Peter have an undercurrent of romantic tension that Lara Jean is blind to as first, and even though their relationship is unconventional, they do become genuine friends. This new level of emotional intimacy in their friendship is what drives the story to the climax, where everything that can go wrong does, the truth comes out, feelings are hurt, and intentions are misconstrued. Nothing is tidy in this book, but Han has done an excellent job at portraying convincing teenage relationships, with some swoony moments and painful growth.Some aspects of the plot seem a bit too contrived to be totally believable, but these parts are easy enough to ignore. This is a fast, fun read, and there is a sequel, P.S. I Still Love You, coming out later this year!Cover Comments: I love the blend of Sharpie title and soft pinks and whites in the background.

"The 5th Wave was not a book I planned on reading, so naturally I was not prepared for the feelings of shock, angst, and utter panic when I finished it and didn't have The Infinite Sea ready to rock. After much maneuvering and a rather embarrassing day spent at work stalking our shipments every two seconds, I got the book and retreated home to begin, slightly dismayed at the slender package in my hands. It wasn't just a tiny bit thinner. It was like 100+ pages thinner!The Infinite Sea is shorter, it's true, but it contains the characters you love and more stand-out writing. Cassie, Sam, Ben, Ringer, survived the destruction of the previous book's ending and are holed up in an old motel, trying to figure out what to do next. They decide their best chance for survival is to split up and try to find a new place to hide out (yeah, when has that ever worked for anyone ever?), but the landscape is riddled with enemies looking to hunt them down, and there's no way to tell whose side the strangers are on.What worked shockingly well in The 5th Wave--the shifting narrative--doesn't quite cut it for me in The Infinite Sea. I need you all to understand that I feel like a terrible person for saying this. The writing, on the line level, is excellent. The emotions are vivid and real. The danger and tension are palpable. But there is not as much action as I would have liked, and I don't think that's necessarily the story's fault, but the fault of the structure.To be fair to Yancey, he's got a lot of characters to juggle, one intriguing mystery to uphold (we still don't know what the aliens want with Earth!), and a lot wild cards in this novel. The characters do whatever the hell they want and don't bend to any prescribed plot, which is awesome, but that does provide some challenges for the telling of the story. Ringer's chapters specifically are very engaging, and I love getting her perspective, but with Ringer's perspective Yancey breaks this unity of time that he brilliantly maintained in the first book, and that disappointed me somewhat. Yeah, yeah, I know I can't have everything. Each part of the novel had its own story arc, but the (only) problem with The Infinite Sea is that all of the parts didn't work together to tell a larger story arc, and I'm afraid that means that this felt like the dreaded second book--a bridge between book one and book three.So I'm left feeling conflicted because this book was well-written and interesting and I love the characters, but it was also jumpy and compressed and did not have as much action. Which, to be fair, might be due to the fact that everyone is still half-dead from surviving the last book.I'm still pre-ordering the third book and I plan on loving it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HOBNWWOKI6LJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399162429#wasThisHelpful","R1HOBNWWOKI6LJ","A3IR2O2V9V2DI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR2O2V9V2DI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 5th Wave is about an alien invasion. Is it an invasion, or just an attack? Do we really know? What we do know is this: The aliens attack in waves. The first wave throws humanity into chaos by cutting all electricity. The second wave decimates all coastal cities with major typhoons. The third wave is an unknown epidemic that kills off most of the survivors. The fourth wave--perhaps the most frightening of all--is the revelation that the aliens are using humanity to pick each other off, one by one. The fifth wave is yet to come.The books opens with Cassie, a teenage girl whose parents are dead. She's been separated from her little brother, but she's determined to find him. She feels like the last human alive as she travels across  the abandoned countryside, tracking her brother, unable to trust anyone, bracing herself for the 5th wave. Her new world has completely challenged everything she thought she knew--she can't relate to the person she was before, and she's not really sure of anything now, only that she must find her brother. She encounters another boy, Evan, who is just as alone as she is. She wants to trust him, but what will she be giving up if she does?Yancey's novel is non-linear, and the sections jump from character to character, weaving back and forth through time. This definitely helps build tension from scene to scene, and adds to the mystery of what is really going on, who the aliens really are, who can be trusted, and the most pervasive question of all--what do they want?What impressed me most about this novel is Yancey's eloquent language and sensitivity to the complex emotions that each character experiences. The language is poetic and brutal, and Cassie is forced to make decisions that have serious emotional implications throughout the book. She must look inside herself, and ask herself tough questions about why she keeps moving forward, what she values, and what she wants in order to make sense of her new world. Each character faces his or her own crises and must wrestle with themselves to keep moving forward. There are surprising connections and yawning mysteries to be faced. Chances must be taken, faith is tested.Yancey gives readers answers that breed more questions, and keep the pages of this story turning fast. While the final action scene does push the boundaries of believability, every choice, consequence, victory, and failure in this novel feels earned. It's not often I read a fascinating high-concept story that is as action-packed as it is emotionally engaging. I'm so, so glad I picked up The 5th Wave and I urge you to do the same!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DUU6YXMW1YY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142425834#wasThisHelpful","R2DUU6YXMW1YY0","A3IR2O2V9V2DI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR2O2V9V2DI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The monster, however, has plans for Conor: hell tell him three stories, and when hes done, Conor will tell the monster about his nightmares.Early on in the book, its easy to see where this story is headedConors mother is dying, and it is obvious to the reader that the monster is supposed to help Conor confront the inevitable.

"When seventeen-year-old Graham mistypes an email address, he accidentally finds himself corresponding with Ellie, a girl from Maine with big dreams for the future and a scandalous past. Ellie has no idea that Graham is actually a movie star, or that his latest project is about to be filmed in her hometownall so Graham can finally meet her, the first girl who sees him for who he really is. But Graham has no idea just how strong the pull of Ellies past is, and how important it is to keep it buriedSmiths novel has the potential to be cheesy and clichd, but the authenticity of the connection that Graham and Ellie feel keeps the story somewhat grounded. Smiths characters also are surprising and funny, resisting the Hollywood-meets-real-world tropes that are often overdone. As Smith slowly delves deeper into Graham and Ellies pasts and their own story together, the complicated feelings that each character has towards each other and their parents lead the plot in unexpectedly interesting and emotionally charged directions. While not as memorable or as serendipitous as The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight, This is What Happy Looks Like is a romantic book that satisfies.Cover Comments: I like the black and white photograph with the colorful design on top. Very whimsical and pretty, and it matches the story well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AG5KLXCEJS2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316212822#wasThisHelpful","R1AG5KLXCEJS2K","A3IR2O2V9V2DI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR2O2V9V2DI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When eighteen-year-old Judith reappears after having gone missing two years earlier, her entire village is suspicious of her and her inability to speak. Judith does her best to remain inconspicuous, holding all of the explosive secrets she keeps deep inside of her and watching her childhood love, Lucas, from a distance. When enemies threaten the safety of her town and Lucas, Judith is forced to action, sending her on a path to reveal the truth shes concealed for over two years.All the Truth Thats In Me is a fascinating, riveting historical novel. The story is told in short, affecting chapters and beautifully written; the tension and suspense build quickly and elegantly, propelling readers through the novel at a breakneck pace. Judiths narration is distinct and smart, and her struggle to learn to communicate once more with her family and the people in her town, despite physical and emotional barriers, is emotional and more dangerous than she can imagine. Patient, curious readers will be fascinated by this intense book as the plotand Judiths secretsare slowly peeled back to reveal a terrible crime and one towns fear and prejudice.Cover Comments: I like the title treatment and how dramatic this book looks, but the girl on the cover has way too much makeup on to be a historical fiction character. In fact, it seems like the book's entire marketing plan revolves around making this novel NOT appear to be a historical fiction book. I find this weird, and slightly misleading, especially since I would have read this book much sooner if I had known it was historical fiction--but that's just me!

"Amelia is fifteen. She just got her braces off and shes started her first job at a grocery store. She is in love with her co-worker Chris. Chris is smart, funny, confidentand twenty-one. Hes in his final year at university and there is no way, not a chance, that hed be interested in Amelia. But Amelia cant help but find herself drawn to him, and as their conversation get increasingly intense and personal, she cant help but wonder if a relationship with him just might workLove and Other Perishable Items is a smart, painfully awkward, and realistic novel is told in both Amelias and Chriss voices over the course of an emotionally tumultuous year. Buzos coming of age story takes most of its action from the grocery store setting in which both protagonists work, and the many zany and entertaining characters who work there. The plot isnt particularly action-driven, but the characters thoughts and motivations are smart and insightful, and both Amelia and Chris ask the reader to ponder questions about love, modern family dynamics, education, and the consequences of feminist movements. With many quiet revelations and comically awkward scenes, Amelia and Chris learn to work through their personal issues, their feelings for each other, and how to embrace an uncertain future. Love and Other Perishable Items is an intelligent, satisfying book, and readers will be reluctant to leave Buzos carefully constructed world.Cover Comments: I really appreciate the simplicity of this cover, and I think it fits well with the story.

"Sophronia never thought shed enjoy finishing school, but Mademoiselle Geraldines school is unlike any other. After a rather interesting start and making many allies (and a few enemies), Sophronia and the first form class prepare for their first examinations. When Sophronia is suddenly ostracized by her peers after receiving the best marks in her class, she suspects a conspiracy that may run deeper than schoolgirl whims.Carrigers use of humor, oftentimes constructed by the ridiculous nature of Victorian etiquette, is the main device by which she builds her steampunk world and fleshes it out so wonderfully. The book includes more inventions, new circles of society, and poses the question of who the girls are really working for. With Sophronia on the case, questions usually lead to more questions, but the journey is delightful and full of adventure and thrills. Carriger maintains a nice balance between the character relationships and the greater conflict of the story, making for a nicely complicated and emotionally satisfying book.Cover Comments: I love the cover, even though the girl looks a lot older than Sophronia, who is supposed to be 14-15. Nonetheless, it captures the fantastic mesh of Victorian setting with danger and airships (look closely at the wallpaper!).

"Troy Billings is over three hundred pounds and his weight dominates everything that he does and thinks about. When skinny Curt McCrae thwarts Troy's suicide attempt, he enlists Troy to be a drummer in his band. Troy doesn't know the first thing about the drums or music, but he lets Curt pull him along because he feels like someone cares about him for the first time in his life.Fat Kid Rules the World is gritty and painfully candid. Going gets close to Troy's insecurities as he struggles to keep up with Curt's manic ideas, and she uses Curt's struggles with prescription drug use to propel Troy to find his self-confidence and value for life. While the relationship between Troy and Curt is well-written, the secondary characters of this novel, particularly Troy's father and brother, tend to come across as caricatures rather than characters. Nevertheless, the story is quick-witted, sometimes darkly humorous, sometimes uncomfortable, but ultimately triumphant.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UIAS8LVJZCSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142402087#wasThisHelpful","R1UIAS8LVJZCSF","A3IR2O2V9V2DI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR2O2V9V2DI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sutter isnt interested in plans for the future; he lives for the constant pursuit of the spectacular now. He spends most of his last days of high school drunk and looking for a good time when he meets Aimee, a shy girl without much self-confidence, and decides to help her come out of her shell. Hes not looking for a girlfriend, but somehow thats what he gets in Aimee. But as graduation draws closer, Sutter cant help but wonder who is helping whom, and whether or not the spectacular now will be enough for their relationship.The Spectacular Now is an interesting study of Sutters character and his inner thoughts, beliefs, and motivations. Tharp mostly explores Sutters character and what makes him act and react, but outside of Sutter, the book is light on plot. Aimees blindness and naivet make her hard to like as a character independent of Sutter, and Sutter is even more unlikable when it becomes apparent that he is taking advantage of Aimees adoration. Tharps writing is honed, sardonic, and interesting, but the conclusion of the story leaves the reader wondering if Sutter ever experienced any character growth, if he even believes in all of the encouragement he offers Aimee, or if Sutters purpose is just in breaking Aimees heart.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E7W6DEBSURCT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385754302#wasThisHelpful","R1E7W6DEBSURCT","A3IR2O2V9V2DI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR2O2V9V2DI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As the days pass and Sydney's pregnancy progresses, she thinks back on her choices and is forced to come to a decision about her future.This introspective novel explores Sydney's life and her relationships, with her parents, her best friend, her romantic encounters, and her own demons. Gramont focuses on Sydney's slow personal growth, and the unexplainable yet magnetic dynamics between her protagonist and the supporting characters. It's in Sydney's interactions and unexpected strong connections to the most unlikely people in her group that force her to own up to her mistakes and take responsibility for her actions. Every Little Thing in the World is a novel about possibilities, connections, and the power of redemption.Cover Comments: I like the bright colors of this cover, and the look on the girl's face--full of bliss.

"Gerald figures he has two options for his future: prison or death. He has so much anger building inside of him, and everyone seems oblivious to all of the injustice that has been making him angry since he was just five years old. His anger is always there, and he can't seem to control it until he meets a girl. She's not perfect, and she doesn't make the anger go away, but together they dare to demand something from the world in return, and Gerald sees a third option--a tentative future of possibilities.Reality Boy is easily King's most heart-breaking and forceful book yet. From the gut-wrenching beginning to the heartbreaking flashbacks of a childhood invaded by TV cameras and millions of viewers, Gerald's story is an intense ride. King deftly demonstrates the reality TV is anything but real, and that it doesn't matter if your family and environment expects you to fail, because you are the only one who has control over your own life and choices, and you can demand better for yourself. The characters in Reality Boy are so tangible; Gerald's sister is truly terrifying, the ketchup lady shockingly sincere and tender, and the circus members profanely hilarious. This isn't a book about finding love and finding your life through a significant other, but rather experiencing romance and in that finding the courage to demand a life for yourself and stand up to others. King will punch you in the gut and demand a visceral reaction. You won't be able to look away. Reality Boy is worth every word.Cover Comments: I really like this cover. The cover model looks a lot like how I imagined Gerald, and I really like the effect of the colors across the cover.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YUKXM6SOI30O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316222704#wasThisHelpful","R1YUKXM6SOI30O","A3IR2O2V9V2DI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR2O2V9V2DI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Blaze, a Marvel comic-loving teen and aspiring artist, is determined to get Mark the Soccer God to finally notice her as girlfriend material, and not just the fill-in soccer mom to her younger brother and his rowdy friends. And when Mark finally takes notice, Blaze is thrilled...except Mark isn't the guy she thought he was. In fact, he turns out to be quite the shark. And there is nothing quite as fearsome as the revenge of the Blazing Goddess.Blaze, Or Love in the Time of Supervillains is full of snark, good humor, and plenty of painfully awkward moments as Blaze fumbles her way through her first relationship and learns a few things about herself along the way. Superhero metaphors and allusions abound in this quirky story, and Blaze's voice is very strong and distinct. Her endless optimism balanced with a sarcastic tone make her a funny, likable narrator who learns to deal with disappointments in life with grace, flair, and plenty of nerdy humor. Crompton's debut novel is intelligent, unexpectedly sweet, and full of attitude.Cover Comments: If you don't pick up the novel for the synopsis or title, you'll definitely pick it up for the fantastic cover!

"Serena dreamed of two things: leaving her small Florida town and becoming a travel writer. Her plans were derailed when Sawyer Legrande left her, sixteen years old and pregnant. Now eighteen and working at her family's restaurant, Serena's life is changed once more when Sawyer comes back to town and wants to be a part of their daughter's life, and Serena's--if she can let him in.How to Love is a vivid and smart book full of love, heartache, hope, and regret. The novel is written in alternating chapters and tenses, dividing the narrative by ""Before"" Sawyer leaves town and ""After"" he returns. The two storylines are independently developed but complement each other nicely to show Serena's growth and character development as a whole. Cotugno develops the tensions between Serena and her family very well, motivating change in everyone's actions by asking heavy questions about life, following your dreams, and second chances. The characterizations are precisely written, and the emotional journeys memorable in this stand-out first novel.Cover Comments: I really like the simplicity of this novel.

"The Iceres Cooking Thermometer Is a quick, accurate and easy to read indoor/outdoor thermometer that is perfect for my cooking needs. The overall length is 9 inches, with the stainless steel probe measuring 5 3/4 inches. I really like the long thin probe. It enables me to get accurate fast readings in seconds even on thick pieces of meat. The length of the probe helps protect my hand from the heat of the grill and the thin design doesn't leave a big tell tale probe mark when removed. This thermometer is instant read with an easy to read digital LED display.  The instant read feature matters when you are trying to get the perfect internal temperature as every minute matters.  I like that I don't have to guess or cut into the meat to get it perfectly cooked.  Another feature thisthermometer has is an automatic shut off.  I usually forget to turn thermometers off.  It is sure not fun to think my thermometer is ready to use and find I need to change out batteries so an auto shutdown is a must have feature when I select a thermometer.The Iceres thermometer comes in a clear plastic storage tube that has a carry strap. The thin design and the storage tube makes it easy to store in a drawer.  The thermometer also comes with the battery in place. It is easily accessible and uses a LR44.  I find cleanup is easy, I just wipe the probe off.  I am so glad I reviewed this product.  I am looking forward to using this during the holidays when baking breads, making candy and baking a turkey.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. My opinion of this product is 100% my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6TX4MF5ZZXJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0122UAYR4#wasThisHelpful","R6TX4MF5ZZXJI","A1D6XGKX9U3B97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D6XGKX9U3B97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finding a deep wrinkle product that is a moisturizer, can be used on both my eyes and face, keeps my skin hydrated, and supports collagen production has made a big difference in my skin texture and appearance. I really like how my face feels more hydrated, smoother and my skin looks healthier.  There is so much to like about this product. It is made in the USA in a state of the art FDA registered facility, safe for all skin types, cruelty free, and a Vegan formula.  Directions are to apply twice a day for at least 28 days to see significant results. Avoid storing at high temperatures for better shelf life.The net weight of the  Illuminea deep wrinkle facial cream is 31 ml. The cream is dispensed using a pump, spreads easily on my face and I only need to use a small amount (about 1 dime sized pump) so this bottle should last me for awhile.  There is no noticeable scent, no greasy feeling and it absorbs into my skin quickly. I love how my makeup glides on over this product and my skin still feels light.  I like that this comes with a guarantee you'll get results or your money back. I am excited about this wrinkle cream as I am starting to see results even though I haven't used this product for 28 days.  In the couple weeks using this twice a day, I notice my fine winkle lines around my eyes are improving and the skin under my eyes is less baggy.  I will continue to use this as I love the results I am seeing so far and I have deeper wrinkles that I know will take longer to improve.  I use this in the morning and night on my clean face after washing.  It is an easy one step (only one product to apply, not a different one for my eyes) that I highly recommend.I am so glad I was given the opportunity to try this product in exchange for an honest review.

"I am very impressed with the design, quality sound, and comfort of the Soniq USA SE500 Pulse Earbuds.  First thing I noticed when I opened the box was the cool sleek look of the cord and the carry case. The cord Is a braided nylon fabric wrapped cord (not plastic) that is generous in length, water resistant and tends to be tangle free.  This is so much better than my earphones that came with my iPhone 6 that tangle easily  and need to carefully be wrapped to get back into their plastic carry case. With the zippered round black Soniq Pulse Earbuds case there is no need to wrap the cord.  The earphones are comfortable, they have a memory foam ear cushion that seals out most noise and mold to your ear.  There are even additional memory foam ear cushions to select from for a proper fit.  The Pulse Earbuds provide a clear crisp sound and the quality of music is top notch and they eliminate most background noise.

"As a homeowner I want burglars not to be able to tell if we are away and that my home is an easy target.  I always have a neighbor watch my house and take extra steps to deter a would be burglar. If my home looks occupied when I am gone most likely burglars will pass it by.  I usually do this by using automatic timers for my lights and make it look like someone is in the home.  Recently a neighbor had some items taken from their car parked outside in their driveway so when I saw the opportunity to review The Fake TV Simulator I was pleased to give it a try.  To be truthful, I was very skeptical that this would be so realistic. I now realize how easy and cost effective it is to give the appearance of a television being played using a small device (about 2 1/2 by 3 inches) instead of playing my real television. The Fake TV Simulator uses LED lights that consume a low amount of electrical energy (only 3 watts of power).  The Fake TV Simulator is very convincing as the lights change color, fade, and replicate screen motion of a real television.  I like that this is so simple to use, nothing to program on a computer.  I just plug it in and choose a setting (press once for always on, press again to come on at dusk till dawn or press again for it to come on at dusk and stay on for 4 hours, press again and you are setting it to come on at dusk and stay on for 7 hours).  The unit has a light sensor that turns the TV Simulator on at dusk so it automatically changes to come on at the correct time. The product description states the lights of the simulator compare to a 40 inch screen and I believe that would be a good comparison. This comes with a free flexible tripod stand that can be used to position the simulator. There is also a bonus gift of a free phone holder that would enable me to also use my iPhone on the tripod.The product owner's description clearly states that this is being offered at a huge discount due to an Australian plug being provided by mistake.  To remedy this issue I used a micro USB cord to plug my unit in. I am still giving this 5 stars for the following reasons; I really like this product, I feel that this is being offered at a great price considering a tripod and phone holder are included, and most people likely have an extra USB cord they can use.I am so glad I was given the opportunity to try this product in exchange for an honest review.

"I followed the directions to hand wash the belt in soapy water, rinse and allow to air dry before use. Once it was dry I fitted the belt directly on my skin having the Velcro facing towards me. I adhered the lined up Velcro edges making sure the fit was snug and comfortable. I then covered the belt with my clothing.  The first thing I noticed was how the ""Just Fitter"" Premium Waist Trimmer supported my lower back and abdominal muscles. I felt my posture was improved. I was excited because I realized that I would be able to wear this comfortably.  Then I noticed the warmth that the belt was creating. It felt similar to using a heating pad. The heat increased as I became more active.  Since wearing the waist trimmer I have seen an improvement in my stomach area and I plan on continuing incorporating this into my fitness plan.The black waist trimmer belt will fit up to a 44 inch waist and is 9 inches wide and weighs 9.3 ounces. It is made out of a heat generating material that helps burn fat faster. It comes with a 90 day guarantee that If you don't notice an OBVIOUS improvement in your appearance, they will give you your money back - no questions asked.  I find that this is not only helping shrink my waist size but my lower back strength seems to be improving.

"To me it is all about how a moisturizer feels, smells, its ingredients and where it is manufactured. I know I won't use a moisturizer that makes my skin feel uncomfortable or if it has an offensive or odd odor.  I want a product that is paraben and sulfate free and made in the USA and this product is.  I am so excited that I found Peels and Petals Anti-Aging Moisturizer as it is formulated for all skin types, makes my skin feel great and I love the peppermint smell. The pump bottle is 1 ounce in size and the suggested use is to cleanse face then apply daily to face and neck or body.  I like to apply this before I go to bed as it makes my skin feel so soft and the peppermint smell is a clean refreshing scent. This product contains Matrixyl, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Witch Hazel, Shea Butter, Green Tea Extract and Peppermint Oil.  I have been using this for about a week and a half and I feel my skin looks firmer and more hydrated. I find the product is non greasy, spreads easily and I only need to use a small amount to cover my face and neck.

"I have wondered if this type of device works and finally gave it a try. We have French doors that open from our basement that don't let the cold in but somehow bugs seems to get in.

I like that this is completely chemical free, no maintenance required (just plug it in, no batteries needed), and is safe for cats and dogs. This is so easy to use, just plug the device to a power socket that is 14 inches above the floor, select a frequency (H for mosquitoes, fleas, ants and roaches or L for rodents). There is a picture of an insect and a rodent by the switch so it is easy to remember the correct setting. Just leave it plugged in for 2 to 3 weeks time to start seeing a big difference.  The way this works is the ultrasonic wave make rodents, spiders and insects uncomfortable nesting, living and mating inside your house. One device will work in an area of 300 square feet, install close to the problem for best results. Allow 4 - 6 weeks for full effect. I really think this is working and I have not heard any bothersome sounds from the device. I will continue to use this and intend to try it out in our garage to see if I get the same great results.I had the opportunity to review 2 in 1 Professional Pest Repeller in exchange for an honest review. I was pleased to do so.  I was not compensated in any other manner and my review is my honest opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M7TAHK1IG6Q4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R5OWJB2#wasThisHelpful","R1M7TAHK1IG6Q4","A1D6XGKX9U3B97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D6XGKX9U3B97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 100% Natural product made from the Loofah (tropical) plant is set in a soft microfiber/terry cloth with an open section for your shower gel or soap. This is a rough sponge that is made from the dried fruit of the loofah and is excellent for exfoliating and can be used like a body brush. I really like how this feels on my back and bottoms of my feet. I like to use self tanning products and the tanning product always states to exfoliate before you use the product. I always have a hard time reaching the center of my back. Problem solved. This is designed with 2 rope handles so you can easily scrub your own back. It is 28 1/2 inches long and 4 inches wide. One side is completely microfiber/terry cloth the other has a 13 inch insert of loofah (which is where the insert is for your soap or shower gel). This also comes with a loofah (glove) mitt that I really like to use on my knees and elbows.  When finished it is important to thoroughly rinse loofah after each use. Use hot water and rinse until all the soap is gone. If you leave soap in the loofah it might start to smell. It is important too to completely dry the loofah. Drying it out will help prevent bacteria from growing inside the loofah. I put my loofah back scrubber and mitt  in a mesh laundry bag and wash them in a my hot wash cycle with my towels.  If you haven't used loofah before you will most likely think it feels too coarse when you first feel it. At least that is what I thought but after trying it I understood why so many people love it.I had the opportunity to review this in exchange for an honest review.

"The fit of googles is important in competitive swimming as well as recreational swimming. If a pair of googles isn't comfortable, able to keep water out of your eyes and allow you to see clearly they are not going to be worn. They will be cast aside and there will be the expense of purchasing a quality pair of googles. I fall in the category of wearing googles for recreational swimming to keep the chlorine out of my eyes.  Aqtivaqua's swim googles are top notch, they provide clear, panoramic vision, they easily adjust so they fit comfortably.  The frame molds comfortably to my face as it is made of flexible silicone. The curved lens allows me to have clear front and side vision. The strap is split in the back which helps keep the googles in place and the strap correctly positioned on my head. Aqtivaqua's swim google have all the features I look for in googles. They are anti-fog, shatterproof, scratch resistant, UV protected with undistorted vision, silicone seal, comfortable nose coverage, easy adjustable strap, and a hard storage case.

"Every diaper bag should have one of these handy reusable portable bottle warmers. It doesn't use batteries or need to be plugged in, you simply flex the stainless steel disc to initiate the activation. It is best to wrap your baby bottle before activating the click button on the warmer. It clearly states in the product description that the purpose of this product is to keep your pre-heated milk warm. It will not warm your milk up from cold. It will keep your preheated bottle warm for up to one hour. The solution is non-toxic FDA approved and is reusable. As it cools down completely it will become crystallized and a solid pack. My product did not come with directions but I had used another product that uses this technology as heat packs for muscle relief so I am familiar with how to reset the pack.  There was an email sent to me on how to use the pack but since I've used this technology before this is what I do. Boil water in a pot, (Do not put the pack in a microwave, must be in boiling water to reheat.) I wrap a cloth around my pack to protect it from the bottom of the pot. Place the wrapped bottle heater pack inside the pot. Keep in boiling water (approximately 10 minutes) until all the crystals are dissolved and only a clear liquid remains. I use tongs to remove pack from boiling water.  (Make sure there are no crystals remaining.). Place the heat pack on a cloth to cool down. When the pack cools down, it's ready to use again. If crystals begin to form while pad is cooling, it should be boiled again until all crystals disappear.  To reuse just flex the metal disc. If it doesn't start to heat up the heat pack may still be too hot after boiling. Allow more time to cool. If your heat pack is completely cooled just try additional flexing to the stainless steel disc. This would make a thoughtful gift to new parents, babysitters and grandparent. I highly recommend this product. I had the opportunity to review this in exchange for an honest review. I was pleased to do so.

"Travelers need to lock their luggage to keep their valuables safe and if you are traveling and your luggage will be checked by a TSA agent it should be locked using a TSA lock.  This is the reason why, if a TSA agent needed to open a locked luggage the agent would be able to do so without having to cut the lock off of the luggage. With the Acrodo TSA Lock they not only can unlock your lock, the agent is sure to lock the lock after their inspection or they are unable to remove their key from your lock.  How cool is that!  There is even a red indicator that shows the luggage was checked. Other reasons I like this lock are; no keys to worry about losing, it is well constructed with easy to read numbers, black in color, small in size (2 x 2 x 1 inch) weighing 2.4 ounces. I am impressed with how easy this lock is to set. There are easy to follow written direction along with a website to access a video showing how to set your personally selected three digit number.  I like that both a video and written directions are provided. The written directions can be kept in case you decide to change the code at a later time.  The solid steel shackle on this lock provides much better security than the flexible shackle I currently use.  This solid steel shackle would be much harder to cut.  Remember to make sure to register your lock so it is covered under a LIFETIME GUARANTEE & WARRANTY (full satisfaction or your money back).  I highly recommend this product.

"I was very interested when I heard about the combination of prebiotic and probiotics in one pill.  Making sure I maintain good colon health is my goal since colon cancer is part of my family medical history.  So when I had the opportunity to review Steele Spirit Ultra-Biotics in exchange for an honest review I was pleased to do so.  I was not compensated in any other manner and my review is an accurate depiction of testing this product.  Directions are to take 2 capsules once a day preferably with food so this bottle would be a one month supply. These are delayed released capsules that are easy to swallow with no aftertaste and they do not require refrigeration.  It is important to me that they are made in the USA in a FDA registered and inspected facility. They are NSF (National Science Foundation) Certified/ GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) Registered, with a 100% money back guarantee.  Some of the benefits listed for Ultra-Biotics are they support colon health, strengthens and support your digestive and immune systems, increases nutrient absorption and vitamin production, help improve mood and energy levels, and will help you lose or maintain a healthy weight.  I have been taking 2 of these pills in the morning with breakfast for about two week and I plan on continuing taking them on a regular basis.  I believe in taking care of myself and truthfully have no way to know what is happening inside my body but my doctor has recommended probiotics and this combination has all sorts of benefits. I can't think of any reason not to take these as they do not upset my stomach and I feel great.I received this product at a discount price for my review.

"I like aerated frothy milk on my drinks but I do not own a milk steamer. I have found by using a milk frother I can create a foamy milk topping in a few quick steps.  It's pretty simple, fun and easy to do using the Bru Joy Milk Frother. I like the Bru Joy unit because it is stainless steel, well made with a classy, trendy look, it fits comfortably in my hand and I am able to control the speed. The unit requires 2 AA batteries which are not included.  To operate the frother there is an easy to operate switch that moves forward using your thumb until it clicks at low speed. Moving the switch forward after the click will increase the speed of the frother head. Turn it off by using your thumb to pull the switch back until it clicks off.This is how I make aerated frothy milk.1) Heat milk in a thick ceramic cup in a microwave oven, filling the cup about 1/3 full (add a little sugar, syrup or vanilla to the milk if you like).  Make sure not boil the milk.2) Remove cup of heated milk from the microwave and insert the frother all the way into the cup before you turn it on.3) Turn on the frother making sure to keep the tip submerged increasing the speed and varying the depth until the milk is foamy expanding approximately 50%.4) Turn off the milk frother while it is still immerse in the milk.The creamy, decadent foam is ready to enjoy on top of a drink.  Sometimes I sprinkle the froth with cinnamon, salted caramel bits or a swirl of caramel or chocolate syrup.  With supervision this is fun to make with children. They have so much fun using the milk frother to make their hot chocolate drinks with special toppings.I also use the milk frother to scramble eggs. I add a small amount of water (about 1 tablespoon water for 2 extra large eggs). My eggs are light and fluffy much better than when I whisk by hand.The enclosed cleaning directions for the milk frother are to wash only the frother head in warm soapy water and rinse thoroughly. Clean the stainless steel handle by wiping with a clean cloth. Make sure not immerse the motor unit.  However, if I have just used it in milk I usually clean the frother head under running water as soon as I am finished using it. This makes cleanup easy. I highly recommend this product. It is fun to create a treat for myself or company. I think this would make an awesome gift.  I received this product at a discount price for my review.

"I personally find raspberry ketone supplements work for me so when I had the opportunity to try Raspberry Ketone Pro (a pure blend of Raspberry Ketones with Acai Berry, African Mango Seed and Green Tea Extract) and give my honest review I was pleased to do so.  I use this as an appetite suppressant for weight loss along with eating a healthy diet, watching my calorie intake, drinking plenty of water and exercising. I find myself feeling less hungry and I have less cravings for sweet snacks which helps me stick to my diet. It is easy for me to take this supplement as the pills are not gigantic, there is no weird aftertaste and it does not upset my stomach.Suggested use: As a dietary supplement, adults, take two (2) capsules daily 20-30 minutes before a meal. There are 60 pills in the bottle so this would be a one month supply. I usually take one (1) capsule 30 minutes before lunch and one (1) capsule before dinner. I have not experienced any jittery feeling when taking this but I do try to not let my stomach get too empty when taking any diet supplements.  I am pleased to see that I am starting to see some weight loss and I feel confident that I will be able to achieve my weight goal.  I received this product at a discount price for my review.

"I was offered this product at a promotional rate for my review.  Opinions are my own and this is my honest review.  The Sarma s360 Armor Pack for the iPhone 6 protects my iPhone 6 and allows my phone to be sleek and totally functional. The ballistic 9H front glass protector is nearly invisible and does not interfere with the functionality of my iPhone 6.  I honestly wouldn't know it was there as my screen responds to touch and swipe movement the same as before I applied the screen protector. Applying is easy and bubble free. Just make sure to completely clean your screen and have it lint free before applying. All you do is remove the plastic, carefully line up the protective glass cover and press. There is no adhesive to apply and your screen is crystal clear. This screen protector has an Oleophobic coating that makes it easy to clean and helps prevent fingerprints from adhering to the glass. Seeing how much better it is than the thin plastic type I was using before I have been encouraging my friends to give this type of a screen protector a try.After I had my screen protected I simply put my phone in the clear flexible case and pressed it on. All of my buttons are accessible and best of all my phone is totally visible.  Until you look closely it looks as if I am using the phone without any protective covering. I have not dropped my iPhone but I do think this case will help dampen and protect it from impact.  I am really pleased with how this case feels in my hand. It does not seem rubbery or sticky.

"I was offered this product at a promotional rate for my review.  Opinions are my own and this is my honest review.  I really like the design of this running belt.  It is comfortable and it does not move around my waist when I wear it. The adjustable bands and the buckle clip allows me to easily adjust it.  This is important as I like the flexibility to wear a running belt with different clothing, sometimes on the outside of my clothing other times under my clothing. The easy to adjust band and the secure buckle clip allows me to be comfortable and keep myself and my personal property better protected. These are the features I like. This waist pack can fit a waist size from 24 to 52 inches and has an eight inch pocket that can easily hold my iPhone 6, ID card, car key, and some money. The waterproof polyester belt is reflective so I am more visible at night.  I find myself using this belt frequently, anytime I want my hands to be free. This is perfect for traveling, walking, running, grocery shopping or at a playground caring for the youngsters.I no longer wear the old style fanny pack as this is so much better.

"The Kitzini Silicone Kitchen Tongs was provided at a discount for my review. Opinions are my own and this is my honest review. I was impressed when I opened the Kitzini two piece (12 and 9 inch) kitchen/barbecue tong set. It is well designed, great looking and felt comfortable in my hand. It is important to me how a cooking utensil feels when I grip it. I want it to be comfortable, not heavy or bulky to hold. These are perfect, both pieces are easy to hold, very sturdy and functional. I also want to be able to use a tong without worrying about scratching my cookware and it needs to protect my hand from heat.  The silicone on each tong makes it safe to use with any type of cookware and is positioned perfectly down the sides which helps keep heat from transferring directly to my hand. The cooking end is covered by silicone that is heat resistant up to 480 degrees and is nubby so picking up bacon, corn on the cob, etcetera is easy. Thanks to the shape and the silicone it is easy to stir with the tongs. Simply put I like everything about these tongs. I can not think of any changes I would make in the design. The stainless steel color looks classy in my kitchen. The tongs are easy to store as they can be locked closed by sliding.  I also have the option to hang the tong. The tongs are dishwasher safe but I usually hand wash since nothing sticks to the silicone. I highly recommend this product. It would make a great gift as it comes with a bonus silicone mitt that is shaped to fit on your hand and allows you to grip handles and pans. Perfect for when you are using the tongs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F9659EE1FJO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YFEXOTQ#wasThisHelpful","R3F9659EE1FJO6","A1D6XGKX9U3B97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D6XGKX9U3B97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I  received a discount for the Spartan Yoga Wear headband for my review.  Opinions are my own and this is my honest review.I am so glad I tried this headband. I needed to do something to keep my hair out of my face when exercising to a dance workout.  My hair isn't long enough to put in a ponytail, so I decided to give a yoga style headband a try. So when I had the opportunity to use a discount I decided why not give it a try.  I usually have problems with headbands never staying in place or they are too tight and uncomfortable.  I had never tried a wide headband, it is so different than a headband that is just one or two inches wide. This headband is comfortable, stretchy and the material is not too thick. It is wide enough to keep my bangs up off my face and my hair off my neck. The material is soft and I can wear it without feeling like I'm going to get a headache.  The fabric is 70% Cotton, 20% Spandex and 10% Polyester.  What's great is it stays in place and makes my exercising experience so much better. Not just because my hair is out of my face but the headband absorb moisture and keeps sweat as well as my hair from getting in my eyes.I now find myself wearing this not just when I exercise. I put this on anytime I want my hair away from my face. I have used this when applying a clay mask to my face, when applying makeup, when I am painting, and when outside doing yard work. I have worn it with the twist knot in the front and in the back. I recommend giving this a try. I had ordered my headband in black but like that this is available in several colors. Care instructions are cool wash, air dry, do not tumble dry, cool iron, no bleaching, and no fabric softener. I find it convenient just to hand wash after wearing and hang dry.I recommend giving this a try. It is definitely a  hairband that is made to be comfortable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DC62KXQCL1E1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPZ5GOK#wasThisHelpful","R3DC62KXQCL1E1","A1D6XGKX9U3B97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D6XGKX9U3B97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chalk This Way Liquid Chalk Markers was provided at a discount for my review.  Opinions are my own and this is my honest review.  These are so much fun.  Liquid chalk markers are different than traditional chalk. They are the innovative way to be able to write on any non-porous surface such as dry erase boards, windows, mirrors, and windshields. This is what you often see used by restaurants and retail shops because they write smoothly, dry quickly, and wipe off easily with no dust.  I have found hours of enjoyment with my grandchildren using Chalk This Way Liquid Chalk Markers. They make it possible to let them be creative without a great big mess and the cleanup is easy. There are so many different ways to use these markers. We have decorated for birthday party,  we have written messages for family members, wrote clues throughout the house for scavenger hunt, practiced writing the alphabet and numbers but best of all just had fun being creative drawing pictures.I especially like the thin design and the bright colors of this 8 piece set.  The colors included are purple, white, orange, green, pink, light blue, yellow and red.  The thin size of the barrel of the chalk marker lets it be comfortable to hold.  The size of the tips allows thin precise lines and I find the ink flow is easy to control. The directions that are printed on each marker are - To prime shake well with cap on, push down gently on the tip repeatedly until ink has filled the tip. It's that easy and simple. I suggest priming all the markers before you start a project with children. It is easy to do but they never want to wait to start the fun. When I am ready to ""erase"" I use a damp paper towel for cleanup.  Chalk This Way has a Lifetime Satisfaction Guarantee. If your markers do not perform for their full life they will replace them for you!  I highly recommend this product and suggest giving them as a gift. They are safe for ages 3 and up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J1R6W57QTO51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RWQXOXK#wasThisHelpful","R3J1R6W57QTO51","A1D6XGKX9U3B97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D6XGKX9U3B97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Vegetable's Chef Culinary Herb Scissors are awesome. As part of my healthy diet plan, I am cooking using more fresh herbs and spices.  I usually just use a sharp knife to cut herbs and end up with them being crushed or bruised.  I had the opportunity to receive the Vegetable's Chef Culinary Herb Scissors using a promotional code in exchange for my honest review so I decided to try them out.  I am very glad I ordered this handy kitchen tool.  The scissors are a fun green color, sturdy, well made, and come with a slide on cover to use when storing. The 5 stainless steel blades are 3 inches in length and are evenly spaced to give an uniform cut.  Because of the multiple sharp blades my cutting job is accomplished quickly and the herbs are not crushed.  I find the handle is comfortable to grip and the scissors are not heavy to hold.  I am pleased that they are dishwasher safe but I normally just rinse them off and they are ready to go.  I find that these scissors cut my preparation time in half, so I am experimenting with different herbs and using these scissors frequently.  I even use them to cut mint that I place in my water infusion bottle. These would make a great gift for anyone who likes to cook. I highly recommend giving these useful herb scissors a try.  They are offered with a full refund if you don't love this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WNEC39R1ADPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y3JASH4#wasThisHelpful","R1WNEC39R1ADPL","A1D6XGKX9U3B97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D6XGKX9U3B97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My doctor recommends that I take Vitamin D daily for several reasons including to maintain normal levels of calcium and phosphorus.  Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium (which I take daily) as it forms and maintains strong bones.  My doctor explained when taking calcium together with Vitamin D it will help decrease my risk of bone fractures and will improve my bone health.  So, when I had the opportunity to order Vitamin D3 using a promotional code in exchange for an honest review I was eager to do so.  I can honestly say I really like these easy to swallow soft gels.  Directions state for adults to take one soft gel daily preferably with a meal. The bottle contains 60 caps which is a 2 month supply if taken as directed on the bottle.  I have had no problem taking these, as my stomach does not seem to get upset.  I plan on continuing these as I know I am not in natural sunlight enough to keep my Vitamin D level up.  So glad an easy to take Vitamin D pill is available that has so many health benefits, made in the USA and is all natural.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R322EK4RJ3SLRI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6UOBTI#wasThisHelpful","R322EK4RJ3SLRI","A1D6XGKX9U3B97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D6XGKX9U3B97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, I am impressed with these headphones and the handy portable stands that were included. The headphones come in a compact sturdy white case with a clear plastic cover. The earbuds are similar in design to the earbuds that came with my iPhone 6. They are shaped to comfortably fit your ear and are marked indicating L for left and R for right ear. These are designed to fit without the need to have foam on the tips which allows me to be able to clean them after use. These earbuds seem to fit my ears comfortably and I am very pleased with the quality of the sound. The volume is easy to adjust by clicking plus or minus on the control switch and I am able to click it to answer a call. The handy stand enables me to set the phone at an angle that is easy to see and to wind any excess cord that I am no using. I am glad I had the opportunity to use a promotional code to order this and to give my honest review. I had the opportunity to try these out on a long airline flight. The headphones worked perfectly and I was able to enjoy not holding my phone. It was easy to put my phone with the stand attached into my pocket as the cords stay untangled when wrapped around the stand. I am glad you get two stands with this offer.  Very pleased with the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R195F4C330YZAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VRGIALW#wasThisHelpful","R195F4C330YZAX","A1D6XGKX9U3B97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D6XGKX9U3B97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This handy Travelsafer Digital Tire Pressure Gauge is so easy to use. I now have an easy-to-read tool so I can quickly and accurately check my own tire pressure. I like everything about this gadget. It fits my hand, the dial is illuminated, and it was ready to use (I didn't need to install a battery).  There are 4 ranges on the gauge; Psi, Bar, Kg/Cm2, and Kpa but for my use I will only be using the Psi range.  I previously always asked my husband to check the tire pressure because I never felt confident with the reading.  Now, with the Travelsafer Digital Tire Pressure Gauge I get a digital display not like the old fashioned tire gauge that I had to manually read.  My car provides a tire pressure reading so I have checked the reading and they were the same so I feel confident using it.  Previously, I would restart my car to double check the reading.  I am glad I had the opportunity to use a promotional code to make this purchase in exchange for an honest review.  I like the size of this tool, it easily fits in the glove compartment.  I know that your vehicle's fuel economy improves with the correct tire pressure so I highly recommend this gauge.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE359TRSG5LRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SO4OVIQ#wasThisHelpful","RE359TRSG5LRX","A1D6XGKX9U3B97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D6XGKX9U3B97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The AOR Flashlights Best LED Bicycle Headlight with Bonus Taillight is so easy for me to install (everything needed to mount is included) requires no tools as I just use my fingers to adjust the mounting screw.  It snaps off quickly to become a handy, easy to hold, waterproof flashlight by just sliding the light out of the holder.  I am an occasional bike rider so having a bike light that assembles quickly is just what I need and being able to use this as a hand held flashlight is perfect. I am impressed with how nicely this is packaged in a padded carry case that comes with a lanyard so it makes it easy to carry.  This makes this light easy to pack when traveling. The light is awesome - very bright with up to 500 feet light visibility and has three modes, fast flash, slow flash and steady.  It comes with 3 AAA batteries, along with a rechargeable battery and the necessary charger.  When you charge the battery it blinks red then changes to green when completely charged.  The bonus taillight is on a strap that snaps closed. This makes it perfect not just for a bike but also on a baby stroller or to use when walking.  Visibility is a key part to being  safe when riding a bike or walking and the AOR flashlights are definitely bright and helps me be more visible.  The quality and versatility makes this product a definite 5 stars.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.

"I have tried different products for dark circles under my eyes and was still searching for a product that provided results when I ordered the Atal eye serum.  Having been impressed with other Atal products I decided to add their eye serum to my daily routine. I ordered this using a promotional code and here is my honest review. I hadn't  been using the eye serum very long when I started to notice that the delicate skin under my eyes seemed a little firmer.  This might not sound like a big deal but this has made a big difference. I can now use coverup makeup to hide my circles. Before the thin, flimsy skin under eyes never seemed to allow makeup to spread evenly. I am very excited to see that this serum is starting to work, the skin texture is different and I hope to continue to see improvements.  I like using the serum as it doesn't feel uncomfortable, just an easy to apply unscented serum. This product comes nicely packaged in a box and the serum is in a bottle that is pump dispensed. The pump enables me to dispense the small amount that I need so I am not wasting. I only use less than a full pump (about the size of a pea), so this bottle will last me a long time. I hope to see my dark circles lighten with continued use.  I like that this serum is non-greasy so my makeup still goes on evenly and that it is made from naturally derived ingredients, Paraben Free, non-toxic and not tested on animals.  Definitely say give it a try it has a MONEY BACK GUARANTEE if you are not completely satisfied.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FYAE4Y4UZ0ZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NRM4D7O#wasThisHelpful","R3FYAE4Y4UZ0ZY","A1D6XGKX9U3B97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D6XGKX9U3B97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Atal products are terrific. I had tried some of their serums and moisturizer and have been enjoying great results. When I had the opportunity to try out their clay mask using a promo code I was excited to try another one of their products and to write an honest review. This is a terrific product. The description states that this clay is the closest to neutral pH of all clay and mud masks, pH is between 6.9 and 7.2, ideal for your skin; must be why I like this so much better that other clay masks I have tried.  The major ingredients listed include glacial marine clay, Vitamin B3, licorice root extract, Vitamin E and aloe vera. The attractive jar of clay comes in a box and a small spatula is included to use to scoop the clay out.  I tried it out the day I received it. The directions state to apply an even layer over clean dry skin. Allow to dry completely (10 - 15 mins) before rinsing off with warm water. Avoid direct contact with eyes.  So I cleansed my face and I decided to put a warm washcloth on my face for just a bit to allow my pores to open up. I opened the jar, the clay is a gel consistency, green in color with a botanical smell similar to ones used on me when I have had a facial. I used the included spatula to scoop and applied with my fingers. I was immediately impressed how smoothly and evenly it was spreading. It wasn't taking a lot of product to cover my face and I was able to easily apply a thin coat. I felt a slight tingle at first which didn't last long. I was able to let this dry without being uncomfortable and the slight smell dissipated quickly. I left it dry and then after about 12 minutes I rinsed with warm water using a washcloth. The product rinsed off easily.  After rinsing off the product I could feel the difference. My skin felt soft, smooth and hydrated.I have only used the mask a few times and I am seeing noticeable results. I feel my skin is brighter and more hydrated. I do not hesitate recommending giving this a try.  Atal offers a satisfaction guarantee of a full refund.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S3GBKPFM7RN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q88V1II#wasThisHelpful","R2S3GBKPFM7RN0","A1D6XGKX9U3B97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D6XGKX9U3B97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Matchbaker Oven Gloves are exactly what I need to protect my hands when grilling and baking. These gloves are awesome. They allow me to protect my hands from heat (up to 425 degrees) and handle food and pans with ease and flexibility. The gloves are thick and have textured hearts on the outside of the gloves to keep things from slipping and the additional texture on the inside of the glove makes removing these gloves easy as they do not stick to my hands. The red is a fun color that make the gloves easy to find. The glove is designed so it covers my wrist which gives me added protection from the heat. Silicone gloves in my opinion are so much better than cloth baking mitts. So when I had the opportunity, I was pleased to use a promo code to order these and to give an honest review. Honestly, I have decided to only use silicone oven gloves and to get rid of my fabric baking mitts. These Matchbaker Oven Gloves are much safer to use. They are heat resistant and can be cleaned in the dishwasher. I do not have to worry about stains as they simply rinse off.  There is no rubber smell to these gloves. I am finding so many uses for them. I even put them on when I am removing corn on the cob from boiling water and when handling baked potatoes. There is a lifetime guarantee and if you are not completely happy you can get a full refund. An extra large size is available to order which is great for a hand wider than 4 inches as shown on the diagram. I ordered the regular size and it fits fine but if it hadn't the company offers a free size exchange. These are the reasons that I recommend giving them a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22O8GYAY6OACG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WP9I7DQ#wasThisHelpful","R22O8GYAY6OACG","A1D6XGKX9U3B97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D6XGKX9U3B97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ingredients in Calaburner are Raspberry Ketones, Chitosan, Chlorella, Kelp, Green Tea and Lotus Leaf Extracts.  I have heard about the benefits of Raspberry Ketones and Green Tea so when I had the opportunity to order during a promotional discount in exchange for an honest review I did. I wanted to try this because it is a non-stimulant weight loss product that may also improve my cholesterol and triglycerides levels. The bottle contains 60 tablets and the directions are to take two tablets once daily with a meal. So this bottle is a one month supply. The pills are well sealed in the bottle by an outside protective wrap and also protected by the seal inside the lid. I like that the pills are not huge so they are easy for me to swallow. They actually have a sweet smell and no funny aftertaste. I find it a great plus that I only need to take 2 pills a day at one time and have chosen to take them with my breakfast so I am set for the day. I have not experienced any jittery feeling and do find my appetite seems more controlled. In addition to these pills I am trying to drink plenty of water and exercising. So far I am pleased with my results. I know I will continue to lose weight as my cravings are more controlled. I have been storing these in my refrigerator since they should be stored in a cool, dry place. This also helps me to remember to take them. Calaburner offers a 100% money back guarantee.

"I really like the angled head and long 18 inch heavy duty handle on this BBQ Grill Brush by USA Kitchen Elite. Cooking on the grill always makes food taste better so finding a great grill brush solves the do I want to grill out and clean the grill problem.  Cleanup is never fun but having the right tool for the cleanup makes all the difference.  I like to take a minute right after I turn the grill off to clean the grill while it is still hot.  I find the design of this brush to be perfect for this. It has a strong, reinforced 18 inch long handle that lets me apply extra pressure without it bending or my hands getting too close to the grill. The bristles are strong and reach the sides of the grates. I used a promotional code when ordering this and my honest opinion is you should give it a try.

"I am excited about the BfB Laptop Computer Briefcase. When I opened the box I was immediately impressed by the classy stylish look.  As I removed the briefcase from the box, I was delighted to find that the bag is light weight and can stand on its own. Other leather computer briefcase bags I have tried have either been too heavy, flopped over, weren't very stylish or functional.  I found myself thinking that the ""Lindsay by My Best Friend is a Bag"" has an appropriate name.  I knew that if I found the inside of the bag to be functional I would be carrying this ""new friend"" all the time as I absolutely love the faux snake skin and gorgeous patent leather on the outside of the bag.  My next thing to check out was the drop height (distance from the top of the folded shoulder strap to the top of the bag).  The fit is perfect!  It carries at the correct position, very comfortable and not awkward.  My personal preference is to carry a briefcase bag on one shoulder, but definitely like that I have the option to add a strap so it can be used as a crossbody briefcase.  I know I will take advantage of this option when I'm in an airport and have other bags with me.The outside is perfect and I had my fingers crossed for a functional inside with pockets and spaces for personal items and all the stuff I always try to fit in my bag.  As I mentioned, the briefcase stands upright so packing is easy.  I like a lining that enables you to easily see things in any type of bag.  This briefcase passes the test with a fun waterproof orange lining which compliments the black outside giving it the ""wow"" designer look. The center compartment has a silver easy to zip quality zipper that has two zipper tabs. The center zippered pocket is padded and easily holds my Apple MacBook Pro even with a cover on it.  There is plenty of room to also carry handbag essentials, briefcase items, and even an iPad and it still looks thin and not bulky.  There are 3 inside side pockets which fit my iPhone, sunglasses and credit cards and also a key ring clip which keeps my keys handy.  A wide, deep and zippered pocket is available on the other inside side pocket.  The 2 outside compartments are closed with magnetic snaps.  I like how the snaps are designed, they aren't sewn directly to the side of the compartment which allows me to carry more stuff.  I am pleased with the design of the inside of the briefcase and totally amazed how much it holds.I was fortunate to purchase this stylish, well made and functional briefcase using a promotional code.

"So far I am loving this serum.  It feels so good on my skin. I like that this is a thin gel that goes on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling soft and not sticky.  Another great feature is that it is odorless. I have tried other anti-aging serums that have had weird smells but this serum is indeed odorless.  So, I have no excuse not to use this regularly.  It is so nice to have a serum that is helping my winkles and dark spots that actually makes my face feel good and allows my makeup to go on smoother.  Other products that I have tried seemed not to cooperate when I tried to apply makeup after they had dried. This serum seems to work as a primer for my makeup.  I can even apply my moisturizer and then my makeup and my skin still feels good.  I have been using this twice a day, in the morning and at night after cleansing my face. I make sure to use this on the back of my hands and on my dcolletage as well as my face.  I always look for serums made in the USA, FDA registered facility, with a full money back guarantee.

"Happy to say I have found the easy solution to being able to chill a bottle of wine quickly. Seems like I never guess correctly which bottle of wine my guests will want to open. Now, I just make sure I have the rod section of the wine chiller chilled in the freezer for at least 2 hours.  Then I simply pour out a little bit of the wine so I can insert the rod that I have screwed onto the pourer/aerator into the bottle. It's important to pour out a little taste of the wine because you will displace some wine when the chilling rod is immersed.  The wine chiller and pourer not only allows me to chill wine quickly (it takes about 5 minutes) but also aerates the wine. I will be the first to admit I am not a wine connoisseur and I am not buying the most expensive wine but I feel that aerating does improve the taste. I also find that the pourer eliminates drips and spills. I am glad I was able to purchase this using a promotional code as this wine chiller is so easy to use. It comes nicely packaged and a free wine stopper is included.  This would make a perfect hostess gift.  It has a sleek look and is a useful gadget.

I'm surprised because when I saw some of the colors like the bright orange lip gloss I didn't think I'd be using it.  What I do is mix the colors of the lip glosses and get exactly the color I want. I am so glad the lip glosses do not feel tacky and do not look greasy when they are on.

My experience is that it holds a charge well for about 2 hours. I am highly pleased and am enjoying this speaker.  Recommend giving it a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R283WX151384G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PF4SNKK#wasThisHelpful","R283WX151384G","A1D6XGKX9U3B97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D6XGKX9U3B97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like to be prepared especially with little ones in the car. It always seems like you need those extra tissues, water bottle, sunscreen, and some toys for them to play with especially when you're stuck in traffic. 411 Seasons BackSeat organizer is well made. It is a polyester fabric that I will be able to wipe clean and it will dry quickly.  It only took me a couple minutes to adjust the straps and install. I like that there are no elastic straps to worry about as the straps clip to adjust to the seat. This is important to me that it Is child friendly with no dangerous parts. The pockets are well thought out. At first I didn't think a lot of stuff would fit but I was pleasantly surprised how much stuff it holds. Even if you don't travel with little ones this would help you to have things easily accessible. I like to have sunglasses, my water bottle, snacks, charging cable and tissues so I can just reach back and find them quickly. I was able to purchase this with a promotional code and I am so glad I did. The organizer even with stuff in it has protected the back of my seat from the mess and school marks from little feet. I definitely feel this is a quality product. It would make a nice baby gift for new parents. You could even include some of the items they will need with their new little bundle of joy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PDG6H28FWM4T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R5Y2F0W#wasThisHelpful","R2PDG6H28FWM4T","A1D6XGKX9U3B97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D6XGKX9U3B97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the Top Concert Earbuds came with 3 different size premium Comply earphone tips for me to select from. Each set is spherical shaped for a secure fit that blocks noises.  I really like that this gives me a custom fit that I could choose to fit my ears. I found it easy to change the tip, all I needed to do was remove the silicone tips off the earbud first then add to the earbud. I like the tip that for a better fit for small ear canals you hold the earbud with one hand, use your free hand to pull your outer ear back and out to the side. This will straighten your ear canal. Another hint to go deep for deeper insertion is that you open and close your jaw multiple times as you insert the earbud with the rolled and compressed Comply tip. Explaining that this would open up the ear canal.  I found that by following these hints my earphones are so comfortable. I am so glad I was able to get these using a promotional code.  Before this set of earphones I never wanted to keep a set on as they weren't comfortable. Now I am comfortably enjoying this set. I like the tangle free cord, the sports clip, music pause and volume control. The sound is awesome and there is a carry pouch to store them in. I am definitely pleased with the quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JVQOPDQYNY0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M22IVPK#wasThisHelpful","R1JVQOPDQYNY0G","A1D6XGKX9U3B97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D6XGKX9U3B97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My dogs are like my babies so they get spoiled a lot. I love buying them new treats to try and I have gave them some fifi & fido treats before and they loved them so, I figured I would get these for them. These treats look like round, long beef jerky and come in a 16 oz. sealable bag so the treats will stay nice and fresh. They are made from 100% USA Pure chicken. They do not contain any soy, wheat, gluten, added sugar or corn fillers. This is important to me because I want my family to eat healthy and that includes my furbabies. These can be used as just every day treats or they can be used to train dogs. I love that they don't have a bad odor to them and they don't leave my hands smelling bad. My dogs LOVE them. I pick up the bag and they come running over and sit in front of me waiting for Momma to give them their daily treat. I received this product at a discount to test and review.

"My skin is super dry and it is really hard for me to find products that help to hydrate it. This Jojoba oil comes in a 4 fl. Oz. bottle and when you open it there is a plastic cap over the opening with a small hole so that you don't get to much at one time.  It can be used on the skin or in your hair but I have only used it on my hands and arms. It doesn't take but a few drops and when I massage it into my skin it absorbs completely. Even though it is an oil it doesn't leave my skin feeling all greasy. It has a nice light fragrance to it and it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated instead of looking all flaky from being so dry.  Reading through the ingredients I have to say that I do not see that this contains Jojoba Oil and I am posting a picture of the ingredients to show what all it contains.

"It seems like every time I go to get a storage container they are all gone so I am constantly having to buy new ones. One of the things that made me want to get these is that they are portion control containers. I received 12 bowls with lids and with the price being as great as it is I was afraid that these bowls would be cheaply made but they are really durable bowls. They can be used for hot or cold foods, are freezer and microwaveable safe and can be washed on the top shelf of the dishwasher. I decided to make a pot of chicken and noodles the day I got them and I made sure I made enough that I could freeze some for later. I filled the bowls up and snapped the lid on and as a test tilted the bowl sideways to see if it would leak and the lid stayed sealed tightly and did not leak at all. I then stacked them up in the freezer and since they are stackable I was able to save a lot of room in the freezer. Whenever we got hungry we could just pull one out of the freezer, heat it up in the microwave and have a nice hot bowl of chicken and noodles. I have found new storage containers for our home and will be purchasing more in the future. I received this product as a sample to test and review. This review is solely my opinion.

"These are so handy to have. We wanted to get one so we could keep track of the temperature in the car in case it overheats so that the head doesn't warp or crack.  You can measure in Fahrenheit or Celsius,  it has a button on it to choose which one you want to use, and ranges from -58 Degree Fahrenheit to +716 Degree Fahrenheit or -50 Degree Celsius to + 380 Degree Celsius. It takes a 9 volt battery and to put it in you just open the compartment on the front of the handle of the gun. It will automatically shut off and lets me know when the battery is getting low. To get a reading you point it at whatever you are trying to get a temperature on and hold the trigger until the temperature stops rising or falling. This can be used to check the temperature in the car, swimming pool, fish tank, fireplace, foods and much more. I think this is a great tool for every household to have.

"The first thing I noticed about this Wine Aerator is that it is so beautiful and stylish looking. I have never been a big wine drinker, I just didnt think it tasted that good but my sister in law told me to try using a Wine Aerator that it helped to give it a better taste. This one looks like a little glass globe and fits easily on the top of a bottle of wine. It has rubber around the piece that fits into the bottle. The glass is good quality and feels like it would not break easily. I was kind of skeptical that this could make wine taste better but it really does. The wine pours out of it smoothly and it helps to enhance the flavor and the smell by helping it to breathe. It is really easy to clean in just some warm soapy water. My only con would be that I did not receive a plastic storage case and would have had some kind of case or something to store it in to keep it safe from getting broke.

"I have lots of appointments and always seem to run out of room on our little calendars so I was needing something bigger to keep track of everything on.  I love the laminated calendars because it saves a lot of money. Instead of having to buy a new calendar every year I can just use a dry erase marker and set it up for the month and then  clear this one each month and start the next month. It came rolled up in a tube so there are no wrinkles or creases in it from being folded.  I just used thumb tacks and stuck it up on my wall next to my bed so I could see every morning what I need to do that day. Now, I knew this calendar was going to be big but I was surprised at how big it actually is. It is  36 by 48 inches big and each square is 5 by inches big so now I have plenty of room on my calendar.

"I have never really seen a teething necklace that the parent wears until recently and I really like the idea. I ordered the green one but there are several different colors you can choose from.  It is made of silicone and is BPA free and does not contain any toxins.  The necklace is a satin cord and has these big chunky beads on them. Now I dont have little ones so again I got this for my nephew.  It is a cute necklace and looks really cute on his mom. I love that it has a break away clasp so there is no chance that she can get choked from him pulling on it. It works great for when he is fussy from teething she can hold him and let him chew on it and it helps to relieve the pain in his gums. He loves to chew on it and play with it.

I got this for my nephew because that poor baby was having such a hard time teething.

I never would of thought something like this could work like this but it absorbs in his skin and he just feels so much better.

"These are  made with Organic Coconut Milk and Oil and they smell so good. They come in 16.9oz. Bottles and have pumps on them. I personally love the pumps because it is easier to get the shampoo and conditioner out of the bottles when I am in the middle of my shower. I run the shampoo through my hair and work it onto my scalp and then rinse it and do the same thing with the conditioner. My hair comes out feeling so soft and smells great.

It can be used for so many different things. It can be mixed with lotion or coconut oil for a massage, put a few drops in the bath water, make soaps and so much more. I love using my essential oils and I learn new things they can be used for everyday. I received this product at a discount to test and review. This review is solely my opinion.

"I love using Argan Oil for my hair so, I was really excited to get this Luseta shampoo and conditioner set. They come in 16.9 fl. Oz. bottles and have pumps on them. I like the pumps because its easier to get the shampoo and conditioner out of the bottle when I am in the shower. These are great at moisturizing and repairing my hair from the damage I do to it every day.  It comes out feeling and looking soft and beautiful. I only have to use a small amount at a time so this is going to last me awhile.

"I have wanted one of these Tens Units since I was in Physical Therapy and they used one on my arm. This unit takes 4 AAA batteries that are included and comes with 4 patches, you can buy more patches for it. It has 6 stimulation modes and the speed and intensity can be adjusted. I use mine on my elbow because right now I have tendinitis in it but they can also be used on your waist, shoulder, joint, hands/legs, soles, or put it on repeat. The speed adjusts up and down , you can adjust it from 1-10 for the intensity, and it can knead, massage or beat the muscles. It is  good for  stress, sore muscles, stiffness and chronic pain. It comes with instructions showing how to set it all up and use it. The patches stuck really well to my arm and didn't slide around any.  I put it on 4 and knead and it works the muscles for 15 minutes. It feels great and when I am done I can tell that it has helped to loosen up the muscles because my arm is easier to move.

"Cool Joe Sunglasses are little, blue, stylish looking sunglasses. The lenses are polarized lenses to help block the glare from sunlight. They are lightweight and plastic. They are unisex and can be worn by male or females but I have to say these really strike me as being made for kids not adults. They are small glasses with big lenses on them.

"I wish they would of had these Baby Car Mirrors when my kids were little. I hated to be driving and my  baby would start crying but I couldn't see what was wrong with him so, I got this mirror for my nephew and his wife so they could keep an eye on their baby. The mirror attaches to the head rest and is able to move at a 360 degree angle so it can face where ever they have the baby in the back seat. The mirror is a great quality, durable mirror and the glass is clear.  As a bonus it came with 2 car shades, a bottle for mirror cleaner and a cloth. The mirror is big so that they can see the baby easier. The bonus shades are great because it helps keep the sun off of him so that he is not getting to hot back there.

"This is one of the cutest Nursery Decals I have seen. The colors are so bright and pretty and really makes it stand out. The decal is 31 in. x 31 in., is Eco friendly and safe for kids. I have to admit I was worried that I would mess it up when I went to apply it to the wall but it was a lot easier then I thought it would be. The instructions come with it and they are easy to follow. One thing I really loved about it is how easy it was to take off and move around when I would put a piece on crooked. It stuck really well to the wall and didn't slide around. It is washable in case little hands get it sticky while playing. The price on it is great and the kids just love it.

"I have two dogs that go everywhere with me. We love to go walking and to the river so that means I need a ball or two, some treats, and some poop bags to clean up after them. This is a mesh bag that is 5.5 in. x 7 in. and you can either clip it on, put it on your belt or use the shoulder strap. I personally like to use the shoulder strap because it's just more comfortable to me that way. There is a mesh pocket, two zipper pockets, and a green inside pouch for dog treats. I really like that it has a poop bag dispenser on it. It makes it so much easier to pull off a bag to quickly clean up their mess. The bag is durable and stylish looking.

"I have wanted a Smart Watch for a while now but I wasn't really sure if it would be something I would use much or if I would even be able to figure it out. This watch came in a nice box and has a small user guide and USB cord to charge it with. The screen on the watch is nice and clear and is pretty bright. It was really easy to Bluetooth to it, it only took a few seconds to find it and connect. There is a setting option on it where I was able to go in and set the time as well as notification settings, call settings and more. I made a call with it and the sound came through pretty clear and I didn't have any problem hearing my husband. I was really happy to see that the watch had a lot of the same things that my smart phone does.

"Since i have been trying to lose weight I have started drinking a lot of water.  I needed a bottle I could take with me when I'm working out and since I have dropped and broke a few glass ones and broke them I thought I better get one I can't break.  I received 2 collapsible bottles,  one pink and one blue,  and a bottle brush to clean them.  The bottles has clips on the side of them so I am able to clip them to my belt loop  while I am walking and I love that. They also has a little loop, it's kind of like a rubber band, on the side so when I'm done drinking my water I can  roll the bottle up and put the little loop on it to keep it rolled up to save space.  The lid fits on it securely,  it doesn't leak,  and it has a flip tab lid to make it easier to drink from while walking. I have noticed when I'm holding the bottle the sides go in and it can be a little hard to hold at first but you get use to it.

"I love tea and am constantly getting different kinds of tea to try.  This Darjeeling Black Tea comes in a re-sealable bag to keep the tea fresh and tasting  great.

"I am constantly using my phone so if I don't keep a charger close my phone will die on me.  Unfortunately,  I can not always find a plug in to charge it so this Celltronix Portable Back up Charger comes in handy when I am not at home but need to charge my phone.  It is small so I can keep it in my purse without it taking up much room. It charges my phone pretty fast and I can charge my phone completely with it.  I like that you can use it for an  iPhone our an Android phone so if I decide to buy an iPhone I won't have to buy a different portable charger. I also like that it has a flashlight on it so I am able to see walking to the house from the car when I forget to leave the porch  light on. The rubber on the outside of the charger is great because I have dropped it a few times and it didn't damage the charger at all.  It's really a good quality,  durable charger.

"With having kids I have learned that it's so much safer and easier to use plastic plates for them. I wanted to find some that were plastic but durable at the same  time. I received two  white square plates, one 8 in. and one 10.5 in. The plates are thicker then the one's I have bought previously from the store. I love that they are BPA free and Eco-friendly.  When I received these they did have a small chop in the top right hand corner but it was not real noticeable.  They were easy to clean and the food did not stain the plates like some I have owned before.

"My husband loves Bluetooth speakers and headphones so,  I am always looking for new ones he might like.  He has a Samsung Galaxy S3 phone and they paired with his phone easily. They can also be used for iPhones, or anything that has Bluetooth capability.  The headphones come with 3 sets of earbuds, a charging cord, and a mantel manual. The LED charging light on it is great because we can tell when it fully charged and ready to go.  It lights up red while it's charging and turns blue when it's charged. They are really comfortable and don't make his ears hurt. The sound quality on these are great.  The music comes through nice and clear and he has no problem hearing when someone calls him.  The buttons on them make it easy for him to shuffle through his music or to answer a phone call. The only complaint he really has is that he wishes there was a way to make them a little tighter around his head so  when he's working or exercising they don't slide out of his ears.

"I have been exercising and changed the way I eat  trying to lose weight but I wanted to find something to maybe help me lose weight a little faster.  I haven't had a lot of luck with weightleloss medicines in the past but I decided to go ahead and give the NutraFx Yellow Energy Xtreme a shot. I received a months worth of pills,  60 days supply. They are yellow capsules that are easy to swallow and I'm thankful they don't leave a bad aftertaste in my mouth.  I take one in the morning before breakfast and then one in the late afternoon.  I have noticed that I have more energy so I'm able to get up, move around and workout more. I love that it helps me to not be as hungry so I don't sit around and snack anymore.  I feel fuller longer  and just feel so much better.  I have been losing an average of 4 lbs a week and I could not be happier with the results. I received this product as a sample to test and review.

"I have been trying to lose weight and decided to  start  drinking some protein shakes. I tried mixing them with a spoon but it seems like I wasn't able to get it all mixed up good. The NutraFx Blender Bottle has a nice  logo design  and a rubber grip on the outside of the bottle. I really like the rubber grip because it helps me to hold  onto the bottle while shaking it up and drinking from  the bottle so it's not so easy to drop. It also comes with a wire whisk blender ball that works great at getting my shakes all mixed up without leaving any clumps in it so that my drinks taste delicious and smooth.  The lid screws on  nice and tight and the flip top  closes completely so, I have not had any problems with it leaking.  I love that it is BPA and Phthalate free.  It keeps the bottle from holding in smells or flavors from my drinks. To wash mine I just wash it in warm soapy water but it is dishwasher safe to.

"I got this sword for my nephew because I knew he would have a lot of fun with it.  The Ninja Sword has Led lights on it that light up  red and blue while he plays with it. It takes 3 AA batteries that are included with the sword. There is a button he can push to activate it or he can just start swinging  it around to activate it.  He loves that not only does it have lights but it makes a cool sound as he swings  it around.  I have to say I was really worried that it was going to get tore up pretty fast like some of the toy swords my kids had but this one is holding up really well.

"I recently started using essential oils and I have to say that I love them.  You can use them to help make your house smell good,  to help with health issues,  to get rid of some insects and rodents and much more.  This set comes with 6 different types of oils in 10ml bottles.  These oils  are 100% pure oils.  They are Dreamy Sleep, Tropical Island, Romantic Paradise, Mellow Mind, Health Guard, and Breathe Again.  I have been really sick these last few weeks so I was really lucky to get this set when I did.  I put the Breathe Again in my oil diffuser as soon as I got them and I was surprised at how well it worked.  It has a nice, light minty smell to it and it really seemed to help me breathe a little better.  I then used the Dreamy Sleep that night as I was going to bed. I put some in my oil diffuser on my nightstand and it helped me to relax before I fell asleep.  I haven't used the other ones yet but I did open them and smell them and they smell amazing.

"I have just enough curl in my hair to make it a big frizzy mess most of the time. I went and got my hair done at a salon and they straightened it and I loved the way it looked so I decided I wanted to try a hair straightener at home.

It came in a sturdy black box and then inside is a nice, durable, heat resistant black carrying bag so it is easy to take where ever I go. It comes with a digital display on it so I don't have to try and guess how hot it is. The plates inside are made of Tourmaline Ceramic and can reach up to 430F.

I love the angst and how Emma was leery of Gabriel. Then things took a turn and it was crazy, but I did not mind it.However here are my issues and why I was just a little irritated, Major spoilers. Do not read if you do not know what happens towards the end.Spoiler below...Keep scrolling....Keep scrolling.....Keep scrolling for major spoilers.I hated that Gabriel told Emma he had something to take care of that Sunday that they had planned together only that that ""something"" was taking care of Embry who told Gabriel she took a bunch of pills. Embry lied just so that Gabriel would stay the night with her. There is no cheating. It is clear that Gabriel loves Emma. However, I think he knew at this point what a snake Embry was and why he believed her, I do not know. Was it because he was her Dom and she was his sub? All the lies he told Emma bothered me. Part of me understands that Gabriel lied so that Emma would not know that he was a Dom and he was into BDSM, which would scare her off but then he seemed so angry that he had to act ""perfect"" because that is what she wanted.I enjoyed reading this book, but I am not sure if Gabriel could ever be completely honest with Emma.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M468VGCVVZNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DLR7FOI#wasThisHelpful","R2M468VGCVVZNT","AIH41FDX1K0Z4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIH41FDX1K0Z4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I was going to DNF this book 3 times, but every time I thought of quitting, I looked at the great reviews again and asked myself ""what am I missing???  The third time was the charm.  I could not stop reading.Sophia is kidnapped by a vampire and brought back as a gift to the prince, Derek, who has woken up after 400 years. Sophia will now be Derek's  blood slave.  However, Derek sees Sophia do something very sentimental to another human and is drawn to her.  I wanted to initially DNF this book because I thought some of Derek's behavior was a little too insta for my liking.  However, the way everything else came together...it was not.  The way the author took her time with Derek and Sophia.  I loved their private scenes.  I needed a break from heavy sex/erotica scenes so I enjoyed the intense chemistry  without the sex in this book.I ALSO almost DNFed the book because I was annoyed with Sophia and the way she was thinking about Ben...her BFF, who ditched her on her birthday.  If my BFF treated me that way, I would not be his BFF anymore.  But Sophia is a little naive and she does care her friend, so I guess I will have to put up with that whole part of the series.  Sophia is a kind person so wants everyone to be cared for.My third reason for ALMOST DNFing was that I am not a fan of dual POVs and especially when the switch happens every other chapter, but I got used to it.  Initially the dual POVs, I felt gave away to  much, but later in the story there was enough suspense going on that it worked.I can not wait to move on to the next book.  I love all the evil that is lurking and how everything is NOT sweet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37QU6AHFU17G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AOHDMFE#wasThisHelpful","R37QU6AHFU17G","AIH41FDX1K0Z4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIH41FDX1K0Z4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Julianna has an older brother who was in an accident and now needs a lot of medical attention that she can not afford by just being a waitress.  Boston tells Julianna that her brother will get the best medical attention money can buy but in return she gives him her body.Boston is 10 years older than Julianna.  Boston comes off as a jerk.

"I just finished THE AUSTRALIAN  by Lesley Young and really liked it so I picked up THE FRENCHMAN.  I am so glad I read THE AUSTRALIAN first before THE FRENCHMAN.  I would never would have read another book by Lesley Young if I read this book first.  The heroine, Fleur, moved to France after finally being reunited with her birth mother. Her first week in France, she meets Louis who is a big rugby star.  Fleur is a virgin but is desperate to lose her virginity and her first week in France, she meets Louis. Fleur says she feels passion like never before and wants to give it up for Louis except Louis puts the brakes on it.  Fleur just annoyed me.  She appears desperate even though she tried to appear as she was not. Louis treated her poorly that first night they met, but she was still willing to give it up to him since he was soooo good looking. Not sure what to think about that...There are snippets of Louis coming off as ""nice"" but for every nice, you got a lot of pages of attitude from him.  I love bad boys, but Louis to me came off as such a jerk in the first 25% that I could not get over his attitude and Fleur's ""desperation"".Fleur has the annoying and slutty BFF.

"I loved the first half of this book. I love quirky heroines and I loved the mystery behind the hero. I would have given this book 4.5/5 stars but at 75%, the book took a turn for me.  I did not like the decisions the heroine made.I loved how they played ""do you know how much I liked you?""As I mentioned, I really loved this book until 75% or so.  It reminded me of Penny Reid's Neanderthal Seeks Human and Janie.  It was the same, but different. I loved Janie in Neanderthal and all her quirky behavior so when I started reading this and saw how quirky Charlie was as well, I really got into the story.  However, the decisions that Charlie made felt wrong to me and that is when I disconnected.Spoiler below:What ruined it for me at 75% Part of me understood her wanting to protect her friend, B, but on the other hand her siding with the cops just felt wrong.

"Lindsey, the heroine, just annoyed me.  Spoiled rich girl with huge trust fund.  Why any man would want to actually keep her after they had sex with her was a mystery. Not sure why Dimitris would want her or Brody. One of my favorite statements in the book that was made to Lindsey which was along the lines of ""good luck to any man that can handle attitude 24/7"".  T I am not even sure why she had such attitude all the time.  Nothing ever made her happy.  Plus she had that attitude of ""I can do what ever I want to do whenever I feel like it."" Dimitris asked Lindsey to wear a bra...out of respect when dining with his family and she could not even do that.  It was ""Me this. Me that."" loc 18%The attitude became redundant.

"3.5/4 StarsI have had this book in my Kindle library forever.  I was in a mood for a clean romance...no erotica, no detailed sex scenes.  I just wanted a love story.  This one was one also that had a second chance theme which is one of my favorite genres.Where do I begin.Josie is 13 and Sam was 18.  They were friends who talked, read, and listened to music on the bus to and from school.  I loved these scenes.  Josie always knew that Sam wanted to be a marine so after graduation, he left. She wrote to him, but after some time, Sam stopped writing to Josie.10 years later Sam is back.This is where I would have liked one chapter in Sam's POV.  I do not care for dual POVs, but I was so frustrated with Sam sometimes. I just wanted to know for one or two paragraphs how he felt. Many times, his attitude was ""I love you and I do not want you with anyone else, but I have to go away again and leave you here.""  My heart always broke for Josie who did everything for everyone, but when would it be her turn to have someone give everything to her?  I liked this book a  lot.  The author does an amazing job connecting you to the characters, to the town, to the story.  However, I wish I would have gotten more of Sam going after Josie.  Josie was just so easy to forgive and to accept what little people gave her.  I want some one to fight for her. I never felt that from Sam.  Sam was genuine and I know he loved Josie, but it is like he always knew that she would be there.  Sam was very kind and towards the end there are some revelations, but I have to say that even at 95%, I had no idea how this book was going to end. The epilogue was beautiful.I would recommend this book. It was a very nice read and a break from the continuous releases of erotica which I am getting tired of.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25NWPY7BRK3ZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007VT7JN4#wasThisHelpful","R25NWPY7BRK3ZX","AIH41FDX1K0Z4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIH41FDX1K0Z4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really love stories when the nerdy girl catches the eye of the popular guy.I first got the sample of this book, read it, liked it and clicked buy for $3.99.  Thinking back, not sure it was worth $3.99. The story was nice.  The characters were okay.  Tripp is not your possessive, alpha jerk.  He had had a hard time/life at home.  Hadley assumed he had it all when he really didn't.  She made assumptions like everyone else about him even thought she should have known better since people at school made assumptions about her.What I did not understand and why the author wrote Hadley's character to always be annoyed by her little step-siblings.  It made her appear very cold.  This threw me off about her and I hated the scenes where she would complain about something so juvenile.I liked the story, but I think there were moments where the execution could have been better. That ""something"" was missing and days after reading this book, I still can't put my finger on it. It is written in dual POVs - first person.  I think it would have been better if the switch did not happen every other chapter.  I knew what each of the characters were thinking at every moment. I like the intensity of not knowing sometimes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17V128BGLMV2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E3OVI8W#wasThisHelpful","R17V128BGLMV2L","AIH41FDX1K0Z4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIH41FDX1K0Z4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And the hero has a ""girlfriend"" that he wants to break up with but before either of them ""break up"" their relationships with their partners, they have sex.

"I could not connect. Holli goes to a business thingy in Vegas meets Jack Dalton while trying to buy a drink at the bar. She has sex with him. This is not Holli's first one night stand and she admits that to him, but he is okay with it. Not sure how any guy wants to hear that you have had a few one night stands and hear you talk about the walk of shame, but to each its own.  Later Holli finds out that Jack Dalton is not who he said he was, but the lead singer of one of the hottest bands and goes by the name Johnny Outlaw.

"I bought this because I thought it would be funny, cute and romantic.  The beginning was funny, but then it got awkward and many of the scenes just made me cringe.The fact that Rosie at 23 years old was that naive to sex and a penis was ridiculous.  I could believe the fact that she was a virgin because of her upbringing, but the restno.  There is Google and porn.I regret buying this book for $3.99.  I saw all the amazing reviews, but this humor is not for me.So many scenes in this book were so uncomfortable.  Below are spoilers.#1 - When Rosie farted on one of her dates while he was giving her oral.#2  When she threw up on the one guy while trying to give him oral.#3  It got annoying when Rosie continued called her vagina, Virginia.

I did not like (even though he was drunk) that he called one of his many dates,  Rindy one of the hottest pieces of a** he had seen in the longest time.

"My opinion and has some small spoilers, but not about the ending.  Just what made me not connect to the characters.Here are my thoughts.I was excited to read this one but I am tired of the annoying BFF that pushes her friend to have sex with a stranger. (The friend can tell by the guy's looks that he is not a serial killer?!?!)  I just did not feel the connection. I mean what was it about the Chloe that had Max so taken by her? Was she that beautiful?? What made her so beautiful??? I mean he barely spoke two sentences to her before she pushed herself down his cock.  How did he know she was all ""innocence and seduction""?  She was at a bar attending a bachelorette party?!?!  Written in dual POVs so you know what each character is thinking at all times. It is probably all me and may work for you.  Honestly.  You should probably give it a try. I love when couples meet at  bar, but this one had no connection for me before they went and did it minutes after meeting.The heroine meets a stranger at a bar at her BFF's bachelorette party.

I have had this book in my Kindle forever and decided to get the whispersync.I did not like this book at all and was extremely bored.  Both of these characters were very insecure.  By the time all the information about the heroine was provided, I did not care.

"I loved the broody Garth in the previous books and I could not think of anyone better for Garth than Josie. However, I dont know how to say exactly what I thought without giving too much away.  Therefore this will be short and to the point, I hope.In the beginning of this book, Garth is reminiscing about his love for Josie.  He loves her.  He sees only her even though he has women wanting his attention all the time.  He sends others to pretend to be him so that he does not have to deal with his crazy fan club.  I love when the hero only loves and sees the beauty in the heroine.  When Garth finally feels that he is out of the darkness that he has been in for a long time, something happens and takes Garth back to that dark place.Nicole Williams is an amazing writer. My problem is that for me this was predictable and I was expecting more.  I did want emotions and angst and drama, but I did not want to see Garth go back to his self-destructive pattern.  I did not blame him for the way he felt, but I was a bit annoyed with it all.  Garth was again feeling his worthlessness.  His behavior at times was so stupid, so selfish.  Why cant he ever just step back and think how his behavior impacts others?  Honestly, I just did not want Josie to go through this with Garth; maybe less attention on Garth and more on Josie. If Josie and Garths relationship needed to be tested, maybe there should have been something that Josie went through.  Josie being so sweet does everything to give Garth everything as do their friends, Jesse and Rowen.  Garths bad temper and mood was a just a repeat of what I had seen before and all of it was predictable.I have been a fan of Nicole Williams for a long time.

It is 100 pages.First I am glad that I did not know a thing about this book before I read it.  There is a little twist (not sure even to call it that) but I was surprised by that information.I am not sure if I felt that intense connection between Erin Easter and Weston.  This was not bad.  I just felt it was missing something.  I love these stories.  Erin Easter has been bullied for the past 9 years by the other Erins in her grade.  Erin Easter more or less takes care of her absent druggie of a mother.

"3.5 StarsK. Bromberg is an amazing writer. The Driver series with Ry and Colt is one of my top 5 favorite series of all time. From the first book to book 3, the story never slowed.  There was an equal amounts of compassion, love, angst, and drama ad none of it felt dull.I was excited to read SLOW BURN mostly because it was written by K. Bromberg.  I never really thought much of Ry and Colts best friends Haddie and Beck, but I remembered them having  that friendly flirty, and fun but I am not sleeping with you attitude.  I wanted to see what their journey would be.Haddies sister just died of cancer.  Haddie thinks she may be carrying the same cancer gene that killed her sister.  She swore she would never get close to anyone. She saw her sister die and then to watch how her sisters husband watched his wife go through treatments and then die was too much. She did not want to put anyone through that pain.  The night of Colt and Rys wedding, Haddie and Beck agree to one night no strings attached.  However, both of them are surprised by how that one night felt like so much more.  In SLOW BURN, Haddie and Beck play the game of we made an agreement of no strings attached, but now all I do is think about you, but not going to be the first one to tell you and I have to admit, that bothered me.  In SLOW BURN, there are a lot of misunderstandings. Haddie has an ex-boyfriend who keeps coming around.  Beckett stating that he really does not want to slow down even though he gets jealous the minute he thinks that Haddie is back with the ex.  Then we have Haddie worrying about possibly caring the cancer gene, but not wanting to have anyone worry with her.The writing as always was 10 stars. I just wish that the switch in POVs was not so frequent.  Colt and Ry stood out.  I just felt like Haddie was still just a secondary character.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S3F5D8LIGWOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNN7HLW#wasThisHelpful","R2S3F5D8LIGWOT","AIH41FDX1K0Z4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIH41FDX1K0Z4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 StarsThis was not a bad book.  I just wish I was given a little more background or something that would give me a stronger connection to the characters.  One flashback would have done the job.The sexual tension was high.I love that even though the characters have known each other for 6 months, they are not having sex the minute we meet them.  Clay and the group of men he works with are bodyguards of sorts for Haileys family.  Haileys father and sister had recently gotten into some problems which have brought media attention to not only them but the rest of the family.  Hailey, unlike her father and sister, stays out of trouble.  Clay thinks Hailey is beautiful, sexy, innocent, and too good.  Hailey thinks Clay is hot and very bad, but she cant stop thinking about him.  Hailey is a good person, but when the phrase innocent is used to describe Hailey, I am not sure I agree.

"3.5 StarsBook 2 in the Cold Fury series.Garrett has the money and any woman he wants.  Garrett sees Olivia at a party and she blows him away.  However, Olivia is not interested.  She has other things to worry about like how to overcome her cancer. When Garrett finds out about Olivia, he wants to be the man she needs and not the womanizer that he has a reputation of being.  Olivia feels guilty and selfish for starting anything with Garrett because of the cancer.It was very sweet romance even though it was an insta-love, insta-attraction type of story.Even though I enjoyed the story, I found myself bored at certain parts of the book.  There is something that happens in the book but it came and went.  When I finished I thought to myself that is it??

"You need to read HE FOUND ME before you read HE SAVED ME. This is a series that must be read in order.I loved HE FOUND ME and was anxious to read the sequel.  Whitney Barbetti did not disappoint. Andra has had a very difficult life with running and then trying to keep all her secrets close.  Since Andras mother passed away and she was left with an abuser which put her in a place of darkness and constant danger.  In HE SAVED ME, Julian and Andra reunite, but Andra is terrified that she putting Julian in danger.  She knows she has one choice and that is to face the evil.  Some of her actions could have been seen as stupid or courageous.  What would you do to protect the one you love?How romantic and sexy if Julian???I liked the characters and Andras story in HE FOUND ME, but fell in love with them in HE SAVED ME.  Andra is the perfect heroine.  Kind, but strong at the same time.  There is heat between these characters, but more than physical, it is emotional.  There is a twist, suspense and romance in this gem.We get a glimpse at the secondary characters, Mira and Six.  Mira is a strong, but she is angry.  Clearly having had suffered through some type of abuse, she is still very protective. You have to admire her and Six. Mira and Six will have their own story in Whitneys next book SIX FEET UNDER.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7IGJ9BIUBEUY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R4SBSW0#wasThisHelpful","R7IGJ9BIUBEUY","AIH41FDX1K0Z4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIH41FDX1K0Z4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Three brothers  Jax, Donovan and Sean.The Morrow FamilyBillion Dollar Bachelor  The premise was there, the characters were all set up but in the end all I kept thinking was that it lacked something.  No matter how much I tried I could not get emotionally attached.I loved these types of stories: Jax Morrow is a dangerously handsome, spectacularly wealthy entrepreneur whose world is turned upside down when Pandora Garret walks into a dark, smoky bar one nighta stunning combination of sex and innocence. He knows shes trouble at first sight, but Jax cant let her leaveunless shes leaving with him.I felt indifferent to Jax and Pandoras relationship.Billion Dollar Bad Boy - The face of the Morrow company, Donovan Morrow is the ultimate Trojan. But despite his giftsin the boardroom and the bedroomhe always comes in second to his big brother, Jax. Until Victoria de Winter, a sexy and brilliant corporate rival, enters the picture and proves that sometimes, the biggest challenges offer the best rewards.This story left me wanting more and feeling disappointed that it was cut short. I felt I was not given enough to connect. I rather have a great introduction to the characters and have opportunities to connect, but it felt like something was missing in this story again.THE BILLIONAIRE BIKER - Wild and reckless, and more at ease with his biker gang than his business partners, Sean Morrow has always longed for Abigail Prescott, whose life he ruined when an innocent friendship turned into a night of red-hot passion back when they were in high school. Now that his brother, Jax, has decided to hire Abby to work for the Morrows, Sean can no longer ignore his old demonsor his desire.I was so excited to get to this story the most.  I love these type of friendship turned to so much more in one night stories. Sean and Abby shared passion until Sean left.  Abby never understood and therefore held a lot of hurt.  Sean took Abbys virginity all those years leaving with no explanation and feeling he was not worthy.These are quick stories.

"I loved the initial meeting between Julia and Geo.  Also I love the way Julie handled the rich lady in the clothing boutique.  Julia was just a great heroine.  I love heroines like her and I hope when I read more of Ruth Cardello's books her other heroines have as big of hearts as Julia's.I do think that Come Away with Me needs a sequel.  I feel that Geo and Julia's story just ended.  There are so many unresolved issues like Geo's mother and how she feels about Julia. Plus, I want to know about Julia's business and her parents.  I want to see Geo meet her parents and maybe see their love since he never saw that with his parents.  Plus, I want to know how Geo handled his mother when he came back to the States. And I want angst with some awesome groveling on Geo's part.Sidenote: I feel like I missed a chapter because it was never explained in the story how Geo found out how his mother propositioned Julia.  Plus who is the new investor of the furniture store???My only disappointment with the story itself was that I feel that the angst in the story ended too quickly.  Julia was too easy to say ""okay, Geo."" I do not want to give away anything, but I wanted Geo begging.  Julia should have made him sweat. I feel like Geo did not realize his own mistake in the situation until it was pointed out to him  I love a man who grovels and there was not enough groveling for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IB0AXOUOA2ZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J0CAR16#wasThisHelpful","R1IB0AXOUOA2ZO","AIH41FDX1K0Z4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIH41FDX1K0Z4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a nice NA college story.  Yes, it was probably one that was done a hundred times, but I there was something about the characters and the writing that I really enjoyed. The heroine was not a virgin, but not a slut either.  It seems like those are harder to find more and more in NA stories.Scarlett has social anxiety.  She is asked to tutor Tucker, the star soccer player at her university.  Tucker has a reputation of getting what he wants when he wants it.  At first Scarlett does not want to do it, but feels forced since it means money for the math department. Slowly, a friendship starts and I loved that this was not insta-love. I loved that the secrets that each character kept secret were NOT revealed until the very end and what was held until the end was necessary for the story. The scenes when they were training and would talk (Q&A) were my favorite.  There was so much more to these characters than they showed to the public.  I never read anything by Denise Swank before and I know after  listening to AFTER MATH  I will.I am not sure if I will read the next book in the series, REDESIGNED. It is about  Scarlett's BFF, Caroline.  I am not sure how I feel about Caroline.  She had her own dating issues, but seemed to have to many opinions about Scarlett's. I know that Caroline was probably just overprotective of Scarlett, but sometimes her attitude annoyed me. She was so judgmental.  Caroline seemed like a girl that liked to party at bars.  I see that Redesigned has great reviews, but I think I will need to take a break and forget about Caroline for a little bit. However, her others books look interesting, plus I love the book trailers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33Y1JJHZ0RA50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BSIPO7W#wasThisHelpful","R33Y1JJHZ0RA50","AIH41FDX1K0Z4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIH41FDX1K0Z4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The heroine was the problem in this story. First she made this ridiculous promise (about the land) to her dead husband that she did not even love two years ago when he dead. However, she has no problem breaking a promise to her friend and Cameron's mother. Then she says ridiculous things to Cameron that she has to take it slow because of the memory of her dead husband AND remember this is not this is the husband that she did not even love...ever. Cameron was the one that she thought of for all those years. And then there are other ridiculous comments but I do not want to give those away. I do not know why Cameron even wanted to be with her.

"4.5 StarsThis book started around two years after Katia left Marcus.  I do not want to give too much away so I will keep the review short.Katia had left Marcus when she found out that the only reason he married her was so he could obtain his grandfathers business.  This left Katia broken.  She left making it impossible for Marcus to locate her.  Katia is having a hard time surviving while working as a waitress, but she is determined to have nothing to do with Marcus.  I usually get annoyed when the author switchs characters POVs frequently, but this was done perfectly.  Chapter after chapter the flow and pace of the story was smooth, controlled, and engaging.There is a lot of angst.  I felt all the emotions of Katia and Marcus.  I felt what Katia was feeling.  I felt all her anger, all her hate, all her angst, all that pain.  I felt her desperation for peace from what she was feeling.  My heart raced with anticipation of what was going on.It is important that Till Death Volume One be read first.

"I love stories that take place in boarding schools.  So when I saw that Night School is a thriller that place in a boarding school in England, I was excited.First this is not a paranormal.  This is a YA story that has some strange things that happen throughout the story, but it is explained later.  Sixteen year old Allie has gotten in trouble time and time again since her brother has gone missing.  Her parents have had enough and thought the best solution was to send her to a boarding school that would be able to help her.  When Allie arrives to Cimmeria Academy she is immediately instructed to learn the rules and guidelines.  After sometime Allie does not hate Cimmeria as much as she thought she would.  She makes friends as well as catches the eye of two boys, Sylvain and Carter.  There are a lot of strange things that occur at Cimmeria Academy.  There is a Night School that takes place that no one discusses.  As more and more strange things occur, Allie wants to know what goes in at night.Allie is an okay heroine. I felt indifferent to her. I am not sure how or why she caught the attention of supposedly the two most wanted boys on campus.  Sylvain and Carter were both boys that had reputations, but I never saw it and it felt like it was forced into the story to cause drama.There were a few things that made no sense even after I got some of the facts. At certain times throughout the book, Allie speaks of her gut not to trust this person and then she would trust them.While I was reading, I even tried hunting for spoilers hoping that it would draw me back to the story.  However, every time I stopped and picked the book back up hoping that something would grab me, nothing would.  The love triangle between Sylvain and Carter is there, but everything is a rumor.  I got bored with nothing being relieved until almost 75% of the book.As I mentioned I was excited to read this, but to say it dragged is an understatement. Every chapter felt like a repeat of the previous one.  I understand when an author is trying to build suspense before the big revolution is given, but once I found out what was going on in the Night School, it was not that exciting to me.A copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PRS0PZ45NS9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QTVTEDI#wasThisHelpful","R1PRS0PZ45NS9M","AIH41FDX1K0Z4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIH41FDX1K0Z4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A nice sweet short story.  Great for a Sunday afternoon read.At first I was nervous that Cinda was going to be too masculine of a heroine for me.  I love stories about girls who think they are the ugly duckling when in fact they are the opposite, but I like the heroine to be feminine as well and some of the descriptions Cinda sounded like she was not very girly.  The heroine does not have to dress in high heels or wear flashy clothes or even have a ton of make-up for me to think and feel that she is feminine, but has to have some feminine qualities besides being attracted to men. This is a personal preference in the stories I read.Cinda is very smart and is a double major in engineering.  She has a sister who has always been the pretty one while Cinda was always the smart one. Even though Cinda loves her sister, she has always felt like second best.  When Cinda catches the eye of Blake at first she is leery and avoids his advances, but Blake is not so quick to give up.Putting Cindas attitude aside, I could not stop reading and truthfully read the story in two sittings.  However, the angst or revolution in this book bothered me. I do not want to give away any spoilers, but when I found out the truth, I noticed myself disconnecting.  Personally, I dont think I could have forgiven or gotten over the revolution. It felt wrong and the wrong person, in my opinion, was apologizing. I wish I could say more.The flow of the story was very good. It is a short read.  Things move along very quickly.

"DNF at 45%I have loved J.M. Darhower other books, but no matter how many times I picked this one up and tried to like it, I could not connect or get into the story.  When I bought this book, I was so excited to start reading it.  I love paranormals with angels and demons and especially stories where the angel falls for the demon.  However, this one was not for me.First, I could have done without the intimate details between Serah and Michael.  When Serah visits Luce to make him stop the war and Luce tells her to go back because he can not handle the smell of Michael on her, I AGREED. She smelled like sex from Michael and went to negotiate with Luce about the war?!?! I did not need the detail of the sex between Michael and Serah in the open flower fields. UGH. I could have done without that whole visual not once but twice.  When I read a story, I do not details of the characters' sex life if it is not between the hero and heroine. And I thought Serah was supposed to be a good angel and she is sneaking off with Michael?!?!So when I thought Serah was finally opening up her eyes and seeing Michael for what he was, the story dragged.  There were scenes that I did enjoy like when Serah would sit with the one family at dinner.  However, the scenes I actually enjoyed were few and far between.This just did not work for me.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVI95882HHK64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D614EUW#wasThisHelpful","RVI95882HHK64","AIH41FDX1K0Z4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIH41FDX1K0Z4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dana Marton writes the best kind of romantic suspense.  Her stories contain complex characters with lots of action and Flash Fire is no exception.Clara Roberts is tasked by her father to find a missing young woman.  Light Walker is a former SEAL who now works for others to further his own quest: find his brothers killer.Light is supposed to help Clara find her missing person but his own agenda keeps getting in the way.  He feels he is beyond redemption and fights his attraction to Clara.  Clara likes who she is but doesnt feel that she is really attractive to men.  She is not the type that Light usually goes for but he admires her tenaciousness and finds himself falling for her.  Clara is horrified by some of the things she witnesses Light do but gradually comes to understand why he is the way he is.This story has many twists and turns and thoroughly captivated me; once I started reading it I couldnt put it down.

"This is the first book Ive read by Tracy Ewens but now I plan to read more of her books.  I received an ARC of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.The heroine, Kate, is difficult to like at first.  However, as the story moved along I came to understand why she acts the way she does.  In the beginning the hero, Grady, comes off as a devil-may-care, immature playboy.  Both of these characters have a lot more going on than what you first see on the surface.Kates ex-husband cheated on her so she no longer trusts her judgment in men.  Grady felt abandoned by his father as a child because it always seemed that his career was more important than family.I found Candidate to be an entertaining story with well developed, complex characters.  When Kate and Grady finally get together everything seems great but the author wrote a conflict that I probably should have seen coming but I didnt.  Not to worry, this is a love story so there is an HEA but getting there was sometimes heartbreaking.I have to note that I found one error that stood out to me.  A reference was made to Monday, Election Day in Chapter 36.

"I received an ARC of this book from the publisher via NetGalley - correction, not NetGalley it was from Hot New Books in exchange for an honest review but I also purchased the book because I loved it.I dont often purchase the books that I receive for review but this was such as wonderful story that I wanted to support this author by purchasing a copy.Ive never read any books by Lucy Score but I do have one in my TBR pile that Im going to move up higher.  This story touched all of my emotions; which is my favorite kind of romance.  At times I laughed out loud and at other times I had tears running down my face.This is a complex story, with well-developed characters.  While the Hero is in the National Guard the military aspect of this isnt the front and center focus.  The author does a wonderful job of concealing certain things from us and unveiling them slowly throughout the story.  Both the H and h have had bad things happen to them in the past.  Having the details unfold slowly kept the story interesting; I didnt want to put it down.If you love a very strong, [I hate it when I make typos!] kick-a$$ not kiss-a$$ heroine and a tortured, sometimes a**hole, protective Hero you should buy this book.

"I have to admit  some parts of this story made me a little uncomfortable, but reading the story was totally worth it.  Ive never read a book about a male sub before and it took me a bit to let go of my notion that the male is always the dominant.  Roni Loren treated this subject with great respect just as she has all of her other stories.Gibson (Gib) and Samantha (Sam) met at the Ranch where Gib helped train her as a Domme.  During their training Sam saw the submissive tendencies come out in Gib and wanted to explore that side of him and dominate him but Gib couldnt handle it and walked away from her.  He is ashamed of his submissive feelings and thinks there is something wrong with him wanting to be beaten and dominated; he thinks others will feel he is less of a man if they find out.Both Sam and Gib believe the things they endured during their childhood have influenced their sexual proclivities.  Gibs father beat and humiliated him and once he discovered he enjoyed that during sex play he felt ashamed because he hated what his father did to him.  Sam was nearly raped by another girl when she was young and now she needs to be dominant.  When Gib tells her how ashamed and embarrassed he is by his desire to be dominated she helps him to see that it doesnt have anything to do with his father.This was a very emotional story for me.  I felt so bad for both Sam and Gib but particularly for Gib.  He wants so badly to love and be with Sam the way she wants him to be but he just cant get past the feeling that it makes him less of a man.The writing, as always, is richly descriptive and makes me totally lose myself in the story.  It was nice to catch glimpses of characters from previous books in the Loving on the Edge series.  While this book can easily be read as a standalone you might enjoy it more if youve already read the other books in the series.Roni Lorens stories always have an HEA but getting to this one for Sam and Gib really tugged on my emotions.  I was happy that Pike put in an appearance and provided a bit of comic relief during a part that was particularly difficult for Gib.Roni Loren sure packed a lot of stuff into this novella and I loved it!I received an ARC of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R132EHVMNJAD9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISEOM2C#wasThisHelpful","R132EHVMNJAD9G","A2RXWEXESDH2NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RXWEXESDH2NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive had a hard time writing this review.  I think there are many reasons for that and a couple of them are: I love this serial so much and didnt want to see it end; there are some really mind boggling things that happen in this episode and Im having a hard time sorting things out in my mind.  I finished reading this book more than a week ago and still feel overwhelmed by it all  in a good way.Reading this series has been worth every cliffhanger as Blair Babylon delivers a fantastic story.  When Georgie was kidnapped at the end of episode three I wondered how Blair could possibly finish this series with only one more book.  Well, the way she did it was by writing an epic story over 350 printed pages long.As the book blurb says, Georgie didnt want Xan to try to find her because Tatiana Butorin, the Russian who kidnapped her, has threatened to kill him if he does.  Of course, that doesnt stop Xan.  This part of the story is heartbreaking and I couldnt believe what I was reading; I just couldnt wrap my mind around it.  Im not putting in any spoilers; youll have to read it for yourself.  All this happened in just the first 10% of the book!This story left me with a book hangover for days.  All I can say is: Blair Babylon is a master storyteller.  The way she has connected the characters in her BID: Rae, BID: Lizzy and BID/RID: Georgie and Xan series is incredible and yet each of them can be read independently of the others.Its been a wild ride with Georgie and Xan, Ms. Babylon.  Im not sure that you can ever top the Georgie and Xan stories but I cant wait until your next book/series comes out so I can find out.  Thank you for many wonderful hours of reading enjoyment.I received an early copy of this book from the author for review but I also pre-ordered my own copy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X9ABBTSSCWN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013AOYTV8#wasThisHelpful","R1X9ABBTSSCWN0","A2RXWEXESDH2NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RXWEXESDH2NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first book Ive ever read by Laura Lee and I loved it.  No one could be more surprised than I was when I discovered that I really enjoy reading New Adult stories.  Im over 50 you see and I just didnt think those types of stories would hold my interest.  Boy was I wrong.  In the last year or so Ive found several authors whose NA books Ive loved and now I can add Laura Lee to that list.I picked this book up on a whim when NetGalley sent an email offering a review copy.  I read a lot of ARCs and I keep telling myself that I have to cut back so that I can find time to read books I pick just for me but the description for this one was just too tempting.  Add that to the fact that the book was already out so I could read it at my own pace and not feel any pressure to get it read and reviewed by release day and I just had to download it.  Boy am I glad I did.I read this book in one sitting and blocked out everything else while I read it.  I love how the book starts out with Part One: The College Years with one chapter for freshman, sophomore, and junior years with Devyn and Riley taking turns at telling the story.  We get just enough of a glimpse into each year without so many details as to be boring.  Senior year gets 12 chapters because this is where the meat of the story for part one is.We already know from the book blurb that something big happens between them and that they meet again 5 years later.  Its not hard to guess what the big thing is but that doesnt matter.  The compelling part of the story for me was the friends to lovers trope and the connection that Riley and Devyn have yet either dont know it or just decide to ignore it until THE night.This story had me laughing out loud in places to the extent that my husband made me read passages to him so he could know what made me laugh so hard.  I also cried (not unusual for me when reading a good story) for the heartbreak that both Riley and Devyn go through before they get to their HEA.As with most NA stories Ive read, this one contains a liberal amount of four letter words.  If that offends you move on to something else or read it and dont complain in a review how there was too much bad language.  The author is upfront about the story containing an overflowing swear jar.I look forward to reading more books by this author.I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AJAGTUSQEMS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZEM1OZY#wasThisHelpful","R2AJAGTUSQEMS9","A2RXWEXESDH2NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RXWEXESDH2NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Chase Marsden, former playboy, now lives on the ranch he inherited from his grandfather.  He had to spend 2 years there in order to inherit but now he loves living there.  Hes befriended Sadie Lovely, a women with a past who is 15 years older, and credits her with helping him pull his life together.  Sadies daughter died recently and she is now raising her grandson, Jake.  Strange accidents have been happening to Sadie and Jake so Chase has hired Covert Cowboys Inc. to help provide protection for Sadie and Jake until they can figure out whats going on.Kate Rivers is a former Texas Ranger, hurt on the job and medically retired.  Now working for CCI, she has been sent her to provide the protection Chase requested for Sadie.  She arrives in town just in time to witness a car running down Chase and Sadie.  Chase has Kate come stay at his ranch while Sadie is in the hospital so she can help protect Jake.  Chase is unaware of what happened when Kate was injured and doesnt know why she cant be around kids.This story held my interest right from the beginning.  Kate and Chase are attracted to each other but things dont really escalate too quickly.  As they learn more about each other Kate finally trusts Chase enough to tell him her secret and he opens up about his former playboy lifestyle.Theres a lot of mystery and suspense in this story and there are plenty of suspects to choose from.  The mark of s good mystery is not being able to figure out whodunit to early on and I didnt guess the right one at all  which was great!  I thought the story unfolded at a nice pace, not too fast and not too slow.Although this book is part of the Cover Cowboys Inc. series you dont need to have read any of the other ones to enjoy this book.  If youve been reading the series you will be happy that characters from earlier books make brief appearances in this one.Books by Elle James always provide me with an enjoyable escape and this one was a great way to spend a few hours away from my normal life.  :-)I received an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R243BR6RTYOKWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0263253244#wasThisHelpful","R243BR6RTYOKWS","A2RXWEXESDH2NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RXWEXESDH2NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How to Train Your Skjaldmaer by Delilah DevlinTorvald was promised one of Hagars daughters a wife; one so fair roses blushed in dismay but what he got instead was one with a tall angular frame and ruddy complexion. Hagar had pulled a switch on him. It didnt take Torvald long to realize he much preferred Solveig to her sister.Solveig wasnt meek and didnt dress like a maiden but Torvald was intrigued by her. She was strong of body and will; qualities that would serve him well; a ladys skills could be taught.This is a short story but Delilah Devlin is adept at creating a complete picture with few words. Reading how Torvald and Solvi interact with each other is steamy and entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed this story.I purchased the Conquests anthology where this story first appeared.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BIV49ZMHKIBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016TIJ88G#wasThisHelpful","R1BIV49ZMHKIBX","A2RXWEXESDH2NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RXWEXESDH2NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the first book I've read by Cat Johnson and I can't wait to read the rest in this series.  I read some of the negative reviews... give me a break!  This is romantic fiction and in novella length there just isn't time to go into great depth.  If you are looking for that then go somewhere else.  There is action, romance and passion with hot, sexy men and steamy scenes.

"This is the 7th book in the Covert Cowboys, Inc. series but you wont be lost at all if you havent read any of the others.  This is a complete story with an HEA.Reggie lost her husband a year ago to an accident and was left with their young son to raise.  She is determined to hold on to the ranch her husband inherited so it can be passed down to their son.Angus lost most of his right leg while serving his country.  As a result of his injury he feels less of a man and is surprised when he is hired by CCI.  His first assignment is to act as a ranch hand for Reggie while at the same time providing protection without her knowledge.  There have been too many accidents on the ranch and her foreman, CW, recruited help from his friend Hank Derringer, the owner of CCI.This was an engaging and suspenseful story.

"I love all of the Night Fall books but this one is particularly hot and steamy!  There was also a big surprise for me in it.  Maybe I just wasnt paying close attention but I was caught off guard and I loved it.  Max doesnt like vampires at all.  He meets Pia and the attraction is swift and mutual.  Only after theyve done the nasty does he find out who/what she is (thats not the surprise I mentioned above).This book was fast paced and kept my attention throughout.  Although you dont need to read the other books in this series to enjoy this one, they are great.  I personally prefer to read a series in order, even if the books are standalones.

"This review is for Bound by the Viking by Anne Marsh as it's the only story I've had a chance to read so far.Although this book is part of a series you don't need to have read the other books to enjoy this one.  Colden is on a mission to prevent the assassination of Odin.  He meets Bera, a fairly new werewolf, and rescues her from the one who turned her and is now holding her captive.  When he spots her his bear says ""this one is ours"" and it shakes him up; he's not ready to take a mate but apparently his bear is.  He also realizes the he's met Bera before.Bera just wants to get away from the pack where she's been held captive for about a year.  She has knowledge about the planned assassination of Odin and agrees to help Colden in exchange for her freedom.  This was an interesting story that kept my attention throughout.  While there is no cliffhanger I do wish that it hadn't ended quite so abruptly.I was provided an early copy of this story by the author in exchange for a review but I also purchased the boxed set so I can read the stories by the other great authors, may of whom I am familiar with.

"I keep saying that Delilah Devlin is the queen of short, naughty stories and this one doesnt change my mind one bit!Zoe and Grayson are step-siblings and Trace is their boss.  I normally dont enjoy the step stories because there is too much oh, its wrong, we shouldnt do this in every other paragraph.  Theres none of that in this book!  Zoe and Grayson dont apologize to anyone for their attraction to each other  and boy are they attracted.After attending a party at Traces house Zoe is surprised when she is summoned to his office the next day at work.

"This is the third book in The Boys of Summer series but you dont have to have read the other books to enjoy this one; they all standalone.Gavin King was a hitting star with the Dodgers but he injured his knee and they traded him to the much less desirable New Jersey Sonics.Jessica Hart is a sports therapist for the Sonics and Gavin is assigned to work with her to restore his knee so he can begin playing again.  Jessica doesnt like or date baseball players.Gavin has a girlfriend when he moves to New Jersey but she soon breaks up with him.  There is an attraction between Gavin and Jessica but neither of them is interested in a relationship.  Working together so closely creates sparks that eventually come to a head.I enjoyed this book a lot; it was a nice summer read.  The pace was good and the characters interesting.  If youve read the first two books you will be happy to revisit those characters in this book but you wont be missing anything vital if you havent read them.The Boys of Summer is a good series and I look forward to reading more books from Katie Rose.  Note:  I was given an early copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for my review.

"So far I've only read the two Billionaires in Disguise: Lizzy stories from this boxed set (I've actually read the whole series and it's fantastic!).  I know I will get to the other stories soon but here's my review so far, based on those two stories.  Cliffhanger alert: only the first two episodes of a 4 part serial are contained in the boxed set.We met Lizzy in the Billionaires In Disguise (BID): Rae series but you dont have to have read that series to read this one. Lizzy is somewhat troubled. She thinks she loves the Dom of the Devilhouse but hes in love with Rae.This is a hard book for me to review. Ive read the entire series and loved it. Since I read them all, one right after the other, its a bit difficult to separate one episode from the other.In this episode Lizzy kind of falls for two VERY different men: Theo and Mannix. Before the end of the series she will have to choose between them.The BID: Lizzy books are a bit darker than the Rae books but it fits for Lizzys character. This series is full of sexy and not so sexy times. It is also full of intrigue and some violence. I did not want to stop reading this series once I started.Be warned that there is strong language and some possibly disturbing scenes in this book. There is also a cliffhanger, which I usually hate. I love Blair Babylons books, though so I will read her books with cliffhangers.Episode 2.In this episode we learn more about Lizzys past. We also find that things are getting more and more rough between her and Mannix. This episode contains even more disturbing things than episode 1 but it seems necessary for the overall story.If you read the BID: Rae series, and you want more of her and Wulf, you MUST read BID: Lizzy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33RX3OWDGP6KR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015ELXXM6#wasThisHelpful","R33RX3OWDGP6KR","A2RXWEXESDH2NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RXWEXESDH2NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love books by Roni Loren; every single one of them that Ive read (10 so far, counting novellas).  Her Loving on the Edge (LOTE) series captured my attention from the very beginning.  In some ways I was lucky to discover her books after several of them were already published because I was able to read one right after the other without having to wait for the next one.  Although each book is a standalone, I loved them so much I could hardly wait to finish one so I could start the next.Call On Me is about Pike and Oakley.  Oakleys main focus is taking care of her daughter.  To do that she works two jobs; a respectable day job and a not so respectable night job that only her brother knows about.  Pike, a bad-boy type, is the drummer for a rock band but he is getting tired of the wild night life and all of the groupies that come backstage after a show.Pike meets Oakley meet when he agrees to help with a charity project for the non-profit group she works for.  Their first meeting strikes sparks but not necessarily the good kind.  Pike is confident and a bit cocky and flirtatious.  Oakley had her fill of that type when she was a teenager.  Unfortunately (or not) Oakley must work with Pike on the charity project or risk losing a promotion that will allow her to quit her night job.Oakley does not want to like Pike but she cant seem to help herself.  Its been years since shes been with a man so she decides that shell just have a fling with Pike  no one will get hurt, right?Call On Me is a hot, sexy book with very mild BDSM themes.  If youve read Ronis other LOTE books you know that The Ranch is a BDSM resort and features heavily in the other books.  The Ranch is not at all prominent in this book but the sexy time is still here.If youve read the other LOTE books you wont want to miss this one.  If you havent tried Ronis books yet this would be an excellent one to start with.  I almost guarantee you will want to go back and read the other ones later.I purchased a print copy of this book in an online charity auction; no review was requested or required.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LKYTR20J4UYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQSF6YW#wasThisHelpful","R1LKYTR20J4UYS","A2RXWEXESDH2NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RXWEXESDH2NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, this series was already complete when I started reading it so I didnt have to wait to finish the story.After reading this serial I have come to realize that if the author and story are good enough cliffhangers dont bother me as much as they used to.

"I purchased this set but so far I've only had a chance to read one story: Hellfire Texas by Elle JamesKinsey Phillips is running away from an abusive relationship.  Her car catches on fire and Becket Grayson gets her away from it before it explodes.  They realize that they know each other from growing up together many years ago.  The attraction between Kinsey and Becket cant be denied even though neither of them is looking for a relationship.This book has a lot of suspense and kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end.  The sexy time is hot and steamy.  This is a complete story with no cliffhanger (yay!).

"This is the third episode of Billionaires in Disguise: Georgie and Rock Stars In Disguise: Xan and it does end in a cliffhanger.  I used to hate cliffhangers but I have come to appreciate them when authors I love write books that have them.  No I pretty much just hate books that arent disclosed as having cliffhangers.  Reading this series has been worth every cliffhanger as Blair Babylon delivers a fantastic story.  I really dont know how she manages to weave all of the BID (Rae, Lizzie, Georgie)/RID (Xan) stories together and yet each series can be read without having read the others.Georgie is now part of Killer Valentine and has agreed to perform with them for 3 months.  Xan has promised to keep her safe from the Russian mobsters that have threatened her life.This episode introduces a new character, Peyton, Georgies High School sweetheart.  Peytons character adds a new level of conflict into Georgie and Xans relationship.  We also learn quite a bit more about the complex personalities living in the body of Xan/Alex/Alexandre.The book blurb provides a much better synopsis than I could ever write.  I just want to say that I am completely captivated by Xan and Georgies story and I will be waiting on pins and needles for the final installment.I received an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review but I also purchased a copy because I loved the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GM6J4R4NI7SL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X8OWQSY#wasThisHelpful","R3GM6J4R4NI7SL","A2RXWEXESDH2NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RXWEXESDH2NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This story is part of the Unchartered SEALs series and is connected to Cat Johnsons Hot SEALs series but it is also a stand-alone story. The blurb for the book is accurate so I wont restate it.Wolf and Piper meet at a barbeque his friends are having; Pipe is staying in the house next door. Shes sassy and hes awkward when making small talk with women. Their chemistry is electric and the sexy time between them is hot.If you like stories with lots of hot, sexy time; a strong woman and a hot SEAL you will love this book.

"Ive read a lot of books by Elle James (and Ive read all of her Take No Prisoners books) and I think this one might just be my favorite.  Although this is part of a series, and is also a crossover into Cat Johnsons HOT SEALs series, you dont need to have read any of the other stories in either series to enjoy this one.  This is also a very complete story with an HEA! [OK, I have to mention, though, that this story runs parallel to Elles SEALs Honor story.  That is also a fantastic book so you might want to check it out.]Cory (Reaper) Nipton has suffered a terrible loss while on active duty as a SEAL.  Leigha Fields also suffered a career-ending loss when she was a D.C. police officer.  Leigha has recovered from her injury and started over with a new career as a physical therapist.  She is assigned to Reapers case; her first one where shes working on her own.  Reaper is feeling like hell never be able to function as a worthwhile man again.In spite of it being against the rules, Leigha is deeply attracted to Reaper.  In spite of being engaged, Reaper has never had the feelings for another woman that he has for Leigha.There is action, suspense and heroism, worthy of any SEAL, in this fantastic story.  I fell in love with Reaper and Leigha and Im so happy that Elle finally wrote a story for this fantastic couple.I received an ARC of this story in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UAFZ82BDJJSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0134EZCKG#wasThisHelpful","R1UAFZ82BDJJSF","A2RXWEXESDH2NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RXWEXESDH2NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wont restate the books blurb because it summarizes the story much better than I ever could.  The story is told from alternating points of view and I love that in this type of book.Sparks fly between Jenny and Chance and they have one mind blowing night together.  When pictures from that night hit the tabloids and internet Chance decides to take off again; he and Jenny didnt even exchange last names.When Jenny goes to Chattanooga to look for Chance she finds out why he left home and learns more about the person he is.  While parts of the story seem somewhat unrealistic this is romantic fiction and I read it for what it is  a way to escape reality and this story allowed me to do that for several hours of reading pleasure.Im not really doing justice to this book with my review; sometimes its hard for me to really describe why I like a book.  All I can say about this one is that once I started reading it I couldnt put it down.I have loved all of the other books Ive read by Deanna Roy and this one is no exception.

"So far I've only read three stories from this anthology; my rating is based on those stories. I have purchased the set but ARCs were provided for the three stories I've reviewed below.Always Enough by Molly McClain  5 starsThis is a short, hot story about Tony and Nicole, from Can't Get Enough. I actually think this stands quite well on its own so don't worry if you haven't read Can't Get Enough yet (but you should read it because it's great). Nicole is worried that she and Tony have jumped into their relationship too fast and she's afraid he's going to regret it and/or get tired of her. Nothing could be farther from the truth as you will find out when you read this great story. :-)Kidnapped by Blair Babylon  5 starsIf you've read Blair's Billionaire's in Disguise: Rae you won't want to miss this epilogue. It's a fantastic short story with beloved characters, Rae and Wulf. But be warned, you might want to strangle Blair after you read this one. She is one of the masters of a great cliffhanger. I used to hate books with cliffhangers until I started reading her books. I can't honestly say that I *like* cliffhangers but her writing makes them worth the wait. If you haven't read BID: Rae yet, what are you waiting for?Like Home by Mira Bailee  4 starsThis was a great follow-up story to the Devon Stone series.  I actually think you will enjoy this one even if you havent read the series first.  Olivia is going home for the first time in years and Devon is going with her.  They are attending the wedding of Olivias bestie from high school.  The trip home brings back memories and some unexpected bad vibes from her besties sister and Olivia is perplexed at the animosity.  Theres also an appearance by Olivias old boyfriend that creates some interesting scenes in the story.  I enjoyed this look at whats going on with Olivia and Devon after The Lust List  Devon Stone ended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KWPA7SQMTR9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010II27V8#wasThisHelpful","R1KWPA7SQMTR9Y","A2RXWEXESDH2NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RXWEXESDH2NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This story is connected to the Billionaires in Disguise: Rae series but you dont have to have read that (but you should; its great) to enjoy this short story.This takes place after the end of Billionaires in Disguise: Rae (complete series). Wulfs father didnt approve of his relationship with Rae and that leads to some interesting times in this story. This is a more lighthearted story than BID: Rae and theres a lot of laughing and sexy time. The story also answers some questions that you might have had at the end of BID: Rae.

"This was my first book by Katie Rose and I really enjoyed reading it.  Darcy and Chase were very likeable characters.Darcy is a house-sitter for famous socialite, Lydia Logan.  Lydia is going out of the country so she tells Darcy to take her place at a charity event.  Since the event is hosted by her favorite baseball team, the Sonics, she is excited to go.  At the event she meets her favorite player, Chase Westbrook.  When Chase doesnt want to listen, Darcy just goes on pretending to be Lydia.  Before too long things snowball and Darcy finds herself impersonating Lydia at more events and hanging out with Chase.  She falls hard for him but is in constant fear of what will happen when he finds out how she has been deceiving him.Chase is perplexed by the mixed signals he gets from Darcy/Lydia.  Her public profile paints her as a self-centered, spoiled rich girl.  Yet when they are together he sees many other facets to her personality.  Shes kind to children and she pitches in to help a friend in the kitchen at a social event.  He is falling hard for her.This was a very engaging story with a few twists.  It has an HEA and I was very entertained while finding out how Chase and Darcy managed to resolve all of their problems to get there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NFWA4A5N7SF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IQROC1C#wasThisHelpful","R3NFWA4A5N7SF6","A2RXWEXESDH2NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RXWEXESDH2NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Glutamine is the most common amino acid found in your muscles - over 61% of skeletal muscle is Glutamine. Glutamine consists of 19% nitrogen, making it the primary transporter of nitrogen into your muscle cells.  During intense training, Glutamine levels are greatly depleted in your body, which decreases strength, stamina and recovery. It could take up to 6 days for Glutamine levels to return to normal - and Glutamine plays a key role in protein synthesis. Studies have shown that L-Glutamine supplementation can minimize breakdown of muscle and improve protein metabolism.Purported benefits of L-Glutamine supplementation are:(1) Glutamine has been linked to protein synthesis. It prevents your muscle from being catabolized (eaten up) in order to provide Glutamine for other cells in the body.(2) Glutamine helps maintain cell volume and hydration, speeding up wound and burn healing and recovery.(3) Glutamine benefits you by replenishing declining Glutamine levels during intense workouts.(4) Research has shown Glutamine can help you produce growth hormone levels. A study has shown 2 grams of L-Glutamine increased growth hormones by over 400%.(5) Glutamine may serve to boost your immune system. For bodybuilders, this is important since heavy workouts tend to greatly deplete Glutamine levels. (Glutamine is a primary energy source for your immune system.)(6) Glutamine is one of the most important nutrients for your intestines. It has the ability to 'repair a leaky gut' by maintaining the structural integrity of the bowels.(7) Treating ulcers.Studies have found that 1.6 grams of Glutamine a day had a 92% cure rate in 4 weeks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZUVK7X1VJUYP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E7TMONG#wasThisHelpful","RZUVK7X1VJUYP","AE12OGX5S9PMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE12OGX5S9PMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Erich Von Daniken's book ""Chariots of the Gods"" is a so-called documentary based on wild speculation and lack of imagination.  While piecing together the great mysteries of archaeology and ancient civilization, whenever the author doesn't know the answer, he assumes extra-terrestrials were responsible.  He often says, ""There can be no other explanation,"" effectively shutting down the debate.The presentation is built on the assumption that ancient civilizations were knuckle-dragging morons, incapable of feats of engineering of any kind.  Any impressive work or monument is attributed to a gift from the ancient alien visitors.Of course, the real motive of Chariots of the Gods is to convince people that their ""God"" was nothing more than an alien visitor with impressive technology.  The author cites supernatural events in the Holy Bible to further his E.T. drivel, but doesn't acknowledge that the same Bible states that ancient people were engineers brilliant enough to elicit a response from God (i.e. The Tower of Babel).Every claim in this movie has either been debunked or resolved an explanation other than aliens.

"""As It Is In Heaven"" is about an apocalyptic cult of around 20 members that lives under twisted pseudo-christian theology.  The cult is led by a ""prophet"" who claims knowledge of the end of the world.  Like all cults, nobody in the group knows much about the Bible.  Apparently every member missed the Book of Matthew, which states that no one knows when the end is coming -- not even Jesus -- but the Father alone.

"Here are several arguments put forth by author Matthew Vines:1.  Vines claims that the sin that led to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 18-19) was not homosexuality.  ""The only form of same-sex behavior described is a threatened gang rape,"" Vines argues.  Therefore, it is the author's conclusion that homosexuality was not actually condemned, but rather, the threat of forcible rape, and the other sins mentioned in Ezekiel 16:49.  While it is true that homosexuality was not the sole sin that induced God's wrath, it was certainly a part of it.  We know this because of the clarification given by Jude, which states, ""just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire"" (Jude 7).  Unnatural desires, like homosexuality.2.  Vines claims that the condemnation of homosexuality as an abominable sin in Leviticus 18:22 and Leviticus 20:13 can be ignored because it was part of the Old Testament law.  As Christians know, the Old Testament was fulfilled by Christ (Romans 10:4) and the Law is now obsolete (Hebrews 8:13).  Vines points out that the word ""abomination"" was used to describe other sins that were later lifted by God, such as the prohibition on eating certain foods (Leviticus 11:7-12).  His argument fails because, for one thing, the wording is different in the verses on food compared to the verses on homosexuality.  The prohibition on homosexuality says that ""it is an abomination,"" whereas the prohibitions on eating certain animals were repeated decreed, ""they shall be an abomination TO YOU"" (emphasis added).  In other words, God stated that the former action is an abomination, and the latter action was to be treated as an abomination by the Old Testament Jews.  The parallel between diet restrictions and homosexuality breaks down further after recognizing that the commandments on food were specifically lifted in Acts 10:13, whereas the sinfulness of homosexuality was never lifted.  While the OT Law is no longer a source of righteousness, the character of God has been revealed through it, and God's view of certain actions has not changed.  Christians cannot simply disregard everything from the Old Testament, as Vines seems to imply.  Certain OT prohibitions remain sinful to this day, such as breaking the 10 Commandments, and the engaging in the abomination of homosexuality.3.  Vines claims that the Book of Romans does not condemn homosexuality.  Apostle Paul states, ""Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the same way, the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men and received the due penalty for their error"" (Romans 1:26-27).  Vines argues that ""His description of same-sex behavior is based solely on a burst of excess and lust.""  If only the homosexuals in the passage had been involved in loving, committed gay relationships, then Apostle Paul would have approved, the author asserts.  This argument doesn't pass any logical scrutiny.  If lust was the primary issue, Paul would have taken on that issue directly and given no partiality to heterosexuals or homosexuals.  Instead, Paul identifies ""shameful acts"" occurring between homosexual partners, reaffirming that the ""abomination"" that God condemned in Leviticus has the same moral standing.4.  Vines claims that two more biblical condemnations of homosexuality are misinterpretations (1 Corinthians 6:9-10 and 1 Timothy 1:10). The Greek words ""Malakoi"" and ""Arsenokoitai"" are used in lists of unrighteous characters that will not inherit the kingdom of God.  Vines chooses to deny that these words refer to homosexuals in context and definition, and claims that ""the concept of sexual orientation didn't even exist in the ancient world.""  The author's argument stretches the limits of plausibility and has no historical basis to be stated as fact.  It is quite irrelevant if the ancients had concocted the concept of ""sexual identity"" or not.  The bible is clear that homosexual behavior is ""an abomination"" and a ""shameful act.""It is wise to look to the bible for answers and it is also wise to refer to original Greek language.  But Mr. Vines has put forth a doctrine of immorality, either by ignorance or by deliberate twisting of scripture.  None of his scriptural arguments hold any water.  Vines' personal life is one matter, but his twisted theology is another,  These biblical acrobatics must be shown for the heresies they are, for the sake of others and for the church.  Nearly every book in the New Testament warns about false disciples of Christ spreading deadly lies, and the myth of the ""Gay Christian"" is a prime example.God created man and woman to be together, and declared homosexuality an abomination.  Disciples of Christ must necessarily turn away from sin and walk in obedience to God.  Christianity is incompatible with Gay Pride.  Apostle John tells us, ""No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God. By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother."" (1 John 3:9-10)","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UYRY0PDAR03W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F1W0RD2#wasThisHelpful","R3UYRY0PDAR03W","AE12OGX5S9PMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE12OGX5S9PMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the last 2,000 years, the Apostles of Christ have been viewed less as men, and more as superhuman saints.  This film attempts to humanize the twelve Apostles.  They were, after all, no one special on their own.  They came from humble backgrounds and had all the weaknesses and flaws that we would expect.  The bible does not attempt to hide their failings, doubts, and lack of faith.When read properly, we should notice the very relatable characteristics of the Apostles.  This film is successful at pointing out those features and does so in a responsible way that is true to the bible.  This film features reputable biblical scholars such as John MacArthur, and as such, contains a message that is logical and scipturally sound.I would recommend this movie to anyone who would like to learn (or re-learn) about the Apostles and the early church.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WAJP6RRKIUBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YXXXZE8#wasThisHelpful","R1WAJP6RRKIUBL","AE12OGX5S9PMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE12OGX5S9PMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This movie analyzes several events of the Old Testament and argues that they really happened, except by natural causes instead of miracles.  (Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by the ash from a volcano.  Jericho was destroyed by an earthquake.  The Red Sea was parted by some sort of wind that exposed a patch of earth.)The producers do not appear to be directly attacking the bible, as their conclusion is that it is true.

"According to the movie, ""food insecurity"" is when people don't know where their next meal is going to come from.  Allegedly 50 million Americans fit this description.The premise is that the problem is not a lack of food, but poverty and the inability to afford healthy food.  The government was universally considered the solution to every problem presented.  ""Charity is great, but we don't pay our defense budget with charity,"" says Jeff Bridges.  Bigger government was his answer.  No effort was spent on the underlying causes of poverty, such as the breakdown of the nuclear family, the exploding entitlement culture, the exportation of America's manufacturing jobs, and other forms of government-caused economic distress.The movie makes the absurd claim that government food subsidies are ""very hard to qualify for,"" and that those who qualify don't get enough money to survive.  This is demonstrably false as other posters have mentioned.  The film also decries the ""low"" federal subsidy for school lunches.The film points out how federal farming subsidies has skewed the cost of consumer goods, especially processed, unhealthy foods (which is true).  The movie then goes on to explain that poor people are forced to eat tons of noodles and junk food to survive, which evidently explains why people can be completely obese and ""food insecure"" at the same time.  No effort was spent advocating gardening or other means of creating food or stretching food budgets.The film was one appeal to emotion after another.  Teary-eyed welfare recipients explained their plight; one kid described hallucinating in a classroom because of hunger.  Naturally, the solution to all of this is unrestrained welfare spending in Washington DC.The film claims that hunger was ""stamped out"" in the 1970s thanks to the gigantic welfare programs of Presidents Johnson and Nixon.  A video montage was shown of speeches from Reagan, Bush I, Clinton, Bush II, and Obama, all sounding the familiar call to solve hunger through more government welfare.  Amazingly, poverty rates have risen with the size of the American welfare state.  While its true that ""corporate welfare"" (farm subsidies) and ""defense"" (aka foreign wars) are sources of great waste, government has contributed to this problem in more ways than one.One worthwhile point that the the movie makes is how ignorant many Americans are about food.  One child interviewed said he eats only soda pop, cookies, and chips.  Another scene showed a teacher explaining to her class what a melon was.  America's problems lie in its profound ignorance, tragic irresponsibility, and the entitled, selfish attitude about demanding charity by force.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R4AD44K9IB4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BN4ZF98#wasThisHelpful","R2R4AD44K9IB4I","AE12OGX5S9PMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE12OGX5S9PMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Prior to doing the cleanse, by bowel movement (BM) frequency was very, very slow.  It was normal for me to have one (very large) BM every 2-3 days, on average.  A dietician & health guru informed me that this was incredibly unhealthy and that the optimal elimination frequency is one BM per meal.  That much pooping was unheard of for me.I decided to try CleanseSMART based on a friend's recommendation.  I followed the directions faithfully and did not find the dietary recommendations to be difficult at all.  I took fiber, omega 3 fatty acids, and probiotics as recommended.  The results were remarkable.  My bowel movement frequency increased noticeably by the third day.  Instead of one BM every 48-72 hours, I was having one BM every 8-12 hours.  In other words, a poop after every meal, on average.  The most BMs I experienced during the cleanse was 4 in one day.  The BMs should be solid consistency with a clean wipe -- we are not talking about diarrhea here.More importantly, the positive effects of the cleanse have continued well after I took the final capsules.  I am writing this 3 months later and I am maintaining a schedule of 1 or 2 BMs per day, which is comfortable and healthy for me; it is a vast improvement from my sluggish schedule before the cleanse.  I have to say I feel better to be operating on a regular schedule, not carrying around days' worth of waste inside me.I must warn you: the flatulence I experienced during the cleanse was incredible.  It was a gas FAR more potent than anything I have ever released.  I am talking about nostril-burning, eye-watering farts from hell.  And a lot of them.  The farts kicked into high gear on the third day of the cleanse and didn't taper off until maybe 2 months after I completed the program.  This is attributed to the ongoing detoxification of your organs, and the release of stored bacteria.  The colon becomes a battleground of various bacteria, and the result is an audible wind-turbine of room-clearing flatulence.  Eventually the bowels find a balance of healthy bacteria and the gas production returns to normal.  To combat the smelly fart-storm, I experimented with a few supplements known assist with flatulence production and smell: liquid dietary chlorophyll, fennel capsules, activated charcoal capsules, and of course daily probiotics.All in all, I found the cleanse to be very effective and rewarding.  My intention is to go through a kidney cleanse, liver cleanse, parasite cleanse, and eventually do another colon cleanse.  I would recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WA7QBWXM5PKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015R78DO#wasThisHelpful","R1WA7QBWXM5PKK","AE12OGX5S9PMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE12OGX5S9PMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this documentary, a muslim female videographer from Pakistan travels across Afghanistan to assess whether the standards of living for women have improved since the American military campaign in that country.  The film shows a depressing and honest look at how women live in that war-ravaged and desolate land.Afghanistan has always been a target of invading foreign empires, and the last 3 decades have been no exception. The country has been war-ravaged since the invasion of the Soviets in the 1980s, and the invasion of the Americans in the 2000s.  As a result, the people of Afghanistan have a very low average lifespan of only 60 years.  Warfare decimated the male population, leaving tremendous amounts of widows and orphans in Afghanistan.  Many of the survivors live in squalor and barely get by through begging.  Others are literally sold into marriage, are treated as property, and are often viciously abused.  Extreme poverty and crude technology makes life very difficult for the average person.Women are rarely educated and looked down upon, in general.  It is usual to see women wearing a head-to-toe garment known as a burqa that has only a small mesh area for seeing and breathing.  Although onerous to wear, the burqa provides women with some anonymity when dealing with the abusive male population.  Afghan men candidly admit that they could not imagine allowing their wives to expose her faces in public, and admit that if they saw women walking around without burqas, that they would be unlikely to control themselves from using some kind of sexual violence against them.The documentary smashes the myth that the American invasion improved the living conditions of Afghans.  For many, like the orphans and widows, they are worse off after U.S. intervention.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PM4ASEJ869KS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTX5CX6#wasThisHelpful","R1PM4ASEJ869KS","AE12OGX5S9PMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE12OGX5S9PMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The UA balaclava is a nice addition that helps cover up exposed skin and stay warm in cold weather.  You can snug it up so only your eyes are exposed.  You can pull down the front, if desired, and let your mouth and nose breathe freely.  Or, you can roll the hood down so that it only covers your neck.  In the coldest weather, I used a hat on top of this hood.As with any mask, if you breath into it for a long time it is going to collect moisture from your breath.  And that moisture may not be comfortable trapped against your face in cold weather.  I don't know of any way around this, other than to roll it down every so often and let it dry out.  When skiing, I would cover my mouth/face as I skied downhill, but as we stood around talking at the bottom I would roll down the front of the mask.Overall I like the product.

"I purchased these clips because they looked identical to the name-brand kind and the price is dirt cheap.  That was a MISTAKE.  After waiting several weeks for the package to arrive from Hong Kong, I finally received a pair of flimsy alligator clips and wires.The first issue I noticed was that the two female ends of the alligator clips (which are supposed to accept the male ends of the wires) were crimped shut.  I have no idea why a company would ship me clips in this condition.  I was forced to get a pair of needle-nosed pliers and try to un-crimp them so I could connect them to wires.  (See Attached Photo #1)After un-crimping the first clip, I attempted to join the male end of the wire to the female end of the alligator clip.  Immediately the wire came loose from its male-end connector.  I retrieved a mini-screwdriver to attempt to re-connect it.  That was a futile endeavor.  The tiny screw which presses against the copper wires does not tightly seat against the opposite side of connector, making a tight connection of the wire impossible.  The wire could not be securely reattached to the male-end connector.  (See Attached Photo #2)I confirmed that these clips were unusable junk.  There is no way I would want to deal with the frustration of having these fall apart on me in the middle of a project.  I threw them in the garbage.  Do not waste your time on these.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IJHDUDUX438P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LY6AQN0#wasThisHelpful","R3IJHDUDUX438P","AE12OGX5S9PMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE12OGX5S9PMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tri-Onimos is a novel concept and I was excited to try it with my family.  We love playing games and love conventional Dominoes, so this game had a natural appeal to us.The product is well made and well packaged.  The Tri-ominos come in a metal tin and are sure to last for years and years of use.  Everything about the set is quality.However, the gameplay left me desiring more.  While the concept seemed like a nice change of pace, it slows down the game and makes it overly complicated.  Rather than matching up your pieces with a single already-played number (as in old-fashioned Dominoes), you are now obligated to simultaneously match your pieces to at least 2 (sometimes 3) numbers that are already in play, and have them fit in the configuration in which they are laid on the board.  While I am not intimidated by the mental challenge of this, I found that the gameplay really gets slow based on the limited number of playable options.  This gets especially true when playing with 4 players, when the Tri-ominoes are divided 4 ways.  The game involved a lot of waiting for people to lay down a piece.I don't hate it, but I would rather play with conventional Dominoes, honestly.  The original was hard to beat; rather than toiling to find a playable piece, I can focus on playing things that score the highest.I'm giving Tri-ominos 3 stars for ""It's okay.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PNKOMI2YG531/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BAWTKI#wasThisHelpful","R2PNKOMI2YG531","AE12OGX5S9PMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE12OGX5S9PMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My son is very interested in joining the Imperial forces when he grows up.  He says he's not sure if he wants to help police the homeland or if he wants to invade foreign countries.  So I thought a new Predator drone toy would be a nice gift for him.  These drones are used both domestically and internationally, to spy on people and assassinate them at the Emperor's discretion.  He just loves flying his drone around our house, dropping Hellfire missiles on Scruffy, our dog.  He kept saying that Scruffy was a terror suspect and needed to be taken out.  I asked him if Scruffy should get a trial first, and he quoted Lindsay Graham, Imperial Senator:  ""Shut up Scruffy, you don't get a trial!""  I was so proud.

"I had so much fun playing this game with my fellow enforcers during our shift.  We kept arresting each other and locking each other's tokens in jail, which is the basic dynamic of the game.  The objective is to grow your department's budget and imprison as many players as possible.  I chose to be the ""Taser"" token, my favorite.  The ""Chance"" cards are different reasons you get to arrest each other, and different ways to collect revenue from people trying to travel around the board.  If you roll anything higher than a 6 (on two dice), you have to pay the government half a week's wages.  ""Community Chest"" cards are reasons you get to send the SWAT token into people's homes at night (always a blast).  One highlight for me was when I got to confiscate someone's hotel using the civil forfeiture rule.  Another time a player was suspected of growing illegal plants so the SWAT Token came to his property and shot his Dog Token.

The entire story is just epic as it unfolds from page one of book one to the very last page of the epilogue in book four. I am sad to see this story and its characters end, but the author also did a fantastic job with the ending, though it wasn't at all what I had expected. I definitely recommend that you take this amazing journey.

"I really enjoyed this read. It is definitely not for the faint of heart or people sensitive to foul language. I thought it was a hoot. I have to admit though that at first I didn't care for Adalyn all that much, she was kind of off-putting, but as I got to know her better I began to understand her better and really accept her. I totally loved Ian, and I really found myself loving Stacy. The author has written a very good story with a great plot, tons of humor, romance and suspense.

"This is my first read by this author and I really liked her writing. I love the way that she wove such an intricate story that is literally full of suspense, mystery romance, drama, and intrigue. There are truly some really horror worthy stuff contained within these pages! I was swept up in the book and became totally engrossed in the story and just wanted to keep reading until the last page and read it straight through.

"This is my first time reading anything by this author and all I can say is WOW! I absolutely loved these books! Once I started reading I was totally hooked and devoured each and every word, turning page after page after page, just needing to know what was coming next. When I hit the last page I was still wanting more and am ecstatic to report that there are 4 more! Yay! The author's writing is fan-freaking-tastic. I don't often become a fan of an author from just one read, I may like the authors writing an look for another from that author but it takes me a bit to add to my auto one-click list. Not with Ms. Swift, she is total one click material. Each book is a fast paced quick read that quickly sucks you in and ends in an epic cliffhanger, so it's awesome that the first four are all packaged together here, so you can go right into the next instead of dying to wait for the next release. Right away I loved Megan and fell instantly into lust with Landon. We are swept up into the mystery and suspense following the murder of Julia's boss, and the suspicions fly in the second book. In the third book we get to know Landon even better and things between him and Megan are really getting hot. I love all of the suspense, reading it is so intense I at times felt my body rigid with tension as I flew through the pages. This story just gets better and better as you go. The there are so many twists and turns keeping you going eager for what is to come. I can't wait to sink my teeth into the next in this series!

"This is my first time reading this author, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised and will definitely be watching out for her future releases. I have to admit that when I first began reading the book it took me a little while to get into the book, but after that I was totally hooked. I love Sophie, she is a strong but sweet, independent woman with a great sense of humor. I also have to admit that I started out really disliking Ashton, not only because of the role he and his high school girlfriend played in torturing Sophie during high school but he acts like a total tool, so totally rude and full of himself, that I was positive that there would be no way that I could ever end up liking this character. I was happy to discover that there was something more to him under all of that tool-ishness. I liked the way that the author ""played"" Truth or Dare and really ended up enjoying the story.

"I have to admit that I was first drawn to this book because of the beautiful cover, I know what most people say about judging a book by it's cover, but this rarely fails me, then when I read the synopsis I knew that I wanted to read this book for certain. I think that the author did a great job in creating this world and the lovely characters. It took a bit but once I became immersed in the story I really didn't want to put it down. I just needed to know what was going to happen next what with the unexpected twists that the author artfully throws our way. As for the heroine Eyelet and the hero Urlick, I just adore them, together they are just so terrific, both perfectly imperfect, and man do they have everything but the kitchen sink thrown at them.

"This box set has nine really great romance reads. All of the books are quick, fun steamy, romantic and different reads, that each very easily make you feel as if you've read a full length book. I also found myself a few new to me authors to watch out for. You have something for everyone from straight up romance, to the paranormal to out there futuristic tales and everything in between. I can not tell you how much I liked every story, which is unusual for a collection, often there are at least one or two that are kind of nah... to me but I really liked all of the stories included in this set. My favorite was Silent Sky by Regina Kammer. It was very emotional for me and I just felt very involved in the story and found myself very much able to relate to Jennie.

"A Fun, Funny, Sweet and Sassy Paranormal ReadThis is my first read by  Tellulah Darling but I can say that it will not be my last. I absolutely enjoyed this book. I love the characters, they are all unique each with their own supernatural abilities and each very well developed by the author, and totally relatable. The book is told from multiple POV's which I love because you really get to know the characters, I totally love Frankie & Rafa, who have so many challenges, obstacles and issues that they have to deal with, as well as the rest of the merry misfit band of friends. I really loved the laugh out loud banter and snark. The author starts you off running and draws you right in, and from there it only goes up. I definitely had a hard time putting this one down, because of that pesky thing called life. :p It is total non stop action and mystery and just makes you want to keep going. I also loved the wit and humor, and found myself snorting with laughter, giggling and just laughed quite a bit. This is the first in the series and I can't wait to read more, but in the meantime I intend to busy myself with the authors back list, there are quite a few yay!

"Where to start? First I was drawn in by the beautiful and intriguing cover, and then when I read the blurb and saw this, ""I am darkness; what you would consider a thief amongst the living. Ive spent time, so much of it that it seems a trifle word to call it, in that gloom being swallowed whole by human grief and human tears. I am the angel of death."", I knew that I just HAD to read this book! I so was not disappointed, it far surpassed my expectations! I absolutely love this book. This is one of those books that you run to your book-y friends and insist that they must read it, and then being the pain in the arse that I am, I keep asking ""Have you read it yet?"" ""Where are you in the book?"" ""What did you think of it?"" ""You loved it right? Am I right?"" ""Of course I'm right."" Yep, I'm THAT girl, but there is just everything to love about this book, it's really hard to write without fan-girling, I just can't. The story is just beautiful, the author has painted us into a fantastical story full of emotions that grab you and take you along for the ride, there will be smiles and tears, yes tears, elation and pain, and so much more. This book left me with one of the hardest book hangovers that I've had to date. I definitely recommend it. I can't wait to read more from this very talented author.

"I really enjoyed this book, not only am I a sucker for a friends to lovers story but this book really grabs you, its fun, funny, and just a real feel good read. The only complaint that I have, and maybe it's just my personal reading preferences getting in the way but they way that the story is told as a present tense, first person, kind of throws off the flow of the book a bit, but I was still able to enjoy it. I think if it weren't for that part this would be a 5 star rather than a four star review. I was really able to connect with Nina being a person that has taken care of my siblings, and her strong family values.

The author has done a terrific job with novel as a whole, the world she has created is not only very realistic and totally believable, but the way that everything is described, it is also very vivid. The plot was awesome and as a lover of dystopian novels, I read quite a bit of them and this one definitely stands up within the ranks of dystopian fiction. The read itself is fast paced, exciting and engaging. I was drawn in right away and wanted to keep going. There are twists that will leave you reeling, it is definitely a page turner.

"I absolutely love this series, from the moment that I began book 1, and throughout the series, I was totally hooked.

Before I began reading book 1 Calling Me Back I had not had the opportunity to read this author, so I wasn't sure what to expect, I am so glad I was presented the opportunity to read and review this series. I have to say that I totally love the author's writing, her creativity and wit are really terrific. There is a series previous to this one, that I have been meaning to go back and read called the White Lightning Series which, I definitely will be going back to read that series now that I have finished this amazing series. It is my understanding that we will get to know even more about the characters from that one. Each book in the series needs to be read in order and books two and three pick right up where the previous one leaves off. Even the ending, though it is always sad to see a great series end, is just the absolute perfect ending to the series, it is so romantic and heartfelt. I just cannot recommend this series highly enough! The story is just so amazing and I was drawn right in to each and every volume, and read each one straight through, I just could not put them down!

"Never having read this author, I wasn't sure what to expect, but with the lure of the paranormal, I had to give it a shot. I am glad that I did. The author has written a story with a great and unique plot, and is also very unique with her verbiage. I really ended up loving this book. I admit that I wasn't sure at first because it was kind of a slow starter in my opinion, but keep going because it gets really good! First let me say that I love the name of the main character Justice, though at times I felt so frustrated with her I wanted to scream. She is definitely not a take charge bad ass heroine, but more a damsel in distress, which is more realistic of how I think most of us would act if we were in her shoes. She has way too many reasons to be distressed though, for certain. I love how the author threw in twist after twist, and am now in agony waiting for the next installment of this series because of the totally epic cliffhanger! I have so many questions!

I absolutely loved the tension, chemistry and heat between Elizabeth and Roman is off the charts. This book is not about blood related cousins, marriage only so though it is a bit taboo, it doesn't cross over into ""that"" territory.

"As soon as I read the synopsis for this book I was in, having read books by this author before I had high expectations and I was not disappointed. The plot is so intriguing and the book is so fast paced that I read the whole thing from start to finish in no time. It was over before I knew it or was ready for it. I absolutely loved and felt so much for Shannon and Ethan, they both come from dark places and have the potential to either ruin each other or save each other. This book is swimming with emotions and passion. Kudos to Cherry for giving us another great book to devour.

"This is the first book that I've had the chance to read by this author and I really loved her writing. I haven't had a chance to read her Broken World series but fully intend to. It is a really good shifter read, although at times I felt as though I was missing something as if I had come into the middle of something. I think perhaps if I had read the other books in the Broken World series I might not have been lost at times, but the author does offer enough back story and pieces of the puzzle throughout the book that everything makes sense if you just keep reading, which is not difficult because the book is hard to put down. The story really pulls you in and the characters are really great. There is a ton of chemistry between the two main characters along with a good deal of action, mystery and suspense. I am very much looking forward to the next book in the series. I was generously given a complimentary copy of this book by the author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q5BXQ69AVVKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0134M8NUE#wasThisHelpful","R3Q5BXQ69AVVKZ","A1LN7TIT4E8KUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LN7TIT4E8KUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this book so much. There is literally something for every reader in here. Not only have I found some new authors to love but the twists on these fairy tales is amazing. While each author has done a twist on a fairy tale, some going way outside the box, some making them ultra modern, each author has their own style and flair, adding twists, sexiness, evil and magic, which when blended in with the other talented authors makes for an amazing compilation. I loved all of the stories but my favorite was Awakened by Kristen Strassel. This is a dark twist on Sleeping Beauty and of course, I love me some Sexy vamps. I think that this is my favorite anthology of the year thus far and I definitely recommend it.

"This is my first read by this author but the synopsis was just too good to pass up. Thank goodness I didn't I really loved this read, and found it extremely hard to put down, I wanted to devour the whole thing in one sitting. The story is so very well written that I was immediately sucked into the story, with all of it's drama and heart pounding moments as well as a few unexpected surprises, plus the characters are so very well developed that you really get to know them. I absolutely loved the sweet, witty and beautiful, Mia, who has gone though some pretty hard stuff in the past along with being a single mom, though there were times I wanted to grab her and yell WTH? I also adore Chris the consummate oh so sexy bachelor. The chemistry between the two is sizzling. Though their first meeting was less than idyllic. I enjoyed the slow way that they build while the two try and stave off their feelings for each other. This is just a terrific read that I definitely recommend.

It was so well written that I found myself falling right into the story, I did not want to put it down and would have read it straight through if it weren't for these pesky adulting duties. :pI absolutely loved the strong, sassy but sweet Cassie and the ultra sexy, bad boy, sweetheart that is Theo. The chemistry between them is off the charts. I love a good friends to lovers story and this one is no exception. I just loved the way that the story flows so easily along pulling the reader along. Will Theo get the woman  that he has been crushing on forever? Can he convince Cassie who doesn't do relationships to give it a chance? Will Cassie reveal her true feelings? Read and find out.

"This book is not your usual apocalyptic, end of the world read. First of all the authors did an excellent job at giving the same story while telling if from the different sides. The story is epic and includes fierce battles and angels, demons and other paranormal creatures, things that nightmares are made of. The action and adventure is practically non stop. There are so many twists and turns and bits and pieces that really keep you on your toes. I was really captivated by the story and was reluctant to put it down.

"This is the second book in the series and if you haven't read the first book Fractured Immortal, I strongly suggest that you do, to really know what is going on with the story. This book picks up after the cliffhanger of the last book although, unlike most cliffhangers this one isn't resolved within the first few pages. Still I loved this book, there is so much going on.  Ilia and Alex as well as the rest of the gang have no idea of the revealed information that we the readers were given at the very end of the last book. When they found out, I was so relieved, I physically felt my body muscles loosen up not even realizing that I had been all tensed up. There is so much action and suspense in this book and love and solid loving friendship. I loved all of the characters though I have to admit that I was very suspicious of Eris from the very beginning and was shocked at the revelation about Ilia's mother. I could go on and on but don't want any spoilers to slip. I definitely recommend this read and can't wait for book 3.

"First let me start off by saying that the episodes of this season have to be read in order and if you haven't started the series yet, now is the perfect time, all of the episodes are out so no waiting. Yay! This entire season has been totally awesome. I absolutely love all of the characters, and loved getting to know them all. They each bring their own thing to the party and are so easy to care about and relate to. We have had ups and downs and secrets and fun. This episode ended with everyone leaving for winter break and a really hard boom. What is Ashleigh going to do? I am positive that her dance ""partner"" is not being totally honest and has something else up her sleeve. Poor Cassie I thought I knew what she was upset about but when we really find out, I was furious and want to smash Clay, that a-hole. I absolutely loved the series the author has done a terrific job and I can not wait till season 2 due out early in 2016.

"I absolutely loved the Serving HIM series so I was totally thrilled to learn that Craving HIM was bringing back Dominic and Aleena. Also with this combination of authors, I don't even have to think before one-clicking, anything that they put out is sure to be absolute gold. This book is no exception. You don't have to read the Serving HIM series before this book, but I highly recommend it, first of all they are awesome, and secondly they are the base, of Dom and Aleena's story and I feel that if you don't read them first you will be missing out on a lot.  As for this book, I was sucked right back in with Dom and Aleena the second I began reading and unlike the Serving HIM series this is a full length novel which I loved! I was so caught up in the story that I didn't realize how much time had passed, until I hit the end and realized that the sun was beginning to peek above the horizon. Oops! The book just has so much to offer, it is blazingly sexy, with suspense, and even more of Dominic's story. This book gave me a real feeling of closure to Dominic and Aleena's story and I can't recommend it highly enough.

"I absolutely LOVED this book! The writing is absolutely superb, I was sucked into the story, totally hooked, right from the start, experiencing the story right alongside the characters. I literally flew through the pages, unwilling to put it down, I greedily consumed each and every word. The story flows effortlessly even while taking you on a roller coaster of emotions, and suspense. The plot is amazing and breathtaking with twists and turns that I never saw coming. I adore Robyn, she is a strong spitfire of a woman, even though she has her weak moments (who doesn't?) Then we have Cole and Callum, two very sexy, very different but completely delish men. I was enthralled from cover to cover through the drama, suspense, betrayal, love, intense passion,  and so much more. I can't recommend this book highly enough. I totally recommend it as a must read.

"I loved this book so much, it is seriously moving, heart-wrenching, and touching and simply beautiful. It is about serious heartbreak and the fallout that follows and moving on. It shows the strength of character of the main character Izzie and how even though you are knocked out with a one-two punch, you can have a second chance at life, and at love, not only for others but for yourself. The author has done such an excellent job with this one. I was immediately drawn into the story and did not want to put it down. I love how the author made the plot somewhat unpredictable and even threw in a few twists. I was captivated and intrigued throughout the entire read.

"When I was first offered the chance to read and review this book I wasn't sure if I would say yes because I had never read or hear of the author, but the first thing that drew me to take a closer look was the cover, and then the blurb, as soon as I read it I knew that I needed to know more. I am soooo glad that I did. This book is absolutely stellar. The writing is fantastic and the book drew me in pretty much from the start and kept me turning page after page, and every time I thought that I finally knew what was going on the author threw in a twist that had me gasping and reeling. There were points when I was absolutely shocked. I love that! The read is a total thrilling bumpy, twisty, turn-y, up and down  ride. This book is so hard to put down and the few times that I was forced to (life and such) I found myself thinking about what I had already read and what might be coming next.

This sequel is just as good if not better than the first which completely caught my attention and I loved.

The characters are all very interesting and each has their own unique personality and really adds their own special something to the story.

Friendships are tested, secrets revealed and sacrifices will be made"" and saw the cover with a spider on the girl's face, which totally creeped me out. I knew that I wanted to read this book.

I myself wasn't sure what to expect when I was offered to read and review this trilogy. I wasn't familiar with the author but the blurb was intriguing so I took a chance. Wow! Am I ever glad that I took this chance! I really lucked out. I love the author's writing style and voice, her imagination is seriously amazing and the characters are real and very well developed. When I think of New Orleans I think of things like Mardi Gras, and Po' Boys, but also history and the mysterious. This was the perfect setting for this paranormal read.

It can be read as a stand alone, but I highly recommend the previous two books. As with the two previous books I was drawn into the story right away and held fast turning page after page until the very end. This book is quite a bit more lighthearted than the previous two books, but we are still taken on a bit of an angsty emotional ride. The author balances out the right amount of angst, sweetness, humor, romance, and steam with this read. I absolutely adore Lana and Jake, I couldn't help but to become seriously emotionally invested in the both of them. Neither of these characters has had what you could call a wonderful past but they are getting a chance at a better future. Will they grab hold and take it? Read and find out!

"This body wash lathers like crazy, smells like cucumbers (good!), and leaves the skin feeling smooth and fresh. HOWEVER, it has two big problems that will keep me from ordering it again:1. The dispenser lid does not work at all! I have to unscrew the whole cap, and then too much product pours out. Plus, it's a pain to do. I have arthritic hands so that's part of the problem, but it really is difficult to do (you have to squeeze the whole bottle really hard to get any to come out, and then only a tiny bit comes out), and I think it would be difficult for most anyone.2.

"The looks of these sandals are really cute and different, and I thought they'd be super comfy too since they're Aerosoles.

I have no idea why or how that happened, but I tried to walk and correct the positioning, and that just didn't work.

"I was getting very discouraged with vacuuming and mopping with the Swiffer, which is super convenient and doesn't keep using the same dirty mop head, but when I did spot cleaning, even right after mopping, the paper towel would come up looking way too dirty... like I hadn't mopped at all! So I decided to give the FloorMate a try.PROS: Floors are definitely cleaner, which is the point.  Dirty water vacuumed up is evidence of what used to be left on floor.  Fairly easy to assemble.  Reasonable price.  Solution and dirty-water tanks are easy to remove, replace, refill and/or empty.CONS: Unit is very heavy to push around. Definitely causes back pain.  Directions for use are completely inadequate. (Example: To make cleaning solution come out, the unit has to be  moving. They don't tell you this.)  Holding down solution-flow button causes hand fatigue and pain.  Doesn't clean grout well.  Unit is large, requiring significant storage space.All in all, I think it's worth it for cleaner floors. But it's not the easiest contraption to use, especially if you have back or hand problems.Most definitely, the floors are cleaner, and the dirty water that is vacuumed up is pretty good evidence of what used to just be spread around. I love the fact that it dries the floors and picks up the dirty water, and the size of the containers seems adequate to me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35TGH8S6MAGZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EQD8X74#wasThisHelpful","R35TGH8S6MAGZT","ATNQNZEHWMR9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATNQNZEHWMR9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Because a suspension of disbelief is required to appreciate this book, and because I'm not usually a fan of ""fantasy"" novels, I had doubts when beginning to read it. But I was soon swept up in this fascinating work about two young girls and their saviors, a pair of Tasmanian Tigers. The first-person narrative and unique manner of speech (attributed to the girls' loss of the English language during their time with the tigers) cease to become off-putting almost immediately and actually become endearing (at least to me).This book is an adventure story, a love story, a story of loss and sorrow, and a. highly imaginative tale which succeeds on all levels. I read it in two days, slowed down by the need to sleep, and loved every minute of it.If you are intrigued by the possibility of humans living in intimacy with wild animals and being cared for by them, do yourself a favor and read this book. It will educate you (check out Wikipedia on Tasmanian Tigers), enchant you, and move you.

"I have a Hoover Linx that I have loved for several years. Thought I try this one because the reviews were good, and I was ready for a change. Sadly, this Rowenta was a HUGE disappointment. I'll list what I consider the pros and cons.PROS: Looks nice.  Charge lasts a long time.  Goes along a base board nicely.  Fits under most furniture.CONS: Once the long charge runs out, it takes overnight to fully charge it again.  There's no battery you can remove and charge. Instead, you have to plug the whole vacuum in, which takes a lot of room.  The vacuum is difficult to stand up. It's very unstable and you have to get it just right.  It's extremely difficult to maneuver unless you're going right along a base board. It requires a strong hand to guide it.  It's also difficult to empty the dust cup. I end up fumbling with it every time.  Then it's hard to get the dust cup back in place after emptying it..  The dust cup is much smaller than the Hoover Linx's.  After the dust cup has been emptied and the vacuum recharged, when you start it again, the smell (of dog hair in my case) is awful, and I'm guessing lots of dust is coming out along with that smell.  A second filter was supposed to be enclosed, but it was not.I definitely do NOT recommend this vacuum. I DO recommend the Hoover Platinum Linx.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D0I0327ARJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005M79ZES#wasThisHelpful","R2D0I0327ARJC","ATNQNZEHWMR9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATNQNZEHWMR9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this lipstick for texture, feel, and lasting power. The case is especially nice because it feels solid, seems to be made of a sturdy metal, the finish seems lasting, and it closes with a resounding click. I don't think it's going to come open in your purse. Be sure you've pushed it all the way closed, which is not difficult.The only quibble I have (and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars) is that the color you see online is not very representative of the color you will see on your lips. I like colors that are close to nude/natural but not so light that they're actually lighter than your lips, ala 1960's Twiggy. I've tried two colors now (Secret Desire and Natural Seduction... dumb names, right?), and they both looked like my kind of color, but on my lips, they are both too light.So when you choose your color, just keep this in mind. I haven't tried one of the deeper shades because (1) his lipstick is super expensive, and (2) I'm even more horrified of too dark than too light.I do encourage you to try Edward Bess, as the lipstick is pretty great if you do hit on the right color, and his foundation is really nice too, but also seems lighter than you might expect. Maybe his line is best tried in a brick-and-mortar store first.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LND5FLFAYXQY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0091TAZOC#wasThisHelpful","R1LND5FLFAYXQY","ATNQNZEHWMR9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATNQNZEHWMR9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love Easy Spirit clogs, which are so comfortable, cute, and versatile, but I took a chance that the 9B might fit o.k. because they didn't have 9AA. Oops, they were definitely too wide, even with thick socks. Since it's hard to find AA sizes, and I can usually get by with a B or medium width, I was hoping these would be fine. They weren't, so I sent them back. Otherwise, they were great. That's why I gave them 5 stars instead of 4, because they are fabulous shoes if they fit, especially if you have problem feet, which I do.The color is unusual, with the ""gold"" being more of an olive green, but the ""bumper"" would definitely help keep the lighter fabric upper looking cleaner. I would have kept them if they had fit.Also, it's possible to find bargain prices on Easy Spirit shoes on Amazon, especially if you wear an unusual size or don't mind wild colors!

I am a diver of many years and have always felt very lucky to glimpse a shark, although I have no desire to stand in a steel cage and watch great whites respond to the chum ladled into the water around the cage. I, like several other reviewers, was hoping for behavioral and physiological information about the ""hidden world"" of sharks, including facts that I wouldn't have been likely to have gleaned from any other source.

"This is an outstanding book about Bull Terriers/Mini Bull Terriers. Many breed books waste 90% of their pages on general dog care, health recommendations, feeding, etc., and actually have little to say about the specific breed. I was pleasantly surprised that this book covers the ground thoroughly, and although I am not an expert on Bull Terriers, I do feel that I learned a lot of valuable information from this book. I have a new Mini Bull puppy, and she's cute as a bug and I'm glad to have a source of information about the breed. They are unique, so I'd advise prospective owners to research the breed before plunging, possibly never to surface. :-)Another great book for BT/MBT owners is When Pigs Fly by Jane Killion, available on Amazon.

"These shoes are great looking, and I love Merrell lace-up shoes, which can be tied to properly fit narrow feet. But this particular pair is AT LEAST one full size too large. I ordered a half-size down (from 9 to 8.5) as advised by the reviews, but it was still way too big. If you have a high instep, you will probably find the fit to be fine, but for narrow, flexible, flat feet, this shoe just won't work.

"I learned the hard way that routers are easily fried by lightning while everything else to do with your computer is rarely hurt. This is the third router I've had to buy, and the reason I chose it was because it was identical to the one that just got electrocuted. Counterintuitive, you say? Well, maybe, but according to the local expert, all routers are susceptible to damage by lightning. The reason I got the same kind was that it had performed beautifully for the short time I had it, and I had just about killed myself installing it. I figured if I got an identical one, it would be really easy to slide it into the pre-prepared installation slot. And that turned out to be correct. It took maybe ten minutes to set this one up, whereas the other had taken me at least half a day of crawling around on the floor under my desk and trying to access the back of my desktop. (It's cramped.) If you are a techie, I'm sure you wouldn't have any trouble at all, but me... not so much.An excellent feature is a reset button on the router itself, instead of having to unplug and replug.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was the trouble I had installing it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QE1Q0ZGFY3J6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A3YN0Z0#wasThisHelpful","R2QE1Q0ZGFY3J6","ATNQNZEHWMR9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATNQNZEHWMR9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These fit me perfectly (true to size), they have fantastic room in the toe box without looking clunky, and the heel is narrow. I love the colors (grey/aubergine/vitamin C), and they look great on. The colors are toned down a bit by the grey, but the purple and coral really jazz it up. The base/sole of the shoe, especially in the rear, is wide and makes my whole foot feel stable and secure. There is lots of cushioning, which I really need, having lost all the fat pads in my feet.  They fit with or without socks, and the support feels really good. I hadn't bought Reebok in years but used to wear them all the time because they ran narrow. Now I remember why I wore them even before they made running shoes especially for women!

"My reason for only giving two stars is simply that the shoes, even though they were the right size, just didn't fit my feet. The arch support hit my foot in a really uncomfortable way. However, I have very flat feet, so that might not be a problem with someone who has more normal arches or even high arches. And the toe box, while roomy enough, somehow hit my toes wrong. Maybe that was related to the fact that the fabric that forms the front portion of the shoe was weird. It was puckered before I even put my foot in them. Maybe this was a defective pair, but both shoes were just alike.I did like the looks of the shoe, and the white sole stands out and looks cool. I love the way the Reebok ZigLite fits and was hoping that this one would fit the same way, but it didn't.I do have problem feet, so I'm thinking this shoe would probably be fine for most people.

What you get is an incomplete list (and JUST a list) of various terms, supposedly arranged in alphabetical order; however, these are very confusing because you can't distinguish the indented ones that come under a topic name from the topic names themselves. If you look long enough, you will discover that at the top of the page, the original topic name is listed, but this is something that could have been explained in an introduction.And when I said ""list,"" I did not mean a list of definitions.

"These glasses come in a small leather case (as pictured) that is easy to put in your purse and it doesn't take up much room at all. The red frames are very bright, very attractive, and look like quality. The lenses seem to be of high quality also. So why only three stars? Because by the time you've gotten them out of the case and unfolded them so that they are secure, whatever you needed them for (menu in dimly lit restaurant?), the moment has come and gone three or four times. The quality of the lenses and the red part of the frames doesn't extend to the mechanism of assembling them for use. The ear pieces are difficult to extend, and they seem too fragile to withstand much use.

"If you enjoy pens that not only write beautifully but are also artistic with great design, you should love this Science pen with Leonardo da Vinci drawings on it.

"This is a large book in dimensions (not thickness), and the paper is heavy and of high quality. There are also lots of pictures, including x-rays and instructions about the exercises. Those are the reasons it's so expensive. This is definitely not a pamphlet that you pick up for free at the doctor's office.The information and instructions are very basic, and whether they would be helpful to you depends on what your level of knowledge is to begin with. Also, it's quite likely that whether you have inflammatory arthritis, e.g., rheumatoid, or osteoarthritis, your tendency to develop it is inherited, and you cannot really change that. These exercises are aimed at strengthening the muscles of your hand to provide as much support to the joints as possible. There is also commonsense advice, like don't use your hands to do heavy work, especially work that involves lots of twisting motions and repetitive small movements. These will definitely increase the work load on your joints and contribute to their deterioration.Recommended for those who would like to strengthen their hands and don't already have a fair amount of understanding.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FLAOEBBPE1SY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1457513838#wasThisHelpful","R2FLAOEBBPE1SY","ATNQNZEHWMR9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATNQNZEHWMR9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But if you have a great love of writing instruments like I do, then you can't go wrong with this purchase. The Deer Prudence is a very special design, in my opinion, and I'm very pleased with it.One word of caution for those unfamiliar with Acme pens: These rollerball pens are substantial, i.e., heavy, so if you think that would bother you, you might want to see one in person before ordering. It's all part of the quality inherent in Acme. Also, you can write with the cap either on or off the top end of the pen, and it definitely weighs less without the cap on.By the way, all Acme products write beautifully, and refills are readily available through Amazon or your local pen store (yes, you probably DO have a local pen store!).Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTBWFMRCAAX3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BNEXXPG#wasThisHelpful","RTBWFMRCAAX3K","ATNQNZEHWMR9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATNQNZEHWMR9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agree with the 5-star comments of the other reviewers and would like to add my own. Everything they said was correct (about fit, comfort, looks), and some mentioned the fact that they were sturdy. But I have multiple pairs of reading glasses (having just gotten cataract surgery and being famous for losing things), and these are by far the sturdiest. When you are putting glasses on and off, as you frequently do with readers, they need to be up to the inevitable abuse. I actually have two pairs of these ICU readers, one green and one tortoise, and they seem identical except for the color. The green is really cool (my favorite) and quite subtle. Not ""screaming lime"" or something like that.One reviewers also said they seemed small. I'm not sure if he was referring to the size of the lenses or of the frame, but I have a fairly small head (hat size about 6 and 7/8ths), and they do fit me.

"I just got my green/teal band/mid-size Timex, and it's really cute and extremely functional.  As others have said, the watch face is easy to read because of size and brightness.  The band is very comfortable and even for my skinny wrists, it fits.  It's a little bit tricky to get the band buckled because it is very flexible, like trying to thread a wet noodle, but it gets easier with practice.  Because the band is nylon, it will last nicely, but if you handle rough things or work outside, it will definitely show wear.  I love that different color bands are available on Amazon.  Great just for fun, and also for when your band starts looking shabby.The watch face was a bit bigger than I expected, but it's not too big.  My wrists are very small, and the ""boyfriend"" watches look ridiculous.  The watch face covers my entire arm!I also like that the two keepers are stationary.  That way they don't keep sliding off the end that they're supposed to be keeping from coming loose.I know that kids today just don't wear watches because the time is available on their phone or their tablet.  I have a phone too, but I really like wearing a watch to know what time it is at a glance.  This one is cute and very, very functional.

"I have to agree with Sunshine (one-star review) about the discomfort and rubbing that this sandal does to the feet.  The leather is thick and stiff, and it hits right on a very sensitive spot on my feet where I had surgery.  Admittedly, I have very narrow, very flexible feet, but normally a Birk 39N fits me perfectly (8.5 to 9.0 in US)and is super comfortable from the first try-on.  Also, since some reviewers have mentioned that the shoe was flattering, I have to tell you that it wasn't flattering on my feet at all, much less so than all of my other Birks (I have a lot in various styles).  It made my feet look very wide and ugly.I do think that if you could tolerate a break-in period, the leather would loosen up and come to fit your feet better.  And I'm sure it does look good on some feet.  (That's why I gave two stars, plus the fact that they were a fabulous buy.) But there was no way I could wear them long enough to break them in.  They just hurt too much.Also, in case you're looking for Soft Footbed in the Larisa, I don't think it's available.  I couldn't find any.

"I have had several pairs of these scissors, and I have loved using them.  I have severe arthritis in  my hands and especially in my thumbs, and if the material I'm trying to cut is heavy, it's very difficult for me.  These solve the thumb problem, as they do the work for you.  They are very sharp and very pointed (not for children!), and they keep their edge well.  The weak spot is the spring, and it definitely wears out.  Then you can't lock them closed, which makes them a bit dangerous to store, and they quit working.If you are realistic about how long things last, you may consider this an acceptable bargain, but I just wanted to give you a heads up.

"I have tried various harnesses on my short, stout little Pug, but if they were big enough around her neck and chest, they were too long.  This Puppia sounded really cute and cool for the Texas summers, so I took a chance and it's great!  I got the extra large because her measurements are: chest 19"", neck 17"", weight about 17 lb.  Now would it be too long for her compact little/big body? NO, it was just right, and so easy to put on!  I hate to admit it, but some harnesses, with all their convoluted straps and buckles, take a long time to even get the thing on.  Lola cooperated well with this harness and just stepped into it.  Then she stood there like she was paralyzed and finally started walking backwards!  She walked all the way across the room backwards, and it was really funny.  She eventually figured out that she could go forward when I tempted her with a treat.I got the harness in purple, XL, and it's super cute and fits just right.  I also got the matching leash, and it was a great price too.  I was a little worried that they might not be very high quality because they were priced so reasonably, but they're excellent quality, and I'm very pleased with them.  They are definitely meant for smaller type dogs, so don't get one for your German Shepherd.  Even the XL is not going to work Plus, they're not meant for true obedience training.

"I ordered this for my 4 Chihuahuas and 1 Pug, and none of them would get on it.  The Chihuahuas weigh 3-4 lb each, so they could have fit on it, but they didn't even want to look at it.  Usually a new dog bed in the house causes a mad rush to claim it by the first one to fling herself upon it! Also, the seat cushion is really small and made out of very thin, fragile, slick material.  The Pug would have destroyed it in short order, even though she could never have fit on it (despite the fact that they show a picture of a Pug on it with plenty of room to spare).  When you squeeze the foam inside the couch frame, it sounds like that very dry kind of foam that tends to crumble.  I hate to say it, but in person, the whole thing looks cheap, despite looking really cute in the picture.  And I paid almost $50 for it!  Another disappointed reviewer said she paid $20.  Hmmm.

"I had been searching for my size (39N) in Blackberry for months and finally found the AZ here! With really fast shipping, I just got them, and they are even cuter than I anticipated.  I agree with another reviewer that the AZ doesn't look too thrilling, but add a gorgeous color, and they sing!  Put your foot in them, and YOU will sing.  Ever since Birks became available in Narrow and with the Soft Footbed, they are my go-to comfort shoe, which actually means my go-to shoe period.  The only downside is that you may have trouble finding them.  Amazon has a really nice selection, and if you have a rare size, you'll also find some great bargains.  They're not cheap, but if you have problem feet, they're a bargain at any price.  The adjustability, the width choice, and the Soft Footbed are what insure a comfortable fit.  The footbed itself offers great support for your arch (or non-arch) and your whole foot.  Your size may vary from the sandals to the closed toe shoes, like the Boston, but if you know your size, then they run very consistently true to size.  I wear an 8.5 or 9 in US sizes, and a 39N in Birks, as some kind of vague guideline.  Don't necessarily believe the sizing charts that you will see.  You just have to try them on.Besides the SFB, which is SO much more comfortable than the plain cork, the suede is the most comfortable material because it is so soft.  I'm not sure it holds up as well as Nubuck or oiled leather, but if you take care of your Birks, they'll take care of you for a loooooog time, no matter what material they're made of.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18A44Z19MX2LX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0079EXIAO#wasThisHelpful","R18A44Z19MX2LX","ATNQNZEHWMR9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATNQNZEHWMR9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love these suede boots and have gotten so many compliments on them.  I wore them to the doctor's office and two of the nurses wanted all the details about where I got them so they could get a pair.  I originally tried on the smooth leather version, which was super nice but looked really dressy.  The leather seemed to be of very high quality, and they looked like they belonged at the polo club, which is not a place I frequent.  Ahem...  So I got the suede instead, and they look casual but nice.  They're also very comfortable, and they fit true to size, at least for me.  My feet are very narrow, so I usually try to buy lace-up boots, but this strap is a truly adjustable one (unlike the Velcro that always CLAIM to be adjustable but simply are NOT), and on the last hole, they fit.Highly recommended! Nice sole, nice arch support, quality suede, great comfort, and really nice looking!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV2MREYV9OJQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007IKRSB4#wasThisHelpful","RV2MREYV9OJQQ","ATNQNZEHWMR9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATNQNZEHWMR9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave these very cute sandals only two stars because they really, really HURT my feet! I am so surprised, partly because I expected them to be just like Birkenstocks, and also because of the great reviews.  As soon as I put them on, they were KILLING my feet across the top of my foot where the buckles were.  I tried to feel underneath, thinking that surely something got bent under or something was caught, but neither was the case.  I had to take them off immediately because they hurt too badly to walk around in.  The leather NuBuck seemed high quality, the color was nice (but more of a light pink than peach), and they appeared to be well made.  The price was great.  But they really hurt me, so I had to send them back.They are unlike Birkenstocks in the footbed.  It is soft, but the toe ridge is different, and the arch is different.  The toe ridge didn't bother me, but the arch hit my flat feet in the wrong places and contributed to the pain.  It felt like something was under my feet, like a ball or something, but it was just the relatively low arch support, and it wasn't in the right place for me.  The real problem, though, was the buckles.I think I'm the exception because nobody else had a problem, but I promise: I am not making this up.  They HURT!","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVKSS9L7KR2Y9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001H54W3I#wasThisHelpful","RVKSS9L7KR2Y9","ATNQNZEHWMR9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATNQNZEHWMR9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having purchased some super Sebago shoes recently, I thought I would give these boots a try. They were a great disappointment. There's really not much to them: no support, no cushioned insole, just a very basic leather container for your feet. They do have the non-slip outer sole, just like the regular Docksides from decades ago. In fact, they ARE the Docksides (as they claimed) with a higher ankle. If that's what you want, you've found it. But I was expecting more. I guess I've been spoiled by all the wonderful boots and shoes out there today. As for looks, I would say they're cute. They don't look like the only place they belong is on a boat. They could easily be just a casual boot. If you have good sturdy feet that don't need support, I'd say these are a great bargain. This was by far the best price I found. As for fit, they were really too big for me (my feet are narrow), but I would say that they're pretty true to size, and there's lots of room in the toe box. But I'm returning them.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CP718XHM9DNW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003CJT53Y#wasThisHelpful","R2CP718XHM9DNW","ATNQNZEHWMR9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATNQNZEHWMR9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You know how people are always saying that the shoes fit so well that they tried them on and didn't take them off until they went to bed? Well, that's exactly what I did! These have to be the most comfortable boots I've ever had, and I've had quite a few. And I have problem feet and very narrow feet. The other reviewer says she has wide feet, and they fit her perfectly~ I can't explain that, but I have to attribute it to the EXCELLENT boot-making skills of Sebago. These boots are actually the boot version of the Sebago oxford, only with a slightly higher heel, and both the oxford and the boot are so goodlooking and so comfortable that maybe I'll never wear any other foot covering... just kidding, of course, in the summer I'll have to look for Sebago sandals.All kidding aside, these boots fit perfectly, look great, and are made to a high standard of excellence. The laces actually work (I hate the new trend of having laces that aren't actually functional), the insole is cushy (just enough), the leather is sturdy and high quality, the copper metal lacers and other metal trim are an added touch, and they come with ribbon laces or regular laces. I got the mahogany and love the color, sort of a mix of brown with black rubbed toe. They go with everything. In addition to all the above, I got a GREAT price from Amazon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMVU9HFBHW2VC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007H5QC4E#wasThisHelpful","RMVU9HFBHW2VC","ATNQNZEHWMR9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATNQNZEHWMR9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It took a while to receive this item,  but I'll definitely get more when these wear out. I had only used the ones that came with the device, and they wore out rather quickly. These really are extra coarse, more coarse than the coarsest one that came with the device, so they work well.

"These shoes are SO much nicer looking in person than in the picture. If you look at a pic of them in a lighter color, you can see the details better. However, the dark brown (there's also a light brown available) is a great color. There's really nothing it won't go with. It's almost dark enough to pass for black, and the ""scuffing"" (not really scuffing, but I think that look is the new style) IS black. I think these shoes are made every bit as well as men's shoes, the way shoes used to be made. They are quality all over: the leather, the dye, the sole, the heel, the fact that they come with ribbon laces and regular laces, not to mention that they actually are adjustable with the laces, unlike many of the new oxford styles that have FAKE laces and are not adjustable at all. Makes me mad because I have very narrow, flexible feet, and I need to be able to tie the laces really tightly. The insole is somewhat cushy, not much, but enough to be comfortable. Speaking of comfort, these shoes are so comfortable for me, and that's saying a lot because my feet are problem feet. I normally wear a 9, but I tried both the 9 and the 9.5, and I liked the room in the 9.5 better. I would say they run pretty true to size, but if you like your toes to have plenty of room, consider sizing up one-half size.I really, really love these shoes, and I'm so glad that Sebago, who's always been known for quality shoes, has decided to branch out a little. I'm even considering getting them in other colors. I think these shoes will last a lifetime if cared for in the old-fashioned way: a little polish and conditioner and brushing. They'll look new for years. I can't recommend them highly enough!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22JGXEP5JN6EG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007H5S8VE#wasThisHelpful","R22JGXEP5JN6EG","ATNQNZEHWMR9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATNQNZEHWMR9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's clearly made with great care, with the old-fashioned hallmarks of a well-made hat. It's got quilted satin lining so you won't have hat hair, and the materials, the stitching, and the finishing is clearly done with great care.

"This hat is made of really classy-looking material, the lining is quilted satin, and it is finished both inside and out very well. The colors are great: not too flashy but not too plain either. It would compliment most any outfit you wore with it: brown, black, grey, tan, you name it. I bought this as a gift (I know it's risky to even buy clothes for people, much less a HAT), and I'm so in hopes that he will fall in love with it. It's definitely expensive, but I was hoping that the expense meant it would be a really fine hat, and my hopes were met. It should last a lifetime with proper care and occasional dry cleaning. It also arrived very quickly, and I was concerned about that. It was packaged well, with paper stuffed inside to help it keep its shape.If you have a friend, husband, son, father, who likes to look good and has some flair about him, give him this hat.

"I've looked at these watches for a long time, and I finally decided the time was right when there was one offered at a great price that the box had been opened on. It was in ""like new"" condition, and it came in the Mondaine box with documentation, so I was pleased with my bargain.The watch is very simple but very eye-catching and classic. I got the red band, which really makes the second hand (also red) pop, but it would look great with the black leather band too. I have very small wrists, and it's always a concern for me whether the band will fit, but this one is perfect on the last hole. The leather band seems to be very high quality too. I hope I can get replacements for the band when this one wears out, as leather bands invariably do.Because my wrists and hands are small, I can't wear the currently popular over-sized watches (they look ridiculous on me and cover the entire width of my arm), but this one is the perfect size and is very easy to read. If the simplicity and looks of this watch appeal to you, I would definitely recommend it. The quality is very evident, and I think that you will find, as I did, that the best price is going to be on Amazon.Added on Nov. 18, 2012: I've had this watch for almost a month, and it has quit running! When I got it, it was already running and, of course, the box had been opened, as I knew. Seems that the merchant failed to shut the watch off when it was returned (or whatever) so it had obviously been running long enough for the battery to die. I still love the watch, and the low battery is part of the risk you take when you save money  with an open box. Now I'll have to replace the battery and see whether I actually saved money or not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RTGYO858DNT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AR7ALA#wasThisHelpful","R2RTGYO858DNT2","ATNQNZEHWMR9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATNQNZEHWMR9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these blocks as a Christmas gift for my daughter-in-law who goes to a lot of effort to decorate their house for all occasions, especially holidays. She also likes to put up uplifting thoughts, etc., on the refrigerator door and other happy things throughout the house. I thought these blocks would be a great way for her to put up whatever she might like to say, whenever. I was a little bit surprised at how big the blocks were, so do check the dimensions so you'll know what to expect.These blocks are definitely quality items and not cheap, made-in-some-other-country junk. The printing on them is clear and looks quite permanent. The wood is nicely finished and very solid. I think they would be a perfect gift for just about anyone, including children who could stack them and build towers with them, and for adults who enjoy sharing nice thoughts with family members. The only caveat would be that for very young children, they would make great weapons for conking another kid (or the dog) on the head. However, at least there's no danger of these blocks being swallowed!I got the Add-On set because it has great symbols and also numbers and extra letters.BTW, these exact blocks are for sale elsewhere on the web, but Amazon's prices were the best. They also arrived super quick, although I did think they could have been packed better. The box was almost all the way open on one side. They had put some bubble wrap in the box, but it probably should have taped around the blocks instead of just placed in the box. And it needed quite a bit more bubble wrap than they put in. The blocks are quite substantial, and I think they just got knocked around during shipping, and the tape wasn't up to holding the box together with those blocks slamming around inside. Still, they arrived in perfect condition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPS3S5J48UGDK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003FN6KAI#wasThisHelpful","RPS3S5J48UGDK","ATNQNZEHWMR9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATNQNZEHWMR9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these jeans in onyx, and it's a very dark indigo that could almost pass for black. I haven't washed them yet, so I don't know if it fades badly or not, but I'll be careful to wash it with only other dark clothes. The waist is very high, coming up even higher than my natural waist line. That means no muffin top, and since I usually wear T-shirts or untucked shirts, it doesn't really matter to me, but it definitely is NOT a contemporary look. The other thing to know is that, while these legs ARE straight, they are NOT slender-fitting but instead are pretty roomy. Again, not contemporary but very comfortable, and the price is great. The fit and length are perfect for me, and they look nice on, looking almost more like trousers than regular jeans. If you work in a place where everyone is not terribly dressed up, you could even wear them to work.Considering both the pros and the cons of these jeans, I'd still recommend them for the fit, the comfort, and the price.

"I am so glad to have found a company (Wacoal) that makes bras without the omnipresent foam cups! I'm not sure why padded bras (that's what we used to call them) took over the whole market niche of bras, but it's really hard to find bras without the foam rubber. Maybe it's because it makes sizing so much simpler for the manufacturers and for the consumer(no real matching of boob to bra necessary), but padded bras are real killers in the summer. It feels exactly like you're wearing a wet suit, and forget about the bra drying while you're wearing it. Now, finally, I find that Wacoal has a great selection of non-padded bras that fit me like a dream and are beautiful besides. I got this bra in light blue, which is really a pale aqua with chocolate brown lace around the cups. I realize that not all boobs are the same, but every Wacoal bra I've tried (four styles) fit me perfectly. It feels like coming home! Amidst all the surgically enhanced ladies, I'm not particularly big (36C) but there's no way I'm going without a bra, and I'm so glad to have found Wacoal. Shoes and bras: they GOTTA FIT!!I highly recommend this particular bra and also that you check out the entire line if you're in the market for bras.

It works precisely, is easy to handle, the cord is generously long,and it couldn't be easier to get started with it (plug and play). The reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is extremely lightweight (which was considered a good point by other reviewers), which gives the impression that it was cheaply made and may not last. But that is strictly a personal impression and likely due to the fact that other mice (mouses?) I've had felt sturdier and slightly heavier.

"I will give products 5 stars based on my inspection, usage, and overall experience. For jeans I look for a couple things: Bad quality jeans will thin or look rubbed off in the leg portions and the bottom by the ankles. I look for the seams and how well it was assembled (sewn). I look at the length is it short or to long? When I wash it I look for color fade or bleeding of the dye. After I wear it, I see if some of the dye has rubbed off on my skin. I look for variation is width between the materials. Okay for this  pair of jeans there was no bleeding or transference. All pieces were equally sewn.

"This is the most simple yet artistic mule mug I have come across. The handle is simple with a glint of design which is completely cute. It easily fits my hand in natural position, so even when I am exhausted I can still grab it. The mug's body is nicely polished with no dents or knicks. The top has a folded seam which gives it character. It is relevantly a descent size for a 16 ounce mug. It fits in my dual mid console cup holder (view picture)  which is great for me.

The padding over the ears and on the underside of the head band make wearing these headphones incredibly comfortable.  The headphones are very lightweight even though they look a little bulky.

The earbuds have enough weight to them to make them feel very comfortable in your ear and they don't feel like they would fall out, but, they are not ""too"" heavy that they are uncomfortable. When you put the earbuds in there is a tight seal and it really does help block out outside noise. The base and treble are balanced well and the sound is EXCELLENT! My FAVORITE feature on these earbuds is that the plug is narrow and it fits into my extra large case without having to use an extension or adapter!!!  They do magnetize together for secure wearing without falling off but the magnet isn't as strong as I had hoped.  Just a nice safety feature for when you take them out of your ears momentarily.  I am very, very impressed with these little earbuds! I'm definitely keeping these in my purse so that I can have quality sound wherever I go! *I received a sample of this item at a discount in return for an honest and unbiased review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VPOF4LP3PTI9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OS1W7M#wasThisHelpful","R2VPOF4LP3PTI9","ADFOJ2MNIUTEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFOJ2MNIUTEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a large package of the tyvek wristbands that you typically get when you go to a concert or event to show that you purchased a ticket or that you are of legal drinking age.  They are all bright green and are easily visible from a distance.  Great for a big party or event where you need to be able to see that the person ""qualifies"" in some way (paid).  The material used is not tear-able and if someone tries to detach and reattach on another person the sticky area will rip away.  They are easy to attach and are pretty comfortable.

"I have been looking for one of these for a long time and I am so excited to have found it! This looks like a normal ear warmer that your kids would wear in the winter when it's cold outside. Inside the fleece headband there are two super thin, somewhat soft speakers that lay right where your ears are! They have a really good sound quality, not tinny at all, a good balance of bass and treble. The wires come out of the back side and connect together at a small plastic toggle where it then is one single wire and offers a good amount of cord distance. The cord is also a braided cloth which helps keep it from tangling. You can wear it anywhere but I specifically like it for all the cub-scout campouts, sleepovers, and vacations with our kids. They are very comfortable and my son absolutely LOVES them! *I received a sample of this item at a discount in return for an honest and unbiased review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15LEQ6LU4FK97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017DPVX3W#wasThisHelpful","R15LEQ6LU4FK97","ADFOJ2MNIUTEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFOJ2MNIUTEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on the size chart I ordered a large and it fit perfectly!  The corset is very well made and has several support bars to keep the corset from rolling down or slipping.  The metal hook/eyelets fasten tightly and don't unhook accidentally.  There are three rows to choose from when connecting so that you get the perfect fit and you can use it comfortably if you gain or lose a little weight.  The floral lace/pattern is just as pretty in person as it is int he photograph.  The fabric around the corset is stretchy and comfortable and really gives your body a nice curve and makes your bust stand out.  I actually purchased this to use with a flowy white top and wear to a Renaissance Faire.  It is PERFECT!  It would also be very attractive over a bra and underwear and worn as something sexy.

"My husband is always taking his growler to and from the brewery and this travel bag is very helpful for taking it back and forth.  The bag is canvas and has a zippered bottom which is where you put the bottle into the holder.  The strap is attached by an adjustable strap with two plastic removable clips.  The top part of the bag is a stretchable neoprene which is great because it fits all sorts of bottlenecks.  There is also a hook that can be used to hang it from a hook and also a hand strap on the side of the bottle, which is great for using to pour the bottle.

There is one battery adaptor that powers all five strands (all the same color, white).  I love that the wires are flexible and versatile.  I think it would be a really cool addition to shadowboxes and other craft projects.  Easy to use, you just add batteries and power on.

There is a bag with a handle and is great for portability, makes it much easier to carry around. The bag has 2 clasps and a zipper to keep it closed and protected.  The unit includes three different valves so that inflating different items is easy (pin for balls, and two wider valves for blow up toys, beds, and other ). The analog pressure gauge on top helps you see what your pressure is. There are rubber feet on the bottom so that the unit doesn't slide much during use.

There are handles and a velcro closure strap and two side pockets for carrying extra small items (like the four included stakes).  The way that the stakes are made they can attach to the ground and the little piece goes over the mat to hold it down with pressure, rather than staking it through the mat.  The entire mat is nicely sewn on the edge so that is no ripping and tearing.  Easy to clean with a wet, soapy sponge.

"All of the similar back supports I have seen are a rigid plastic coating that isn't comfortable when you strap the support belt on, but this is all neoprene and is comfortable and flexible.  There are two sets of straps to get a really good fit, and extra support.  The material is breathable and won't make you sweat like other support belts do.  The belt and shoulder straps are completely adjustable to fit almost any size.  Using a belt like this helps take weight from your back and distribute it and also helps protect you from hernias.  It is exactly what I need when we get our 40' containers in and they need to be unloaded by hand.  Whoever is working on it can use the belt to keep themselves from getting injured.

"I actually bought this in a size larger than I would normally wear because of the size chart saying that a size 8 to 10 is a large, but it was somewhat too large.  I would have preferred a medium after seeing how the large fit.  I really like the shirt but it is thin and somewhat transparent so you need to wear the same colored bra or skin colored bra....or a tank top underneath which is what I think I will do.  It is very silky and soft material.  It lays nicely on your body and feels very comfortable.  The material is 94% Rayon and 6% Spandex.  It IS hand wash only and hang-to-dry.

"A surprisingly small shipping and storage size which is a HUGE plus in my small home.  Storage comes at a premium in my attic and this box makes it easy to store the entire tree in a small space.  The base is one connected piece that swivels into an X and uses three screws to hold it open to support the tree and hold the pole at the base of the tree itself.  There is a little shedding upon set up but it's nothing out of the ordinary.The tree comes in three separate sections and easily snaps together to make one large tree.  The arms are a flexible metal and come pressed together for shipping and need to be pulled out by hand and each little branch needs to be pulled and spread in order to ""fill out"" the empty spaces.  This process can vary in time depending on the look you are going for.  I'd say about 8-10 minutes to connect and stand up the tree and another 20-30 minutes to spread the branches to really fill it out as seen in the photo.  Any additional empty spaces can be filled easily with tinsel, garland, and ornaments.This is a 6' tree and would go great in a small house or apartment, or even a nice addition to your office at work!  In my townhome I am limited in space and this tree is going to make a GREAT surprise for the kids who have only had even smaller trees in the past.  The base looks a little sparse, I would recommend you get a Christmas tree blanket that goes around the bottom of your tree to hide the stand.I have included a couple of photos for you to see how it is shipped and how it looks put together (I didn't spend a lot of time spreading the branches but I will when the holidays come).  *I received a sample of this item in return for an honest and unbiased review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LLXZ6WZVTY07/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015XSQ3DG#wasThisHelpful","R2LLXZ6WZVTY07","ADFOJ2MNIUTEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFOJ2MNIUTEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This bag is a nice computer bag! To start, the silver colored hardware on the bag is heavy duty and well made. The zipper glides well on the zipper teeth and the clasps on the long strap (included inside bag) are sturdy while looking classy.

Right where the two handles are there is a slit to two ""hidden"" pockets that are the size of the bag, great for paper or cords.  The exterior zippered pocket is great for cords or earbuds other small accessories.  The design is stylish and the fabric is waterproof and feels durable. The construction and stitching are also strong and look to be very nicely made, the only problem I have with the item is that the two hooks that the shoulder strap attach to are plastic rather than metal.

"I've had a plastic burger press for years and it finally broke on me recently so I was on the search for a replacement press.  What I really like about this press is that it is exactly the same size every time.  The last one I had you could vary the size because it was a deep press.  I do recommend greasing up the bottom part a little bit so that the meat comes out easily from the mold.  One of the things about this press that I haven't seen in a lot of other brands is that it gives the ""grill lines"" so that when the meat plumps in the middle it won't get super thick and look like a meatball.  The aluminum press is well made and looks nice.  The handle is wood and is screwed on tightly.

It's a pretty simple procedure to put the unit together.  You should definitely plan on having about 30-45 minutes to put it together.The quality of the pieces are very nice.  The poles are hollow but are sturdy pieces of metal, not flimsy at all.  There are little plastic caps to protect the pieces from being metal-on-metal and prevent scratching between pole and the sides.  The wheels are solid and heavy duty with swivel locks on the sides.  The laundry bags are very nice and thick material and the poles that hold the bags have rubberized coating so that you don't get that metal-on-metal scratching on the top either.  They are a little darker brown in person but they are a neutral color so they match just about any decor.The poles that support the bags slide in and out of the cloth laundry bags which is a great feature that makes it easy for you to wash the bags with your laundry.  There is a mesh metal shelf along the bottom so that if your bags are heavy they won't sag and pull on the stability bars.  I also like that there is an extra bar midway down the back side of the sorter which gives it a much better support than I've seen in other laundry sorter units.This would be great in a bedroom or in a laundry room.  You could use it to sort colors, or if you prefer you can sort clothes based on who's they are.  In my family we would need one more bag (as we are a family of four) if we were to sort it by person.....but I think I would prefer to sort laundry by using one bag for towels and sheets, one bag for light colored clothing and one bag for darker colored clothing.  I saw one reviewer said that this was small but it is NOT small at all, it is much larger than the one I've been using for years.  I have a large capacity washer/dryer and each bag is about one large load.This is a GREAT sorter and it is much nicer than others I've seen (and MUCH nicer than the one I currently own).  I have included many photos of details for you to get a closer look.  *I received a sample of this item at a discount in return for an honest and unbiased review* and absolutely LOVE it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NKC9ODIOFZQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZGXUSS#wasThisHelpful","R3NKC9ODIOFZQ6","ADFOJ2MNIUTEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFOJ2MNIUTEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Elegant, stylish, sleek. This ""rabbit"" style wine bottle opener is really well made and all of the mechanics are made from metal rather than plastic. It is SO easy to use once you pop off the three plastic protectors, all you have to do is pull the top bar up, open the two side bars and insert a bottle (with the foil already cut off with the foil cutter included) and the squeeze the two side bars and press down the top bar down. Once in the down position you pull it back up and you are done!This is the easiest bottle opener I have used. I have tried the pressure ""popper"" opener which is easy to use but needs frequent, expensive cartridge changes, an electric opener which is easy to use but incredibly bulky and needs to stay on the counter for charging, and old fashioned corkscrews which are difficult to use.The bronze finish is very attractive and looks so much nicer than plain steel. The box is beautiful and great for storing the wine bottle opener. I'm SO happy with this set! *I received a sample of this item at a discount in return for an honest and unbiased review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FIHWAJVFVM8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014SCLOLE#wasThisHelpful","R3FIHWAJVFVM8C","ADFOJ2MNIUTEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFOJ2MNIUTEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I LOVE this ceramic tourmaline flat iron! It comes nicely packaged and has a storage bag with an insulated carry drawstring closure. The iron's heat is fully adjustable up to 400F (professional level heat) which can be adjusted by using the dial on the inside of the iron. Another professional feature is the heavy duty, fully rotating cord swivel at the end of the iron. The cord is a long and heavy duty cord so that you are not tethered to the outlet. There is a hook at the base which can be used on a hook for hanging storage. The iron did a great job at straightening my hair and making it look silky and shiny.  The iron also has a bonus of a glove to keep your hand safe from burns while using the iron.  *I received a sample of this item at a discount in return for an honest and unbiased review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTHBFFURTUKJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L3IWTMU#wasThisHelpful","RTHBFFURTUKJO","ADFOJ2MNIUTEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFOJ2MNIUTEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice, comfortable neoprene case. The inside is a silky smooth stretchy neoprene and the outside is more durable plastic which is stitched together well. There are a few nifty features on this case, Two holes at the bottom for cords (I suppose it's for the charging cord and headphones) and a long slot at the top to put your phone into the case. There is a smaller hole in an area on the side to hold a key or two. There are two slots for when you wrap the band around your arm and slide it through to velcro, I suppose this is for varying sized arms. The closer slot would be used for a tighter fit. There is also an individual slot to stick a license or credit card that is also tucked under the backside.

"I have been looking for one of these for a long time and I am so excited to have found it! This looks like a normal ear warmer that you would wear in the winter when it's cold outside but because it's made out of lycra it is actually even better for using when you are running. Inside the headband there are two super thin, somewhat soft speakers that lay right where your ears are (you can move them around if you need to)! They have a really good sound quality, with a good balance of bass and treble. The wires come out of the back side and connect together at a small plastic toggle where it then is one single wire and offers a good amount of cord distance to plug into your phone and put in a pocket or an armband. The cord is also a braided cloth which helps keep it from tangling and cord breakage. You can wear it anywhere but I specifically need it for all the cub-scout campouts, sleepovers, running, and vacations.

"These are so much cuter and brighter than your typical Christmas/holiday lights!  There are 50 brightly lit purple colored LED lights that run on solar power! No plug needed!!!! With each full charge (6-8 hours charge time) you get 8-10 hours of light. There is 21 ft including a 5ft lead line and the lights either flash or stay on.  They are weatherproof so you can use them safely outdoors in your trees, bushes, or attached to your home. There is a stake included if you want to mount the solar panel.

"These are very cute and come nicely packaged in a ziplock type bag.  They fit the fitbit nicely but the band isn't quite as nice as the real band that is made by the fitbit company.  The buckle is metal and there is a little wrap that holds the end from popping up.  The designs are even prettier in person, the colors really stand out and are much prettier than the standard black band that the fitbit comes with.  Both bracelets are a smooth plastic, not that grippy type.  They are also good at repelling sweat on the outside.

"Cute concept and great execution.  The little ""capsules"" have charcoal in them to freshen/purify and absorb moisture from stinky & moist environments.  The capsules also have a scented freshener in the middle which you can control the power of the scent by unscrewing the capsule a little or a lot depending on how much scent you want your shoes to have.  It's a fresh scent, much like cotton or powder, not flowery or perfume-y at all.  I got these for my teenage son to use in his expensive pair of shoes to help make them last longer.

"This is a huge, heavy battle rope that is used with a circuit for an intense arm/shoulder workout.  It sounds easy enough, you wrap the middle around something and grab a hold of the rubberized grip handles and whip them up and down but after about 20 seconds it burns and is very challenging to continue.  In my circuit I use it in 30 second intervals between other exercises....it's so intense I can barely continue.  My arms and shoulders feel sore.

The thinner, drawstring cloth bag is good for using inside of a gym bag or a purse.  Protection from scratching but not as solid as the hard-shell.  The cleaning cloth is handy to keep with you in any travel bag for cleaning the lenses without scratching them.I have included some detailed pictures of the glasses and accessories.  *I received a sample of this item in return for an honest and unbiased review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21BLW5Y6DMMPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010494K1Q#wasThisHelpful","R21BLW5Y6DMMPN","ADFOJ2MNIUTEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFOJ2MNIUTEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Super cute set of chalkboard stickers! There are six sheets of 8 stickers, all die-cut in different shapes (meaning there are 6 of the same die-cut if you take one from each page that match). They are easy to write on with the chalkboard pen and you can also find additional colors in any craft store.I use these on my plastic storage bins for organizing and easy identification without having to open them. I also have them on some of my glass pitchers and jars in my kitchen just because they are adorable. I also use them on my food storage pieces that have flour, sugar, coffee-mate, and powdered sugar so that I can see at a glance which is which!There are SO MANY creative uses for these!

This book not only has just about every Korean food that I've tasted before, but, also offers a chapter on tradition and culture of Korean food preparation and serving, and even a little bit about table manners!The 135 recipes themselves range in difficulty from easy to complicated, but most seem to be on the easy side.  Each recipe gives you a ""prep time"" and a ""cook time"" so that you know before you begin what to expect.The only thing that the book lacks is photos of the finished product.

"Very cute for little kids.  The colors are bright and look like graffiti, as shown in the photo.  The main compartment is thin, designed for a tennis racket to fit in.  The compartments have one zipper so the racket handle pokes to the left side when you zip it....if it had 2 zippers the design would work better for having the racket handle straight up.  The second, mouth shaped zipper compartment is bigger, for storage.  You can throw a sweater or shoes into that section.  There is also a smaller zippered compartment for little things like a small towel or other little accessories.  The arm straps are padded for comfort and there is a hook strap for carrying or for hanging.

"This badge holder is very nice for attending expos or for holding your work ID on a daily basis.  The color is a little darker than shown in the stock photo, but I personally think it's nicer.

There is also a thin black cord which you can use to attach other accessories such as keys or even a cell phone....the clasp on that is also detachable.

"While I understand the ""beauty"" effects that this pillow case claims to offer, I just like it because it is so smooth and comfortable and feels great to sleep on.  The pillow comes in a pretty gift box that includes a little drawstring bag with other color samples and an actual silk moth cocoon.  The pillow case is neatly folded and wrapped in plastic.  Once I took it out I saw that the top side is silk and the bottom is cotton.  As other people have mentioned in their reviews that they feel that this is a method to ""cut corners"" while in fact it is not.  Anyone who has had any experience with silk pillows would know that silks is very smooth and pillows tend to slide inside.  The reason that the bottom of this case is cotton is so that the case doesn't slide around.  I do like that there is a zipper to close the pillow so that it doesn't slide out.  It is incredibly nice and so soft and comfortable to sleep on.  *I received a sample of this item in return for an honest and unbiased review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QFIHQ3XDDR22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0116XKNFQ#wasThisHelpful","R3QFIHQ3XDDR22","ADFOJ2MNIUTEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFOJ2MNIUTEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update 06-17-15 => I just added the following to my pump.Etekcity Wireless Controlled Electrical Switch Socket Outlet with Remote (Battery Included)It was $11.99 for a single on/off remote control and works thru walls up to a 100 feet. It is awesome! The reason I decided against a phone app is because I didn't want to look for, or grab, my phone every time I needed hot water for my showers. Plus I am not going to make my house guests download an app hahaha. Good Luck !-------------------I had house guests arriving, so I could not receive this in time for my plumbers' arrival, so I had to buy it at Home Depot (same price). Don't hesitate, this pump is amazing! The plumber installed the pump on top of my water heater and the comfort valve in my upstairs bathroom. There is a clock on the pump. You can set it to be off (and the water heater works as before), 'on' all the time or set the timer to the positions that you want hot water. With a horrible drought in California I needed to at least try to do something. Before the pump, I got hot water at all my faucets quite fast but it has always taken over 10 minutes for the showers. That's a lot of wasted water. I now turn on the pump before each shower. Either by an APP on my phone or physically at the pump. I NEVER wait more then 20 seconds for hot water in the shower. The $215 (including tax) is a lot of water charges where I live, so it does not make sense financially. I had it installed because I wanted to help out with the drought and for my personal convenience.

"Wow I need to get out more...I had never heard of a pop up drain. For those that do not know what a pop up drain is...it just means you push the drain itself to go up and down. This drain is dark antique brass and really works well. I am very very pleased. I had rust around the old drain and I thought I would have to buy a new sink. This drain is big, it completely fills the hole, and it covered up all the rust (most drains are smaller then the hole). I am one happy customer.

"Insanely cheap so I bought it, yet I was suspicious. The plumber immediately said, Wow what a nice faucet! He installed it and it works perfectly. It is well designed and good looking. FYI this is a dark antique brass finish NOT shiny brass. My last faucet had round handles and hard to turn off while brushing my teeth. This faucet can be easily turned off with the back of your hand. For those of you curious about how it is so inexpensive, I have a theory. I think the faucet is not as stout and big as most faucets therefore less brass and less expensive. Because there is NO drain lever behind the faucet I also bought the pop up drain and it is also awesome. Don't hesitate, if you like how it looks just get it.

"Update 08-31-2015 - I doubt people are still reading my watch review but if you are I have now lost 50 pounds using this watch. It is not a magic watch it just makes you more aware. And second, people keep asking me when the phone notifications are coming. Polar recently sent this internal message to all watch owners. So here is the news and Good Luck!' Coming soonAndroid Smart NotificationsHeads up Android users! Weve continued to work really hard during the summer to get the Smart Notifications to your use and were excited to let you know the wait is almost over. Now were at the point where we need to do a few final test rounds and try to nip those nasty bugs out before we can launch the notifications for you guys as well. If all goes as planned, we expect to be able to bring the Android Smart notifications to the first Smart notification supported device during September. Then, well continue to gradually update the other supported devices in the upcoming three to four months following the first release.Team PolarTags: Polar A300, Polar FlowApp Android, Polar Loop 2, Polar M400, Polar V800 'Update 07-30-2015 - I am down 40 pounds now, what a relief! This watch and MyFitnessPal continue to amaze me. Technology is awesome how both programs sync between each other. I now have 6 watch bands and change them daily. Since I go to the gym and do several things I just start the recording on 'Circuit Training'. I turn it on when I start working out and stop it when I get home. That's about when my heart rate has dropped to normal hahaha. If you are serious about loosing weight and want to move more get this watch. Also use MyFitnessPal to help you count calories. It is a free app for your computer and phone. However I got the paid version. In my opinion it is faster and a better experience. Good luck !Update 05-15-2015 - I am down 27 pounds now, WOW! I love this watch and the app MyFitnessPal. The watch battery lasts 28 days on one charge. I have been more active since I got the watch and I pay more attention to my sleep. I know it is not an Apple Watch but in my opinion it is much better and functional.Update 4-23-2015 - I have lost about 15 pounds already using this watch and MyFitnessPal. I called Polar today to clarify some things. I hated turning on and off the exercise recordings for each exercise. Then it dawned on me, you don't have to. The guy at Polar told me that I was correct. The different types of exercises named in the watch are for those that like a breakdown of each exercise. I don't. He said they are simply 'labels' but each exercise is calculated the same way, by heart rate from the chest strap. So I took all the labels off my watch and just added one and called it 'workout'. So now I can do the bike, treadmill, weights and walking around the gym with just one recording.I also discovered that once your IOS device has your Bluetooth information you don't need to add it again even if it doesn't look connected in your settings. So if you use the Polar Flow app and the MyFitnessPal app this is what you do to update the apps. Simply open your Polar Flow app and push the bottom left button on your watch and let it sync all the watch data to the app which will also update MyFitnessPal app automatically. Now this is the catch, if you don't walk enough or workout enough, the calories that MyFitnessPal said you had for the day will change up or down when you sync the watch to the programs.Update 4-9-2015 - Well I still love this watch. I seem to be getting 28 days of charge. But it is hard to tell because every few days I take it off to update it on my computer, but only for a few minutes, and it is still fully charged. Yes I could do all that by Bluetooth but I am old school. It also seems to work well with MyFitnessPal. It syncs to that program which is awesome for trying to loose weight. If you use MyFitnessPal I suggest you enter all your foods nutrition values manually the first time so you have an extremely accurate calorie count. I have already lost 10 pounds. Yeah!I have noticed in the reviews that some people are wearing the chest strap all day. During the day the watch is a fitness tracker (pedometer, sleep monitor, vibrate to get up and walk). You only wear the chest strap during exercise whilst you record it. Polar does not make that clear in the instructions. I am sure you can wear your strap 24/7 if you want to but I don't. Polar changed the way the watch works since my last one. They now call it 'recording'. It may be more accurate this way. You record your exercise at the start and shut off the recording at the end of your workout. If I go to a special place like Disneyland for the day I have worn the strap and recorded it as an exercise under 'walking'. But there is no way I am wearing the strap all day. So, for just as a fitness tracker, you just put the watch on and go about your day and you don't push any buttons or record anything. This model does not come with a constant heart monitor (flashing lights under the watch) unless you wear the strap. I downloaded the PDF instruction manual and printed it out on my laser printer. I still have a lot to learn but that helps. Yes they totally need to work on their APPlication it could be far better then it is. I.E: Better explanation of what things are and more consolidation of data. Employees should never write the manual or instructions because they assume the end user knows what is obvious to them.Original Review - This is an amazing fitness tracker / workout watch. Amazon did not have it at the time I bought mine so I bought it at REI. I have been a Polar fan for over 20 years. I kept wondering why they had not developed a fitness watch like so many manufacturers. Polar has always been considered the Rolls Royce of workout watches. You put a strap around your chest and it keeps track of your vitals (including heart rate) during your workout at the gym or at home. The chest strap is far more accurate then the blinking lights under the bottom of the watch on the new trackers which Polar did not add. Polar introduced this A300 just ahead of the Apple watch. I am sure the Apple watch will be amazing but it starts at $349 and has an 18 hour battery life. The Polar A300 has a 4 week battery life and it is $140 without the heart chest strap. On the Polar USA site I bought 2 more awesome bands at about $28 each. This watch is the update to the Polar M400 which has GPS, the A300 does not. But I have no need for GPS since my memory works well and I know where I have been! Plus later this year there will be a firmware update to only this watch (not the M400), to give you phone notifications. Wow that will be AWESOME!So when you bring this watch home you download, on your computer (phone), the program / app that tracks all your vitals in one spot. There are both Android and IOS apps. You pull the watch out of the watch band and it has a USB plug on it. Plug it into your computer and the program / application will open. You should go thru the program / app and make any necessary changes. By default several things are public. I made everything private since I don't want to share my fitness details around the world hahaha. After you make your changes click on the sync and it downloads all your workouts to the program / app so you can watch your progress, recharges the watch (very fast) and checks the time etc.So basically once the watch is synced and charged up unplug it from the computer and put it back into your watch band. I wear mine 24/7 because I found it to be very comfortable. If you just want to use it as a fitness tracker, put it on your wrist and that's it (the instructions do not explain that). It will do everything automatically. If you don't move your butt every 50 minutes or so it will vibrate on your wrist and tell you to move. If you don't you will get a bad boy badge lol! Do not push the center button either. That means you are 'flipping off' the watch about moving and it will also give you a bad boy badge. On the face of the watch is a rectangular box that fills up solid as you move about. The empty area will have 'pixxy dust' sprinkling around but only when you are moving. It is very cool! In the evening it automatically stops bothering you about moving. It also somehow knows you are sleeping, also amazing. Inside the program it doesn't give you a bunch of mumbo jumbo junk about your sleep, it just gives you a percentage of how you slept. It tells you how many hours of sleep you got and how many hours of restless sleep you got.When you want to work out you put a Bluetooth chest band on. In the program you can set up your workouts. I deleted the presets and added just the ones that I need. It has indoor cycling, elliptical, weight lifting and etc modes. I also learned this the hard way and I think it's correct. You only push the center watch button when you want to work out (unless you want to see your step progress during the day). The center button starts to 'RECORD' your workout. So push the center button then use the right up or down buttons to pick your workout and start your exercise. In my case, I ride the indoor cycle, start to record and when I am done I stop recording. So when I go next to the elliptical I repeat that process. I do not know how to combine them yet. But it is super simple to record each type of exercise individually. FYI if you need to know, what time it is, as you workout, just hold your watch up to your chest strap and the screen will light up and tell you the time for a few seconds.Like I said the battery lasts 4 weeks but I am excited to see my progress so every few days I plug the watch in to see how I am doing. So it is always charged. But you can also recharge the watch in any USB charger. The last thing I would suggest, do the 'FITNESS TEST' on the very first day. Get the watch set up, sit in your favorite recliner with the chest strap on and do the test. This will give you a base line of your fitness and help you see your progress. Seriously buy this watch it is great. Good luck !","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TU9KQL9WI0WZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXHZI9Y#wasThisHelpful","R3TU9KQL9WI0WZ","A2CS1YMSJDFTFO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CS1YMSJDFTFO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 2 year old, original battery, in my Samsung Galaxy S4, started to heat up my phone and the battery life drained after just a couple hours. Obviously I went to the phone store and the big box stores to get a new battery. I was told that they only carry batteries for the latest phones and that I should check on Amazon. Duh, why didn't I think of that? Anyway, I bought this battery and it arrived in a couple of days from Amazon. I immediately installed it and charged it. It's been a couple weeks and it works really well. The battery so far has not gone below 60% on a pretty busy day. And the phone is not heating up as much. I am very happy.

"I have not been impressed with most Bluetooth headphones. The sound quality is inferior to a good wired headphone. So I wasn't expecting all that much when I received the review sample of the Air Fi Touch. I tried them on, and was immediately impressed with how comfortable they were. I held down the power button for a few seconds until the blue light came on. Holding the button down, I paired it with my portable device. I discovered quickly that sweeping my finger upward on the left ear cup increases the volume. Sweeping my finger with the down stroke on the left earcup lowers the volume. A swipe to the left starts the song over. A swipe to the right skips to the next song.I also own the $50 MEElectronics Atlas on ear headphones, and that headphone has a dynamic sound with deep bass and crisp treble, with a slightly withdrawn midrange. It's a terrific headphone for the price.This headphone is not as crisp and punchy and clear as the Atlas, and it doesn't play as loud as the Atlas, but it is more balanced. I would characterize the sound as balanced and warm and a bit veiled and gentle. The bass, the midrange, and the treble are well-behaved. The Air Fi Touch sounds more dynamic and clear when you raise the volume, it doesn't get harsh or break up like with cheaper sounding headphones.The Air Fi Touch delivers the goods when listening to Michael Jackson's Billie Jean or Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines.Country music and classical sounds good also, though those who like big bass or crisper treble might prefer the Atlas.The Bluetooth headphone impressed me with how well it sounded for the price and for being a Bluetooth headphone, so I tried plugging in the 3/5 cable that comes with it to see if it sounded better. I honestly could not tell the difference. The Air Fi Touch sounded just as well wireless as it did wired.The headphone is comfortable, but I am not sure I would recommend it if you are a janitor because as you bend over to sweep and mop and pick things up, the headphones can slide off your head.It is a much better choice for wearing while you are sitting on the train or the bus or taking a walk.The Air Fi Touch headphone will stay paired to your portable device. But you're farther ahead to keep your portable device in your pocket. If you leave your phone on the counter and wander away with the headphones on, the signal starts to cut out after about 15 or 20 feet.In my honest opinion, this Bluetooth headphone is close or equal in sound quality to the much more expensive Bose on ear wireless headphone, but not as good sounding as the Atlas or the Sennheiser Urbanite.I did get the opinion of someone else who also has the Atlas, and they felt that the Air Fi Touch headphone sounded equally good, they couldn't decide which one they liked better. So your mileage may vary.If you absolutely need a Bluetooth on ear headphone, this or the Meelectronics Air Fi Matrix 2 are your best options under $100.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO9HUJCQOFS75/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S9ZZK7G#wasThisHelpful","RO9HUJCQOFS75","A633NIAR4JJAR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A633NIAR4JJAR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Noontec has been making quality on ear headphones for several years, all of which bear a striking resemblance to the Beats Solo headphone line. The Noontec  Zoro came out first, and for around $50, it is a very good sounding, balanced headphone with good bass and a natural sounding midrange, but a cloudy sounding treble, which made the overall sound seem a tad blurry. Nevertheless, they sounded superior to the Beats Solo and Beats Solo HD in every way, which were plagued with a loose muddy, accentuated bass and a caved in sounding midrange.Next came the Noontec  Zoro HD, which had the same balanced sound profile as the Zoro (and looks identical), but the Zoro HD had better clarity and refinement. Like the difference between watching a standard definition TV and a high definition TV, the Zoro HD was just clearer and sharper. The treble was still a bit cloudy and veiled, but it was definitely better, and it punched above its price in the sound department. I preferred the Zoro HD to all the other portable on ear headphones I had, including the MEElectronics Atlas and Koss Portapro.If I could improve the Zoro HD, I would make it smoother sounding, more refined, and I would construct bigger, plusher ear cups.Enter the Noontec Zoro II HD! The build quality is better than before, it still folds up into a compact design so it can be carried in the Noontec pouch. The cable is removable. I tried using other 3/5 millimeter cables, including the VModa XS cable, and there was no difference in sound quality. The Zoro cable does great. It is flat with a push button to pause and play.It is a plastic headphone with plenty of soft leather-like material on the headband so it feels soft and comfortable on my bald head. The ear cups are bigger and plusher (!), so it not only feels more comfortable for longer listening sessions, it makes the sound richer and fuller (to my ears).The sound quality is clear, balanced, neutral, and punchy! The bass is plump and tight and extends down deep. The midrange is clear and natural, and the treble is more articulate and clear than previous Zoros. Those who want an added bit of sparkle might want to use the treble boost on their ipod or iphone or Spotify equalizer.Acoustic music with spare instrumentation makes it sound like you are there at the show! I appreciated that while listening to Neil Diamond's Hot August Night (256 mp3) on my Sansa Clip+ and while listening to George Philipp Telemann's Two Violins and a Guitar classical album.But I also rocked out to the Beatles and Led Zeppelin and Michael Jackson, and the Zoro II HD handled everything I threw at it. It is more refined than other Zoros, so you can turn it louder without the sound breaking up.I also used the Zoro II HDs with my Sony MHC G55 receiver (sounds great!!!!) and with my ipod classic and iPod touch 5th generation. It also sounds really nice with my Galaxy S4, my Sansa Clip+ and my iPad Air 2.How do these compare with the new Beats Solo 2? The Solo 2 is the best headphone I have heard from Beats, and it sounds similar to these! The Solo 2 has a more refined treble. But the Zoro II HD has better bass and mids, the Solo 2 still sounds a little loose and leaky in the bass, which adds a muffledness to the midrange. Keep in mind that the Solo 2 is $200, but the Zoro II HD is under a hundred dollars! Me personally I prefer these because of its clearer, more balanced profile.I would be quite pleased having these as my main on ear on the go phone. I think they are more balanced and stylish than any on ear phone I've heard in the $100 price range, and I even prefer them to more expensive on ears like the Sennheiser Momentum On Ear and the Sol Republic Master Tracks.To get a better on ear headphone, you would have to spend double the money or more. These are a great bang for the buck and is a very noticeable upgrade from the previous Zoro headphones. If you have the Zoro or Zoro HD, I would still definitely recommend upgrading to these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5Q2WX6GSLB6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWRR8OA#wasThisHelpful","R5Q2WX6GSLB6Y","A633NIAR4JJAR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A633NIAR4JJAR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Brainwavz is known for their lauded budget audiophile over ear headphones (Brainwavz HM5) as well as their balanced and neutral in-ear headphones (the Brainwavz R3) which rival similar earphones from HiFiman. These do a great job of reproducing what is in the recording, but can sound flat to some.This particular in ear monitor is a more fun sounding earphone, with big, deep bass and detailed treble. Pop music fans will appreciate the beat and the pulse and the shimmer of Locked Out of Heaven by Bruno Mars, Party Rock by LMFAO, Jive Talkin' by the Bee Gees, and Lights by Ellie Goulding. The bass is tight and deep and propulsive without bleeding into the mids, and the highs are detailed without being shrill. The midrange is a bit recessed, and as a result, songs with acoustic guitar and breathy female vocals sound more distant and rough. The sound signature is sharp and clear, but lacks the warmth and the smoothness of the Brain Wavz R3 (but those cost more) and the Shure SE 425 (those cost MUCH more).The soundstage is fairly wide for an in ear headphone, and they isolate well, the world will not hear your music, and you will not hear the world! The cable is a thick, flat, tangle resistant, plastic material, which I prefer.If you like oldies or 70's soft rock, or something neutral where no frequency is accentuated, get the R3.

"Cate Kincaid is an evangelical Christian assistant private investigator who is just getting into her uncle's line of work and liking it. But she also has a knack for getting herself into troublesome situations, and she is blessed to have a conscientious, gentlemanly boyfriend (Mitch) to come to her rescue.Cate has learned from her semi-retired uncle Joe that everyone is a suspect, and we get to read her thoughts as she questions and queries clients and suspects alike.This case is particular troublesome because it involves more than one murder, and our young PI soon finds herself in her fair share of peril. The novel was absorbing, at times humorous, and a good followup to the first Cate Kincaid novel. Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4GZV84ORBQA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B85M50Y#wasThisHelpful","R4GZV84ORBQA7","A633NIAR4JJAR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A633NIAR4JJAR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Plantinga makes a great argument that we not only read for preaching illustrations, but to get us in touch with the human predicament, the human experience, and parts of life we don't normally reflect about.Even if we never retell the stories we read about, they will inspire us to craft analogous analogies in our sermons. Plantinga also suggests that wide reading gives us greater wisdom and expands our vocabulary.

"Update: The SAME DAY I posted this review, the review unit died. It just turned off and stopped working.I received a 16800 mah version of this at no cost in exchange for writing a review. Here are my comments.This is a bulky, but terrific power bank. It has enough juice to charge an iPhone 8 or 9 times and a Samsung Galaxy S4 six times. It charges my phones as fast as a 2.1 wall charger. It takes about 2 hours and 20 minutes to charge my phones from 0-100%. You can even charge two phones at the same time! Very handy!I rubberband my phone and my power bank together and I use four inch micro usb and lightning cables to charge my phones.It takes about 20 hours to recharge the power bank from empty to full. That's the only downside. You can charge a phone while the device itself is recharging, but it slows things down alot and heats the device up.I highly recommend this device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AUT9J7QXM28E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJ0K9NO#wasThisHelpful","R1AUT9J7QXM28E","A633NIAR4JJAR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A633NIAR4JJAR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dr Beale does a nice job expounding and applying 1 and 2 Thessalonians. This is a good commentary to be used in conjunction with a more significant and academic exegetical work like Gene Green's commentary or the soon to be released tome by Jeffrey Weima in the BECNT.There is not much information about Thessalonica and Macedonia in the introduction, and on occasion, the amount of application oriented material outweighs the exegetical and expositional.But generally speaking, Beale's applications are more on target and accurate than many other application oriented commentaries. That was very impressive to me.Not everyone will subscribe to all of Beale's views, some of which are novel (The temple in 2 Thessalonians 2:4 is a spiritual image for the church, the restrainer in verses 6-7 is an angel, the rapture is posstrib).But these points aside, I found the commentary to be very helpful for preaching preparation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15K4SDHGNCUML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006CDQIWI#wasThisHelpful","R15K4SDHGNCUML","A633NIAR4JJAR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A633NIAR4JJAR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bruce's book provides fantastic coverage of the Apostle's Paul's life and thought. He discusses Paul's Jewish background in Tarsus, his zealous Pharasaism, his conversion from unbelief to Christ, and his missionary journeys and theology. Bruce is a reliable guide as he takes you through the narratives in Acts and the supplementary material in the epistles. He is open to all of the Pauline corpus being authentic writings of Paul, and even if someone else had a hand with Ephesians, (Bruce is not convinced), then that someone else did a great job representing Pauline thought.I especially enjoyed the discussions of the Corinthian correspondence (Paul's teaching about marriage in 1 Corinthians 7 in particular, I found it to be very pastoral and sensible) and the proposition that the Onesimus in Philemon went on to become bishop of Ephesus years later.Bruce believes that the heart of Pauline teaching is that true religion is not a matter of rules and regulations, that Christ makes us all one in Him, that people matter more than things, principles, and causes (not sure about this one, I would want to qualify it), and that unfair discrimination against others is an offense to God. I think the first two points are the strongest.One of the most INTERESTING books on Paul I have ever read. Bruce is like an investigative reporter, digging into the New Testament documents and historical sources to present the clearest picture of Paul. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCKWFHG2LUA8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802847781#wasThisHelpful","RCKWFHG2LUA8O","A633NIAR4JJAR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A633NIAR4JJAR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Thiselton does a great job of sketching Paul's life and surveying his thought. He rightfully sees the heart of Paul's Christopogy within an apocalyptic framework. Not everyone will agree or subscribe to his view that Israel in Romans nine through eleven refers to the church rather than ethnic Israel, but there are many solid insights here. Borrowing from J.A.T Robinson, he sees the career of Christ in Paul's writings as the exact reverse of Adam's career, a point I had not considered before.He also observes that James 2 is not a contradiction ofPaul's teaching about justification by faith, it is a correction of the abuse of that teaching.A quick read and strongly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGLW2LW0SYLE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F44LQ8W#wasThisHelpful","RGLW2LW0SYLE5","A633NIAR4JJAR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A633NIAR4JJAR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a great book. Billy Graham is 93 years old and getting ready to go to be with the Lord, and he shows us how we can prepare for our own post-retirement years in heaven. He says we should stay active for the Lord wherever we are, whether it's our retirement home or in a nursing home. We can devote our time to praying for others, to volunteering at a rehabilitation center, or writing letters of encouragement.He also says we need to come to grips with the reality that we can't do the things we could do years earlier, and to concentrate on what we can do. He says that even though exercise has some value and we should take care of the bodies God has given us, we're still going to get old, and we need to accept certain limitations.He stresses the importance of continuing to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, reading Scripture and sharing His love with others.He also says we should have a clearly outlined will so that there will be no family feuding after our departure. Be looking to God in prayer and blessing others around us, we forget about our problems and model for others how to age with grace.This is a book you can read in a few hours, but it will stay with you for the rest of your life.

"I expected more discussion of the books themselves, but what we get from this book is a heartwarming tale of a father and a daughter who make a reading promise. The dad reads to his daughter at least one chapter a night, no matter what, for 100 days. Then when they hit 100, they decided to try for a thousand. The reading streak continues until the daughter goes to college. The narrative of the last night of the streak where the dad reads to Alice on the stairwell of her dormitory is very touching.Alice loves the Frank L Baum Wizard of Oz books, and the Lewis Carroll Alice in Wonderland books especially, but she becomes a lover of books in general. Her father is a library, and he takes it hard when the school library where he works gets rid of all the books in favor of making room for more computers.Both father and daughter struggle to fill the gap in their lives following the end of the Streak, but they continue to maintain their love for reading.

"Room is about a nineteen-year-old college student who has been kept as a prisoner in a barred-up garden shed for seven years.  The room has a hot plate and a sink, a toilet and a television.  Her captor brings her enough food to survive (mostly canned food and junk food), disciplines her by cutting off electricity and heat, and rapes her several times a week.  She conceives and gives birth to a son she calls Jack, and Room is told from his perspective, which takes a bit of getting used to, because Jack is only five years old, and he doesn't understand figures of speech, or that he is a prisoner, or that there is a whole world outside of the room he's lived in his whole life.His mother does everything she can to bury her anguish and to make life as normal as she can for Jack.  They watch Dora the Explorer on television, they play ball together (the ball is a bag stuffed with paper), and ""Ma"" even reads the stories of Jesus to him.Slowly as the weeks go by, Ma tells Jack about the outside world and that this is where she wants to return.  Together, they attempt to escape from the dreary shed.  The suspense is tremendous, and the book is hard to put down.The broad theme of the book is about coping and learning to survive with extremely trying circumstances.  Jack's mother is an extraordinary person who copes with life as a captive while trying to make her son's life as stress free as she can, while Jack must later learn to cope with life in a world he knows next to nothing about.  This theme should resonate with the Christian community, for we too must cope with trying circumstances (even if they are less harsh than the ones Jack and his mother face).  Like Jack and his mother, we too have the stories of Jesus to inspire us and give us strength.  This book definitely touches on issues that matter to parishioners and can be a preacher's source for illustrative material.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI9VKJ6P7J58W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316098329#wasThisHelpful","RI9VKJ6P7J58W","A633NIAR4JJAR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A633NIAR4JJAR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first volume dealt with the individual theologizing and ethicizing of Paul, Peter, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and others (Witherington 2009).  Witherington's goal for the second volume is to allow the New Testament writers to articulate their own synthesis of material from Jesus and the Hebrew Scriptures (Witherington 2010, 29).  He presents the theology of Jesus and then announces, ""I will consider how the various New Testament writers add to, or reinforce, or delete from such a discussion.  I will follow the same procedure with the issue of the ethic of Jesus and then of the New Testament writers"" (Witherington 2010, 29-30).After some preliminary considerations, Witherington discusses the symbolic universe of Jesus and the New Testament writers in chapter two, a storied universe that speaks of God, Jesus, the cross, substitutionary sacrifice, sin, the risen Lord, new/true people of God, the Spirit, and spiritual gifts (Witherington 2010, 60-82).  He contends that the New Testament contributors shared this symbolic worldview because they each drew from and relied on the Hebrew Scriptures (Witherington 2010, 82).  As an example, Witherington lists ninety-one examples where New Testament writers and personalities drew from the Psalms for authority (Witherington 2010, 82-89).Chapter three discusses the narrative thought world of Jesus and the New Testament writers.  Jesus presents Himself as the Danielic Son of Man who tells stories of His own making, but refers to the stories of Adam, Solomon, Noah, and other Old Testament luminaries.  His stories have a dark edge, noting the lost condition of His own people (Luke 15) and their danger of experiencing judgment (Matthew 11).Paul's storied world is also rooted in the Old Testament, and his Christological hymns recall wisdom psalms such as Psalm 1 and Psalm 119, as well as the non-canonical Wisdom of Solomon (Witherington 2010, 118).  After discussing the thought worlds of the other New Testament contributors, Witherington concludes, ""Monotheistic, messianic, eschatological thinking characterized the thought world of all these early Jews.  They believed they lived in the age of the fulfillment of prophecy, the climax of history, the arrival of final redemption, and judgment that would begin with the household of God"" (Witherington 2010, 201).The next few chapters examine what can be said about a shared set of beliefs when it comes to New Testament theology.  Christ Himself is the basis of New Testament thought, so Witherington begins with what the writers say about Him.  Paul sees Christ as ""Lord,"" the true emperor of the world, the anointed one who died for the sins of the world and rose again, the true Israel who comes to save a world gone wrong (Witherington 2010, 213-18).  There is also a discussion of Christ as ""God"" in the Pauline letters.  He discusses Phil 2:6-7 and Rom 9:5 and Titus 2;13, concluding that Paul does attribute divine status to Christ (Witherington 2010, 218-23).  Witherington shows that Paul taught the essential humanity of Christ in passages such as Rom 5:15 and 1 Tim 2:5 (Witherington 2010,223-28).Witherington also shows that Hebrews shares with Paul a high view of Christ and a belief in the penal substitutionary death of Jesus in passages such as Rom 3:25 and Hebrews 9:14 (Witherington 2010, 233-45).  We see the same theme in 1 Peter, Mark and in Revelation.  His conclusion is that we do not need to talk about dueling Christologies in early Christianity, but rather a kaleidoscope of images and storylines that could be applied to Him (Witherington, 2010, 245).The remaining chapters demonstrate that the New Testament writers were not only on the same page with regard to seeing Jesus as Christ, risen Lord, God, and atoning sacrifice, but they also agreed that believing and behaving go together.  Divine action demands a human response (Witherington 2010, 735).  This sums up the 1700 pages of both Indelible Image volumes (Witherington 2010, 735).In a way, this book answers some of the questions raised by Carson's Collected Writings on Scripture (Carson 2010).  The researcher felt that much of Carson's argumentation was convoluted and circular in reasoning, while Witherington shows clearly from Scripture that there can be a collective theology of the New Testament.This book gives the researcher a fortified theological base to draw from when preaching through the New Testament.  It will provide food for thought when preaching about the substitutionary death of Christ, the deity of Christ, and the Christological hymns of Paul.  The biggest preaching point is that believing and behaving go hand in hand; you can't have one without the other.  There are a number of people in the parish who think that because they walked down an aisle or raised their hand or took communion that they are automatically saved regardless of how they live their lives.  But Witherington reminds us that faith without works is dead (Jas 2:17).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K1VNXMFCBMM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830838627#wasThisHelpful","R1K1VNXMFCBMM1","A633NIAR4JJAR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A633NIAR4JJAR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Foner's purpose is to trace the evolution of Lincoln's ideas in the context of the broad antislavery movement (Foner 2010, xii-xvii).  He states from the outset that Lincoln was antislavery, but he was not an abolitionist and never claimed to be one (Foner 2010, xii-xvii).  His personal wish was that men everywhere could be free, but he was also a legislator and later a President who recognized the South's right to own slaves (Foner 2010, xii-xvii).Lincoln's own antislavery views evolved through the years.  In 1849, Lincoln (anxious for a job in the Zachary Taylor administration) proposed a plan for all slave children born in the District of Columbia after January 1, 1850, to labor as ""apprentices"" for their owners ""until they reached adulthood, when they would become free"" (Foner 2010, 57).  Later as President, he proposed a number of plans for ""gradual, compensated emancipation"" (Foner 2010, 57).It wasn't until January 1, 1863, when he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, that Lincoln would take a different tack.  As late as the summer of 1862, he was worried that if he issued a general emancipation ""half the army would lay down their arms and three other states would join the rebellion"" (Foner 2010, 210).  He was quoted in the press as saying, ""I would save the union.  I would save it in the shortest way under the Constitution .... My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and it is not either to save or to destroy slavery.  If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do that"" (Foner 2010, 227).In the end, he chose to take the path of general emancipation.  On January 1, 1863, late in the afternoon, he went to his office to sign the Proclamation, which said that all the slaves in the areas to which it applied--over three million men, women, and children ""are and henceforth shall be free"" (Foner 2010, 240).  The proclamation only had bearing on the slaves in the Confederate states.  There was no way at the time to enforce the Proclamation in the South, but then again, the Emancipation Proclamation was a political document more than anything else, and it signaled Lincoln's determination to end slavery without compensating slave owners (Foner 2010, 240-43).  More significantly, it altered the nature of the Civil War, the relationship of the government to slavery, and the course of American history (Foner 2010, 244).  Foner concludes, ""Lincoln did not enter the White House expecting to preside over the destruction of slavery.  A powerful combination of events, as we have seen, propelled him down the road to emancipation and then to a reconsideration of the place blacks would occupy in a post-slavery America"" (Foner 2010, 335).Signing the Emancipation took a lot of guts.  Lincoln's hand was shaking from exhaustion when he picked up his pen, so he laid it down.  He took a moment and said, ""I do not want to appear as if I hesitated.""  Then he picked up his pen again and signed the proclamation (Foner 2010, 239).Having the courage to do what is right is an issue that matters to people in the pew.  Having the guts to stand by your convictions in a tumultuous world is something we applaud and admire.  The signing of the Emancipation Proclamation will make a great sermon illustration, as will a number of other stories from the life of Lincoln.But we also at times see Lincoln's weakness, his willingness to say what is politically expedient in order to save political face.  We see his humanity, his desire to please his base. We see Lincoln as a conflicted man. I appreciated the author's mostly nonbiased portrait of the 16th President.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBA0ZLKT3QXWT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=039334066X#wasThisHelpful","RBA0ZLKT3QXWT","A633NIAR4JJAR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A633NIAR4JJAR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is written for anyone wanting to know more about the Bible, Christianity and ""the God who is there.""  Carson runs through the Bible in fourteen chapters, and each one focuses on one or more passages from the Scriptures, unpacks it, and ""tries to build connections with the context, drawing the lines together to show how they converge in Jesus"" (Carson 2010b, 5).  Each chapter tells the reader something special about the God who is there.The first chapter is an exposition of Genesis 1-3.  Carson says that even if you believe that the universe was created by a big bang fifteen million years ago, ""sooner or later you are forced to ask the question, ""Where did that highly condensed material come from"" (Carson 2010b, 11)?  These chapters in Genesis tell us that God exists, He made everything, there is only one of Him, and He is a talking God (Carson 2010b, 14-15).  These chapters also tell us that we are made in His image, we were made male and female, and we were made well (Carson 2010b, 21-22).Chapter two is called ""The God Who Does Not Wipe Out Rebels.""  It is a discussion of Genesis 3.  Carson's careful exposition shows that people willfully rebelled against God, and that we need to be saved and reconciled to Him more than anything else (Carson 2010b, 37-38).Chapter three is called ""The God Who Writes His Own Agreements,"" and here is where Carson examines Genesis 12, 15, 17, and 22 and shows that even though Abraham sinned and Isaac was a wimp and Jacob a trickster, the God who is there makes and keeps His promises (Carson 2010b, 47-49).Carson's discussion in chapter four is about ""The God Who Legislates.""  He looks at the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20, and also at Exodus 32-34 and concludes that the giving of the law was an act of compassion and grace and with the sacrificial system, it points the way to Jesus (Carson 2010b, 64-65).The next chapter is called ""The God Who Reigns,"" which is a discussion of the line of Davidic kings which lead the way to Jesus, the greatest King of all (Carson 2010b, 67-79).Chapter six is called ""The God Who is Unfathomably Wise.""  Carson takes the reader through the Psalms, where the God who is there makes His people sing in thanksgiving, contrition, lament, and reflection (Carson 2010b, 92), and he also zips through Proverbs, Job, and Ecclesiastes, where more lessons are shared with God's people.In chapter seven, Carson discusses ""The God Who Became a Human Being.""  He looks at some of the great messianic prophecies of the Old Testament (including Isaiah 53), and also at Matthew 1 and John 1.  He became a human being to show us the Father and to be the meeting place between sinners and the Father (Carson 2010b, 114-15).Chapter eight is called ""The God Who Grants New Birth,"" which naturally leads to an exposition of John 3:1-15.  We receive new life, or new birth, by believing in Christ (Carson 2010b, 130).Chapter nine is a discussion about ""The God Who Loves.""  Carson looks at John 3:16-21.  He says that the measure of God's love is Jesus, and the purpose of His love is that we might have life (Carson 2010b, 135-42), and the way to experience this life is through faith in Him.Carson goes on in chapter ten to discuss ""The God Who Dies--and Lives Again.""  There is an exposition of pertinent passages in Matthew's Gospel, noting that the man who is mocked as king is King"" (Carson 2010b, 149).  He also observes that the One who is utterly powerless is transcendently powerful (Carson 2010b, 151), and that the One who can't save Himself saves others (Carson 2010b, 153), and that the One who was dead lives again, inspiring us to say to Him ""My Lord and my God"" (Carson 2010b, 162).Chapter eleven discloses ""The God Who Declares the Guilty Just,"" and goes into an exposition of Romans 3-4.  This encourages a response of faith (Carson 2010b, 180).  Chapter twelve introduces a discussion of ""The God Who Gathers and Transforms His People.""  There are expositions of Eph 2:1-22 and Ephesians 4-5 which demonstrate that God is at work making His people more like Jesus (Carson 2010b, 181-96).Carson converses in chapter thirteen about ""The God Who is Very Angry.""  He focuses on Rev 14:6-20 and shows that there is a place called Hell where the wicked are tormented forever and ever.  They do not want to be there, but neither do they want to bend the knee to Jesus (Carson 2010b, 206).  We must warn the people we love that there is such a place for those who refuse the love of Christ (Carson 2010b, 206).The closing chapter is called ""The God Who Triumphs.""  Carson expounds Revelation 21-22 and shows that God's glory will be manifested ""in the church, in the new Jerusalem"" (Carson 2010b, 215).This is one of Carson's best and most accessible books, even more helpful than his collected writings on Scripture discussed earlier.  Each chapter contains tasty chunks of expositional meat ready to be passed on to the people, and so this book will be consulted again for sermonic insights. o","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24V1HUTO1QN8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801013720#wasThisHelpful","R24V1HUTO1QN8A","A633NIAR4JJAR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A633NIAR4JJAR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The silk side of the pillow is very comfortable. I never use the cotton side, its just not as nice. The cotton side is likely just to keep the cost down since their pillowcases that are silk on both sides are more expensive. i love the zipper, I toss and turn and my other pillowcases tend to fall halfway off. This pillow case completely wraps your pillow and the zipper secures it. The silk is very quality and you can easily tell the difference between this and he sateen knock-offs you can find at the big box stores.The downside is... its just one pillowcase. So you have to buy a few to cover all of your pillows, that makes these a bit more expensive.[I received this product for he purposes of an honest review]","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AE3DBC73Q9SR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0116XKNFQ#wasThisHelpful","R3AE3DBC73Q9SR","AETBIYGN4IYG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETBIYGN4IYG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As you can guess this product is a giant block of salt. I got one of these to try some creative things with cooking and there are several things I wish I understood beforehand. Cooking on a salt block requires much more prep time and clean up. There are 3 uses for salt blocks: presentation, cooking, and chilling.Presentation block: Salt blocks look cool. its pink and marbled and when you serve your guests on a salt block people will be impressed. Its a conversation piece. and food you serve on it will pick up a very small amount of the salt from sitting on it. If you plan to use the block as a presentation block, don't cook on it. once you heat the block up you lose much of the pink color, you'll get cracks, and by cooking food on it it will darken he surface. Best just to have a separate presentation/serving block.Chilling block: Pop this block in the fridge for a few hours to let it get nice and cold and you can use it for deserts! Pour chocolate on it and when the chocolate hardens you can break off nicely salted chocolate pieces. Or it works great on fruits and cheeses. It takes about an hour or longer in fridge to get it sufficiently cold.Cooking block: This is what most use the block for. WORD OF CAUTION.... Do not heat these up too fast or they can explode! You want to heat gradually, increasing temperature every 15 minutes until its hot enough. These can withstand temps of over 500 degrees. You can cook on a grill, stove or oven (I wouldn't use in gas oven though, salt absorbing moisture in oven can be a problem). You can cook food on the block or under the block (i.e. chicken on a grill with block on top of chicken. weight of the block presses on the meat infusing salt and flavor).Cleaning: After you cook on these you want to wait until its back to room temperature before cleaning the block. This can take a few hours to get cool again. You don't want to rush this since rapid temperature fluctuations can cause it to crack. Use water and a brush to scrape off food bits. Don't use soap for obvious reasons. Also when your cooking on these, you might make a huge mess! if you cook juicy items or too close to the edge that grease or juices will just run right off the block!I would recommend getting a salt block guide or cookbook to learn all the ways to use these blocks. Mark Bitterman makes a good one, that helped me learn proper way to use the block. Have fun cooking with these!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFDOLGK5J6RS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQHMKNS#wasThisHelpful","RFDOLGK5J6RS8","AETBIYGN4IYG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETBIYGN4IYG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This took me a few tries to figure it out, not exactly the most intuitive device. Out of the box you get the main DVR unit, some USB cables, a mount bracket (suction cup), a car charger and an instruction booklet. The device is smaller than it seems in the pictures which is great since it doesn't take up a large amount of your windshield (don't want it obstructing your vision). The device easily fits into the windshield mount and you stick it on the windshield (suction cup style) and then you twist a small knob to lock it and it won't fall off. The battery life isn't good so you need this plugged in pretty much the whole time your using it. The USB cable plus in at the top which leaves you with an unsightly wire hanging down to your car charger.A micro SD card is required for recording. As soon as you turn this on it starts recording if a card is in. The unit asked me if I wanted to format the card and I opted not to and it worked fine. The recordings continuously make small video files and when the card fills up it deletes the older files with new ones. Video and audio quality is better than I expected. The unit can play back video or you can plug an HDMI cable in (or take SD card out and watch on a computer). You can also take still pictures with the device as well (button on top right).This would come in handy if you're ever in a car accident.[I received this product for the purposes of an honest review]","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q5PV1XIMN3VJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014ISLQZC#wasThisHelpful","R3Q5PV1XIMN3VJ","AETBIYGN4IYG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETBIYGN4IYG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Step up your beer game! Honestly these really aren't going to make your beer taste that much better, that's mostly the brewmasters job. However, these are nice glasses and they do add to your beer experience. The stem keeps your hand from warming up your beer, and the bell shape can help release aroma, while the lip of the glass gives a nice amount of head (foam).The glasses are fairly thin so you want to be careful with them. They can be washed in dishwasher but I would handwash them. They are fragile and residue from dishwasher can affect taste of beer.I'm too old to drink beer out of a red solo cup.

"So I'm not a professional photographer or anything like that. But like most people I take a bunch of pictures with my cell phone. This set of lenses are great for taking pictures when I go out of town and am likely to take more pictures.Out of the box you get 2 phone clips, the lenses, and a small bag to carry them in. Having 2 clips allows you to snap them on and off pretty quickly. I tried them on both my front camera and back camera on two different phones (Samsung Galaxy S4 and LG G3). This should fit just about any smartphone since you can slide the lens along the clip to get the fit right. One thing that did bother me with the clip is that after a few uses the small cushion on the inside of he clip started to come off and that left adhesive gunk on my phone (easily wiped off but still an annoyance). If you use a thick phone case this will not fit (i.e. otterbox cases are too big). In fact most cases are probably too big. you would need a fairly slim case to allow this to fit, or just go without the case.On to the lenses! So most important thing about this review should be what kind of pics can you can take.FISH EYE LENS: Tried out this lens first, because well fish eye stuff is fun. The fish eye lens is a wide angle lens so you can get more in the pic than without it. The lens also sortof creates a curved shape to the pics (center bulges out). You can see from my attached pics of the football game that the fish eye captures more of the stadium while the pic without the lens looks closer (both pics taken at same spot seconds apart). The closer you are to your subject the greater he fish eye effect.WIDE ANGLE LENS / MACRO LENS: The wide angle lens and the macro lens are connected together. You can unscrew them to get the different lens effects. The Macro Lens is for super close-ups, and I mean really close up. You need to be right up on your subject or else the lens will make things blurry. Its great to get fine details in your pic.Overall these aren't professional quality but your also not paying professional prices or using a professional camera.

"For starters most USB cables are pretty much standardized in terms of fit and performance (the ""U"" in USB does stand for Universal after-all). So these perform exactly the same as any other USB 2.0 cable. They will fit just about any device that uses micro USB ports (just about any android tablet or smartphone, most cameras etc). So I just typed a bunch of words describing this as the same as any other cable, why did I give it 5 stars?DURABILITY: These are far more durable than the standard cheap USB cables the come with smartphones and tablets (and other devices). Typically the cables used to charge your smartphones and tablets are after-thoughts by the manufacturers and they usually use a cheap plastic or rubber to coat their cables to save costs. These cables are braided nylon and you can feel the difference in quality. My Samsung and Motorola cables usually get twisted near the connectors and over time the rubber separates and tears exposing the wires beneath, I do not have that problem with these.LENGTH: These are more than 6 feet long! That is big for me since my bedroom outlet is behind the headboard of my bed and I need a sufficiently long cable to reach my nightstand. Also most people tend to have outlets behind furniture, so it is a big plus to have a cord 6 feet or longer.COLOR: you get 4 fun colors.

"First thing I noticed with this is the solid build. Materials are sleek and sturdy, looks like it can withstand drops and scratches. The device is small, but fits well in my hand, good size for one hand use and it fits in pocket. Rec button is big red button on front, the other buttons are smaller and on the sides. There is a little red light at the top that lets you know its recording. It wasn't exactly intuitive to use at first. I needed to quick read instructions before I got it down.

The backpack has two mesh side pockets for water bottles, and a small zip pocket in the front for smaller items. The backpack can hold the same amount of materials a traditional backpack would hold, however the material is noticeably thinner than the canvas you find in most backpacks and there isn't a reinforced bottom, so if your carrying around lead weights or something i'm not sure the thin material will hold up.Folding the bag up is a breeze. I thought there might be a structured way to do it, but all you reall have to do is stuff the bag into the attached pouch from the inside out. Very simple. Once in the pouch its much easier to carry around. If your like me and come back from vacation with more stuff than you left with, this bag can be easily packed into luggage then filled with souvenirs on your return trip.No complaints this far.[I received this product for the purposes of an honest review]","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RAO8S3WXR2U9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KX0B5TW#wasThisHelpful","R1RAO8S3WXR2U9","AETBIYGN4IYG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETBIYGN4IYG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What your getting here is 2 double walled glasses, 9 whiskey stones, and a small velvet bag to hold the stones. The glasses are larger than normal (probably a result of the double lining). The double wall prevents condensation from forming on the outside of the glass and keeps the drink colder longer. The whiskey stones allow you to chill your drink without watering it down with ice. Just put the stones in the freezer and place in your drink when ready. I actually do not use the velvet bag since the fuzz comes off on the stones. I jsut wash the stones and put them in a plastic bag in the freezer.Only downsides are the size, bigger in both width and height than your average tumbler but its not a big issue.[I received this product for the purposes of an honest review]","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P0UH8IEA0VCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPXHWFM#wasThisHelpful","R2P0UH8IEA0VCZ","AETBIYGN4IYG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETBIYGN4IYG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great bar starter kit. It has everything you need to make cocktails (except alcohol and ingredients of course!). It all comes in a neat little package that makes this perfect for gifts.

"This is a pretty nice ipad keyboard case for the ipad2/3/4. Installation was pretty easy. My Ipad 2 clicked right in and fit perfectly. From there you just turn the keyboard on (may need to charge it first), press the connect button and then find the keyboard case under the bluetooth settings on the Ipad. The thing I like most about this case is that they keys are hard keys like on a laptop. My previous keyboard case had soft rubber keys. The hard plastic case provides good protection as well. The case can swivel to use landscape view or portrait view of ipad. The case also comes with a USB cable to use when charging the device. Only drawback is that the case is a little larger/bulkier than my previous caseI have had no problems with this case.

"My PS4 gets pretty hot since it is on nearly all the time (games, Hulu, Netflix, etc). This product is perfect for me. The stand fits the PS4 perfectly and plugs into the USB port on the front of the PS4. The stand can charge 2 controllers simultaneously. There are also additional USB ports on the front of the stand. This comes in handy for me because I use a USB keyboard when I play an MMORPG on the PS4, which means previously I could only plug in one controller. The box it comes in is pretty plain and there are no instructions. But its pretty easy to figure out.Now my PS4 isn't in danger of overheating and I have extra USB slots and charging capability.

The stand fits the PS4 perfectly and plugs into the USB port on the front of the PS4. The stand can charge 2 controllers simultaneously.

This comes in handy for me because I use a USB keyboard when I play an MMORPG on the PS4, which means previously I could only plug in one controller. The fans aren't too loud and I usually can't hear them over the sound of my gameplay/movies. There is an on/o switch on the front, but if you plug it into the PS4 it turns off when you turn the PS4 off. The one downside to that is that if you keep your PS4 in ""rest mode"" like I do then you actually have to press the button to turn it off otherwise the fan just keeps going.

"This is a set of 2 16oz copper mugs, perfect for Moscow Mules or any drink really. These are made of stainless steel coated with copper. There is no nickel lining unlike several other copper mugs (stay away from nickel lined mugs since the lining wears off over time and gets into your drink). These are really nice to look at and even display. The copper is a good conductor of heat so your cold drinks stay colder longer. The handle does conduct temperature as well so be careful with hot drinks. These are inexpensive and make great gifts. The box even has the recipe for making Moscow Mules (vodka, ginger beer and lime, over ice)Everyone knows that you do Moscow Mules without a copper mug! Honestly all these really do is keep drink colder, and traditionally the drink is served in copper mug, so you'd be following tradition. There is no difference in taste whether your vodka and ginger beer is in a copper mug or in a styrophone cup (if you could taste the copper that would probably be a bad thing). Don't be that person who drinks Moscow Mules from a plastic cup, get some copper mugs!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33R127NUIQ9GB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPX8CUG#wasThisHelpful","R33R127NUIQ9GB","AETBIYGN4IYG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETBIYGN4IYG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the debate of books vs movies I am firmly in the ""books are better"" camp. However I was a bit disappointed with this one. I saw and loved the movie Argo and naturally upon finding out that it was based on 1) a true story and 2) a chapter from this book, I had to go read the book myself! The book is significantly less exciting, and there are very few thrills.What the book does do well is it takes you through the role Antonio Mendez played in the CIA. He is more of an artist than James Bond. He learns how to create disguises, open and reseal envelopes without leaving a trace, forge documents etc. All very interesting stuff and not your usual spy story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R140RBQ6QCMCHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OVLJTQ#wasThisHelpful","R140RBQ6QCMCHD","AETBIYGN4IYG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETBIYGN4IYG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First thing i noticed about these is the quality build / durability of them. The head is made of wood and metal while the cord is nylon braid. The cord feels better than the cheap rubber feel of most ear buds. These come with the earbuds themselves, 3 sets of rubber tips, and a little burlap bag to carry it all in. I did not choose the color, but if I did I would've gone with something other than turquoise.The sound quality is pretty good. Its not top of the line but it will easily sound better than the default apple earbuds most people use. Like most earbuds these do not really fit well in my ear, but i suspect thats just the shape/size of my ears since no ""in ear"" headphones feel good to me. Still I will be using these often since I cannot (or won't) use over the ear headphones when I workout or go for a run.I received this product for the purposes of an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EP8154A2U2ER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QPI3EE0#wasThisHelpful","R3EP8154A2U2ER","AETBIYGN4IYG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETBIYGN4IYG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice inexpensive gaming mouse. It is plug and play (thankfully since the box and instructions are all in chinese). The look and feel of the mouse are great. It fits perfectly in my hand and all the buttons are placed well. It has a nice edgy look to it however the red light doesn't glow the whole time and its not as bright as the picture on Amazon makes it seem. Imagine everything ""red"" in the picture as white plastic and thats more like what it looks like. The 6 buttons are the left and right click, the forward and back buttons on the side, the scroll wheel, and the DPI button. The DPI button is a nice touch and allows you to adjust the sensitivity on the fly (think of a first person shooter game going from a hip fire sub machine gun to a sniper rifle). I believe the DPI button has 4 levels of sensitivity.The USB receiver does not fit in all of my computers USB ports (a problem I have found with other wireless mice on other computers as well). The batteries barely fit in the battery compartment, and the compartment cover is a bit awkward. There is a place near he batteries where you can store the USB receiver. It takes 2 AAA batteries and the can drain fairly quickly.

"I often travel 2-3 days a week and wanted a way to play without lugging my PS4 around (which I actually did a few times). So I bought a PS Vita. I don't do much gaming on Vita specific games. 95% of my Vita usage is remote playing my PS4 gamesThe device:The device itself is a good size and rests nicely in your hands. The screen size is good and the picture is crisp and clear. The button arrangement is a bit uncomfortable for me. The right joystick doesn't seem to be in a very natural position and there is a lack of L1/R1 and L3/R3 buttons. I play Final Fantasy XIV: ARR and those buttons are pretty essential. To use those buttons you have to make use of the touchpad on the back of the device which takes a bit of getting used to. if you touch the upper right side of the back touchpad its like pressing R1, the bottom left is like L3 and so on.Remote play:This is why I bought the Vita. If your PS4 is in standby mode (rest mode not off) then the Vita can turn it on and operate it remotely. There are 2 different ways you can do this, at home via direct connect and away from home via the internet. If your home you can connect directly to the PS4 via a bluetooth connection. If your family needs the TV or you want to multitask and watch and play at the same time, you can play the PS4 using the Vita as controller and screen leaving your TV screen available to watch TV. If your away from home you can connect via the internet. I have used the Vita to play my PS4 remotely from several states away from home. The only thing you need to watch for is bad internet connections. Using hotel wifi can be hit or miss, and I've used stronger wifi connections that had trouble when someone else was using Netlix it hurt my Vita's connection. If connection is lost for Vita, the PS4 is still on, so when the vita regains connection a few seconds later your right back to where you were (or dead depending on the game!).

"I decided to read this book because I enjoy military biographies and the author described it as a biography of Gen. Howard Peckham. However, this book is not strictly speaking a biography at all. The book is written from the perspective and viewpoint of the author, which often makes her the subject of the book rather than Howard Peckham. The book often digresses from Howard Peckham to relate personal stories of the authors about life growing up in a military family.The authors unnecessary overabundance of similes often made the book hard to read, and the prose just seem forced. For example ""at the sight of each needle that stung my arm like a thin metal wasp"".The book was okay, but it would have been better served had the author taken on a co-author or editor who was not related to the subject of the book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T5SDSNYIYC7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B6EIUNI#wasThisHelpful","R3T5SDSNYIYC7P","AETBIYGN4IYG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETBIYGN4IYG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You don't seem to get the upconvert if you just use the AV cables. I believe you get upconvert if you use the S-Video cable.Pros: If you have an older device that you want to connect to a newer TV (i.e. my old DVD player only has AV and S-Video but my TV doesn't have s-video port just HDMI)Cons:Power cord is shorter than I'd likedevice can get pretty hot","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G2JK1YFK3AH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KXDS77M#wasThisHelpful","R3G2JK1YFK3AH6","AETBIYGN4IYG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETBIYGN4IYG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:48 MinsThis is the 2015 version of the Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) Calendar. I own the 2013 and 2014 calendars as well is much better than the 2014 one in my opinion. Art is very subjective so I will include a vid to show you exactly what you are getting. SPOILER NOTE: If you have not read through A Dance With Dragons (book 5) some of these titles/descriptions may contain mild spoilersThe pictures depicted are:January - The Night's WatchFebruary - Sam & Gilly on the Cinnamon WindMarch - The Iron Islands (theon?)April - Road to Kings Landing (just a bunch of swords intertwined)May - Mother of Dragons (same as the cover art)June - RiverrunCenterfold - The artists sketchbook. Several rough sketches of charactersJuly - Forging of the Iron throne (Balerion breathing fire, blacksmiths creating throne)August - Little Birds (Varys' spies)September - Battle for the Wall (Stannis)October - House of Black and White (Arya)November - The Kings Hand (Tyrion naked lying with Shae)December - North of the Wall (Direwolf killing a stag)The sketchbook is the highlight for me and was a nice touch for the centerfold. The previous versions of the calendar just repeated a prior months artwork. Mother of Dragons is my favorite artwork in the calendar. I like the subjects depicted in Little birds and forging the iron throne. The lowlights for me are the road to kings landing and the kings hand. Road to kings landing is supposedly depicting many swords intertwined in battle but to me it just seems odd that so many swords could possibly in such a short space in an actual battle (no room to swing!). And I feel a bit weird about having a naked dwarf hanging from my wall. Other than that Donato Giancola did a superb job on the artwork.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AFTNVVRWARPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345537963#wasThisHelpful","R1AFTNVVRWARPA","AETBIYGN4IYG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETBIYGN4IYG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:52 MinsThis is a nice set of 4 ceramic knives and a peeler. They come in a nice holder that adds a bit of a cool design to your kitchen. the knives themselves are of good quality, very lightweight and sharp. Because the holder is made of plastic you want to make sure not to bend the arm that holds the peeler too far because that can break.Pros:-Sharpness: Ceramics are harder and won't need sharpening as often as a steel knife.-No Rust/stains-Lightweight-Not Porous: Won't transfer tastes or odors from one food to another (i.e. onions or spicy foods). Also metal knives can alter the taste of acidic foods like lemons, a ceramic knife is non-reactive and will not alter the taste.-Looks: Unlike your normal wooden block, this plastic holder actually looks nice in your kitchenCons:-Unflexible/Brittle: The hardness of the knife has a catch! Can't use the knife to pry or wedge something. It is not flexible and will break. Can't use on hard cutting surfaces like granite or the knife may chip. You don't want to drop it or it can chip/break. You don't want to use these as a screwdriver!-Can't sharpen on your own: while rarely needing to sharpen is a plus, if you ever do need to sharpen it you will have to find a professional with a diamond wheelOverall its a good set of knives at a decent price. Many sets of ceramic knives sell for a much higher price than this. I received the product for the purpose of this review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OVNODSI5GFSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6BGV9W#wasThisHelpful","R3OVNODSI5GFSQ","AETBIYGN4IYG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETBIYGN4IYG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining this book was. I bought the book on pre-order back in April and promptly forgot about it. When it was sent to my Kindle in September I thought these would be serious scientific questions along the lines of what you'd see Neil deGrasse Tyson talk about on the History Channel or something. Instead this book is full of entertaining and absurd questions that are answered in a fairly thorough scientific way. Not only that but the author is a physicist AND cartoonist, so the book is illustrated with stick figure cartoons that are actually both relevant to the science and funny.The book addresses questions such as what happens if everyone on Earth shined a laser pointer at the moon? What would happen if a pitcher threw a fastball at the speed of light? Can you build a jetpack with downward firing machine guns? The book takes the questions in a sort of Mythbusters sort of way (meaning that a plausible explanation is attempted first then an extreme example just because!). Usually each chapter ends with we all die.The book has many humorous quotes and analogies, and can make many scientific scenarios understandable to the average person (non-scientist). ""Think of the elements as dangerous, radioactive, short lived Pokemon""I highly recommend for anyone who likes science, humor, the history channel, the show Mythbusters, random what if questions, or for that know-it-all friend (we all have one). This book is a fun read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20EZ0FQUFN840/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IYUYF4A#wasThisHelpful","R20EZ0FQUFN840","AETBIYGN4IYG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETBIYGN4IYG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The LifeCHARGE InAir case for the Samsung Galaxy S4 is a case that includes a 2nd battery to give your phone that extra charge. Out of the box you get the case, the extra battery, a charging pad for wireless charging, and a micro USB cable. Installing the case requires taking the back of the phone off and removing the factory battery, you then attach the lifecharge battery, and place the original factory batter on top of the lifecharge battery (sounds confusing I know, but there are instructions). Then you attach the rest of the case. My previous cases were all fairly slim, this case is noticably larger and heavier than my previous cases. The product description describes it as ""slim"" but that's only if your comparing this to an Otterbox. The extra battery is nice and I can now use the phone alot longer before having to charge it up. The volume buttons work well but the power button has to be pressed on the bottom of the button (not the middle). The case leaves ample room to plug in headphones and USB cable (unlike the iphone version apparently)The Charging pad is a nice touch. There are 2 charge points on the back of the case that have to touch the charging pad in order to charge. So yes it is ""wireless"" as in there are no wires between the phone and the charging pad, but you still have to have it directly on the pad. This is great for me, as I get random texts in the middle of the night and I can grab my phone and place it back on the charger pad without having to fumble for wires in the dark.Pros:--Provides extra battery--Wireless Charging--Sturdy build means good protection for phoneCons:--its noticably heavier than most cases (there is a 2nd battery in there afterall)--Its not as slim as many other cases out there--Glossy case is a fingerprint magnet","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15FFF7SFFD4DB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCL7XNI#wasThisHelpful","R15FFF7SFFD4DB","AETBIYGN4IYG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETBIYGN4IYG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The writers aim was to tell the story about how terrible it was to grow up an unwanted orphan in communist Romania, and on the part he succeeded. This is not a happy story. The book describes many horrible things that these children suffered through. The book revolves around Daniel as he grows up (and escapes) an orphange, to life living in the sewers, to ultimately arriving in America. Daniel and his friends (with names like Crazy, One Eye, and Burned because no one gave them real names) try to survive in a world where no one wants them.The book is in sort of a memoirs format and goes off the memories of the author. This sometimes leaves you with unexplained gaps in time as well as incomplete information to help the reader understand whats happening. From a historical context the book briefly explains why there are so many unwanted orphans (President Nicolae Ceauescu made abortion illegal in an attempt to boost the country's population) but very little else about the Ceausescu regime is explained. The Romanian Revolution is briefly witnessed and the 1990 Mineriad is mentioned so fleetingly you don't really understand why random miners are beating people to death in the street.The painful part of this read was that it badly needs an editor. The book is full of broken english and misspelled words. Many times I had to re-read a sentence just to understand what the author was trying to say.Overall it was an interesting and often heartbreaking story about a time and a place that few people in America hear or read about. I received a copy of this book for the purposes of this review. The author told me that all money earned from sales of this book will go to ""MyAmericanKids,com"" and will help immigrant children.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NN2RQV77RRV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBU7I66#wasThisHelpful","R3NN2RQV77RRV7","AETBIYGN4IYG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETBIYGN4IYG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There is a thumb loop to help you put them on, but I find it easy enough to put on without the help of the thumb loop.

"These are good stainless steel measuring spoons. The set comes with 6 spoons a 20ml, a 10ml, 5ml, 2.5ml, 1.25ml, and 0.6ml. The steel is sturdy and doesnt bend. The measurements are engraved into the steel and not painted on. One thing to keep in mind is the tablespoon and half tablespoon (20ml and 10ml) seem to be Australian tablespoons and not US or Uk measurements (US TBSP = 15ml). So if you get these keep that in mind and adjust accordingly. The teaspoon measurements match typical teaspoons.One thing I like about these is it comes with a 1/8 tsp.

" 1:45 MinsThis review is on the AV+ S-Video to HDMI converter. You definitely want to make sure you check which product your buying to make sure you don't get the opposite of what your looking for! Product works pretty well. It comes with all the cables you will need. I use this with my HD-DVD player (yes I know I'm one of the few people that bought those....). You don't seem to get the upconvert if you just use the AV cables. I believe you get upconvert if you use the S-Video cable.Pros: If you have an older device that you want to connect to a newer TV (i.e. my old DVD player only has AV and S-Video but my TV doesn't have s-video port just HDMI)Cons:Power cord is shorter than I'd likedevice can get pretty hot","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FBKZTUY7YAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CU6Z03O#wasThisHelpful","R2FBKZTUY7YAQ","AETBIYGN4IYG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETBIYGN4IYG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a great read on the Nintendo-Sega battle in the late 80s-90s. Growing up in the 80s I was firmly in the Nintendo camp. I had a NES, SNES, N64. While my friends had Sega, Saturn and Dreamcast. We spent hours arguing which was better. This book relives those moments for me, except this book paints Nintendo has the villain!This story primarily follows Tom Kalinske as he leaves the toy world (CEO of Mattel and Matchbox) for the world of gaming as CEO of Sega of America. At the time of his arrival at Sega, SoA is a big underdog to Nintendo and hasn't yet come up with their answer to Mario (sonic the Hedgehog). Throughout the book, Nintendo is the bully. They bully retailers and game makers. Sega put themselves out there as the ""anti-Nintendo"".The best part of the book is the ""inside info"", the anecdotes around the 2 companies. The origin of the ""SEGA Scream"" at the end of their commercials, the Sony-Nintendo partnership that never happened for a CD based console, etc.The only downside to the book and to me it was very minor, was the flow of the story. You start off from Segas point of view put every so often the story goes back in time and from Nintendos point of view. I understand the need to develop back story but sometimes it just felt disjointed jumping back and forth. I'd knock off a half a star for that (still rounds up to 5 stars).This was a really good read. I'd recommend for anyone who grew up in the 80s and 90s, or for anyone who likes to read about business.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36LEY1PCYNAPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJ379XE#wasThisHelpful","R36LEY1PCYNAPS","AETBIYGN4IYG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETBIYGN4IYG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow! I just loved this book. Charbonneau's first trilogy was amazing, and we had the opportunity to hear her speak at our school last year, so I was eager to read this one.In this book, high school kids join a social media site and ask for things they feel they ""need"". In return, they are asked to complete tasks. The valuable lesson they learn is that not all wants are needs, and you can't get something for nothing in return. Additionally, the attempt to get whatever one wants can often hurt others.As a reading specialist and interventionist, I was excited to read this book because it really has amazing potential for being taught in the classroom. It's a fun and exciting read and something to which kids can connect. Since I teach reluctant readers, this is just what we need.The only disappointing thing about the book is the ending. I'm still trying to decide if it was actually believable. However it is open-ended enough that I think Charbonneau could turn this into a series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HHFGVXNC755V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544416694#wasThisHelpful","R1HHFGVXNC755V","A3TJSWA0W9ITYE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TJSWA0W9ITYE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Step back other stick vacs! This one takes the prize home! I love the fact that it plugs in. No more remembering to plug in a vacuum (and who has a plug in the closet anyway?). It also can be used three ways- as a hand vac, a hard floor vac or a carpet vac. The pole comes off for use as a hand vac which makes it convenient for small messes or curtains (although I still prefer my dust buster for the first). My favorite is the hard floor attachment which had a microfiber! This is the best thing since a swiffer vac, which I hated because it couldn't hold, a charge, but loved because it had the cloth and the vacuum. This vacuum simply gets every spec of dirt and dog hair on my hard floors. Finally, it had a power brush attachment for your carpet. I probably would only use this for touch up, but I definitely would use it for stairs.The absolute only con I have to this is that it is top heavy! You can't just stand it up, but Bissell added a wall mount, so it can easily be hung on the wall when not in use.

"I got this scooter for my son, and I'm pretty impressed. It's lightweight enough to lift with one hand, but still feels like it is good quality. The folding feature is awesome because I can fold it and throw it behind the seat in our van and still have space for other items. Another really great feature is the adjustable handlebars. My three year-old can use the scooter now, but it will also fit him when he's eight, so I like that! Besides those features, the scooter just glides super smoothly.

"I purchased three different ""Creative Haven"" books to start out my new hobby of coloring these ""adult designs coloring books"".  I was really impressed with the first two, but not so much with this one.  Don't get me wrong, I do like the designs. and like the other two, there was a nice variety in the complexity of the designs (from beginning adult designs to more complex and detailed harder designs).  However, I thought the quality of this book was no where near what the other two were.  The lines in the designs were thicker and seemed to be a little blurred to the point where they looked more like bad photo copies from a copier as opposed to the high quality printer look that the other two had.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ND5CG3VVISDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486490890#wasThisHelpful","R2ND5CG3VVISDW","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 2nd of 3 ""Creative Haven"" coloring books I've purchased (not to mention those 3 are also the first ""adult coloring books"" I've purchased and tried.  My favorite of the 3 was also a ""tessellation"" pattern book (the 3-D one, you can see my review of that on the product page).Both of the Tessellation Pattern books have a very nice variety of designs.  Some being easy/simple designs for the beginner, while still being ""complicated"" enough that you didn't feel like those easy one's were designed for children.  Others being either a medium or more harder complicated designs.  None were too hard, either, where you felt you just couldn't do them.  The ""harder"" ones were just more detailed and complex in the pattern(s).  Some even had a kind of optical illusion effect to the design (most of those were in the more detailed designs, but not all).The only reason why I would choose the other one as a ""favorite"" over this one, is just for the 3-D instructions provided. Other that that, I really think the two different Tessellation Patterns, (both from Creative Haven), are of equal value in design, and fun in coloring.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TKR8CEA1HUHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=048649165X#wasThisHelpful","R2TKR8CEA1HUHE","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just started getting into using the ""adult coloring books"" (as a way to kill time while sick in bed with a chronic illness).  For my first attempt, I purchased three different ""Creative Haven"" books, and this was most definitely my favorite of the three.  I h ave enjoyed this purchase, not only for the wonderfully fun and intricate pattern designs, but also for the ""3-D"" aspect of the book.Upon first opening the book, you are shown on the inside cover a quick and easy to understand way of how to color the designs so they show up as 3-D when viewing them with the free and included 3-D glasses.  It explains which colors will ""pop out"" and which ones tend to stay in the background.  Pay attention to that, because I've found that when viewing your picture while still in progress, it will not always seem to follow those ""rules"".  But, when finished, your picture will seem to correct and show up the say it should when using their color guide.Not only is there an instruction for your 3-D coloring inside the front cover, but on the back inside cover is a small color guide which shows (when viewed with the glasses) which colors pop-out or stay in the back ground. I've also found, though, that not all shades of a particular color will follow the rules or color guide, even on the finished product.  For example, as the rules state, ""warm colors will ""pop"" more that cool colors"".  But, when using either a warm or cool type color, if using a darker shade as compared to a pastel shade, they will behave differently.  What I've done with each of my different color modes (using gel pens, markers, or colored pencils) is to set up an example page for each one so I can see how each color reacts when viewed with the glasses.  As I've previously stated though, that does not always work, as for example, while one color will appear to pop-out on the example page, when viewing that color in a finished picture, it may appear to stay in the background (this is not always the case though).As the book suggests, you just need to experiment with each color and each color mode to see what works and what doesn't.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VLXCYHX27UNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486790886#wasThisHelpful","R2VLXCYHX27UNR","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There were a lot of skipping, so I had to go back in every section to fill in the skips/blanks left by the pen in the picture/drawing.The color variety was nice and I got what was described in the product description. But that does not make up for the poor quality of the pens.  However, the different colors and styles were all mixed up and I had to first use the pens on a ""sample"" page to discover which pens were metal, neon, pastel, or normal (the glitter ones where obviouse from the ""glitter"" appearance on the pen cover).","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OTM6M3R1JUMA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C8RTZCW#wasThisHelpful","R2OTM6M3R1JUMA","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am very happy with this product.There is a nice variety of colors.  Most importantly, for me, is that they not only color smoothly, but the lead does not break either inside the pencil, or when sharpening.  Also, when sharpening, using the sharpener that comes with this set, it removes the wood from the pencil, and hardly any of the lead (most of the time removing close to none of the lead, while still leaving a sharp point).I've just started using some of the ""adult complex design"" coloring books and purchased these pencils for that purpose.  When using those, and comparing using these colored pencils, markers, or gel pens, I prefer using these pencils for that purpose.My daughter, who is an up and coming professional artist, was jealous when seeing the set, and immediately put in a request for me to order one for herself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTTY1UB5GP6W0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0038EHRFQ#wasThisHelpful","RTTY1UB5GP6W0","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this software for my daughter to go with a new drawing tablet I purchased for her.I really wanted to get her one of the SketchBook software, since they make my favorite drawing app for my Kindle Fire tablets.  However, I'm glad I did my research before deciding on my purchase, because, right now her favorite drawing style is more anime than anything else.  So, in the end, since this was for her, it didn't matter what my favorite drawing app is. This is what fits for her style.So far she is really enjoying this software program.  She's still working her way through learning about all the different features available.  But, she is liking all the different brush styles and color choice options.  Another favorite part is the layer option/function.  Being able to test something out on her drawing using a layer is perfect since, if she doesn't like how her drawing looks with it, she can easily delete it without ruining the whole picture.  She also likes that it includes some templates, allowing her to get her drawing up and running a little faster.I will add more to my review as she works more with it and learns a bit more about all the functions and options available to her.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15T329XMGKSGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ANH074Y#wasThisHelpful","R15T329XMGKSGX","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ok, yes one star is earned and deserved for providing an app without any of the usual problematic and questionable permissions. So in that aspect it shows the developers of this app has good ethics and business practices. However, when every 5 star review to date are obvious fakes (in each instance either this is the one and only review by this person, or the only other reviews are for just this one developer/company), you have to wonder if the good business practices continue. I will give them the benefit of the doubt though.

"I did enjoy this game enough, but don't be fooled in thinking it's a top of the game list like most of Alawar games are. It does have a lower price than what Alawar usually charges. One thing I found most annoying was there was a lot of going back and forth from the first scene to the last. Usually Alawar breaks the game into section so you only go back and forth between a few scenes at a time. Several time you find an object, go back 10 scenes to place it then have to go back through those same 10 scenes to get the next object which again has to be placed 10 scenes away. The ho scenes and puzzles weren't as challenging as usual either. The graphic seemed a little more cartoonish than the usual high quality computer graphics. In all it was OK for the lower price, but with the lower price you aren't getting the higher quality that Alawar is known for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U7QTKK6V8BIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5D3ROK#wasThisHelpful","R1U7QTKK6V8BIP","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After the low quality games being put out by the top developers of the point-click adventure games it's nice when atop game like this comes along. If you enjoyed the first Weird Park game and/or Stray Souls, both from Alawar, you will definitely enjoy this one. The game is long, and with each section only having 3-5 scenes you don't have a lot of the going back and forth between scenes that are too far away. Everything you come to expect from Alawar is here. Nice graphics, fun ho scenes (each one played twice and includes one object where you have to do something to find it first), fun challenging puzzles with a skip if needed, and an enjoyable storyline. This is truly a five star game, but I deducted one star because three times it froze on me and then the game would exit and do the whole extra download stuff again. I have a decent enough device (kindle fire hd 2012 model) and fast enough wireless that it only took about 5 minutes each time. Thankfully upon returning to the game my place would be saved. This only really happened in the first one or two sections. But after that I then had many times when the next scene would show up black (with the exception of the pause, hint and inventory/journal buttons) and seem to freeze again. After anywhere from 30 seconds to 1 or 2 minutes the  game would pop back up for play. I am going to uninstall and reload the game. If the above does not repeat I will consider it a rare glitch and change my rating to 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38BSR2AO36BY8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3WTXCS#wasThisHelpful","R38BSR2AO36BY8","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I normally enjoy the games from this genre, it seems that lately the new releases from all the top three developers have issued games that almost play themselves with the players just pushing the buttons along the way. This one falls into that category. You have a similar storyline to the first game from this series. You are trying to undo a curse from Davey Jones while also collecting coins for the talking chest who is telling the backstory as you do so. All the usual ho scenes, puzzles, game modes, help/skip buttons that you come to expect from G5 Games is included. For now the game price is set at $2.99, but it looks like that will only be for the first week. I got it mainly because it is nice to have a few easy games from this genre on my kindle for the younger kids who enjoy having an ""aunt Cathy"" type game they can play on their own.

I enjoy it when they are included so I did enjoy this game enough. However, the graphics weren't up to par for Big Fish, more cartoonish than anything. There are only two game modes to play instead of the usual three, but that didn't lessen the game at all. Some reviews have mentioned the lack of a help button outside of the ho scenes. But 1)I found the game almost plays itself and 2) there is a strategy guide included if you look in the bonus section. As with most Big Fish games there is a small bonus chapter at the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10RRKAR7X5F6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GK5F1GC#wasThisHelpful","R10RRKAR7X5F6X","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been searching the Amazon ebook store all morning for books to read to/with the kids on Christmas Eve before present time. This one was free so despite it having no reviews I took the chance hoping it would work.  I'm glad I did because this will surely entertain them all, young and old. Each page (can't remember how many but there are a lot) has a darling little picture, like the cover of the book, and a cute poem of 4-6 lines. Subjects of the poems range from the tree, decorations, snow, presents, to even the table settings waiting for Christmas dinner. The author of this children's book did an excellent job.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6F9PQRXXASYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H4GKNXM#wasThisHelpful","R6F9PQRXXASYS","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I started using breathing relaxation techniques about 15 years ago to help with chronic pain. Suffering some depression as a result of the chronic illness my doctor sent me to a therapist who helped and taught me varying degrees of breath relaxation exercises. During one of our first sessions she made me a tape to assist me in doing the exercises at home. It helped to the point that I no longer have depression and when I have a painful attack from my illness I don't require as much medication (please don't take this as advice to use this and stopping any meds because of success from relaxation-you should NEVER stop medication without the advice of your personal doctor). Not only does relaxation exercises help me, but as a toddler we started helping my niece with her ""breathing exercises"" to calm down when she was throwing temper tantrums, and later for bad headaches and panic attacks. While we are both sufficient enough with these exercises that we no longer need assistance, this app is nice to have for the background noise and being able to adjust the voice and background separately we can add or delete either one depending on our desire at the time. I only gave 4 instead of 5 because there are only the four choices of background noises and there are times that the voice sounds slurred or just hard to understand. I would like to see either/or more background noise options and/or the option to use music from my own playlist. I already have a nice selection of music I use for this exact purpose. But, in all for a FAOTD this is not a bad selection, so get it while it's free.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P0HCIJ26K9DN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052OSTOS#wasThisHelpful","R1P0HCIJ26K9DN","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*UPDATE #2* here is part of the e-mail I received back from Big Fish with a response about the glitch: ""After doing some research into this game, I see that you're right, as we're definitely seeing many other reports of this error. Hopefully we can get an updated version of the game soon to fix this, since we certainly don't want more players to run into this""*UPDATE* I sent an e-mail to Big Fish on the first night that I tried playong this game and told them of the problem. Only today, Dec 10, did I finally receive a response. Basically it says they have received a high volume of complaints and have not had a chance to look onto my problem yet then included a bunch of common troubleshooting suggestions to try. I did send a reply back that this is obviously a coding error since it seems to be a problem for all. I will update more as when I receive any other responses back.This IS a point-click game with a whole lot more HO scenes than is usual for the genre. You need to collect mirrors in those ho scenes for hints, but so far I have not needed any as there is no click penalties. The few mini-games so far (basically these are just to open doors) provide no challenge. The HUGE problem I have is that playing on a kindle HD7 I have been kicked out of the game at three separate spots and on return get the message of ""a corrupt file with this profile has caused a reset of all game settings"" (this includes losing all game progress) not sure what is going on with that but I'm tired of having to restart the game over and over. I do at least I know there is some replay value since the ho scenes have different lists/objects to find each time (with the exception of the second play of each scene-you play once with a list and a second time to look for theme items i.e. find all the kings or rings etc). I am going to try the whole un-re-install thing to see if that makes a difference. If that helps I will update my review...that seems to be a theme in almost every review for this game so far.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R311P0YJG4MWV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FN79YR0#wasThisHelpful","R311P0YJG4MWV1","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you enjoy any of the monogram puzzles (like previous FAOTD Crossme or the other popular one called FlipPix) or if you also enjoy playing minefield you might like this one. Basically you are given a picture broken up into hexagons. The colors shown on each one represents the colors of each hexagon that surrounds it. So, for example, if all the dots are the same color then every hexagon that touches it will be that one color. Or if you have a hexagon and you can see that all the surrounding ones only have the color red in common then you know that is the color for it. There is a tutorial included in the options section. After going through that, as long as you remember the colored  dots represent the surrounding hexagons and NOT the hexagon it is on then it's not too hard.I am taking a star of because at times it either too hard to tell what ones you already have colored and/or once you have one colored it is hard to tell what color the dots are on that hexagon to know what the surrounding ones should be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12HR5XDO03GC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CGNYDIE#wasThisHelpful","R12HR5XDO03GC5","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"this was played on a kindle hd 7. I played each scene once to determine the playability for the different ages of kids who would be playing this game. the first time through there didn't seem to be any problems. that all changed when I re-entered the game. first off the option setting were sent back to the default. I turned the music and the timer back OFF. even with the timer off the games were being timed and the scene would end after 60 seconds. then on several scenes on replay had items in the column that shows what you are supposed to find double imposed. when there are two pictures on top of each other how is the child supposed to know which one to find (only one was valid in each instance). when the 6 year old was playing he was trying to get the ""achievement award"" of finding every object in each scene (takes about 5 replays in most scenes). but there was one scene he played at least 20 times at still had one object that had yet to appear for him as an option to find. add these glitches to the unethical practice of the owner leaving not only a 5 star rating for himself, but another 4 star fake review from a sock puppet account (when you sign out your reviews the same way it is only too obvious) and it equals 1 star.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38RU89NC24MPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DUQQWKS#wasThisHelpful","R38RU89NC24MPB","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm actually quite disappointed in alawar with this one. It's a good enough game to like, but the shorter length and glitches make it not as fun. let me start by telling how to place inventory items. as other reviewers have said, they are hard to place, unless you know the secret. I figured out that what you need to do is use your stylus/finger as a guide. to place items you need to put your stylus/finger where you want them to go and ignore the item itself, since it is quite a ways off point. follow this rule and you shouldn't have any problems playing. another big problem for me was the sound. I like to double task while playing (like also watch tv or something) so I usually turn any music off. yes, there is an option to turn down either the music or the sound effects, anytime a new scene is loaded the sound reverts back to the default levels. which means I either put up with the music and louder sound effects or play with my devices sound off, which makes it hard to hear any notifications from any other apps. there is only one mode of play on this game, unusual for a game from alawar. there are quite a bit of HO scenes (each one is used twice), with a few not so challenging puzzles thrown in between. I usually like replaying games a couple of time at least before I place a game into my rotation of games to play/replay. but, once you know what to do, and since there is nothing different to find in the HO scenes, it wasn't as fun as replays usually are and I sailed through it in less than an hour. there is a hint button you can use in the HO scenes or to tell you where to go if you get stuck, but a few times it would tell me to go to areas that were complete, so not always so helpful. another weird thing that is helpful to know is when there are cut scenes there are two choices of either ""skip"" or ""continue"". when a set of cut scenes are finished, however, the ""continue"" button is turned off and to continue playing the game you have to click on ""skip"" even thought there is nothing else to skip. in all, for $2.99 this isn't a bad game, but it is not up to par for an alawar game. it's easy enough I'll probably keep it for my younger niece who like to play ""aunt cat's"" games.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NXSTAE6LFQS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G1XRE6S#wasThisHelpful","R2NXSTAE6LFQS6","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"when I checked for new games yesterday the only version of this game that showed on my device was the one where you pay up front. when I noticed the 1 star rating for ""not compatible with Kindle hd"" I wanted to 1)note that at least with the pay up front version I bought I had no trouble playing on my kindle hd. 2)give the demo first version a copy of my review:as copied from the same game: I'll start out with WOW!!! This game is definitely one of those games that gives Big Fish it's fine reputation. you can't beat the price for the quality and length of this one.

I played on a Kindle hd and the one and only problem I had was that moving back to the previous screen was not always easy. it seemed there was only one very small exact spot that you had to hit, and it was in a different spot for each screen. one thing to take note for game play is that most of the time to place/use an item you only need to click it in the inventory then click where you want to use it. but, there are times where you do have physically move it from the inventory to where you want to place/use it. if you get stuck, if you are playing in casual mode at least, the hint button will tell you where you need to go and what needs to be done. if you are playing in the other two modes there is also a strategy guide included in the main menu. I also want to thank Big Fish for only placing one ""will you rate this game"" message. I think it pops up at the end (or close to) of the 1rst chapter. on that same note I thank them for just asking for a rating and not telling me to rate with 5 stars (even though it clearly is worth all those 5 stars)in total, this is one that I very highly recommend and it is without a doubt one of the higher up of the top games to play.

"this may not have Alawars usual 5 star rating that we've all come to expect from this company(at least for how I rated this), but it is a fun game nonetheless and gets 4 stars from me. it is a little shorter from their norm (although not by too much), but since most of their other games have a higher price than what I paid for this one I can't really complain.To start out you get to choose from 2 different playing modes: 1)Casual-hints take a shorter time to recharge, interactive areas sparkle*, and there is no penalty for tapping, and 2)Expert-hints take longer to recharge, no sparkles to mark important areas, and penalties for random tapping. I have only played this once (in casual mode) so I can't really tell you by experience how big/little the differences really are. *as for the sparkles when it comes to indicate interactive areas, all they really mark is the ho scenes and nothing more.there is a nice combination of finding objects randomly through the game, ho scenes to collect other objects, and puzzles (made to open things like chests, gain access to other areas, etc). there is a journal that you can easily access that keeps notes of your progress, which is great when you come to things like safes and locks and you need the combo that you were given earlier in the game, but forgot it. the journal also includes a map, although I did not really need it I'm sure it would be useful if you got lost. a hint button is included in the game which you can use either during normal game play and you need to know where to go next or what to do, or you can use it in a ho scene and need help to find an object. it is easy when you need to use an object from your inventory. this is one of those games where you just click on the object and a circle will appear on the screen where an object is needed. just click on the circle and if it is the correct object for that circle it will be used. if not you get a quick little note saying so and you just play on.the premise of the game is that you are ""red riding hood"", really just a random girl who wears a red jacket with a hood. there is a serial killer around town who is killing couples and plays each ""killing game"" based on a fairy tale. he has kidnapped your boyfriend and is leaving you notes and puzzles to play promising that if you solve to whole game in time you will find your boyfriend alive.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TTZLFD47F29T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FOMNIM6#wasThisHelpful","R2TTZLFD47F29T","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I played on a kindle fire hd and trying to tap anything on the main menu is a joke. It takes several taps before the game will finally register it. But, once I was in the game everything played ok.  There are two game modes: 1)casual, which gives you more help along the way and highlights important areas, and 2)advance, which is supposed to have more details in the dialogue since there is no other help while playing (I have only played in the casual mode so far so I'm not sure as to the differences). There is a journal in the game that keeps your progress, but, that is just about all it does. The only help it provided for me was the note it made as to which buttons were needed on the idol statue. There is a map provided, but since for the majority of the game each section is limited to only one or two rooms the map isn't necessarily needed. There are several puzzles throughout the game, but the instructions aren't always clear and I had at least one where the game didn't recognize any taps. But, there is a skip button for such occasions. On the main menu there is a button for a ""bonus"" which you apparently can only get if you sign up for their newsletters. There is also a button for ""extras"" which looks like it is all the puzzles from the game, but, even after I played the entire game they are all locked up. I know there are plenty of players in this genre who have their preferences as to whether HO scenes should/shouldn't be included. As for this one there are NOT any ho scenes.I'd go ahead and recommend this game as one that is just an average ok game to play, but it is a far cry from one of the top games to play. Big Fish can and has done much, much better and when the send out a game of this caliber you sometimes have to wonder who is making the big decisions. I will give them kudos since I was only asked once to ""would you like to review this game?""

"For the price I would have expected this game to be a bit longer, or at the very least have some kind of a bonus. But, none of the above was included. This game is basically puzzles and tasks. There are three levels to choose from and you play with a game journal that shows your tasks and gives any necessary hints. There is a hint button that changes to a skip button for the puzzles if needed. This game does not include any ho scenes so those who prefer this genre without the ho scenes will enjoy this one. This game was on the short end as far as game time goes, and as I mentioned earlier there is no bonus chapters or anything else to do once the game is done so definitely play a bit with the demo to decide if you think it's worth the price.One thing that is worth mentioning to the devs is after every chapter the game nags you for a FIVE STAR review. For one thing I, like most players, prefer to wait till I am finished with a game before reviewing it. Also, I don't mind being asked once to review a game. But, it gets really annoying and tedious to be asked over and over and it's even worse (not to mention unethical) to be told the rating to put in my review.

"I was disappointed with this one. It was ok, but not as intuitive as the first two. It was fun to discover how the whole ""mysterious fog"" from the series got started. It was enjoyable to play, just not as fun as the first two. You do get the helpful journal which lists the tasks to do, notes for puzzles, and a map that will show where you are and if you're playing in normal mode will also show areas that has something that needs to be done. There is the helpful hint button that will also show you where to go if you get lost, are not sure what to do next, or shows you items in the ho scenes. For the puzzles, as is usual in alawar games, there is a skip button for those who need it.In total I would only recommend this one to those who have already played the first two and are interested in the storyline.

"This was a good enough game for the price. it is a mix of ho/point-click adventure, but there were a lot more ho scenes per puzzle then what I usually get. I didn't have any problems playing on a kindle hd. there isn't the usual help guide provided, but it isn't really needed since once you finish a room there is usually no need to backtrack. (closer to the end you do, but only to enter a newly open area of that scene). Other's have mentioned that without the help it might be hard for beginners. I thought that the lack of backtracking would make is easier for beginners. you only play each ho scene once, and you usually have everything you need for puzzles (if not then they are almost always in the same room or very close by).  there is a skip button on for the puzzles (which I did not need to use once), and a hint button is available in the ho scenes. everything else you need to interact with is identified with a sparkle. it wasn't hard for me to see those, but it might be if you are using a phone instead of a tablet. it was shorter than some, but not too bad (I think another thing that beginners would like also).I would recommend this to those who do enjoy the genre (beginners or not). but if you don't like the ho part of these games (some reviewers state they only like the ones without ho scenes) then you might want to pass.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PKOI0XN9GSHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DUGDYTA#wasThisHelpful","R2PKOI0XN9GSHI","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off this is not a point-click game adventure as others have described. It is a very basic, very simple room escape game.  If you are familiar with either genre you know there is a distinct difference between the two. It's supposed to have a ""walking dead"" graphic novel feel but falls short. I completed the game in 10 minutes. Anyone claiming to be willing to pay for a second chapter for a 10 minute game is either an associate of the devs or has money to burn.

"I had a hard time downloading this game just as others have stated. it requires a little over 911mb more. when it first started downloading the countdown timer said 1:34 (hrs/mins). however, when this was done it started not once, but twice. so in total it took somewhere between 5-6 hrs to download. I have no reason why it kept restarting as no messages ever came up to indicate there was a problem. it is only because BigFish is one of the top game makers for this genre that I didn't call to get a refund while this was all going on.as for the game, it is a fun one to play. it has nice graphics, a fun storyline and a decent mix of ho scenes and puzzles. the ho scenes progressively get more challenging (like they can really be that hard at all, right?). the first one is your basic find the items. by the time you get to the last one you are only given 4 items at a time and then you need to use 1 or more of those items to find the next 4 (i.e. use a key to open a lock, or a hammer to smash something). some are matching 2 items at a time, while there are others that are finding 10 items that belong to 2 or 3 categories. there are 5 chapters and a strategy guide is included (which is good since there isn't a skip button for the puzzles, but there is a hint button for the ho scenes). after the first scene you are also given a game journal, which keeps track of your progress and clues needed for puzzles. this also gives you additional info on characters in the game and what your current goals are. it is a good idea to refer to this often as many times when you accomplish one thing it will give you information of things you haven't really done yet.here is where the glitches come it which makes the game loose points. this is probably more of a 3 1/2 star because of the glitches, but I went with the 4 since amazon doesn't let you use half stars. there were times when the game didn't register a touch. although this problem seemed to get better after the game ""unlock"" feature was used, and also on replay I'm not having as much of an issue with that. I eventually got used to the fact that sometimes you need to hold down on something before you make an action (i.e. for a number lock click and hold on the number before you move it up/down), or in the journal you sometimes need to double click before making the swipe turn action. there was a big glitch when it came to the sounds in the game. you have two options for this 1) music, and 2) sound effects. I turned the music off completely so I can't say anything in regards to that one but for the sound effects nothing seemed to really work. no matter where it was set I had problems. I didn't play the game in one session and every time I re-entered the game the sound was different. I either could barely hear the characters, or they were too loud or made no sounds whatsoever. all that didn't seem to really matter much since what they were saying didn't match at all to what was written (each time a character spoke a caption pop-up showed so you could choose what to ask them next). what was even worse was whenever a cut scene came on the sound went completely up as loud as could be with the devices sound control being disabled. I was glad I wasn't out in public when this happened because it was LOUD! every time you re-enter the game you are asked for a review. this is a pop-up and if you choose ""no thanks"" you aren't asked again till you re-enter again. however at the end of the game you are asked for a 5 star review. I've said this before, and I am saying this again: whenever a dev asks for a specific kind of rating (positive or 5 star) they will loose a star every time for this unethical practice. one more glitch that I am now getting on the replay is at gideons door the puzzle wasn't working right, and half way through froze up. I had to leave and come back. when I got back the 4 puzzles for the door showed as complete and I got the required doorbell crank, however the door will not open, saying I need to do the door puzzles. so I am replaying again to see what happens.besides the glitches it is a fun game and worth getting in the end. if this changes at all I will update and/or change my rating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AVZT0SU7GX7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMT5778#wasThisHelpful","R2AVZT0SU7GX7T","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*PLEASE SEE UPDATE BELOW BEFORE DECIDING WHETHER TO PURCHASE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING*I will leave one of my usual more detailed reviews once I have played this game, but I wanted to let people know right from the start that although this is the kindle tablet version it is for the 1rst and 2nd gen only. not compatible with the hd models. with three new games released this week it might take a few days for me to play and update this review, so until then you are on your own to decided. good luck.UPDATE #2: it seems that BigFish has provided an update to this app since it is now available for the hd kindles. when I first purchased it the app was only showing up in the appstore on my 1rst gen, and when I looked at the info on my laptop it said in the top right corner that is was only compatible with the older of my two kindles. well now it is showing up at the appstore on my hd model and it is showing as compatible for both kindles now. I downloaded it on my kindle hd and discovered an interesting tidbit while playing. I played this all the way through on my 1rst gen kindle twice already. but playing it now for the first time on my kindle hd I'm finding several new riddles and items to find that weren't on the list even once while playing on the 1rst gen. it certain is weird, but maybe they added new riddles when they updated the app for the higher end devices. and FYI: I am adding a star to my rating since this is now compatible with all kindlesUPDATE: This is a fun enough game as far as hidden object games go. but, it is just that, a hidden objects game only. don't be fooled into thinking it's a point-click adventure, because it is not. it is better than normal hidden object games go in that you are given riddles to solve to find each object. some riddles hint as to the object themselves, while other hints include clues around the room/scene to help solve what the item is (i.e. ""I am sitting next to...). there are about 20 levels with 4-7 scenes and 7-9 objects to find in each scene. in each level you must find all but one item total for that level. there are only about 25 scenes, so they are all repeated several times, with each riddle also repeating throughout the game. this makes the game VERY repetitive and lowers the enjoyment some. after each level there is a picture you need to unscramble. each picture is divided into tiles which need to be turned in order to find the correct position to see what the picture is.this game is one that's fun when you have a few minutes to waste here or there. is it worth $1.99, well play the demo and decide for yourself. with the repetitive factor I might have only paid $.99, but some might decided it's worth the extra cost since everything is in riddle form and not just ""find these items on the list""","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV9IZ3O9UPIN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB86J8A#wasThisHelpful","RV9IZ3O9UPIN5","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"bigfish is going to keep me busy with three new games this week. as for this one, it is right up there as one of the best. playing on a kindle hd, the graphics are wonderful. perfect mix of puzzles and ho scenes. for the ho scenes you need to find a rune stone in each one to change some objects over to more modern versions (for example you might need to change a whisk to a blender). those items are listed in a blue color. there are also items listed in yellow, which means you have to do something to uncover them first (like open a door or something). the puzzles are challenging and fun, with a skip button for those who might need it. not only do you need to pick up items for puzzles and other stuff, you also need to find pages for your ""grimore"" (sp?, a help book you are given at the beginning of the game), talking crystals, clock gears, and roses (collect the roses for achievements). it was a longer game and with all the daily distractions thrown in it took me two days to finish (if you only have an hour or so a day it will take you much longer). there are different game modes to play in if you want either an easier or more challenging game play. the story line is a new one, where you have to fix an eternal clock to fix the worlds time line, which is unraveling and combining as it winds down (hence the need to convert items in the ho scenes).This is one I highly recommend getting as it is tied with others as the top/best games to play in this genre. you will enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U5YKTDX0R1MK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DBER974#wasThisHelpful","R2U5YKTDX0R1MK","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The game constantly nags you not only to leave a review, but to leave a 5 star review. Sorry devs, but you will loose a star every time for tactics like that. Plus for 3 semi-short levels $4.99 is a little much. Other than that it is a good game. New and interesting story line. Nice help and skip buttons when needed. The graphics look great on the kindle fire hd. Sometimes the game didn't always register a touch when picking up or placing inventory items. There are some nice puzzles, and while there weren't any ho scenes per say there are some rooms where you are given a list of inventory items you need for the game. In all a pretty good game where you can decide for yourself if you want to spend the money or not.

"So, the FAOTD is yet another from the vast selection of word games. as the game description says, the goal for this game is to create one word for each length from 2-6 letters all within the 5 minute time limit and trying to get the highest score possible. when you start a game, the letters are scrambled on a pyramid shaped board with 2 letters on the top row and obviously on down to the bottom row containing 6 letters. to play you switch letters until you successfully have the five rows filled with correctly spelled words, or until you run out of time (there is also the option to ""give up"" but you forfeit your score in doing so). for scoring, each letter is given a separate number value listed on its tile (just like scrabble tiles) and each row of complete words are added up then timed by the word length, with the number of seconds left added on if you complete the game before the time is up. for example for my first game the top row spelled ""HE"" with the H having a value of 12 and E with a value of 3. so with it being a two letter word the score for the row was 12+3=15 and 15x2=30. I had 2 minutes and 43 seconds left on my time since I finished early so 163 was added to my sore. there aren't any bells and whistles in the game to make it stand out from all the other countless word games out there. in the settings the only options are for the music and sound. on the main menu there are 5 options: 1)new game, 2)how to play, 3)credits, 4)5 stars...pretty please (not sure what it is for exactly since when chosen a pop-up for the app store appears), and 5)buy the board game (which takes you to their web page). in the corner there is an icon for ""award"" which takes you to a page titled ""badges"". this shows you your top winning streaks, fastest times, and highest scores. the badges only show limited info, such as a ribbon for the streaks, 4:00 down to 1:00 for the time (no actual seconds are displayed on the badge), and the scores showing as 600+, 700+ etc. to get your specific info you have to click to another page with icons for the 3 types of badges where specific info for the top 5 are listed on each page. that's everything in a nutshell.would I recommend this game? if you can catch it while it's the FAOTD it's an OK enough of a game if you want something easy to do while waiting in a long line or in a doctors office, etc. but paying the regular price of $1.99, I would say your money could be spent elsewhere. I would also like to point out that IAP is not listed anywhere in the games description, but, as I said earlier, there is the option on the main menu (5 stars...pretty please?) which takes you to the app store for something. but, credit should also be given to the devs for not weighing down the game with all the annoying links for facebook and ""game circle"" type listings to spam all your friends with ""look what I scored on this word game"". although there is the permission for network access this is for the option which takes you to their web page and the game can be played with your wifi turned off.Edited to add this: some people are already complaining that this was already offered as the FAOTD 18 months ago and feel cheated that they aren't getting something new for free today. well, 1) not everyone devotes their life to checking the FAOTD every day and might have missed this one (or any other apps that are recycled in the FAOTD program), and 2)there are plenty of new people to amazon that most of the recycled apps are being offered for the very first time for them (even ones offered only a year ago). got over it and just wait for what tomorrow might bring.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YZZF4BVR180D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0067R8JNK#wasThisHelpful","R1YZZF4BVR180D","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You can change the speed, the number of notes played, whether to play one or multiple keys at a time, and many more.

"of the game apps my favorite genre is the ho/point-click adventure type. the younger kids enjoy helping me with the ho scenes. so, when I can, I get the game apps that are nothing but ho scenes for them. This company is one of the better ones for this type so I always try to snag them when one of them show up as the FAOTD. while they don't have any kind of bells or whistles that set them apart it's a good game for what it is. the items you are looking for are all clearly seen (nothing hiding behind so many other objects you can't tell what it is, or hiding off the edge of the screen). there is background music, which I always find annoying, but you can turn it off. if you care for that sort of thing there is a score and timer. these seem to carry over from one level to the next, so I'll assume the goal of the whole thing is to finish all 16 levels as quick as you can.

"First off, the game description is that this is a new kind of crossword style of game. But, let me be clear, this is the game of CODEWORDS, which has been around for a very long time. I get 10-15 variety word puzzle games that can be found in just about every checkout around the world (popular publishers are PennyPress and Dell). So, I think it is safe to say that I have played this enough to know this isn't any kind of ""new"" game these devs have come up with on their own. Basically you are given what would look like a completed crossword puzzle, but any shared letters of words are deleted and you need to figure out what those are. you are not given any clues. let me also tell you that there are two different types of Codeword. one being that you use each letter once, and only once (so there are only 26 blank squares to fill in). another version is, obviously, each letter can be used in more than one location (in this version each letter corresponds with a number which is placed in the square so you can more easily figure out what letter to use where). This game if the first of those two versions.Now, on to the review of the game. it starts out by letting you pick between 4 difficulty modes, ranging from 30-60 games in each mode. after playing the first game you are asked if you want to unlock a ""free bonus puzzle"" by posting your score to facebook. you have the option of clicking yes or no and also include with your answer to not be asked this again (which I certainly chose, because seriously who wants to spam all your friends with a stupid word puzzle score). you can change the settings by clicking on your devices menu/options icon (I'm using the kindle fire hd, so for me I had to click on the middle icon that is commonly described as the ""notebook paper"" icon). The first option is to NEVER post to facebook, next you can hide completed puzzles, show timer, or change colors in the game. the settings seem to be backwards. for example, with the first one titled ""use facebook?"" it says ""never offer to post scores and achievements"", but after I clicked that setting I was still asked about posting my score when I finished my next game. I once again clicked to never be asked that again, and when going back to settings the option was unclicked. so what the settings seem to be is the title is a question and the answer to that question is to click it for ""yes"" and leave it blank for ""no"". I hope that makes sense and helps at least some. if you need help during a game you have two options. the first is the ""hint"" button which gives you the answer to a specific square (with a 30 second penalty if you care about the score and/or timer). the second option is to click ""audit"" which will show you any correct choices you've made so far (also with a timing penalty of 1 minute).That's it for the game. a pretty basic word game normally called codewords. no ""bells or whistles"" to make this stand out from any other of the many codeword games on the market. instead you get the annoyance of the option to spam your facebook friends and the constant option to buy more games in the ""new and unique series of word games""","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35ABVWQ219OZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006OOHVVC#wasThisHelpful","R35ABVWQ219OZS","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"with the exception of BigFish, the top ho/point-click adventure game makers seems to be lapsing off in releasing new games recently. my hope is that with the others the next game will be a giant winner for us all. in the meantime BigFish is giving us some enjoyable games to play and making all the money. like other more recent games from BigFish this one doesn't necessarily give you an overly challenging game, but you are given enough of a challenge to have a fun way to pass the time with. if you want a small challenge, but need to relax at the same time then definitely give this one a try. you aren't given any ho scenes per say, but with each scene will find objects you need to complete a goal/task. but before you can pick an item up you need to find 5-8 additional items found in the scene first. the puzzles aren't exceptionally hard, but challenging enough. if needed you can use the ""skip"" button after a certain amount of time has elapsed. the storyline is a fun one that deals with you wandering a small town and adjacent castle, while trying to avoid guards and robot sentries. as with most games of this genre, you are given a strategy guide if the hint button isn't helping you to precede if you get stuck. the graphics are great and playing on a kindle fire hd I didn't have any glitches while playing the game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O2HLI5C4VQMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DD1F0VC#wasThisHelpful","R1O2HLI5C4VQMP","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to start out by stating, while other reviewers have said this game seems to be aimed at the younger crowd (given the storyline), this is an enjoyable game for everyone from pre-teen* and up.  if you have played the Empress of the Deep games (also from BigFish) you will see it is like those, in that it provides a challenging game for them, but it's not so overly easy for adults and still makes for an enjoyable (if not overly challenging) game. The storyline is more of a mix of fairy tales with a fairy and/or dragon helping you along the way (you start with the fairy who leaves when the dragon is hatched and returns a couple of chapters later). the game has a good mix of ho and puzzle scenes and you pick up needed objects either individually upon entering a new scene, or from a ho scene (which are not hard or annoying). the puzzles are fun and some of the more enjoyable ones are coloring tattoo designs: you are given 3-5 colors and the goal is to color the design while not letting any of the same colors touch. There is a strategy guide included, but be aware it is not the normal kind of guide you come to expect with this genre. If you do need help you can click on the guide (not having to leave the game) and you are given a list of past/current goals, with the incomplete goals highlighted. you can click on the goal you need help with and you are given a hint as to what you need to do to accomplish that goal. you can keep clicking and get progressively more helpful hints.  there is some going back and forth between the scenes which is normal for this game and I'm happy to say this is not overly done as it is with some games. The game is an excellent length for the price and a bonus chapter is included after you finish the game.In all I would recommend this game for everyone. If you are new to the genre (or want a game for your pre-teens) then this is a perfect game to start with. for adults, while you might not get any super challenges with this game, you are given enough of a challenge to make this an enjoyable and relaxing game to play. and, as for me, this also gives you a game if you want some quality time with the 8-10 yr old crowd. meaning it is a good game to play together with, letting them being able to play the ho scenes on their own, while playing the rest of the game letting them ""help"" you in decided what/how to do next.*please note when I say pre-teen, I mean the ages of 11-13, but with the aforementioned Empress of the Deep games my 9 1/2 niece enjoys playing those games with my help throughout most of the gameplay.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FI9EBLSQJYUN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D99ZK2C#wasThisHelpful","R3FI9EBLSQJYUN","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*EDITED REVIEW:At first I wasn't sure of buying a game with no reviews and it not being from one of the top three ho game makers. **But when I saw this was an original game from bigfish I didn't hesitate. Freeze Tag seems to have bought this to adapt for the android market and did an excellent job. (please see an update re this below)** The story line and playability are great. The graphics during gameplay are good as well, but the cut away scenes get blurry/pixelated making it hard to see what is going on. One downside is there isn't a strategy guide included. Just about every game in this genre has one. If you are like me you don't necessarily need one while playing, but it is helpful for the one or two times I might get stuck when the hint/help button isn't clear enough as to what to do next. Another thing that is normal for this genre, but wasn't included with this game, is the option to play in different difficulty modes. There is only one mode to play, but you are asked at the beginning whether you want interactive help while playing. I didn't have any kind of problems playing on the kindle hd (although on replay the voices on some scenes were muted). I would definitely consider buying more games from this company if they made more android versions of more adventure games.UPDATE: After replaying this I am reminded that I wanted to put this at 4 instead of 5 stars for the following reason: at least once in every 5-10 rooms you get the annoying pop-up asking for a positive review. while I don't mind being asked for a review maybe ONCE in the middle and/or at the end of a game, this was extremely excessive. plus, asking for a review is fine, but you should never be asked as to the rating to give in the review (I think asking for a ""positive"" review is just unethical). For one I prefer to wait till completing the game to give my review, and second, they should let the game speak for itself as to what type of rating to give. if they have done a good job and made an enjoyable game it will get a high rating. but when you ask me to give a high rating with my review you will always loose a star.UPDATE #2: since, depending on the device you use, not everyone can see comments attached to reviews I wanted to share part of a comment I received from the devs: ""...Victorian Mysteries: The Woman in White is a Freeze Tag original game.

"This is ok for a time wasting game if you get it for the FAOTD. But I wouldn't waste any money on this one. I was questioning whether to download it at all with the app description being broken English that didn't make a lot of sense in some spots. But decided to let the game speak for itself. As other reviewers have said, there are no instructions. Basically you are given a checkered board with a few colored pegs. You need to move the pegs around to line up 5 of the same colored pegs. There are different bonus type pegs to help. Some examples of those are: multi-colored (to use as a universal peg), arrowed pegs (to clear a column/row from the arrow on), bomb pegs (to clear all adjacent squares), some that are combos of bonus pegs (multi-colored with another bonus). With each move you make more pegs are added to the board. So the goal is to make as many match-5 combos as you can before the board fills up. There are three difficulty levels. That's the game. Most of it is all up to luck since you can't make a lot of strategic choices with not knowing where the next set of random pegs are going to pop up.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC4P8RY8560H3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AVFO41K#wasThisHelpful","RC4P8RY8560H3","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Basically what this game is that you are given a cube with different ""color swatches"" of varying shapes on the bottom of the screen. By maneuvering the cube around and placing the swatches on the cube you have to match the colors to each side of the sample cube on the top of the screen. It gets progressively harder as you advance as each swatch can fit on one or more squares. There are 4 squares per side with each square sometimes being devided in half. There are 4 main levels, named after the seasons, with each level having 12 sub-levels.About the first half of the spring level serves as a tutorial. Played on a kindle fire HD with no obvious glitches so far. There doesn't seem to be any excessive permissions to this app. While it's nothing overly exciting,it does provide a good challenge for when you're bored.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE067NC60ALLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009DDKZT6#wasThisHelpful","RE067NC60ALLA","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"because of how this ""drawing"" app works, I would describe it more of a doodling app. the way each brush works, even drawing a simple line expands it out beyond what you draw with your finger/stylus. there are two modes of drawing included with this app: 1)touch-where the line you draw will stop from beginning to end, but still expands slightly on the sides, and 2) continuous-where what you draw will continue to flow out from all sides. you have the option to change the percentage of how far the expansion is depending on the type of line you are drawing (zig-zag, straight, or rainbow shape).  there are several different ""brushes"" you can choose from, but since they are all basically the same with the exception of color it doesn't make sense to call it a change of the ""brush"". the another option you are left with is the background color. there is an undo (seems to be unlimited as to the number of strokes you can undo), and an option to save or delete the entire picture (not found in the same spots). there is an option to upload photos, with the option to upload from a computer, facebook, or a phone. I do have photo's in my kindle fire hd device, but they show up as an option to use for this app (unless I missed something, if I did I'm sorry). I didn't try to upload anything as you have to enter e-mail/facebookID/phone number, so I'm not sure how well this option works or not.  the app description lists IAP's but I didn't see any of those, so this seems to be the full app (instead of a trial version that a previous reviewer stated). this isn't even close to ""the best drawing app available"" as one reviewer states (my choice is sketchmobile), but this would be a nice and simple doodle app for yourself or anyone with younger children who can't draw yet and enjoy making lines and swirls (or any age in between for that matter)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BSSM3TBFKZCK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CGPPMKU#wasThisHelpful","R1BSSM3TBFKZCK","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE: since this review was published it seems because of an e-mail sent to the devs by another reviewer the IAP's are ow listed in the product description and the permission for current and recently running apps have been removed. Thus I will add a star to my rating. Wish more devs would listen to customers. Thank youAs far as a weather app this looks like it would work great.Once you enter your location you get the temperature, conditions, the feels like temperature, humidity, wind, when it was last updated, and the date and time. In the bottom left corner you also get t high/low prediction and moon phase. In the top right corner there are icons: 1)change the bunny's wardrobe 2)piggy bank to buy more clothes (with earned coins or real money 3)give bunny an umbrella 4)camera to send bunny photo via Twitter/facebook 5)options. The bunny part of this app is described as a virtual pet, but all you can do with it is change it's clothes and add an umbrella. Some reviews have said the app does not save your location, but I didn't experience that problem when I exited and returned.I think this company is showing questionable practices though. Two reasons are 1)the piggy bank has an option for IAP which is not disclosed in the product description 2)there is NO reason this or any app needs to know anything about current or recently running apps on my device. I know some devs have noted in the past this is to check for game cheating apps/software, but this is not a game,much less one that would need any kind of cheating. Thus, one could conclude it is for data mining.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BJTVSFT345NB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A3NQ04E#wasThisHelpful","R2BJTVSFT345NB","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game isn't one of the best, but it's still a keeper. There are two modes to play: easy with hints, or expert without hints. I played on the first mode for my first way through, and while it's not as helpful at first, after the game unlock the game seems to become more helpful and intuitive. Sometimes it wasn't as clear as to what to do, but once you realize that when you leave some scenes there are new objects that pop up when you return. As for the storyline, if you are tired of all the ghost stories lately you might want to give this one a try. It does deal with the supernatural (evil creatures living underground) but no hauntings.

"This is another physic based game. With this one you have to get the rolling ball head into the bubble. You need to press the two arrows on each side to tilt the maze of boards. While this seems to be aimed at some of the younger crowds it takes coordination to use both hands at the same time. Easy enough for the preteen+ audience.

"A good strategy game that's like checkers with a twist. The goal is to knock a certain amount of your opponents pieces off the board. The default is 6 (with the beginning tutor level being 1), but  in the settings this amount can be changed (1-6). Unlike checkers, where you move one piece at a time, with this game you can move your pieces in groups of three and in every direction. There are three modes of play: 1)by levels where there are several different levels with around 10 different stages to each, 2)free play where, like the first mode you play against the computer with three different board set-ups to choose from, 3)duel player, which is the same as the previous choice only you can play against a friend on the same device.I was questioning myself as to rate this 3 or 4 stars for the following reasons: went from a 3 star for what a simple game of checkers would be to a 4 star for the twist and added challenge of the game. I could (or some would say should in this case) change it back to 3 for the invasive type of permissions for this type of game.

"I like to play enough of a game to give fellow customers an honest enough review. While some games I will play to completion first, after playing this one for about 10 levels I think I have enough.  This game starts out pretty cute in a robot factory with robot heads being crated up. The 3rd one (roby) fakes a defect to avoid the crate and finds that the crate is the only way out. That is where you take over. Each level has several crates and you need to figure out the correct one(s) to break in order to coolect each levels three gears (same as the ""stars"" that all physic based game has for scoring purposes) then fall into the crate. Of course each level increases in difficulty with some adding more elements along the way (like finding and helping friends).

"To start off please be aware that although this is a kindle edition it is for the hd model's only. That being said alawar is one of my favorite game developers but I find it hard to believe they would put out such a shoddy game. The plability and length was way less the the first alabama game (which is a tp game in it's own right). There was by far way too much going back and forth. While this is the norm for this genre it was excessive and became very tedious. You would be in one room to find you need water for something then had to go to another room, switch the time piece to go into the past, get a cup, switch back to the present, find the water in another room, then find your back to where you started only to discover that this is when the game tells you it requires a rag to complete the task so you have to do all that again.  This happens with just about every task. You are told the objects you need one at a time. Even on replay or if you know ahead of time the additional items needed the game won't let you get them till the game itself tells you they are needed. On top off all that the game was unresponsive many times, taking it 3+ more times to recognize an action. Also on most of the hidden object scenes what you are looking for is a ghostly silhouette, meaning the are see-through and blended into the color of whatever it is sitting on making them near impossible to clearly see what you are looking for.In all I was very disappointed in this game and would tell anyone to pass and save your money. If this was any other company I would even steer clear from them in general. But alawar is truly one of the best developers for the ho/point-click adventure games. This is just the exception to the rule when it comes to the standard of games they are known for.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R150LAFRUHGIX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009T4YK68#wasThisHelpful","R150LAFRUHGIX7","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"this game is the FAOTD today, and, as much as I love watching The Walking Dead, I'm not the type to play zombie or any kind of rpg's. So I definitely did not get this for me, but instead for my teenage nephew. if you are familiar with the choose-your-own-adventure books from your youth, then you can easily imagine how this game works. to make it more a game rather than a book, the devs made this so when you arrive at some of the choices dependent on a dice roll. but on the dice roll choices they aren't exactly choices. the best example of this is when you come face to face with zombies. you have the choice to ""fight the zombies"" or if you have saved any pages with a bookmark you can go back to any of those. I got real bored with the ""game"" about 10 minutes into it. it's pretty much read, read, read, make a choice, read, read, read, make a choice, ect. with about 1 in 10 choices finally involving a dice roll. there are 3 difficulty levels, so maybe it could be more interesting for people who enjoy this genre, but I am not one. If when my nephew plays this and he likes it I will edit my review to reflect his game experience. so until then, unless this is your kind of thing or any other reviews change your mind I would pass on this one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T7N7TDW83PLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009SI3OHG#wasThisHelpful","R3T7N7TDW83PLX","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"while so far in my experience I haven't found any particular brand of capacitive stylus that is in any way better or worse that others I tend to pick the bluecell brand for some conveniences (which are not exclusive at all to this brand). they come in a wide variety of colors and/or combo packs for a lower price than some of the other brands out there. while being cheap, they do last and the 4 pack that I bought over 2 years ago I am still using today. I only bought a new set to receive new colors to go with the different skins and cover/cases for my upgraded kindle. they not only have the side pen clip but have a bottom tip with a hole for a phone jack attachment (although you need to buy those separately). while the capacitive tip glides smoothly over most of the different brands of screen protectors/anti-glare screens I think that has more to do with the screens themselves rather that the stylus (although it could be a combo of the two I find it is generally the brand of screen that makes the difference (you can see my reviews for my favorite as far as screens go). any an all of these features can more or less be found on just about any stylus you look at so the main reason I tend to go with the bluecell is because each purchase comes with a free cable tie. with all the cords/cables that comes with anyones everyday use (be it tablets, cell phones, laptops, etc.) the more cables ties you have the better, and if it's free you can't argue with that.if you don't want to wade through my reviews to find the aforementioned screen protector/anti-glare screen here is a link:  http://www.amazon.com/rooCASE-Anti-Glare-Invisible-Protector-Compatible/dp/B00A407R5W/ref=sr_1_cc_2?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1371460514&sr=1-2-catcorr&keywords=rooCASE+screen+protector+anti-glare+screen","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TYE26NJTDT74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BUXRUO#wasThisHelpful","R2TYE26NJTDT74","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"we all know there are countless brands of either/or anti-glare screens and screen protectors on the market. when I got my first kindle a few years ago I got a case cover for it made by rooCASE  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B2POVWA/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  (you can see my review for this item which is HIGHLY recommended) and after purchasing it clicked on amazons ""those who purchases xxxx also bought xxxx"" for the anti-glare and screen protector combo pack made my the same company. I was not disappointed and while a couple of times I bought other brands at different stores for sheer convenience I recommend the rooCASE brand over all the others. just to start with it comes not only with soft dust cloth to clean your screen before application, you also get a perfect size ""installation card"" to remove any bubbles when applying the film (other brands I've bought either have cards too small to be of any use or just tell you to press hard with your fingers or use a credit card). this one seems to be the easiest one to install not only with being able to align it in the right spots, but I get less bubbles (with being able to do it with no bubbles now with practice). while my newest hd kindle came with a screen protector after only 3 days I already notice underling circles showing up on the film and unlike the rooCASE the fingerprints/smears build up much faster. with the rooCASE films I not only get less buildup of both the fingerprints and smears, but on the anti-glare screen you get the best anti-glare effect with the lease amount of the annoying darkening blurriness that comes any/all anti-glare screens (it is unavoidable in all brands in how they are made). another difference that is very noticeable is the fact that I use a stylus more often than just my finger and with the rooCASE brand the stylus glides smoothly over the film (unlike right now again with the screen that came with the kindle the stylus skips here and there and does not keep a constant contact with the screen). I just received my screens this afternoon and am planning on replacing them with the current one first thing on the morning.  I certainly understand going with the convenience of buying these items in the store versus ordering on the internet and waiting for delivery. but in this case I feel it is worth the difference.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R178YGXE60UH6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0096XHJEW#wasThisHelpful","R178YGXE60UH6I","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought one of these for my original 1rst gen kindle fire and when updating to kindle fire hd 7"" my first and most immediate accessory was another rooCASE. I thoroughly enjoy this for everything it offers. it comes in several colors. you have the option of sitting your kindle up in either portrait or landscape mode. it comes with a safety enclosure that separates/attaches from the case with velcrow on the back to keep it from falling out of the case when carrying it. the separate safety enclosure is one of my favorite features because I can read/play with my kindle without the case and not worry if it is dropped or anything else that might damage it. I have actually dropped my device from about a 4 foot height with it landing face down on a hard tiled (hospital) floor with absolutely no after effects. that should sell you on this item alone.  happily with this hd 7"" case it comes with some additional options I didn't have with my 1rst gen model. first off it has a slot for your stylus so if you don't have the option to attach your stylus to the phone jack you can still keep it close. closing the case will not only automatically put your device in sleep mode but it is kept closed with a very small magnet in the bottom/right hand corner (between the case and safety enclosure).  as with each model the rooCASE is made for, all the places you need open slots/spaces for you will find them. I have seen several other cases, covers for the kindle and I will turn to the rooCASE every time (and it has nothing to do that ""roo"" is a nickname of mine since childhood-but it certainly helps to identify my kindle as MINE)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WGJ2BOI9PV82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B2POVWA#wasThisHelpful","R1WGJ2BOI9PV82","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"first off this third Snark Buster game  is for the KINDLE HD only, so if you only have a 1rst or 2nd gen kindle you need to wait till you can get an updated model. that being said, although I enjoyed this game, it wasn't quite up to par with the first two. there were only five levels compared to the others with about 10 levels each. the levels seemed to be shorter as well. as far as the puzzles go they seemed to be the same on a challenge level (not too hard and not too easy). the graphics were great and the storyline an enjoyable one (although there was only one small not at the beginning that mentioned anything about the normal snark hunt with nothing else to follow). this was a fun game that I would recommend, just don't expect the higher caliber of game that alawar is known for. it's because of that and for ignoring have their kindle customers in the KINDLE TABLET EDITION that I am rating this 4 instead of 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E0YHHX86MP6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AO2KZPY#wasThisHelpful","R1E0YHHX86MP6B","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ho games are my favorite genre to play. while I generally buy the ho/point-click adventures I like to get the plain ho games when they are offered as the FAOTD (like this one was for fathers day). starting off one thing I don't like is the option settings don't save. so if you prefer to play with the sound off you have to go through all the different pages to get through all the setting to turn it off each time you enter the game. I know it's just as easy to turn the devices sound off, but most games save option settings. there are 23 levels with three difficulty settings: 1) NORMAL limited time, limited hints, bonus, 2) NICE AND CASUAL unlimited time, unlimited hints, 3) CHALLENGE MODE items are rotated, words have missing letters. after choosing your difficulty you choose how you want to look for items: 1) by picture, 2) by silhouette (spelled sillhouee), or 3) by word. I played each of the three lists for a more thorough review and here were the problems I found. when playing by picture the color shading didn't match between the list and the main picture. when playing both the picture and silhouette the sizing of the list didn't match with the main picture. for example on one level there was a fairly large flower followed by a very small arrow on the list. however when I found them on the main picture the arrow turned out to be the largest item to find. finally when playing with the word list it wasn't always clear what you are looking for. one example being a soda can on the list but on the picture it ended up being a very small grey circle with a barely visible line of the soda pop click opening thing (so only the top was visible and hardly recognizable). in all three occasionally I had items that weren't even on the screen and when I clicked the hint for those there was only one or two stars visible of the normal 10 stars in a circular shape. this was played on a kindle hd 7"" with the brightness turned all the way up, so none of that should have impacted any of the problems I faced. in all I was very disappointed from a company that usually turns out much better games than this.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5RO0J5Z4Q3J9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B5KHZA2#wasThisHelpful","R5RO0J5Z4Q3J9","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"this game only came out a few months ago and I have been wanting to get it but have always talked myself out of it wondering if it was really fun enough or not for the cost. needless to say I was happy to see that this was the second FAOTD after the first one for today was a total failure for amazon customers. there was a version of this game on the science channels new show Brain Games (re-aired on fox I think). some reviewers have rated this 1 star because it's too easy when taking your time. however, from watching that show to get the true challenge of this game it's supposed to be played with a short time limit. I can see without having to race through the choices this game could get boring.  you are given two columns of blocks with the name of a color in each one. sometimes the color that the word is written in matches the word and sometimes not. the goal is to match a block from each column by matching the names of the colors, matching the colors themselves, matching a color with the word itself, etc. even though you might be able to find a certain solution that gets everything matched, but the game seems to only accept the programed solution for that level for you to score and move on. some reviewers have also said when playing on the fire that the colors weren't clear. I'm playing on a 1rst gen and when the brightness is turned down it is hard to differentiate some colors. so play this with the brightness turned up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RMOINH3PDRQK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJRH6HS#wasThisHelpful","R2RMOINH3PDRQK","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"this is a trivia game with several categories to choose from: history, sports, science, art, music, tv/films, language, cuisine, games, geography, or all of the above. because there are so many categories with who knows how many questions for each it takes 3-5 minutes to load the questions so sit back and be prepared to wait (it only took a minute to download the app itself). there are three modes to play in: 1)single in which you play on your own to gain points and potions, 2)versus where you can play against a friend who also has the app on their android device, and 3)live where you play with a random (worldwide) player found in their database. I'm guessing it is for the latter two that they need either an e-mail or facebook account. however IMHO there should be the option to play without the e-mail/facebook if you just want to play in single mode. that's where the shadiness begins. I choose the option of using my facebook account to play so as for playing by signing in with an e-mail I can't say what is/isn't shady about that. but the first time I tried playing when I signed in with facebook you have the option for the game to post on facebook for your behalf (usually this is to post scores for anyone unfamiliar with facebook), or you have the option to skip that step. at first I clicked on the skip option. however when re-entering the game from the facebook sign-in I was given an error message that the game could not be played at this time (and this was in single mode). then I had to un-reinstall the game and surprise when I clicked to allow the game to post for me the game worked just fine (I changed the option that only I and not the public or my friends could see these posts). I think I will be uninstalling this game for good unless there is an update with the ability to play without an e-mail or facebook.

"I want to start my review by copying/pasting a post I wrote in the amazon discussion boards in response to all the complaints about there not being an e-book for this novel available at this time. This also goes out to everyone posting a 1 star review for the same reason. Also I use the words TRUE FANS in my review title because real and true fans of Stephen King could care less about the publication form and collect his works because there are few authors who can write the amazing novels/short-story collections that are so imaginative and descriptive and in so many genres as SK does.  I understand that there are some readers who need e-books for reasons of eyesight, arthritis, etc. I have enough faith in SK that he will eventually put this novel in other forms besides paperback like he has in other publications that were released in only one form to start with.SK has a long history of publishing his stories/novels only in certain formats for the express purposes of creating an atmosphere. The ones that come to mind are The Mist, The Storm of the Century, the joint publications of The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer and Rose Red, and finally UR. The Mist was originally published as a ""3-d sound"" audiobook. In the hopes of enhancing his readers imagination this short story was made into an audiobook with a unique 3-d sound stereo effect. With the background noise, excellent voice actors, 3-d stereo effect, etc. the fear and panic the characters feel was geniusly portrayed (if you can find it I highly recommend this to all). This was eventually published in a short story collection, adapted into movie format and can also be purchased individually. The Storm of the Century was published as a ""novel for television."" SK did this not only because the larger cast of characters would make this almost impossible to publish it in just one book in written form, but in order to portray the immensity of the storm. Once again this was eventually released in written form (the script was published in paperback). I have both the script and the movie and I love to read the script while watching the movie to see the differences. Another concept SK tried in order to enhance the atmosphere intended was the joint publication of the book The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer and the movie Rose Red. Under the pseudonym Joyce Reardon SK published in paperback form The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer in order to provide a more detailed background into not only the characters, but also the house (a character in its own rights) Rose Red. The cover of the book has a note for readers to watch Stephen King's Rose Red. Publishing the book before the movie once again helped to enhance the readers (or in this case the watchers) imagination and create the intended atmosphere. Last on my list is the more recent UR. Because of the theme this was originally published in e-book format. You definitely would have not shared the characters feelings if this was first read in paperback form. Hence SK decision, once again, to publish this in only one form at first (this can now be purchased in audiobook form.on to my actual review. this novel was as much of a great read as all his others are. I don't want to go into any detail of the story and ruin it for other readers with spoilers, so here is a small description. the basis of the novel is about a college student who gets a summer job at an amusement park, makes friends with others that are both living in the same boarding house, but also on the same ""work team"" at the park. at the park learns about the local legend regarding the funhouse's history and the resultant haunting. from there it just gets better and better as only Stephen King can do. the story's main character, Devin, is now much older and is narrating the story through flashbacks. at times while trying to tell about a certain part that happened during that summer the character seemed to get sidetracked with other side stories. at first I found that annoying. but, I started to think that that is what people do in real life so why is that not portrayed as much in novels. So I actually found that feature to increase the realism of the story for me. yes, I know this is fiction, but we all read books with our imaginations flowing as if the story is happening for real.in conclusion I encourage anyone who is a fan of mystery books to give this a try. Even if you aren't a fan of SK I think you would enjoy this novel as his descriptions aren't as ""hard core"" as some of his longer books. some have stated they dislike his work if he gets too descriptive with violence and/or sex for their taste to handle. that is not the case here so I think you could take a chance with this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R224DRPWCUVMF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781162646#wasThisHelpful","R224DRPWCUVMF1","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The difficulty increases as the game progresses. What I really like is that even though you technically only have three lives (with the possibility to earn more) when you run out of lives the game will restart at the current level.

"I enjoy playing the different alchemy games (alchemy, and all the doodle ones). there are a few aspects that set this one apart from the rest. one of the best being that one the page where you choose what animals you want to attempt to mix on the main page has two sort options: alphabetical or in order of when they were made. this second option makes it soooo much easier to figure out what you have attempted to mix with other animals. at first it was hard to figure out why certain mixes made other animals, but when you look at the info for an animal it lists the attributes of that animal that can be used to mix with others. to make the animal on the games icon (mouse with wings) you would think mix a mouse and any bird. but no-mix a mouse only with a bird with wings listed on it's mixable traits. hope that helps with those having trouble mixing animals or trying to make sense of why some mixes work and others don't. while some alchemy games aren't necessarily appropriate for kids (even some games with a kids rating option in the game have some mixes that shouldn't be there) since this is strictly animals I have no problem letting the younger playing this one. in all I highly recommend this game. definitely fun for all ages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/REU2LYIP8V4GC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SIOQCI#wasThisHelpful","REU2LYIP8V4GC","AGK11TF4U2187","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGK11TF4U2187?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"An unconventional pastiche, 'A Study In Terror' is a novelization of the somewhat overlooked 1965 film of the same name; although whilst several prominent plot points remained, it does very much deviate from the movie it was based on. Additionally, in the tradition of those ""editorial"" notes which find themselves preluding many Watsonian manuscripts, explaining where this lost adventure you are about to read was uncovered, this book takes that trope a step further, weaving its origin into the story itself. Ellery Queen, knee deep into a writer's block, finds himself the unwilling recipient of what is purported to be Dr Watson's journal, but who sent it to his acquaintance, and, more importantly, why?Thus, the reader has two mysteries to unravel, and while neither are overly complex, they both provoke the mental gears into turning, or else one risks losing the threads entirely. We follow Ellery as he reads the journal piecemeal, every chapter or two interspersed with his ruminations on what he has just read, and his acquaintance's investigation into how the manuscript came to be in his hands.The case itself, as I mentioned, was not very difficult to solve, but there was still much fun to be had in unraveling this mystery. Aside from that, the exceptional characterizations helped me to overlook some of the more easily guessed at aspects. This was, if nothing else, a convincing pastiche that admirably met the task of conjuring Holmes & Watson as penned by Doyle.What I did not expect from this was the twist, of sorts, at the denouement. Instead of Holmes cleanly solving the riddle, and Watson writing it down for posterity, we learn that the doctor has leapt to the wrong conclusions in penning it, with the actual solution (that we learn Holmes was aware of) being well concealed somewhere in the journal's pages. In that regard, it excelled as not only pitch-perfect pastiche, but traditionally structured mystery, where all the clues are hidden in plain sight and the solution is logically explained at the denouement. Overall, I found it to be an excellent read worthy of Holmesian attention.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CP3L1QYHZQ9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZE9784S#wasThisHelpful","R2CP3L1QYHZQ9R","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I have felt something intangible has been lacking in the past few albums, overall, I found this new release a refreshing collection, with several truly solid tracks more reminiscent of the Trans-Siberian Orchestra of yore, where the sounds of rock and classical blended into the perfect marriage. Albeit, though I enjoy both genres tremendously, personally found the only ""misses"" for me were those inclusive of vocals more suited to outdated '80s ""metal"", as in my humble estimation, it degraded what could have been a harmonic masterpiece into unforgivable cheesiness.'Not Dead Yet' was probably the worst offender and weakest of the lot - not bad, but a few stylistic tweaks and less coarse vocals would have salvaged it quite nicely. 'The Night Conceives' also suffers from this problem, though to a lesser degree; still I found it grating and something that did this album little credit. Classical vocals, I believe, have always worked best for this band.Despite this, a preponderance of material from Letters From The Labyrinth are not only excellent, they have the potential to become classics and hopefully mark a turning point for a tremendously talented band.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3THH5LJW93RMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015FATSOS#wasThisHelpful","R3THH5LJW93RMV","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am an avid reader of short stories, and find they often make the best introductions to excellent new series/authors. It is also no exaggeration to say that in my opinion, the best thing about the Kindle is how it brought back this format of writing by creating a new market for them, yet it is ones such as this that remind me why they fell out of favor in the first place.A quick, occasionally amusing read, Summer Rain may have been slightly on the predictable side, but its plot was, at least, going somewhere - that is, until the author abruptly cuts it off with the most trite and ineffective conclusion. A good short story is an art form, a bad one, nothing more than a diverting waste of time. Or in this case, an advertising ploy, since the story ended at the 50% mark to make room for an excerpt of the latest book in this series.

"In what I found to be an airy and insubstantial read entirely lacking in anything resembling Christmas spirit - despite its being specifically marketed as a holiday tale, this was one novella that suffered for its length and inevitably left me cold. Although the writing is lush and evocative of the era, it proves that a story should be more than its prose, and after a time, the dialogue becomes so overwritten that one character blends into another.Even so, Lady Emily manages to come off as vaguely pretentious, and, for a woman who certainly believes in egalitarianism, can be a bit too dismissive of her husband, even going so far as to mention ""his opinion does not concern me in the least"". Never mind Colin is portrayed as a limp rag - imagine if that statement were turned around.The plot itself is bland in the extreme, revolving around something of a personal mystery surrounding one of Lady Emily's new neighbors, a peculiar lady who at first glance appears to be on the verge of madness. It is obvious her condition connects with a ghostly apparition both she and lady Emily have both seen, and while it did have some involving aspects, before Lady Emily even does some digging on who this apparition might be, the solution is obvious, the mystery too easily, and anticlimactically, solved. It did have potential, but aside from my never warming to the characters, ultimately seemed too rushed and scraped together. I love a good Christmas short story, even when they stray from the usual trappings, but this was just not one of them. Actual rating would be 2.5 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFMV5Z7NLUW49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CS5MLM#wasThisHelpful","RFMV5Z7NLUW49","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I went into this book almost hesitantly, supposing it would be a light, fluffy, cozy-type mystery with yet another modern author utilizing an established classic character; this time to reel in those vulnerable to the promise of Dickensian charms. Well, it proved neither of those things, and while historical accuracy was sometimes called into question, it did turn out to be intricately plotted, fast paced, and an unexpectedly pleasurable escapist read.Opening several days before Christmas, 1833, we are introduced to a young Ebenezer Scrooge, who has the makings of, but is not quite that embittered, stingy curmudgeon we see in A Christmas Carol. In fact, he is, if slightly pessimistic, fairly quick-witted, sympathetic for all his flaws, and endowed with almost Holmesian like deductive abilities that I wish the authors would have taken more advantage of throughout the course of the story.We meet Mr Scrooge in his counting house, where two visitors that will change the course of his life are about to enter stage left. One of them is Miss Adelaide Owen, a young woman applying for employment as a clerk, and the other... is the ghost of Fezziwig, who has apparently  been murdered that morning. It is Fezziwig who enlists the duo to bring his murderer to justice, with the added warning that not only will more die, Scrooge will be the last amongst that number. Reluctantly, they take up the investigation, aided by Charles Dickens himself, no less, and are rapidly thrown into the seediest corners of London's underworld, where they will encounter a murderer whose motives are deeper and darker than anything Dickens could have written of in his day. And might possibly even be of the supernatural realm...Of a much darker tone than would be expected in a Christmas story, The Humbug Murders was an expertly crafted mystery that truly had me doubting my own conclusions at every turn, with its well hidden clues strewn about and lively characters (many lifted from from the pages of other Dickens' novels) who each have their own motives for murder.While I felt it did nicely convey the atmosphere of an early Victorian London, the plethora of modern terms and anachronistic details peppering its pages could not be overlooked. For instance, while Robert Peel and his ""bobbies"" were officially formed in 1829, it would be decades before it functioned as it did in later years - that is to say, detective work was unheard of and Inspectors did not even exist. That detail, where constables took on the roles of investigating crimes, was more than a bit jarring, as was hearing an often crude modern expression when generally the dialogue and writing style came off as sufficiently antiquated. The anachronisms are my sole complaint, but those aside, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it without reservation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H6BY03YAFKSO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476792348#wasThisHelpful","R2H6BY03YAFKSO","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book, or at least, its premise, seemed so promising, but as an avid mystery reader I did not find that it delivered on any of those promises. While not actually bad or anything that defied credulity, the plot still manages to become simplistic because the author relies more on coincidence than brain work on her detective's behalf.On that note, Lavender and Woods have the faint whiff of cardboard about them, though perhaps they were fleshed out more fully in the first book - which I have not read. But they were very much generic detectives, or rather, generic Holmes & Watson knockoffs, and there was nothing even vaguely unique about him or what I hesitate to call his methods.I found myself growing increasingly annoyed as it played out, not only because of the irritating nature of many side characters plucked straight from the Book Of Cliches (don't get me started on how gratingly banal her ""mobs"" are), but because unbeknownst to this reader, a romance was also part and parcel with the book. I found myself skipping over the scenes with Magdalena, who is herself a caricature, because I simply do not care to have my mysteries with a side order of romantic angst. It's an annoying trend in historical mysteries lately, that just when the plot picks up, out of the blue will come a chapter devoted to the detective's love interest, and the story veers off into soap opera territory from thenceforth.Inevitably, that is what forced me to give up on this, even though I hate leaving books unfinished.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12WJ6N7BE5J6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503947823#wasThisHelpful","R12WJ6N7BE5J6X","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For several months, I had 'Art In The Blood' on pre-order, which is something I almost never do, and was greatly looking forward to a book that gave every appearance of being a traditionally penned Sherlock Holmes story. Alas, it disappoints me to admit not only was this nothing of the sort, it has also gone a fair way in causing me to reconsider the wisdom in continuing to read pastiches by modern writers. It has been apparent for a while now that certain television and movie characterizations have leaked into published Holmes novels, yet here, the author maintains a pathetic knowledge of Canon and, as she admits herself, makes no attempt whatsoever in imitating the characterization or writing style (the latter, I admit, is far less of an issue) of Doyle's creations.Therefore, before the story itself began to fall apart, my main gripe was that these men referred to as Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson were anything but; though her Watson is not so lamentable, and even fairly good at times, Holmes was entirely unrecognizable to this stodgy old Canon purist. On that note, however, it must be said that the greatest flaw of this book was not actually the intentionally skewered characterizations, but what passed for its plot.After Watson is married and his wife is away visiting her mother (apparently, Mary Morstan is not an orphan in this author's world), he is summoned to Baker Street, where Holmes is languishing in a black mood after a stint in prison. Nothing the doctor can do rouses him, until an interesting missive requesting his assistance in the possible kidnapping of the woman's young boy comes along. Holmes then journeys to Paris, where it appears, aside from some utter twaddle regarding the man becoming besotted with a client, there lies a nice, juicy mystery ahead.Except, this is where the plot begins to unravel and the nonsense begins. Along with this investigation of the disappeared child, Mycroft has enlisted Holmes to look into the whereabouts of a stolen statue which it turns out connects to the kidnapping case. Instead of the two plots intersecting gradually, after interviewing the Parisian woman, Holmes and Watson magically end up at a nightclub where the most utterly ridiculous and extraneous ""action"" scene transpires. There, he meets Vidocq (can we say derivative?), who has also been enlisted by the child's mother/his paramour. Of course, being the glorified fanfiction this is, we get to see a jealous!Holmes whose emotions cloud his judgement.Not, in all honesty, that it would matter, because this kidnapping ""investigation"" goes absolutely nowhere, not even in a circle as it chases its own tail, and after a second, pointless interview with the child's mother, Holmes arrives in London and gets the solution to the case handed to him on a silver platter by Mycroft. You read this correctly. At around page 110, Mycroft basically just tells him where the boy is, and as a favor for this piece of information, has his brother go undercover at the house of the boy's adopted parents, who, we just magically are told out of thin air, is the art thief who stole the statue. To be fair, Holmes does find this out himself whilst disguised at the docks, but there is not even a sentence of explanation as to how he made the connection betwixt the shipping yards and the thief. Loose threads such as this littered the story, and really made it impossible to continue holding my attention when we know everything from motive to perpetrator 1/3 of the way through the story.In short, though I am loath to leave books unfinished, it took me five or six days just to slog through to somewhere over page 230, where I finally had to admit defeat. An airy, insubstantial, incredibly dumbed down version of Doyle's creation, the Holmes we were presented with here was but a pale intimation of that great intellect, the ""introspective and pallid dreamer of Baker Street"", and replaced with an action figure more suited for modern audiences who prefer to check their little grey cells at the front door in regards to their reading material. Quite frankly, this was BBC fanfiction with a thinly veiled Sherlock & John in something vaguely resembling the Victorian era, and although saying as much will no doubt get me burned in effigy, it is indeed a sad day if this is what the future of pastiche is destined to become.In conclusion, this is not a recommended read for Holmesians, those of that dying breed who prefer the intellectualism of the originals over sensationalism. I also noticed this book was not endorsed by the ACD estate, and whilst that has never been a factor which weighed at all with me, if this is what does /not/ get approved or vetted by the estate, then I might just have to reconsider that stance.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J14ZK2FXSJ1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0008130833#wasThisHelpful","R2J14ZK2FXSJ1E","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Through a hypothyroid haze, which usually makes reading or concentrating on anything for more than two point five seconds an impossibility, this book could not be pried out of my hands for any enticement - it is such artfully crafted suspense of action and character developments I was hard pressed to put it down.

"The eighth installment of the Agent Pendergast series proved a thrilling change of pace after completing the Diogenes trilogy, and despite a seeming barrage of lukewarm or hostile reviews, which made me half expect this to be a disappointment, it was an excellent, thrilling adventure that ties up some loose ends left over from The Book of the Dead. And very satisfactorily, at that.True, this one diverged from the other books, sometimes dramatically so, yet Pendergast was more his old self here, and proves his worth as a sleuth as he tracks through Europe an ancient artifact which has been stolen from a Tibetan monastery. I did not find the setting detracting in the least, and in fact was a favorable welcome, with some very nail-biting scenes on the high seas.Personally, I did not view this as a weak link in a phenomenal series, only a book that starts off a bit weakly then takes off full speed ahead. A very, very enjoyable, exciting, and a lavishly written read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1479VYPQD2R6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000V2S08Q#wasThisHelpful","R1479VYPQD2R6P","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While this film has undoubtedly garnered some mixed feelings from this particular viewer, if one is patient and is able to suspend disbelief during the more over the top elements, The Physician can be appreciated as a commendably acted, (mostly) cerebral view into an 11th century medical profession that was lamentably bereft of adequate knowledge. With absolutely stunning cinematography that brings to life the medieval Middle east, a twisting plot line and characters that invoke emotion, there is too much here to overlook it because of its glaring - and oft intentional - historical inaccuracies.Opening in medieval London, we are introduced to Rob Cole, who is only a boy when his mother dies, but seems to have a perception or instinct that warns him someone is nearing death. Taken in by a sympathetic ""barber"" who performs medical procedures from his travelling caravan, it is this skill, along with a love of learning, that assists him throughout his apprenticeship, of sorts, to the barber. In all honesty, I nearly gave up on it entirely for the first twenty minutes or so, because it just gets so... odd during Cole's apprenticeship in London.Apparently, medicine has not just stagnated and become a dubious practice, but there are no such things as doctors or hospitals, and no one even knows what the terms mean, which is, of course, entirely the fault of the Church in England, whom it is clearly stated equates the art of medicine with ""necromancy"". They were also the sole reason the old knowledge of Hippocrates was lost (fall of the Roman Empire, anyone?) - but when monks start throwing punches in the street, I must have gazed at my computer screen in abject stupefaction. That... was more than a little heavy handed.Nonetheless, I persisted, and it did indeed improve vastly once Rob begins his trek to the middle eastern lands to find the noted physician, Ibn Sina (portrayed gloriously by Ben Kingsley), where medicine was far more advanced. Islamic and Judaic history also suffer to a milder degree from warpage by either the author of the book this was based on or whoever dramatized the script. It's not quite so over the top, however, and takes a backseat to the story, as not long after Cole arrives, a plague infection breaks out, and while the methods by which the doctors at Ibn Sina's medical university control and effectually cure the disease would not be hit upon until the early 20th century (though some plague experts do believe it was a contagion related to Ebola and not bubonic plague), it made for excellent fodder in watching Cole blossom into one of the best students at the university.With a smattering of romance, intrigue and the political uphevals of the day, The Physician made for a movie I became very involved in, and would certainly recommend it to anyone interested in the ancient Near East and/or the history of medical practices. I enjoyed it on both accounts, and found it to be an excellent movie if one was willing to sift through the flaws and inaccuracies. When all was said and done, I was even interested enough by this production to look into the novel it was based on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AUQIOZZR8T4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RDEISE6#wasThisHelpful","R3AUQIOZZR8T4L","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the past few installments of the Pitt series, in particular, the quality of Ms Perry's work has varied considerably - some I have greatly enjoyed for what they were, whilst others were consigned to a pile in the farthest recesses of my bookshelf, never to be looked upon again. Unfortunately, this latest effort not only falls into the latter category, it is quite possibly the only book to this author's credit that I have ever deemed truly terrible, despite having read a few ""misses"" penned by her over the years.Our humdrum case begins with Thomas Pitt being called upon by Sir Walter to keep guard over a Spanish nun and her ""acolytes"" who have been the recipients of threats, and whose safety Special Branch is taking seriously as it might cause friction with Spain if she were to be harmed on British soil. From thence, the storyline rolls into one excuse after another to degrade Christians, Catholics in particular, and throughout all this soap-boxing against religion and Victorian morality, the investigation goes /absolutely nowhere/, reads more like a gritty police procedural, while that magical feel of the era Perry is always able to convey in her novels regardless of their overall quality, is entirely lacking. Even when her plots go downhill, her books never fail to provide an engrossing read that allows one to travel back into time.I have ever admired the way Anne Perry portrays the underbelly of Victorian London along with the highest echelons of society, and rather than moralizing (which she really is in no position to do), paints a beautiful, if shocking picture of that world. The Angel Court Affair does nothing but paint the ugliness, with characters who are cynical, bitter and nothing like the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt I have come to know.In all honesty, I do find myself wondering if Ms Perry has acquired a ghost writer or two whilst she takes a creative holiday. This book was just so poorly constructed, lifeless, its overall theme so bleakly derisive, the writing style (dare I say almost hard boiled, at times) veering so significantly from her past works, I can come up with no other conclusions. As for myself, I derived no enjoyment from this, and as a long-time admirer of Ms Perry's works, have nonetheless decided it is time to put the Pitt series, at least, on temporary hold.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SNH7QUI7D17Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553391356#wasThisHelpful","R3SNH7QUI7D17Z","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A definite improvement over the last installment, 'Shadow of the Raven' was an elegantly written novel that I was glad to see did periodically return to the series roots as an intelligent glimpse of detection at the dawn of the scientific age. The research concerning the Enclosure Act brought it to life, the descriptions (which never felt like random info dumps) of how its enactment affected the daily lives of commoners who literally depended on the land for survival, was so educational as to be almost historical non-fiction. I honestly found it fascinating.As usual, the mystery was original, and Dr Silkstone skillfully applies his expertise at pathology in the solving of it. Whenever we get to see him in action, the story takes off. Sir Montagu Malthus, the recurring villain, has recruited a surveyor to chart the common lands, and when Turgoose is murdered, Silkstone is called in to perform a post mortem and set the matter to rest. Suspicion, of course, lies with the peasants who derive their livelihood from Ravens's Wood Forest, but the clues may not lead to them, after all. Meanwhile, the drama surrounding Lady Lydia's confinement to a mental institution continues, smothering the life out of the story with practically every scene devoted to her.Unfortunately the only true complaint I have about this book is the reliance it placed on a sordid romance angle, which was not only applied with too heavy a hand throughout, it verged on frustrating for how slowly that facet is developing. It was maddening, like a drawn out soap opera.That excessive amount of emphasis placed on melodrama and extraneous details caused me to frequently struggle with this. I do enjoy a tinge of romance, but it had the tendency to overwhelm an otherwise excellent mystery. Lady Lydia is becoming an annoyingly overdone damsel in distress, and not even a very interesting one, at that. While my technical rating would be 3.5 stars, I still found the good to outweigh the lifeless parts. That being said, I would love to see Dr Silkstone return his focus on crime...","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBEBNKSMREX3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758293399#wasThisHelpful","RBEBNKSMREX3H","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Short stories are my favorites when well penned, and this one was decidedly so. Not being familiar with the novels, I found it richly drawn, steeped in the atmosphere of the time period it was quite simple to guess it took place within, and for such a quick read, the mystery was exceptionally clever, solved entirely by Flavia's considerable knowledge of science.Alan Bradley undoubtedly has a natural talent for contriving a believable, engaging mystery, yet I found Flavia herself defied credulity. The precocious child sleuth seemed just a plot contrivance to make her different from other detectives, when in my estimation the eleven year old girl aspect lowered an otherwise serious book into the pre-teen or young adult category. Disappointing, because Mr Bradley would really have had something here if not for the device of utilizing a child as his main protagonist. An enjoyable read, nonetheless, which I would not hesitate to recommended for lovers of traditionally spun mysteries.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VK8LU8TQNACC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PEPS86E#wasThisHelpful","R1VK8LU8TQNACC","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An outstanding example of early cinema that should appeal to any aficionado of the silent era, this 1922 film also proves its merit as a serious Holmesian adaptation. While there is no question liberties have been taken with characterization, a testament to the fact it was heavily based on William Gilette's infamous stage play, remarkably enough, those changes flow well with both the character and plot, so that this version of the Great Detective's exploits is actually not so Canonically dubious as this purist had originally imagined it might be.Featuring one of the most mesmerizing actors to fill the exalted role of Sherlock Holmes, John Barrymore's portrayal cannot be overlooked. True, the acting was above par, the plot strikingly complex, but he slips into the character so thoroughly, sans all those extraneous trappings not found in the stories, which would later become synonymous with Holmes due to the innumerable other actors who left their mark, even the love aspect becomes tolerable - if not believable. It is obvious Barrymore is deriving a monumental portion of his inspiration from Canon, because while there /is/ a love interest for him in the form of Alice Faulkner, his Holmes remains a thinker, his deductions and solutions deeply motivated in intellectualism. And make no mistake, while it does involve a romance, it is more of a background sub-plot, and this film is decidedly not a love-story.On that account, though, being such an early example, Barrymore has mainly the books to gain insight from, and that is apparent in the way in which he plays a Sherlock Holmes under the spell of Cupid's arrow. His Holmes is obviously head over heels, but still manages to come off as tentatively innocent, quietly reserved about what must be an overwhelming emotion for one so accustomed to repressing them. He is blessedly free of theatricality, truly the ""quiet thinker of Baker Street"".As a general rule, I normally find romance to be off-putting character assassination, but developing it as he did with the confines of how Holmes might react without losing his formidable acumen, Barrymore not only convinced me it could have happened in such a way, but also made it quite endearing. From a personal standpoint, he epitomized Sherlock Holmes for me that well. As did the film itself, its plot strikingly complex, with the entirety of it reminiscent of several Canon stories. I even lost count of how many deductions and snippets of dialogue it paid homage to. And cleverly, too, with a Moriarty that was given a prominent presence and was possibly one of the most ominously creepy Napoleon of Crimes to grace the silver screen until Eric Porter later epitomized the role.Roland Young, unlike others who would follow shortly thereafter, portrays a capable, multifaceted Watson who is a schoolmate of Holmes' at Cambridge, as is Prince Alexis, who has been wrongly accused of theft and petitions the doctor for help. Watson, of course, petitions Holmes to look into the matter, where he sees Moriarty's hand, but is at the present unable to thwart the Professor. After the initial case is resolved - or rather, covered up by Moriarty - Holmes loses sympathy for the Prince regarding his ill treatment of his fiance, who also happens to be the sister of Alice Faulkner. There both his interest in her and that case will lie to rest until many years later, when he learns Moriarty is out to harm Miss Faulkner, who intends to use letters of her sister to blackmail the Prince (a la SCAN), letters he wants for his own nefarious purposes...In summation; intricate plotting, a (apologies, but I must admit it) satisfying romance, competent Dr Watson, Barrymore's eccentric, cerebral Holmes who epitomizes the character, intelligent ""dialogue"" that did not require the complete cessation of neuronal activity, and one pretty impressive Moriarty, made for an extremely enjoyable silent film which is, from a  personal standpoint, deserving of being ranked alongside other Holmesian classics. My only complaint is that Watson, while faithful to the man described in the original stories, his relationship with Holmes ringing true, was shamefully underused here. If that were not the case, I would be hard pressed to say this were not the greatest underrated film adaption. As it stands, its definitely one of the better ones, and really should be viewed by those who love the silents and serious Holmesians alike.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RMCEOEKSKR5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0024EWPE4#wasThisHelpful","R3RMCEOEKSKR5V","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For newcomers to the Ian Rutledge series, 'A Fine Summer's Day' is the perfect introductory. An intricately crafted plot of seemingly disconnected threads, which are linked at its denouement, serves as a conduit for the fleshing out of those characters and situations appearing throughout the previously written books, making this latest installment work well as a standalone or prequel to readers familiar with the other novels. Atmosphere plays as important a role as the story itself; the writers managed to meticulously bring across into its pages the somber pall hanging over England during that ominous summer of 1914.There was much in the way of personal drama for the cast of characters, and the political intrigue that would eventually lead to the Great War was seamlessly threaded into this aspect, and that of the mystery Rutledge is called upon to solve. It was as much well researched historical that truly drew me into the era.Beautifully written, with a complex mystery that should prove difficult for the most seasoned mystery readers to solve, Charles Todd's latest is at its heart the story of how Inspector Rutledge came to be who he is, presented here as the vibrantly youthful man he was before heeding the call of duty and enlisting in the war. I found it to be a believable contrast from his older, more haunted self in ""later"" books, and unlike many prequel/character study oriented novels, I appreciated the focus remained on Rutledge's investigation.Overall, it tilted a bit on the side of slowly paced, but proved an exemplary read that I felt made for a strong inclusion to the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30F9QJBD1SRDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062237128#wasThisHelpful","R30F9QJBD1SRDT","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read one of the Sydney Chamber's novels a few years back, I must confess to being somewhat disappointed in the televised series, which, with each ensuing episode, is rapidly spiraling into a more uninspired - and uninspiring - mystery featuring an Anglican priest who is fairly adept at solving crime, as was the character from the novel, yet unlike his fictionalized counterpart, the series leaves much to be desired in the portrayal of this drinking, smoking, spiritually apathetic priest.Changes have also been effectuated to the script that irreparably distorted the original mysteries, making them dull and contrived, while also adding elements of crassness here and there which are nonexistent in the book.Based on its own merits, Granchester does have potential. While the storyline lacked originality, and plodded along too predictably, the characters of Chambers and Inspector Keating are the only noteworthy aspects to emerge from the hash that was made of it. This is one instance where the adaptation did not simply lose the flavor of the books - it simply lost all flavor whatsoever, however, James Norton and Robson Green do their absolute finest with the rather prosaic material. I am willing to continue watching in the hope for improvements, but those changes will need to be profound if Granchester is to be salvaged.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PA7OAPS4L80J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R041FXA#wasThisHelpful","R2PA7OAPS4L80J","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dare I say it of a mere pilot of an Amazon original series? Yes, I shall - 'Point Of Honor' is unequivocally the finest period dramatization of the Civil War era since the illustrious Gone With The Wind. I exaggerate not; this was a lavishly produced, gripping, emotive glimpse into the lives of Southerners who both supported and renounced the institution of slavery, but who chose to fight for their home, ideals, and literally everything they knew and were born into, crumbling around their ears though it was with the Union invasion. Herein is portrayed admirably what it meant for brother to be pitted against brother, father against son, and that ultimate, very human cost of this familial betrayal for North and South alike.Truly, it evoked the conflicting emotions of these men forced to choose their country versus personal honor, this sentiment never captured more wonderfully than in the scene at West Point, when John Rhodes excuses himself to fight for the Confederacy, reading a letter written to his sister renouncing slavery but adamant to defend his home and state's right to secession.Furthermore, 'Point Of Honor', to my great relief, strayed from the trend of films that villainize all European Americans over a lamentable period in history, while portraying what every Southerner in that time stood to lose, the human toll it took on real families and communities, offering a glimpse of precisely why the Civil War's reverberations are to this day felt so deeply in the lands this awful war was fought upon. By not casting all whites as evil monsters, while also rejecting an outdated institution, this program is an incredible step in the right direction.Aside from that positive light, I genuinely found this to be quite an absorbing drama, its characters lively and bold, despairing that it ended with only one episode to its credit. If this theme is continued, I would gladly watch more, and think it would be a shame if a program of this caliber were discontinued.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KA214L202NK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RSGIH7M#wasThisHelpful","R2KA214L202NK6","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a novel I had been looking forward to for quite some time, never mind that I understood it was set to take liberties with the usual confines of a pastiche, 'Moriarity' ultimately turned out to be an unsatisfying foray into the world of Sherlock Holmes for reasons other than its lack of a Watsonian narration.It begins at the Reichenbach Falls, after the fatal struggle between the great detective and his adversary, where Inspector Athelney Jones of Scotland Yard (who only ever appeared in SIGN), along with a Pinkerton detective by name of Frederick Chase have both been summoned to inspect the recently recovered body of one Professor Moriarty. Chase, we soon learn, finds himself in Switzerland on the heels of an American criminal mastermind to rival the erstwhile Napoleon of Crime, who is effectually spreading his tentacles around London, and will soon be a worse menace than Moriarty ever was. Chase and Jones subsequently join forces in something meant to resemble a Holmes and Watson type association, to track this unknown mastermind back to London, led there by a note discovered in the pocket of the dead man.Athelney Jones has become so far removed from the ineffectual blunderer he was written as in Canon, where he literally pulls asinine assumptions out of his proverbial hat, that I originally wondered if he was indeed not Sherlock Holmes in disguise. Since his last case with Holmes, as described in Horowitz's absolutely brilliant short story 'The Three Monarchs' - which any Holmesians out there really ought to read, even if this particular book does not strike one's fancy - Jones has battled illness, and in his dejection over being showed up by an ""amateur theorist"" a second time around, has taken to studying, replicating to perfection, even, Holmes' methods during his downtime from the Yard. Jones certainly does come off as an overdone caricature of Sherlock Holmes, presented in too similar a fashion to the detective and so unlike even the most perceptive Yarders, it's difficult to believe this Athelney Jones and the one Watson tells us of are not entirely separate entities. And yet, once more of his background is divulged, and the investigation with Chase plays on, he does become a sympathetic, likable character in his own rights.The book had a tendency toward rambling, drawing out a case with what appeared to be unnecessary lulls in the action or depictions of violence - and make no mistake, this rival, or so we are led to believe, indulges in outrageous acts of violence/torture, while giving the impression he is far more brawn than brains. Without elaborating, this aspect was one of many flaws in the story, particularly with the ending, or rather, how Horowitz ties up the loose threads. Which takes me to my absolute main gripe, which I perceive to be an unpardonable authorial sin.For all its uniqueness, shall we say, 'Moriarity' was otherwise an enjoyable, artfully written book, a weak form of pastiche, yet truly a solid novel in its own rights. The blow, however, falls somewhere around the next to last chapter, and does it ever hit hard! The problem entails the very ending, just before the loose ends are explained, and was not so much a plot twist as it was the revelation of a dirty trick that has been played on the reader from the opening chapter. It actually made me angry, a good thing, I suppose, as it indicates I was invested in these characters, but aside from my reaction to this ""twist"", the book fizzled out dramatically in the remaining 30 or so pages. I felt if it /had/ to be done that way, a brief few sentences, several  paragraphs at most, could have concluded it neatly without the endless exposition that only further annoyed. To say this could have been a Holmesian classic that ended poorly is a gross understatement. I found the ending to be a disastrous mess that ruined the entire book, like a domino effect in reverse.My final rating, for whatever it is worth would be that 'Moriarity' held up far better as a classically plotted mystery, especially as any Victorian atmosphere was a bit lacking, then it did if being read as an unorthodox pastiche. This may not be for many Holmesians, especially us stuffy old hats for whom nothing can ever rival the original Canon. That being said, I found the majority of it to be immensely enjoyable, and have settled for a three star rating to balance out the horrible conclusion which might otherwise have earned this offering two stars at most if the rest had been any less engaging. All that having been said, Horowitz remains an author I respect, enjoy reading, and certainly wish to see more pastiches from in the future.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25U1AORX1QLUJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062377183#wasThisHelpful","R25U1AORX1QLUJ","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the overwhelming majority of Christmas compilations disappointing in terms of their neutral winter ""holiday"" content or predilection for taking questionable artistic liberties with well-loved carols, I nearly refrained from purchasing this album - that, and I hadn't much interest in what I assumed might be a promotional item for the series. It was, then, a pleasant little revelation to hear the strains of such beautifully sung traditional late Victorian/Edwardian era hymns, the entirety of which are deeply rooted in British culture.Aside from two inclusions of instrumental themes for the series, and, as I understand it, a few of the actors lending their voices on a number of tracks, the finished product was a refreshing return to traditionalist music that avoided relying too heavily on the television series to carry it off. The most exquisite rendition of 'Panis Angelicus' was of of particular noteworthiness, along with several inclusions by Julian Ovenden that conveyed the wonder of this magical season. And of course, the King's College choir contributed some of the most ethereal and transportive devotionals.This may be an album connected to the Downton Abbey franchise, yet there was nothing that reeked of commercialism here. Only heavenly carols that hearkened back to a bygone era, and emphasized the birth of Christ as being the true reason for the season of Peace on earth and goodwill towards our fellow men.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MC0D0MHB0BKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTMR7QQ#wasThisHelpful","R3MC0D0MHB0BKW","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Rarely have I read anything that opened so superbly as 'The Revolutions'. It was impressive with its fantastic, yet simultaneously authentic depictions of the Victorian fascination with all things occult, the peculiar events Arthur is thrust into, and the romance between him and Josephine which very much showcased what a strong grasp on characterization the author started off with. This book begins as serious historical fiction - with a steampunk twist - reminiscent of Dickens in many veins. The circumstances of the story itself may be off the beaten track, but the descriptions, events and players were so well drawn as to exceed my wildest expectations.After the incident with Josephine, however, it devolved so rapidly, I had to convince myself I was not dreaming, and that the book had actually switched to a Martian setting, where we follow one of the characters who has become stranded on the Red Planet and sift through pages of exposition regarding her experiences therein. All the same, I would gladly have allotted this five stars - and then some - even after it began falling to pieces, as there were still plenty of scenes that made the read worthwhile, that gave glimpses of how outstanding a story it began as.Alas, this was a truly excellent novel irrevocably ruined as it derailed further and further off of what it had been and devolved into something that had no place in this book, not after nearly two hundred pages of setting up the events taking place in London. It not only destroyed the atmosphere so grandiosely achieved, but made the character of Arthur seem inconsistent. The writing was captivating, the characters were fantastic; I had been completely drawn into this world only for the author himself to pluck me out of this wondrous version of London.It strays from the lively atmosphere of Victorian seances into something utterly nonsensical that overshadowed the entire story. The Martian angle would have been great in another book entirely. Despite my complaints regarding the ending, I believe that if a good hundred or so pages were eliminated, and less time elapsed between the start of Josephine's predicament and the point at which she is rescued, even then the last several chapters might have been salvaged, and would have given the book as a whole a Jules Verne feel.Instead, it began to shift from the scenes on Mars to an often overdone element of magical realism - I felt the magician's war unraveled it not only in terms of plot, but with too many erratic changes in the characters. To an extent this extends to the author as well, as his views on the occult and God seem to swing like a pendulum. Then to be bounced back and forth into the heavy science fiction aspect of the Martian world was just too much for me. Somewhere around Chapter Twenty-Seven I became disgusted with what 'The Revolutions' had turned into. From previously adoring this work and being completely invested in Arthur and Josephine, I felt how the story played out was a severe disappointment due to its sheer absurdity. Although I enjoyed a good deal of this book, I had to push it away in frustration after completing it. This could have been one of my favorite stories... as it stands, I hope to entirely forget it and the promise it held at the outset.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29DSB3ZHP8PPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765337177#wasThisHelpful","R29DSB3ZHP8PPR","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This could have been an interesting new spin on alternate history had it not been so predictable from a very early stage, which any reader who has even a passing knowledge of the events surrounding and unfolding after WWI could easily see through. I knew precisely where Mr Cook was headed with this story when he very obviously refers to the war of 1914 as the Great War, when it is set in 1960s America.Herr Altman, upon concluding a speech to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Armistice Day, meets a frail, tired looking old man who attended the same school as him before the war, and who clutches a ""mysterious"" manuscript to his chest. The entire story becomes one prolonged conversation between the two men, with some admittedly nice emphatic realizations on behalf of Altman, but even the sparse crumbs of interest that get dropped here and there are left suspended in the air.Having previously read several stories in the Bibliomysteries series, I definitely expect them to be short and concise, but this is the only one where I can say that its brevity was to its own detriment. Over 25 pages of dialogue between Altman and this nameless ex-soldier were not nearly absorbing enough to warrant being the entire focal point - nor did the intended weight of learning the man's identity have its desired effect, since it was so obvious from an early point who he was.As I mentioned, if the author had taken a less predictable route, this could have been decent, but as it was executed, I felt the story was flat and, sadly, rather pointless.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30CO7BFWZJ845/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JDY7Q38#wasThisHelpful","R30CO7BFWZJ845","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One does not have to be a vintage aeroplane enthusiast to appreciate this delightfully absurd movie revolving around the historic 1910 London-to-Paris air race, although I doubt the actual event was quite so entertaining. The humor sparkles with classic British wit, much physical comedy, while never veering off into the realm of slapstick.Produced in a time long before the advent of CGI or sophisticated wardrobes, the period costumes were excellent, even the dubiously constructed planes go a fair way in recreating the atmosphere of Edwardian England. This is a movie that is not meant to be taken seriously; all the same, it does do a far better job than any 1960s production I am aware of in keeping true to the era.Anyone who appreciates solid acting, the variety of which simply does not exist in any form in modern movies, I dare say this will be a treat to watch. For such a silly comedy, there were some nice moments, and more subtleties than I would have expected. The cast made a superb effort so that the physical scenes are cute without being stupidly so.I have seen a similar films from the time period which I found to be unwatchable for all the overly saccharine silliness. Thar be only clever dialogue here. I am also a little surprised this is not more popular with the Neo-Victoriana crowds, since the cinematography allows for such a realistic peek into the mechanical ingenuity that marked the early twentieth century.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJXJMJUPDV41D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00014NEX0#wasThisHelpful","RJXJMJUPDV41D","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In typical Anne Perry fashion, her latest Thomas & Charlotte Pitt novel begins on a high note, the action never wavering from the opening to its denouement. While this series has ever been rife with rich historical details, Death On Blackheath combines her usual lush descriptions that so completely transport the reader into the time period with pacing so remarkably quick, I believe this may be one of Perry's best literary efforts to date.Instead of sputtering out, both Pitts are in excellent form here. I will ever marvel at the unique plots of these books, and this one in particular is more intricate than I have come to expect. There was much going on in terms of plotting, with twists and turns around ever corner, but Perry never loses the thread. I would go so far as saying this may be one of the most intricate storylines she has yet to contrive.Moreover, more attention is paid on Pitt's partner, Stoker, who has appeared in other works in this series though has previously been flat. I was glad to see him elaborated on, and am beginning to admire him (and many other of the side characters) just as much as the regulars. Perhaps we shall see more of Stoker in one of her Christmas novellas? Either way, a wonderful read from an author who I would swear only becomes stronger as time goes on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37KCCEZTXK9EN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345548388#wasThisHelpful","R37KCCEZTXK9EN","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*** THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS ***When Mycroft Holmes dies suddenly, a now twice-widowed Dr Watson comes to be accidentally reunited with his old friend at the funeral, where Holmes confides in him that his brother's death was in fact a murder he intends to investigate. As Sherlock Holmes has sold his cottage in the Sussex Downs and moved back into Baker Street, he of course asks Watson to do the same. The first few opening chapters were a nicely done getting together of the detective and doctor in their golden years - the meat and potatoes, as it were, of a solid story, were in place. There was an attempt made at recreating those intellectual puzzles of the originals, the idea behind the ciphers was exceptionally clever, and the first few chapters came off as very polished for a first novel. It appeared then, as though we were in for a nice ""retirement era"" story that attempts to recreate, with a few obvious exceptions, the spirit of the duo's old days solving crimes in Victorian England.Except, that is the last thing it actually does.The case revolves around a series of murders where all the victims are ""musical"" and being killed in a very gruesome way. It made for a promising start, but the plot collapses quickly. The historical accuracy was nil - too much of the antagonist's motivation seemed rooted in 21st century sensibilities. It is one thing to take a topic that Watson would have had, for proprieties sake, to leave unpublished, yet another to insert modern situations and reactions to them into a Victorian setting. This contributed to straining an already thin plot. Aside from that, the killer's identity and reasoning behind his murder spree were veneer. There was, essentially, no mystery to solve.The characterizations were not exactly up to par, either. Lily Hudson - who is no substitute for her aunt, the estimable Mrs Hudson - was grating from the very page on which she was introduced, with her overdone cockney accent. Mycroft Holmes was apparently a Bohemian socialite. Holmes, I have to admit, was mostly himself, which is why I stuck with it all the way through. Watson starts off fairly well, however, does not get away so unscathed. Somewhere mid-way through, he becomes an absolute farcical bumbler, who contributed nothing whatsoever to the story and apparently had no other purpose than sleeping and eating. If this was an attempt  portraying the aging process, it was not a successful one.The way Holmes arrives at (or rather, jumps to) conclusions and solves each cipher are often pulled out of thin air. There is no solid reasoning behind why he should arrive at a certain answer or why one particular type of cipher was being used as opposed to another in any given instance, while the solutions seemed just a bit too contrived. At one point, Watson suggests bringing Lily Hudson into their confidences, his reasoning being he believes they might ""need her intuition to supplement Holmes' logic""... and what Watson then goes on to refer to as his own ""shambling efforts"". In this case, my dear doctor, I would have to agree. This poor Watson had the whiff of Nigel Bruce about him.Which brings me to the antagonist, who was ultimately the reason I downgraded this book from the 4 stars I originally planned on rating it, to the 2.5-3 stars I settled for. Holmesians may have our differences, yet I think we can all agree it is indeed a sad day when a villain in a supposed Sherlock Holmes pastiche ""giggles maniacally"". Something, I realized, was gravely amiss when we discover the note left beside Mycroft Holmes' body is signed ""love and bubbles"". This quite literal lunatic asylum escapee who refers to himself as the ""Goatslayer"" is nothing more than a thinly veiled, less coherent BBC Jim Moriarity, a sad comic book character that ultimately ruined the entire book for me.On that note, the final problem here (no pun intended, I swear) was what I suspect the author intended to be the climax. Thinking it could not possibly get any worse after the obligatory Evil Villain Soliloquy we are subjected to, it literally skips from a high tension scene wherein Watson has been kidnapped and bound at the end of one chapter, to the next chapter opening with Holmes and Watson in front of a fire at Baker Street, with Holmes expounding on how he cracked the final code and discovered the doctor's whereabouts. This is not even anti-climactic. There was NO climax whatsoever. It literally went from dramatic scene to explanatory conclusion! I actually had to go back and re-read to make certain I had not missed anything.If anyone has made it this far, my sincerest apologies for the length of this review. Because of its few enjoyable aspects, I am sorry to rate it this low, would even consider other works by the same author, but cannot reconcile many of the major issues this book was plagued by. What did begin as a decent enough story was irreparably ruined by an unbelievable, comic book antagonist and the mess that was its last few chapters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H1R03TGLHV5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780925654#wasThisHelpful","R1H1R03TGLHV5D","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This may have been an artist I was unfamiliar with previously, but I pre-orderd it all the same (because, steampunk), and could not be more delighted with this imaginative book! It turned out to be exactly what I was hoping for. Featuring top quality designs that are primarily geared at adult colorists but suitable for all ages, the artwork is moderately complex while the pictures themselves exude Neo-Victoriana to perfection. Consisting of oddly wonderful gadgets, mechanized devices, automatons, and a few scattered ones of appropriately moustachioed gentlemen, this particular book should be appreciated by those who enjoy the more sci-fi side of steampunk - I've some new metallic colored pencils that have thus far gone well with the artwork. It is vastly different from the two other steampunk coloring books in my collection, and comes very highly recommended by this finicky lover of all things Victoriana.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ABM55UYW6GL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486494438#wasThisHelpful","R3ABM55UYW6GL7","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Raffles stories, written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's brother-in-law as a lighthearted homage to Holmes and his Watson, require no introduction for anyone looking to enjoy them all over again in this definitive e-book edition. To those just discovering them, A.J. Raffles and ""Bunny"" Manders are certainly based on the their more famous crime fighting counterparts, yet they are not at all imitations. If you go into this expecting another Holmes knock-off, you will be sorely disappointed, because characterizations and writing style veers dramatically despite the nods and gentle pokes to the Sherlock Holmes Canon. Enjoy them for what they are, and not what they were based on.As a side note, the formatting is excellent; the editors have even gone so far as to chronologically order both the short and novel length stories. This is a complete and unabridged edition, made even better for the inclusion of several classic pastiches, most of which I have not previously been able to find elsewhere.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R75HJS1CQS50R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D4608WM#wasThisHelpful","R75HJS1CQS50R","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For most of us stuffy Holmesians, this movie will never amount to much more than an ""alternate universe"" reworking of the first meeting between the doctor and detective, and yet, there is not a single adaptation that can claim it is anything other than another writer's revitalization of our much beloved characters. When one considers the liberties taken with Holmes & Watson of late, any deviations here are tame by comparison. This was written with the utmost respect for the source material, and not by someone attempting to outdo Doyle, so in that regard, I view it as a deserving film pastiche.The main divergence from the cold, occasionally misogynistic reasoner of Canon was the insertion of a love interest. I am not particularly enthusiastic about adding romantic elements, though if it had to be done, this was the way to go about it. Elisabeth, the niece of an eccentric inventor, Professor Waxflatter (portrayed, incidentally, by Nigel Stock, who may be remembered as Dr Watson beside both Douglas Wilmer/Peter Cushing in the 1960s BBC series), exudes such a radiance, and is an immensely likeable, competent female lead with absolutely nothing of the dreaded Mary-Sue about her.In fact, Elisabeth becomes less of a distraction to a good Holmes/Watson adventure, and more of a vital addition. What little we do see of the romance, however, quickly takes a back seat to the plot. And an enjoyable one it is, with secret Egyptian societies, a killer who strikes using a dart gun whose poison drives the victim to madness - very reminiscent of the era in general, with elements straight out of SIGN and DEVI.Overall,I was not bothered much by the alterations. Holmes retains his cleverness - as evidenced by some fairly good deductions - and Watson, his heart. In no way whatsoever did it seek to ""reinvent"" Holmes, so much of his character was recognizable enough. The sets and costumes were absolutely glorious, being richly evocative of the mid-Victorian era, making this movie an extremely underrated serious, if slightly darker, period piece. Young Sherlock Holmes may not rank up there with the best of them, but it at least deserves a spot as an above average attempt, and was actually quite good by its own rights. I was prepared not to care for it, but ended up falling for it by the end.As a side note, continue watching until the end credits have finished rolling for the bonus scene...","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35N0M15CDL2TA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000AUHPC#wasThisHelpful","R35N0M15CDL2TA","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before Mariah Mundi's parents go missing, his mother tasks him with keeping his brother safe, and entrusts both sons with the piece of an ancient Egyptian amulet. But he soon finds himself entangled in a quest for the fabled Midas Box when Felix, his younger brother, is kidnapped by the same organization that his parents have fallen afoul of. Help comes to him in the form of a man named Charity, who sets him up as a porter in the hotel where the villainous Otto Luger is keeping Felix, and where he learns the amulet may have a darker secret than he ever expected.The story unfolds quickly, and for a low(ish) budget, independently produced film, I was left impressed with how high the standard was set from the scripting to wardrobe. The Victorian costumes are lovely, the paltry use of CGI not one bit detrimental to the visuals. The plot was original, where unexpected developments abounded, and while technically a young adult movie, it was more than mature enough for any age to enjoy. It may not be the absolute best in the genre when compared to other period sci-fi/adventure films, yet this still held its own nicely.As a bonus, there was no standard Hollywood glorification of filth or depravity here - just a solid movie that provided me with a much needed steampunk fix.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TWQLO8DY8FM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOHZLDO#wasThisHelpful","R2TWQLO8DY8FM","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While this book is set around two intriguing mysteries that did keep me reading when all the other elements either failed to snag my interest or made my blood pressure rise, I have not had the displeasure of reading such a dreadful piece of tripe in quite some time. I normally enjoy books that revolve around Holmes/Watson inspired characters, yet this one made me grateful the author scraped up enough decency to at least change the names.Colin Pendragon and his partner, Ethan Pruitt are called upon by Lady Arnifour to prove that the man Scotland Yard suspects of her husband's murder is innocent of the crime. Sensing more to the story than at first meets the eye, Colin agrees to take the case. In my estimation, the one redeeming factor of the entire book comes into play during the ensuing investigation, as Colin never strikes me as a Detective X sort, asking all the usual suspects the usual questions. Instead, there is a good mystery buried beneath all the detritus that comprised The Arnifour Affair, and many of his inferences, especially at the stable when he reads the tracks, are actually quite inspired. A second plotline also comes into play when a street urchin comes to Colin for help in finding his lost sister, although while not bad, I felt this was the weakest part of the story and did at times bog the plot down.My main issue here was the unrelenting coarseness of every single character which left me unable to sympathize or even like any of the players, including Pendragon and Pruitt. There was not simply a hostility between every person who interacted with one another, but an unaccountable brashness, crudeness and downright nastiness. Related to that was the author's blatant lack of respect - even dislike for - women that shines through with every female character he writes in. Without exception, Harris portrays ALL women as liars, backstabbers, whores, adulterers, general villains or braindead squealing airheads only interested in one thing.Certain scenes and dialogue, instead of coming off as edgy, as I suspect the author was aiming for, became nearly unreadable due to his wretchedly cynical presentation of humanity. His main characters are not exempt from this habit, as at one point, Pruitt wants to ""backhand"" a woman for no other crime than being overly flirtatious with Pendragon. I will leave it there, and let that speak for itself.Less grating on the nerves but no more acceptable were the historical inaccuracies and modern Americanisms which ran rampant through its pages. The text was littered with anachronisms, and a point which one investigation hinged on was based completely on a detail the author, during his no doubt extensive historical researches, failed to discover collapsed the entire plot - that is, there was no ""illegal drug trade"" in late 19th century England. Opiates and other narcotics were frowned upon around the turn of the century, but were still perfectly legal and available at any chemist. And a friendly note to Mr Harris: When writing British fiction, please DO look up modern slang terms as they pertain to the Other Side Of The Pond, because ""tossed off"" does NOT mean what you believe it does. I am also reasonably certain ""ya must be starkers"" was not in use during the reign of Queen Victoria.I will not even get started on the practically criminal overuse of what I suppose were meant to be character quirks. Suffice it to say, if I took a shot every time Colin flipped a coin between his fingers or shot someone a glance, I would need a liver transplant by the last chapter. Overall, I had the feeling this author wrote in the time period not for any great love of it, but to disparage it, and the social mores the Victorians lived by. So while there were some good and interesting parts, it failed miserably on all other accounts, and even the small potential it did show was overshadowed by its problems.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R256ZR7TEUNQF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758292678#wasThisHelpful","R256ZR7TEUNQF6","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For as long as memory serves, this has been a controversial book in Holmesian circles, one which I was warned off reading many years ago, and since being informed of the blasphemies within, have avoided like the plague. I do not appreciate new ""interpretations"" of the Canon that play with the characters to such an extent as to make them consistently unrecognizable, but herein lies the crux of it. Dibdin is one of a scant few authors with the uncanny ability to summon the very essence of the Great Detective and his doctor - yet while I normally delight in such talent for penning an authentic Watsonian narrative, there was no such elation to be had in these pages. The tone throughout is bleak and somber, though knowing what was to come made it an emotionally difficult, oft times disturbing book to get through.The most unnerving part of it all is the way in which the Ripper clues are made to run parallel to what we know about Holmes, even several of his cases. Such was never more apparent as in the first 'Dear Boss' letter, which actually gave me chills when read in the context of the book. And it is not necessarily the nature of the explosive plot reveal that was so upsetting, but that the solid facts of both worlds were so eloquently intertwined. In short, this was in character and at least in the book's setting, was remotely plausible. That, I think, is what unsettled me so badly.Even at this juncture, I am unsure how to rate it. It was exceptionally well written. It was suspenseful, evoked the mood of the Ripper's Whitechapel district, and for the first half of the book, with the investigation still underway, was unquestionably the best Holmes vs. Ripper novel I have read to date. However, if you love Holmes, this is bound to be a profoundly affecting, disturbing book that tosses your emotions into the proverbial wringer. Admittedly, the ending had me in tears. I loved it, while utterly despising it at the same time, especially the way in which it ended. Even then, there is one last act by Holmes that makes you want to love it all over again... while still seething in boiling hot hatred.Needless to say, after coming to the end, I felt like I had been hit by a truck. It is not the sort of book one can really recommend, only advise other readers what it was and was not. For my own part, I only continued reading because the plot hinged on the final few pages of SIGN, where I can remember being very angry with Watson for so blithely overlooking that statement revealing the extent of Holmes' pain over his impending marriage. It is a point I have only ever seen touched on superficially, while the ""what if's"" are thoroughly rummaged through here. What I will state is that it is not a sensationalistic or trashy book intended to profit off Holmes, but be aware if you do decide to give it a chance, it *is* as profoundly disturbing as most Holmesians claim it to be.Dibdin is a genuine (if heretical) devotee of Sherlock Holmes, who is also very well versed in his 'Ripperology', though I think it is fair to say he has written something that has to be the product of the most pernicious plot idea to ever haunt an author. Certainly, it will haunt me for a long time to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18BKL1OOIJOTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007N3WIHA#wasThisHelpful","R18BKL1OOIJOTN","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At its heart, this was an imaginative novel, one that delved into a truly unique world woven into the very texture of the book, where villanous Steam Barons terrorize not only the citizens, but each other. I loved the creativity behind the world building, the color coded lights that identified each Barons territory, and found myself enjoying that aspect even though I am not normally a fan of magical realism. In my estimation, however, it was one of the best aspects therein, as I could not help but feel this fell short of its promise as a Holmes inspired mystery. Evelina is headstrong and fairly capable at investigative work, though in all honesty she did not inherit the lion's share of acumen from the Holmes side of her family. Then again, this is far more of a Victorian era urban fantasy than anything resembling a traditional mystery. I liked the character and found her to be sharp enough at times, in that she did make some capable deductions as to the meaning behind small clues left on the murder victim.That being said, what could truly have been an incredibly enjoyable journey through this vividly created alternate universe London was so fatally crippled by pacing problems that it did, at times, become a very frustrating read. The author has a tendency to describe at great length every thought and motion in excruciating detail, instead of condensing these to a brief summation. The reader does not need to have described for them every step a character makes, or know every thought and insecurity that flutter's through a character's head. Which brings me to another of my issues. The overuse of introspection and painfully overwriting every single scene was one problem, yet the self-doubt and constant stream of questions was quite another. It was amateurish, and unfortunately marred a book I otherwise liked.Because when the reader begins to strike through with imaginary red lines entire blocks (or pages, in some cases) of text, that is never a good sign.Literally, seventy-eight pages covered the events of one night, giving us in painstaking (and altogether unnecessary) detail the actions of every single main character. That translates to SIX entire chapters going through the motions and introspections of what Evelina, Tobias and Nick did during the time preceding and following the murder. And it was not just the tedium of reading through this that aggravated me, when the author uses all these extraneous scenes to do nothing but reveal little tidbits that could have come out over time with, you know, an actual investigation on the part of this supposed amateur detective. And instead of letting the suspense build, events just unfold over the course of the narrative, where Evelina is apparently in absentia for several chapters on end. Random, frequent POV changes are also not my favorite thing.A Study In Silks was, despite my quibbles, a promising start to this series and did contain enough enjoyable parts that I will not rule out taking a peek at the second novel. It did need a good editing and would have only benefited from the trimming of at least a good 100 pages. I think the main problem was that the author excelled more at the steampunk and magical realism elements, but had issues when she attempted to fit in the mystery elements. All in all, not a bad book by any stretch of the imagination, though one I would only recommend to die-hard fans of the genre.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VPCTQGUVTXAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345537181#wasThisHelpful","R3VPCTQGUVTXAY","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started out using Herptivite as an occasional treat for my extremely finicky land snails, just to ensure they were getting all the nutrients they needed after bouts of hibernation or when they decide to turn up their noses at a variety of foods. Even when eating well, I noticed an increase in activity on this supplement, but for my GALS, who require protein in their diet but are infamous for not cooperating when it comes to accepting anything beyond their favorite fruits and veggies, the results I have had with this are amazing.It contains a complete profile of amino acids, and is far superior to the ethoxyquin laced fish flakes most GALS owners recommend to meet protein requirements. Fed 2-3x weekly, Herptivite produces robust health in adults and hatchlings - who often outgrow their parents, and whose colour is strikingly richer than previous generations. There is undeniably a remarkable difference in health, size, weight and life span in those snails who are raised on this supplement.I have also found this to be an efficient way of getting nourishment into convalescing snails, and it has saved or prolonged the lives of many an ill mollusc or one who otherwise would have wasted away after laying eggs. Unlike the cheaper knock-off products sold in pet stores, Herptivite is completely natural, with no artificial coloring agents, flavors or preservatives, and is scientifically formulated to avoid both vitamin imbalance and overdose. I use this in conjunction with Rep-Cal in the pink bottle, and would not recommend any other supplement for herps - or snails.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE9NP4DSZJJR6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00076HT3S#wasThisHelpful","RE9NP4DSZJJR6","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A disremembered rarity that deserves more recognition if only for its bold divergence from early era horror films, 'The Drums of Jeopardy' holds up as a suspenseful thriller that seems to have creepiness down to a fine art. Dark and stormy nights, mad scientists, darkened mansions where phone lines have been cut by the villains, and long intervals of silence in the background soundtrack - all contribute to the atmosphere of gloom. The latter has been utilized to great effect, heightening the suspense as did the deliberate lack of sound in Hitchcock's earlier works, such as in the climax scene of 'Saboteur'.The quick-witted dialogue accentuates this swiftly moving thriller, where the ever menacing threat of Dr Boris Karlov (!), a Bolshevik (the communist party that caused such havoc in Russia) and something of a mad scientist who is spurned into murdering off an entire royal family when one ""ruins"" his daughter, who subsequently takes her own life in disgrace. Her lover, it appears, has gifted her a family heirloom necklace, referred to as the Drums of Jeopardy, which of course has the standard obligatory curse attached to it. Karlov vows vengeance against the Petrovs, returning a single piece of the necklace after each inventive murder.What follows is a political espionage meets your typical old dark house trope, with Karlov picking off each victim in his own dramatic fashion.

"If you can overlook the pithiness of this tale, you will not be disappointed in the substance of the actual story, wherein Wellington and Eliza are summoned to investigate a particularly peculiar haunting. What follows next was a charming bit of seasonal cheer, a nice little character study, and an ingenious twist on Dicken's much beloved classic. This was just an appetizer to hold one over until the next Ministry of Peculiar Occurrences installment, but a very satisfying one indeed, and was just what I needed to get into the holiday spirit... if three months early.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ECU5G741MM2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ALN6PUK#wasThisHelpful","R3ECU5G741MM2O","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having been unimpressed with the mostly lukewarm amalgamations of Sherlock Holmes pastiches set amidst a steampunk backdrop, I was initially skeptical going into this book. There have been no shortages of newly discovered Watsonian manuscripts unearthed from the vaults of Cox & Co. of late, though I have had the sneaking suspicion that most are merely clever forgeries. It is very seldom I can believe the doctor is responsible for the narration or that it is the convincing recounting of a lost case, but if for nothing else, I would rate this book highly for the sole reason that so far as pastiches go, this is definitely the genuine article. There are no paper thin caricatures here, Holmes' deductive process and methods while on a case feature prominently, the narration voice is suitably Victorian, and the science fiction elements were an integral part of the plot - not some weak addition in an attempt to widen the audience appeal.The story takes off quickly, with a bomb detonating in Waterloo Station as Watson is returning from visiting his convalescing wife in the country. Holmes, we soon learn, has been engaged by Mycroft to investigate what is the third in a series of such ""terrorist"" bombings, and here the story takes off, as he follows the trail of Baron Cauchemar, who is something of an urban legend in the East End. Holmes, however, is convinced The Black Baron is not a figment of the collective criminal imagination, and the ensuing investigation leads to wild chases through the London sewer (in which the doctor is not even the slightest bit amused), booby trapped rooms a'la Indiana Jones, technological gadgetry galore, an airship ride over London, and a race to save the monarchy from an overzealous villain. There was more action than one could shake a stick at, all while never slipping on the pacing or characterizations. In that regard, 'The Stuff of Nightmares' was well done, indeed. One of the best ""rediscovered"" Holmes stories I have read in a while, in fact.While the plot begins very well - and the concept behind it also had potential - it is riddled with holes. For instance, we never do learn how (or why) Holmes makes any association with the spate of bombings and Baron Cauchemar. I can believe that Holmes would reject the popular theory, but not that he would pluck some mythological figure of sorts out of the air with no solid reasoning behind it. As it turns out, the Baron is not the bomber, and Holmes knew this, but again, why Holmes even suspected a link between him and the bomber was never clearly stated.The plot also stumbles a bit towards the latter half. Parts of it were conceivable in the context of the story, others not so much. There were also an inordinate number of anachronisms, which was odd being that the author's writing style was so inherently Victorian. They did become infrequent somewhere around the halfway mark, much to my relief. Aside from that, in my opinion, this does outclass most recently published pastiches. The author was well suited to both genres, and this made for an exciting, pleasurable read - one I would have no qualms recommending to any Sherlockian.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HLPEEGB7DA4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781165416#wasThisHelpful","R1HLPEEGB7DA4C","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Gideon Smith's fisherman father is mysteriously killed at sea, his son vows to avenge the death, which he is convinced was not accidental. Intent on enlisting the assistance of his penny dreadful hero, Captain Lucian Trigger, he crosses paths with an aspiring author researching for his new novel - one Bram Stoker - who at first is more interested in the local reports of a large black dog that appears to be the only survivor of a shipwreck than Gideon's claims that monsters were responsible for the death of his father. It seems at first their interests are at cross purposes, but Gideon's monsters and Stoker's vampires turn out to be one in the same - though neither are what they appear to be. Several different story lines then come to the forefront, only to converge in the most unexpected ways, so what seemed like a hodgepodge of unrelated scenes and characters eventually blend seamlessly (and ingeniously) into one.We are thus introduced to an amusing array of fictional, historical and original characters alike - sky pirates, archaeologists, vampires, assorted adventurers, clockwork automatons, Jack the Ripper - and follow along almost rapturously as we are led through this richly described steampunk world. As each layer of the story is peeled back, Gideon uncovers government conspiracies, ancient Egyptian curses and mummies straight out of the pages of his favorite magazine, World Marvels and Wonders. And learns some disappointing truths about his hero, Captain Trigger, in the process.Blending elements of Victoriana, pulp fiction, sci-fi and mystery, Gideon Smith was a fantastically enjoyable and intricately plotted adventure set in an alternate universe London powered by gears and gadgetry. This elaborately contrived world, in fact, practically takes center stage, contributing as much to the story as do the actual characters, and was possibly one of the most imaginative renderings of a steampunk setting I've read to date. This would make for an excellent movie, one that I would actually spend the price of a ticket to see.I did have a few quibbles regarding the overuse of foul language - this may be an instance of the pot calling the kettle black, but I feel strongly that it should be kept out of literature with the exception that it might contribute to the story. Show, don't tell us with one expletive after the next, that the character is a boor. Also, frequent instances of modern turns of phrase did tend to jerk me out of the story.Minor nitpicks aside, I have not enjoyed a story this much in quite a while, and my technical rating would be 4.5 stars for the aforementioned nitpicks and some character development issues in the first few chapters. Overall, though, it reminded me of a Victorian Indiana Jones (with vampires... who do not sparkle) and if this is to be continued into a series, I would read the next one without reservation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X83NC2B61KOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQY7TKC#wasThisHelpful","R1X83NC2B61KOO","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For anyone who is fond of classic high fantasy, 'Swept Up By The Sea' is a charming, character oriented (and extremely tongue-in-cheek) homage to the genre, and I think would best be enjoyed by those who either prefer or are willing to stray from the average YA fantasy novel. I certainly appreciated the deviation, and in spite of a few slow chapters here and there, found myself utterly enchanted by this book.Equal parts adventure, romance and a comedy of errors, the story follows Percival Taylor, who has been given some dubious advice by a gypsy fortune teller, as he seeks to become a pirate... an undertaking which is not so simple as it first appeared. He quite literally stumbles into the seafaring town of Blackshore, where he is unintentionally thrust into one adventure after the next - whether he likes it or not. Tuppence Magrathia-Paddock, who has indulged in a few too many romance novels and subsequently arranges for him to abduct her, while his betrothed, Vestia, has plans of her own to win him back.Awkward situations ensue, much to the reader's advantage. The wit sparkled, the characters are quirky, likable, memorable, and their stories all merge in a very unexpected but satisfying conclusion. I found myself setting it aside at intervals just to savour the story, and this is one of very few books I would unreservedly recommend for all ages. Though it is meant to be a light read, especially for the younger reader, there is much depth to be found within its pages.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J6KFWY1M1FGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609076613#wasThisHelpful","R3J6KFWY1M1FGY","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*** THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SLIGHT SPOILERS ***Maybe I went into this with expectations set too high, but after an atmospheric and spine tingling opening that promised an exciting ride, it was clear by the end of the second chapter that the story was already beginning to deteriorate. It may have started out strongly, but 'Sherlock's Demon' lost a fair bit of its momentum along the way.After Joseph Hepworth's initial ""attack"" of what his wife refers to as possession by the ""Sherlock Holmes Demon"", we meet the team of Ghost Hunters, who are, every last one of them, as flat - and just about as compelling - as cardboard. One character blends right into the next; there was nothing to set them apart or make them interesting. In the one instance where a strong personality was required for the plot, Joseph's sister was deliberately made unlikeable, though even this came off as laughable. Her motives were thin as chiffon and the tweaks to the plot made when she enters the scene were eye-roll inducing. A great suspension of disbelief was required for me to continue reading once she entered onto the stage.The bare outline of this book was actually quite good, though most of the promising aspects were deflated as events progressed. We learn that Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character in this world, and that his spirit does not, in fact, possess the body of Joseph Hepworth. The actual explanation was one of those exasperating moments of the plot. Certain scenes were unnecessarily repetitive while others (primarily the climax, which actually had a clever idea behind it, but was infuriatingly anti-climactic) seemed rushed. The side plot surrounding Kit and Ashara was obviously and annoyingly contrived, their supposedly budding ""relationship"" so one-sided as to be a bit creepy.That aside, for a late night read, this was better than average, containing just enough original elements with a slight twist on the old 'haunted house built on unhallowed ground' trope to make me interested in a ghost story... which I usually hesitate to read. This was also mostly a page turner and Mr Clark's stories are always impressively atmospheric. He can give you the chills with a description. So definitely not his best work, yet a decent read all the same.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KFE0FXLQNBRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EV49D2C#wasThisHelpful","R1KFE0FXLQNBRX","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite numerous attempts to settle into this book, I had a difficult time appreciating what appeared to be an interesting story due to fundamental problems with flow, continuity and structure. The writing was actually quite fluent and beautiful, however there were issues, mainly with the pacing, that I simply could not overlook. From the opening scene, we are quite literally thrown into a choppy, confusing action sequence that should have started things on a high point, but instead, due to the utter lack of explanation as to precisely what was going on, I found the story difficult to follow. There were a few bits mentioning who Clare was fighting off, but only crumbs were dropped for the reader so that there was a perpetual question as to what was occurring in many of the fast moving scenes.This became a trend. Half the time I had trouble picturing what was going on when things picked up, and the other half was spent on entirely too much inward exposition - so that the general pace of `The Red Plague Affair' swung back and forth between choppy action scene to chapters of introspection. There was also a distinct lack of dialogue throughout, which made for tedious reading after a time.Unlike some other serialized novels, there was practically no real introduction here to this world, so if reading this without being familiar with the first book, you might find yourself out at sea in regards to back story. Unfortunate, because the bare bones of the premise intrigued me greatly, though I felt the main issue here was the execution of that idea was sorely lacking, and made this a largely dull novel that took a painfully long time to complete. In fact, back in June, I received this as an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review, and am only just completing it now.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31M1CFUU1XKIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316183733#wasThisHelpful","R31M1CFUU1XKIT","A2VF25F0XZHXMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VF25F0XZHXMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:08 Mins Great toy to make a moving bug. What's even more interesting is the gear system it comes with. Connecting a gear to the motor and then connecting Push/Pull Spring Scales - 250g (2.5 N) - Blue about a centimeter from the center of the gear gave me a chance to demonstrate my seventh grade kid a way to measure the ability of the motor to rotate: torque. When we turned on the motor, the scale stopped the motor at 0.5 N. So the torque is 0.5 N-cm. Very small scale compared to, say Bugatti Veyron, which has an engine that has about 1,100 lb-ft torque.

Not only can you what the key is for, but if you have several of these you can easily match the key to the lock. One last thing, it has an exquisitely designed cover where the key goes, to prevent water to go into the lock.This is a great product and of great quality, which made me curious about the company that makes it. The company is Wordlock. It is a private company. They normally make combination locks using letters instead of numbers. They haven't done that with this particular lock because it is primarily designed for the outdoors. The word Wordlock was commercialized in 2004, 8 centuries after the Chinese had first invented it.I'll probably buy more of Wordlock locks in the future. If the company ever goes public, I'll buy some shares, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VLWAY7I421N9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FHSV4UA#wasThisHelpful","R3VLWAY7I421N9","A1EQ5D5JRSW23K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EQ5D5JRSW23K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WOW...Haitham Alsarraf's new book starts off describing all of Middle East with just two words: Inshallah and Habibi. The first two paragraphs sets off the first peel of an onion that will reduce you to tears of laughter and thinking:--------------------""lnshallah, habibi.""This is the reply I get in Arabic from my floor manager. I request a three-day vacation and all I get back is inshallah, habibi. Not just any inshallah, either. It is the third and most ridiculous one. One being the true religious term, God-willing, which is said with the most seriousness. The second means a careless and ambiguous maybe. This third one, though, is the most potent.It is the least sincere, given without direct eye contact, combed onto a nonchalant smirk and hand-gestured with dramatic, semi-pleading palms. It means there is no way in hell you will get what you request. It is just wishful thinking. Take your pathetic pleading somewhere else. Leave my sight.--------------------","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RKLWJ07JF4X7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1515064794#wasThisHelpful","R2RKLWJ07JF4X7","A1EQ5D5JRSW23K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EQ5D5JRSW23K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This heavy beast of a computer weighs in 5.8 pounds. It feels heavy and bulky, but it is a powerhouse of a computer that boasts i5-5200U two-core processor, 8 GB memory, Intel HD graphics 5500. It's not a gaming machine, as I tried to test it with a few Steam games and noticed intermittent freezes. This could be due to the Intel graphics card. For gaming, a beefy desktop computer with a muscular Nvidia card still seems to rock. For everything else it's a pretty decent computer with responsive Windows 8.1, productivity tools, such as Microsoft Office, and even software development work. It also comes with a free offer of switching to Windows 10 when it becomes available.Security seems to be at the top of the list of this computer. You can't boot this computer with a USB stick, unless you specifically enable this feature through its setup by pressing F2 during boot up to disable the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) and then pressing F12 to boot from a USB stick. After you're done with your USB stick to boot the computer with, I recommend you switch the UEFI back and boot from the main Operating System normally. Otherwise the computer misbehaves.Like I noticed the touchscreen may stop working. Anyway, this is not normal use and not really recommended. I was just testing.Its SD card reader is rather slow. It clocks at about 200 Megabits per seconds, which is an average USB 2.0 speed. But the USB ports, with the same SD card and a reader adapter, clocked reading speeds around 600 Megabits per seconds, which is more in line with the USB 3.0 spec. The USB ports are black in color, as opposed to blue you might see with USB 3.0. In any case, the USB ports are 3.0.External speaker of this machine...forget about it. It's horrible. That's the one reason I'm taking a star off from this product. Otherwise it's a good machine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RANB32OWVFYIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQXZLZ2#wasThisHelpful","RANB32OWVFYIT","A1EQ5D5JRSW23K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EQ5D5JRSW23K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is better than the corded version of the same concept: bone conduction. These support two criticial Bluetooth technologies: Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and Hands-Free Profile (HFP), which works on most Bluetooth 2.0 technologies found with newer, as well as older phones.Its microphone is superb, someone who calls you will hear you with crystal clarity. But hearing them is another matter. It's not impossibly bad, you can hear the other person, but in a muted sort of way unless you can put the end right over your ear, which would beat the purpose of this kind of technology. You'd also have to be in a very quiet place to really hear well; like a library. Any ambient noise, such as a relatively quiet fan will make it really difficult to hear.It does fit nicely as designed, and there's some amplification thanks to a re-chargeable AAA battery inserted in a well-designed compartment.

Kale Chips' is somewhere in between: they're air-crisped under low heat. This probably prevents the enzyme myrosinase getting damaged.

"Loved it. I also heard rumors that the contents of the book is still under litigation.In any case, it is a well written book about you girl born to one of the richest families in the world, the Duke family. The same family better known today for their namesake institution, the Duke University, then the American Tobacco company. The girl is Doris Duke, who grew up sheltered from most rituals of life in general, such as going to school or having a career. Her father, Buck Duke, ensured the wealth of her daughter by betting on the United States early 20th century, which is now known as the American Century. Buying treasury bonds, hedged with tons of gold in safes around the world, Miss Duke was forever banished into being too rich. What she witnesses with people around her and with herself are some of the ugliest extremes of the human nature. The lesson learned here is this: very rich people shouldn't give all their wealth to anyone who doesn't know how to earn it in the first place.
