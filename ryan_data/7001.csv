"With the same ingredients as the usual flea and tick medication I use, the PetArmor is worthy of consideration.  I administer a topical to my dog every month and will include this one in the rotation.  There was no leakage from the package and it was in a plastic case which was an added level of protection.  I always use disposable gloves when applying medication because I don't want to risk getting it on my own skin.  My vet offers a discount on the primary medication I purchase in a yearly supply, so I may not switch to PetArmor, but if it becomes cost effective, I would not hesitate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15WF4XU4Y1QKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWP1QIG#wasThisHelpful","R15WF4XU4Y1QKH","A1ZPY91VE3IDN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPY91VE3IDN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EDIT:  The sealed with a twist bag did not contain 100, but four stacks as follows:  1 stack of 22, 3 stacks of 21.  That makes a total of 85, and not all the cups are even usable.  Some have a rim that is more flat than rounded, with a sharp edge that I am not comfortable serving to my guests.  Nearly half of the cups will be delegated to crafting and not drinking purposes.  This is a very surprising discovery since we have many types of Hefty cups which were all in good shape.  I have reduced my rating from 4 to 2 stars.We use plastic cups for varied purposes from drinking to craft and home repair purposes.  What makes the Hefty Ultimate Easy Grip cups in blue special is not that they are sturdy, but that they are a very pretty blue color that happens to match the paper plates we are using this weekend.  Each cup holds about 18 ounces of cold liquid, not hot.  If held too tightly, even with the embossed finish, they may not crack but they will collapse.  They are not squish free when empty and are definitely not sturdy when filled.  These would be better for use by those who are older than 5 or 6 because younger kids will hold on too tightly, in my experience, and even if the cup is filled halfway, it is not the best.  We don't typically reuse our disposable plastic cups but do find that we can rinse them out and then use the cups for crafting purposes as in painting.  They are also pretty good for serving popped popcorn or snacks and the younger kids have less trouble with the dry foods than liquids in the cups.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E76Z9D3WO1O9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007Y0FJMI#wasThisHelpful","R1E76Z9D3WO1O9","A1ZPY91VE3IDN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPY91VE3IDN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of my sisters is the perfect audience for the Ultimate Disney Party Book because she is a fabulous hostess who loves to prepare coordinated products in every aspect of her event.  I, on the other hand, am more of a haphazard, spur of the moment, mishmash kind of a person when it comes to parties.  This is a book that we both can learn from and we will both be using it because I am happy to share.  The recipes are the weakness, in my opinion, but the templates that are enlarged with printing are worth more than any recipe.  The thematic parties offer enough for boys and girls to become inspired as well as participate in the planning and execution of the event.  Had this book been available when my daughter was younger and wanted the Minnie Mouse dress that had to be exactly like Minnie's, I could have created an entire thematic party.  If your kids are not familiar with some of the characters in the selection, they are pretty easily adaptable if you just follow the basics.  The presentation is very well laid out, just as I would expect from a party planning book.  These are not like Martha Stewart productions, remember it is Disney themed guide.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LCTT1H4J1D5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940787041#wasThisHelpful","R1LCTT1H4J1D5Q","A1ZPY91VE3IDN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPY91VE3IDN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know that the Tropiclean Fresh Breath drops will do anything about bacteria in the dog's mouth and it will not clean her teeth, but it sure is simple to use and it really does neutralize her breath after eating.  She does not like having her teeth brushed, so it is always a chore and I've found their placque removal gel to be a pretty good product if I can catch the dog before bed and rub it onto her teeth.  Using this is a good supplemental product which she does not seem to notice in her water.  Since her bowl of water is small, I use 2 drops as opposed to the 3 recommended in the directions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35SAOS0SX8UX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHU4644#wasThisHelpful","R35SAOS0SX8UX7","A1ZPY91VE3IDN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPY91VE3IDN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The idea of adding a powder to water is good, but the taste of this Seeds of Beauty product is unappealing.  I love pineapple and this does not taste like anything natural or real to me.  I have had to force this down and after less than a week, I have to give up and go for those that are in pill or capsule form.

"Basically the same as the electronics Woods surge protector I recently received, this one has the addition of two coaxial cable ports (IN and OUT) so your cable can be protected through this.  As with the other protector, I like the style of this one but wish the spacing for outlets allowed for larger plugs as are used for many electronics, particularly when used as a multimedia strip.  The sliding covers are pretty good but I do find that with all of the Woods strips, I have to really press the plug into the outlet and it sometimes feels like it is going to break the plastic.  The color is very neutral and the cord is just long enough to prevent excess which can be problematic with such a thick cord.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CXG5MWVGQGH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CHMR4S#wasThisHelpful","R1CXG5MWVGQGH6","A1ZPY91VE3IDN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPY91VE3IDN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is nothing about the Trudeau glass tea maker that I would change and this is not usual for a very picky person.  The size is ideal for a couple of mugs of tea, the strainer is one of the best I've used for all types of tea, the design is perfectly engineered, it is attractive in its simplicity, and it does not drip.  Yes, it does not drip tea as I pour it and this is highly desirable, especially when I pour black tea or chai which can stain.  The system is nicely packaged with the strainer tray protected and enclosed inside the teapot.  It is held together with a simple paper wrapper, so there is not excessive and wasteful packaging.  The well written single sheet manual is enclosed and I like that it even lets the user know the temperatures for steeping assorted teas.  A five year warranty is provided, more than any other I've seen for a glass teapot.  Every part of this snaps securely into the adjacent part and each can be removed for washing.  The protective base can quickly be removed and replaced, so everything can be clean and fresh.  I especially like the way the plastic rim which snaps in and holds the strainer is designed so that when the strainer is lifted by its wire handle, the tea can be dripped directly back into the teapot with no waste or mess.  This is a winner.  I was provided a sample for my honest evaluation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QQQ2ACLKOD92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CWYE0C#wasThisHelpful","R1QQQ2ACLKOD92","A1ZPY91VE3IDN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPY91VE3IDN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The orange color of the VenBaby food storage tray is lovely, the silicone is well formed and a weight that will hold up to many fillings, the rigid cover adds a base if necessary on which to fill and transport the tray, I love it all.  I've been using another brand's covered ice cube trays, but this by Ventien allows for larger portions that are especially perfect for toddler meals.  With a sturdy semitransparent cover that snaps on top of the lip edge of the tray, these can comfortably be stacked as well, and it is easy to figure out what is inside the tray by looking at the color if I forget to label what is inside.  The lid does not make an airtight seal, but neither do the covered ice cube trays.  Just as I do with those, I take the frozen portions and keep them in a zip lock bag which are labeled with food and date.  These can be used for much more than baby foods, especially since they are suited for food use and freeze well.  I received a sample for my honest evaluation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKF3AGISNS0UV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013GLX1LY#wasThisHelpful","RKF3AGISNS0UV","A1ZPY91VE3IDN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPY91VE3IDN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hyland's teething gel is a little messier than the Hyland's sublingual tablets, but it is as effective at calming the baby.  The tube is similar in size and style to others and the ingredients seem to be non-invasive if used as prescribed.  We do not use it every 15 minutes, but less frequently.  Its cost is cheap enough to give it a try since we want to make the baby comfortable as quickly as possible when they are suffering.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AVZTM7W6QWTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00719E0MM#wasThisHelpful","R3AVZTM7W6QWTS","A1ZPY91VE3IDN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPY91VE3IDN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried and used a multitude of disposable gloves and the Ammex GPNB nitrile gloves are by far my favorites.  The fit is perfect, they slip on and off with ease and I have yet to have one break.  To my surprise, there is a sort of sweet smell to the nitrile, but it wears off quickly, so I don't mind because there is no smell on the inside or my hands when I remove the gloves.  These are not made for medical or healthcare uses, but are specifically made for industrial use.

"I wasn't sure how the resident seven-year-old would take to this one.  There are no unicorns, no wizards, and no Stampy Longnose.

"I am beyond thrilled with these!  The fit is true and they are extremely comfortable.  Now, I'm in So Cal, so it's going to be a little bit before we get some significant rain, but the resident seven-year-old and I went out, turned on the hose, and got to splashing.  My feet stayed perfectly dry and the boots still looked good.Most rain boots for adults look, to me, like larger versions of kid's boots.  Cute enough, but they don't fit my personal style.  These don't sacrifice style at all.These are reminiscent of combat boots with a little punk plaid.  Tough, functional, and edgy.  Just perfect!*********************11/3/15 UpdateIt rained yesterday and I wore these boots.  Still an enthusiastic five stars.

"I have to admit that I liked Book 1 a little better than this one, but I still think most middle grade readers are going to love this.  It's a space opera adventure from beginning to end.Don't expect science in this science fiction.  Instead, expect aliens that look like humans, booby traps that act like electronic games, and a whole lot of fun.  You learn a lot more about why there are two teams and you get a little hope for team two - they are starting to realize that not everything is great up there.Above all, you've got some kids to root for.  One of my favorite characters in this 2nd book is a girl with a disability.  I loved the fact that her disability became an ability - and saved the day on one more than one occasion.

"This is an easy breezy beach read of a book.Scarlett is relatable, the story line is very pop and current, and young YA readers will get it.I did find that I liked Scarlett's fan fic story better than I liked the true plot of the book.  It's funny, but as I read, I wanted to know more about Ashbot and less about Scarlett and her troubles.  What saved Scarlett for me was her relationship with an older neighbor.  Scarletts relationship with this old woman was one of the best things about the book (besides Ashbot) and I enjoyed reading it.The book is lightweight - don't look for life changing affirmations or anything truly new in the field of YA - but it's a enjoyable, quick read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKF72HILZB7Z7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595148353#wasThisHelpful","RKF72HILZB7Z7","A231LBC8EGPO5L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A231LBC8EGPO5L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The author puts his character in an impossible situation and it was simply a blast reading and trying to figure out what he was going to do.And it's an ethical situation as well which makes you wonder what you would do in the same situation.At heart, though, this is a good thriller with a supernatural element.

"I was likely at a huge disadvantage here as this was actually my first book in the series.  As such, I did feel a little bit at a loss when it came to the history of the character and would recommend that you may wish to start with the other books first.Overall, I did enjoy this dark foray into Finnish YA.  I enjoyed having a little change from the standard US heroine and felt that the much touted Scandinavian darkness we see in lit did add to the atmosphere of this book.  It's dark, a bit depressing, and does feel a bit like an old fable.Unfortunately, though, there was too much angst  - I didn't care for either love interest - and at times the angst overtook the mystery.As for the mystery itself, I didn't really care about the 'who' and found the answer to be rather anticlimactic.Again, though, I think I would have fared better had I read the other books first.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24L2UTO0HIIT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477829954#wasThisHelpful","R24L2UTO0HIIT6","A231LBC8EGPO5L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A231LBC8EGPO5L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have mixed feelings about this humidifier. On the one hand, it works quite well and the unit is fairly prices. It also has a nice option to put scent pads and Vicks in the humidifier. It's also extremely quiet. When I put it on, I can barely even hear it.On the other hand, it requires more care and maintenance than a misting humidifier. There's a filter pad that apparently has to be replaced every month or so due to bacteria growth. Over a year, that will cost over $100. It's also a bit frustrating in that it's one more thing I have to remember.This is definitely a good option for humidifiers, but just be aware of the full costs and benefits associated with it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RX29GYPFFD49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01410YUH8#wasThisHelpful","R3RX29GYPFFD49","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So far I’ve been a big fan of IDW’s Ninja Turtles series. It’s got great characters and an exciting plot. Issue #44 infamously ended with several major surprises. Volume 12 follows directly thereafter, collecting issues #45-47 and a “free comic” supplement. I’ll have to discuss spoilers from issue #44 to put this volume in context because Volume 12 is all about how everybody deals with the repercussions of what happened.The story doesn’t just return to the status quo in Volume 12; issue #44 had real consequences. Although Donatello is alive (I doubt anybody really thought he would stay dead), he doesn’t just get out of bed and start fighting again. He’s not the same, and might never be. What happens makes sense given the story and his character arc. It’s a neat twist so I won’t spoil it.At the same time, given what happened, it still seems like less has changed than I’d expected at the end of #44. I thought the revelation that Donatello survived came a bit too soon. It makes Donatello’s “death scene” in #44 feel like a cheap fake out. Did the Turtles not check his pulse correctly? I think we should have had at least a few issues to see how the Turtles react to the death.Shredder’s return to the Foot Clan also seemed a bit too hasty. His defeat in the previous arc was a major setback. Yet, by the end of Volume 12, he’s back in power and making more plans. I thought it would have made more sense for Shredder to spend some time in exile (his own “Northampton,” if you will), or suffer more for his defeat.This volume does have a great subplot with the Purple Dragons. With the Foot Clan out of the picture, the Dragons start running wild. There are some nice moments between Casey and Hun. And I love the final battle. As I’ve said before, IDW does a great job making the background characters feel like more than accessories for the TMNT. The battle scene does that better than anything else so far. TMNT’s New York has never felt more like a real place, with real people, with real dreams and aspirations. It’s a unique scene for the TMNT franchise.Volume 12 also provides more hints about the war between the demons, as hinted at during Rat King’s appearance earlier in the series. It’s still not entirely clear who the demons are, but the threat is real and imminent.Volume 12 feels like a transitional arc rather than a coherent arc on its own. Aside from the Purple Dragon subplot, it mostly deals with the fallout from the previous issues. On its own, it’s not that exciting, but it is certainly a necessary piece of the overall story.NOTE: The volume places the free comic book issue second, after issue #45. However, that doesn’t make sense because #46 directly follows from #45, whereas the free comic book shows certain characters in different locations. I’d recommend reading the free comic after reading #46.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8X9OPCL45RHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631404504#wasThisHelpful","R8X9OPCL45RHT","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been getting back into model making recently. I built Bandai's excellent 6'' R2-D2 and C-3PO, but I hadn't gotten any ships from The Force Awakens yet. Unfortunately, Bandai's ship models are difficult to get in the U.S. due to a licensing dispute with Disney, so I decided to try Revell's out offerings. I’ve grown to love the Special Forces TIE Fighter as a neat variation on a classic ship, so I decided to try it out.First of all, this is only a model in a very loose sense. The pieces aren't attached to a rack so there's no cutting required. All the pieces snap together very easily. In fact, the entire construction took less than 10 minutes. So I wouldn't really recommend this for anybody looking for an involved build. In terms of difficulty, it's probably suited more to younger kids.That said, the final product is a really nice version of the TIE Fighter. The ship is over 8 inches tall, and unlike Hasbro’s TIE Fighter this model uses nice, hard plastic (these wings won’t warp) The ship itself is very detailed. You can open the cockpit hatch, but sadly there’s no figure. The model comes partially prepainted, at least the major features like the white wing panels and red stripe, so no need to worry about paint. Best of all - and this was a surprise to me - the ship comes with pretty good sound effects!One (tiny) complaint is that the model doesn't include a stand.

It's certainly great value for your money. I remember getting the Action Fleet version of the Original Trilogy TIE Fighter during the 1990s.

"To be perfectly honest, I was a bit skeptical of this book when I first heard about it. I've read books about China in the past that demonize China and exaggerate its threat to U.S. interests. Fortunately, Peter Navarro takes a much more balanced and level-headed approach. He does a good job outlining the risks inherent in China's rise while carefully considering counterarguments and other points of view.Navarro frames the book as a detective story. The primary question is whether or not the U.S. and China are headed towards war. Each chapter begins with a multiple-choice question. Navarro then proceeds to provide evidence that answers the question. I found this to be a useful approach, especially for readers not as well versed in international affairs. It's a deductive approach to problem solving.Although policy wonks would probably benefit from reading Navarro's book, I suspect the book is probably best suited to the general public. Navarro excels at explaining abstract concepts and the strategic benefits of certain pieces of military hardware. Navarro presents his case in a clearly and in a way accessible to non-experts. That said, I don't consider myself a China expert, but have worked professionally on foreign policy in Asia and follow the news closely, and I found that I certainly learned a bit about China's military capacity.As I said above, I think Navarro is generally quite fair towards China. He clearly views China's rise as a risk, but he never demonizes China. He barely even mentions China's human rights abuses, and certainly doesn't use those abuses to whip up hatred of China. Navarro does take the time to understand China's actions from China's point of view, even if he generally concludes that China's actions are offensive in nature and constitute a threat.Unfortunately, the book (I presume I received the final version) could have used another round of editing. Some of the writing is a bit awkwardly worded. For example, in one of the early chapters, Navarro writes:""Across the broad swath of world history, in fully eleven of the fifteen times since 1500 that a rising power like China faced an established power like the United States, war resulted more than 70 percent of the time.""It's not clear if this refers to 70% of 15 or 70% of 11. I also noticed a few errors, which I assume are the result of typos rather that the author's lack of factual knowledge, because he seems to have done his homework on other issues.Despite a few missteps here or there, Navarro's book provides a well reasoned ""hawk"" perspective of China's rise. I definitely recommend it, especially if you want a primer on U.S. security relations with China.[I received a free copy of this book from the author in exchange for a fair and honest review]","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EXZE2XHGRGKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633881148#wasThisHelpful","R1EXZE2XHGRGKA","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Over a decade ago, Tom Holland wrote ""Rubicon,"" one of the best popular histories of the fall of the Roman Republic. It's the book that truly ignited my passion for the time period. I've since read more detailed histories of the period, but Tom Holland has an incredible knack for bringing the history to life and making it exciting. So, after several books about other periods of ancient and medieval history, I was very excited to hear that Holland has returned to his roots in ""Dynasty,"" his sequel Rubicon.In ""Dynasty,"" Holland accounts for the history of the five Julio-Claudian emperors: Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero. Those names are already household names and part of pop culture, partly due to films like ""Caligula"" and Robert Graves' ""I, Claudius."" Most of what people know - or think they know - about these emperors is shrouded in myth and gossip. The depictions in the arts especially have emphasized the outrageous scandals of the emperors. Add to that the fact that history was often written by the Roman elite and it becomes surprisingly difficult to piece together information about each man's rule.As such, I was pleased to see Holland's first chapter in ""Dynasty"" tackle the problem head on. Holland discusses the biases in our sources and how some of the myths surrounding the Julio-Claudian emperors are just myths. Holland's appraisal of each emperor is surprisingly balanced. In fact, even Caligula and Nero come off as more than just madmen. Sure, they were cruel and had despicable tastes in entertainment, but some of their excesses were carefully calculated. Holland makes note that the public at large adored Nero and to a lesser extent Caligula.""Dynasty"" focuses on court politics within the imperial family. Holland focuses almost exclusively on events in Rome, except for when the emperor himself leaves the capital. In some ways, the focus of he book matches the realty of imperial politics. Roman elites tended to look inward, ignoring the vast provinces. I suspect anybody who has ready ""Rubicon"" will know enough about basic Roman history to follow along, but just be aware that this book doesn't go out of its way to provide a general history of the empire.My one criticism of this book is that Holland has a habit of using quotes in the text without citing the author in-text (although there is invariably a footnote). I think it's always good practice to mention the name of the author/speaker so readers understand the context of the quote. Sometimes we can assume that it's a historian or famous writer, such as Ovid, commenting about the local gossip. It's important to know the source of the gossipy quotes so we can evaluate their reliability, especially given what Holland states in the introduction about such gossip.I hope Holland's next book covers the five ""good"" Roman emperors!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROTPKOCO6IX5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385537840#wasThisHelpful","ROTPKOCO6IX5U","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Most of us in the West know Xerxes as the Persian king who lost a war against the Greeks. Popular historians have often depicted him as indolent and indulgent. The movie 300 is probably the most prominent depiction of Xerxes in pop culture in recent years. If nothing else, Richard Stoneman tries to disabuse readers of those prior conceptions in his new biography “Xerxes,” the first major biography of the king in decades.Stoneman argues that Xerxes was likely not the caricature history has often depicted. He puts the Greek war in perspective, noting that Xerxes continued to rule 15 years after his defeat at Salamis. Instead, Stoneman points to Xerxes’ public building projects at Persepolis as his true mark on history. He also points out that, far from being a womanizer, for most of his life Xerxes had only one wife and seemed devoted to her.Stoneman even manages to put Xerxes’ supposed cruelty in context. In traditional Persian conceptions of kingship, the king symbolized the kingdom. So when Xerxes asked soldiers to depart from a ship to allow the king to board – leading to their certain death – we should view that as not simply cowardice but as a testament to the importance of the king.Stoneman is excellent at finding new ways of understanding ancient Persian political culture. Yet, as he seems to admit, he can’t bring Xerxes “to life” for modern readers. Part of this is due to the lack of sources; we can’t psychoanalyze Xerxes without data. But Stoneman’s writing also tends to be dry. Stoneman spends much of the book countering the more dramaticized popular depictions of Xerxes, so perhaps his style is deliberate.Stoneman’s book is geared more towards historians than for the general public. He references other scholars and historical figures with little explanation or context. If you don’t know who Themistocles is before going into the book, this probably isn’t for you. However, if you’re familiar with the basic history of the time and want help separating myth from reality, Stoneman is a good guide.(For readers looking for a dramatic retelling of the Greco-Persian War, I recommend Tom Holland’s Persian Fire.)[I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review]","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL0KMENRHPVEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300180071#wasThisHelpful","RL0KMENRHPVEN","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The format of the book is very plain but efficient, fitting many questions on each page without ever looking crowded.This book isn't for people wanting to learn more about their favorite franchises so much as for people who want to test each other's knowledge about the genre in general.

"As others have already stated, this model kit is wonderful. It's like a Build-a-Droid line for Hasbro's The Black Series 6'' action figure line (but better quality!). I won't repeat the praise ad nausea, but thought I'd share my pictures and mention a few tips.I like my droids pretty weathered, so I used a black acrylic weathering paint to highlight the detailing in the models. Just paint over the pieces and wipe clean and the extra paint will sink into the details. There are also weathering kits you can buy to simulate sand, mud, and other environmental weathering.The model kit's R2-D2 dome is cast in silver plastic. It looks pretty good, but if you want to make it look like real plated chrome I suggest Testers Chrome paint spray. I'd suggest spraying the chrome dome pieces before inserting any of the non-chrome pieces, but assemble the dome as much as possible to coat it evenly. Also, make sure you start spraying away from the pieces to allow the spray can to get rid of air bubbles first.I wasn't a fan of decals so I used the stickers. They usually worked well, but there are a few stickers designed for tiny silver highlighting on the droids. They don't look realistic because they have clear background overhang, so I recommend just using a paint pen or marker for those areas.Overall, these are really fun to build and make for great 6'' figures. I actually ordered another kit so I can make another R2 that's completely clean (a Prequel-era version).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R203OROKYEILSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RYSALNC#wasThisHelpful","R203OROKYEILSP","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Irwin F. Gelman's The President and the Apprentice is revisionist history in the best sense in that it completely upends that conventional wisdom, but does so in a credible manner and based on convincing evidence. Gelman argues that President Eisenhower and Vice President Nixon actually had a productive and respectful working relationship. Ike saw Nixon as a skilled politician with potential. More importantly, he trusted Nixon with important assignments, from lobbying Congress on behalf of the administration to representing the U.S. overseas to chairing government civil rights boards. Unlike FDR's vice president, Nixon's vice presidency was worth more than ""a bucket of warm piss.""Gelman relies heavily upon Ike's handwritten notes and correspondence to close friends and family, especially his brother Milton, to reveal Eisenhower's thoughts on his vice president. These documents are revealing. As Nixon gave his Checker's Speech live on TV, Eisenhower wrote down words of support and viewed the speech as a success. In his letters, Ike generally told others that Nixon carried out his duties capably and seldom complained about his performance. As a bonus, Gelman includes many of these primary documents in the appendices.At best, Ike and Nixon complemented each others skills and compensated for each other's weaknesses. Having come from the Army, Ike was an excellent bureaucratic manager, but knew little - and cared less - about partisan politics. Ike managed to find ways to utilize his vice president, far more so than any of his predecessors. On the other hand, Nixon, who built his reputation in Congress, was keenly aware of the political implications of any action. Nixon often advised Eisenhower and the cabinet on the political implications of the administrations policies.The Ike-Nixon relationship did suffer some occasional friction, but more because of misunderstanding than because of personal or professional animosity. Ike often failed to appreciate how his actions would be perceived in a political arena. For example, in 1956, Eisenhower famously urged Nixon to take a cabinet appointment rather than seek renomination as vice president. Gelman convincingly argues that to Eisenhower this was not an attempt to ""dump Nixon,"" but rather a show of support - Ike thought a cabinet post would provide Nixon with management experience and better prepare him for the 1960 campaign. However, Nixon the politician believed that political observers would perceive a cabinet position as a demotion.As others have noted, this book - or at least the advance review copy I received - seemed plagued with formatting issues and editing problems. There was quite a bit of repetition in later sections as the author reintroduces people or events for the second or third time. It definitely didn't seem fully polished. The organization is a bit jumbled as well. The book proceeds roughly chronologically with chapters for various subjects, but it sometimes jumps around for no apparent reason. Despite this, I definitely recommend it to those interested in US presidential history and foreign policy.[I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review]","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8SY4BOQTDUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010M92FC4#wasThisHelpful","R8SY4BOQTDUC","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So far, I’ve been very impressed with the storytelling in IDW’s new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics. The Mutanimals miniseries exemplifies several of the things that IDW has done particularly well compared to previous incarnations of the franchise.In the 1987 cartoon series, it sometimes seemed like new characters would appear on-screen just long enough to sell action figures. However, IDW really takes the time to give many of these secondary and tertiary characters their own arcs. The New York City in the IDW series feels like it’s populated by hundreds of fascinating characters. I find myself enjoying the time I spend with them as much as if not more than the time spent with the Turtles.The Mutanimals are a particularly fun bunch. As kids, I’m sure many of us thought it’d be cool to see another group of mutant crime-fighters. And the Mutanimals aren’t just a “discount” version of the TMNT (like the mutant frogs they encounter in the cartoon). Each of the Mutanimals comes from a different type of animal and has a unique personality. As morally ambiguous characters, the Mutanimals seem well suited to our current post-9/11 world. They’re terrorists or freedom-fighters, depending on your point of view.It’s a credit to the author and IDW that, in a comic about mutant animals, I spend so much time thinking about the depth of characterization. Old Hob and Slash both come across as fascinating characters, regardless of their appearance. Hob is an emotionally scarred fighter out for revenge, but he also truly cares about his fellow mutants. Slash idolizes Michelangelo and wants to be a hero, but, like another giant green comic book character, has anger issues that threaten his relationships with his friends. The two play off each other well as they debate the extent to which the ends justify the means.Herman the Crab, Mondo Gecko, and Pigeon Pete don’t receive as much attention, but they have their moments. In one scene, Pete talks about his nightmares, suggesting that he’s more than a brainless bird. Mondo is generally a surfer dude, but we also see him get flustered and anxious when others aren’t as personable. Even Lindsay, the human lab assistant, has a surprising character twist.The Mutanimals miniseries introduces several new mutants, including Mutagen Man, Ray Filet, and Sally Pride. The latter two are introduced rather late and don’t receive much attention, but Mutagen Man – a brain in a suit filled with ooze – is perhaps the unexpected star of the miniseries. He’d been traumatized by lab experiments at Null Corporation, which plays to Old Hob’s best and worst instincts. Mutagen Man struggles to establish a “normal” life on the outside, but can’t completely escape his past. Mutagen Man is one of the IDW series’ darkest characters, which is saying something.Unfortunately, the comic doesn’t do enough to develop the villains, which is a shame because IDW’s other villains have generally been exceptional. The Null Corporation is run by a woman who literally looks like the devil who wants to use her business empire to build a race of mutant servants. It’s never clearly explained why she looks like the devil, but she certainly acts the part. Overall, she comes across as a less interesting, less subtle version of Baxter Stockman.Overall, if you’re following IDW’s TMNT series, you should definitely read the Mutanimals miniseries. The Mutanimals have already played an important role in the main series, and this miniseries gives the characters even more depth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VOJ8JFSXIJ99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631403850#wasThisHelpful","R1VOJ8JFSXIJ99","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Galaxy Quest” is an odd choice for a comic sequel. The original movie was primarily a parody of “Star Trek.”  Yet, the movie has developed enough of a fanbase that Paramount is reportedly even considering a “Galaxy Quest” TV show. So the question becomes how does one write a comic sequel? Should it be another parody or should it be an adventure set in that universe?The authors of this comic seem to have primarily taken the latter path. “The Journey Continues” is exactly as it sounds, yet another adventure with the “Galaxy Quest” crew. This time, a race of alien lizards forces them to help undo some of the inadvertent effects of the Omega 13 Device.The best thing about “The Journey Continues” is seeing where all the characters end up after the movie. All the crew members star in a sequel show (“The Journey Continues”). Fred is married to a Thermian, Guy is angling for a spinoff show, and Brandon gets a degree in engineering. Unfortunately, some of the characters got left by the wayside. We don’t learn anything much about Gwen or Tommy.One of the things I loved about “Galaxy Quest” is that, even though it was a spoof, it contained truly bizarre aliens and was a fun story in itself. In theory, the comic format should have free the writers to be even more creative than the movie. After all, they don’t have to pay for the special effects budget of giant rock monsters and epic space battles. Yet, I found “The Journey Continues” to be comparatively tame and self-contained. Aside from the lizard aliens and one monster, there was relatively little bizarre or exotic. It felt like less of an adventure.The comic does include some clever moments of parody. I especially liked how it played with sci-fi tropes about appearances of alien races (we always assume reptilian aliens are evil). There were also some funny moments spoofing the trope of evil twins or clones. The comic is never quite as hilarious as the movie, but it definitely has the humor.The artwork is generally pretty good, but the artist really doesn’t capture the characters’ likenesses. I suspect that the publisher couldn’t obtain the rights to use the actors’ likenesses for the comic and so just used generalized caricatures. However, I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish the character apart (especially the white males). In real life, Tim Allen looks nothing like Tony Shalhoub or Alan Rickman.Overall, “The Journey Continues” might satisfy your Questerian fix – at least until the TV show – but doesn’t quite capture the magic of the original. To be fair, the writers were stuck in a dilemma. I don’t think the movie lends itself to sequels and world-building. It’s tough to make a successful sequel to a spoof unless the writers come up with a fresh angle (or some other gimmick, as with “mini-me” in the second “Austin Powers” movie). Spoofing the same material the same way is bound to yield diminishing returns. Yet, as a comic, the writers probably couldn’t do too much with the characters or take the franchise in drastic new directions. So, it’s more of the same.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LB63IRA541S3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631403567#wasThisHelpful","R2LB63IRA541S3","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've always liked the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, if largely for the sheer spectacle of the Triwizard Tournament. Unlike its predecessors, the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is very different from the book - necessitated in part because the book is almost twice the length of Prisoner of Azkaban.Goblet of Fire contains an entire subplot about House-elf rights not even referenced in the films. It's an interesting social commentary and adds another layer of moral complexity to the Harry Potter series. Unfortunately, the characters' responses to the House-elves plight puzzles me, to say the least.Harry, Hermione, and Ron learn that Dobby now works at Hogwarts as a free Elf. However, they also learn that hundreds of House-elves work in Hogwarts, basically as slaves. This immediately strains credibility. Harry, Hermione, and Ron have all snuck around Hogwarts at night. In Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry even learns about the secret passageways. I simply cannot believe that they'd never spotted any House-elves during their three years at the school. Up to this point. Hermione seemed to know every minute detail about the school and its history. Perhaps they were simply never curious and, like many kids, never wondered about the domestic help who cleaned up after them.Hermione takes a strong interest in the plight of the House-elves and decides to form the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare (S.P.E.W.) to advocate for Elf rights. Despite her best efforts, neither Harry nor Ron join her crusade. In fact, they seem blasé about the House-elf situation and believe that the Elves are happy to work at Hogwarts. Harry even seems a tad insensitive; for Christmas, he gives Dobby - who risked his life for Harry in Chamber of Secrets - an old sock. Meanwhile, Ron teases Hermione for being obsessed with S.P.E.W.I'm all for letting Harry and Ron's characters wade into morally ambiguous territory, but this setup doesn't quite ring true. If anything, given his backgrounds, Harry should have been more sympathetic to the plight of House-elves than Hermione. When we first met him in Sorcerer's Stone, the Dursleys basically treated Harry like a House-elf, forcing him to do chores and otherwise stay out of sight. In Chamber of Secrets, he actually developed a friendship with Dobby, and thus should have had a personal stake in the House-elf question.As any social activist knows, personal appeals are often the most effective. I kept waiting for Hermione to say something like: ""Harry, did you like the way your uncle and aunt treated you? Living under that staircase? Didn't they order you to act happy in front of guests? Imagine your life if Hagrid hadn't come to rescue you. How different is your situation from the House-elves, really? Except they don't have a Hagrid."" Even if such an appeal didn't convince Harry to wholeheartedly join S.P.E.W., I think the character really need to confront the fact that he was turning his back on individuals in a situation similar to what he experienced under the Dursleys.Believability aside, the House-elf subplot adds an interesting twist by suggesting that the world readers saw simply as ""magical"" in Sorcerer's Stone actually runs on slave labor. Again, as Harry grows up, the world is no longer black and white. As Sirius Black says, ""If you want to know what a man's really like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors..."" At the same time, Rowling strikes a delicate balance. Despite Hermione's pleading, the plight of the House-elves isn't so desperate that readers become disgusted with Harry or Ron. The House-elves have always been somewhat comical figures and do seem to genuinely prefer servitude. We might admire Dobby's Braveheart-like passion for freedom, and we be frustrated by the limits of Harry's compassion, but I doubt many readers come away from Goblet of Fire thinking that Harry condones slavery.If anything, Goblet of Fire seems to use the House-elf subplot as social commentary on society's blind neglect of societal injustice. We know that problems exist in the world but rarely do we do anything about them. Most of us - and Rowling's largely Western, middle-class readership - never dig too deeply into the lives janitors, waiters, bus drivers, etc. A news article about Asian companies using slaves to catch seafood might jolt some readers, but will probably prevent few from taking action - if they even remember the following day. Goblet of Fire doesn't seem to imply that, in accepting House-elf servitude, Harry - or readers who engage in similar blind neglect - is becoming like Voldemort. It does make clear though that Harry will have to learn pity before he can become a truly admirable adult.For all my discussion about the House-elves, they're a small part of Goblet of Fire. The later Harry Potter books continue the House-elf subplot. There's some payoff for Harry and Ron's character development, but oddly the larger issue of House-elf rights remains unresolved by the final book. Perhaps this is meant to convey the difficult of social change? In any case, the House-elf question provides an interesting subplot throughout he series, but I wish the characters had had more meaningful and personal conversations about the subject.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R287U94IFXUXDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00728DYCO#wasThisHelpful","R287U94IFXUXDT","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Admittedly, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was my least favorite of the films, so I approached this book with some trepidation. The Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets isn’t quite so bad, but I still can’t help but wonder what exactly Harry learned in this book. What role does this book serve in the larger Harry Potter mythos?I think one problem is that, through Dumbledore, the book misrepresents Harry’s character development. Indeed, I’d argue this book muddles the larger themes of the Harry Potter series. It’s as if Dumbledore doesn’t quite understand what’s going on in his own story.At the end of Chamber of Secrets, Harry tells Dumbledore that he’s worried about the similarities between himself and Tom Riddle (a.k.a. Voldemort). Dumbledore reassures him by saying, “It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.” It’s a nice sentiment, but what does it have to do with this story?First, I doubt that any reader actually saw anything more than superficial similarities between Harry and Voldemort. Yes, they’re both orphans with brown hair who became talented wizards. But that’s about it. There are probably hundreds of kids who fit that description, even at Hogwarts. Harry has been nothing but a nice, innocent kid. By his age, Voldemort was already torturing other kids and stealing things. I just don’t think the books give us enough to take seriously the idea that Harry might really follow in Voldemort’s footsteps.Even more problematic, Dumbledore seems to frame the whole story as a matter of choice, yet everything in the story thus far suggests the opposite. Nowhere in Chamber of Secrets does Harry ever “choose” to be good or resist evil temptations. He always acts with intent to defeat the villain. He seems genuinely disgusted by anti-muggle bigotry and Voldemort’s actions.The story could have presented Harry with a moral decision. For example, there’s a scene in which other students think Harry told a snake to attack Justin Finch-Fletchley. The movie tries to create some ambiguity by making Harry sound slightly menacing when speaking Parseltongue. However, it doesn’t really work because Harry has no motivation to attack Justin. The scene is even less ambiguous in the book because, as the point of view character, we know all of Harry’s thoughts and know that he never intended harm.If the snake had been poised to attack Draco Malfoy instead of Justin, Harry might have felt tempted to attack. Harry and Malfoy are antagonists. Harry resents Malfoy’s attempts to bully him and his friends. From Malfoy’s own statements, it seems quite clear that he would have been happy to have the Basilisk kill muggle students. As such, it wouldn’t be hard to imagine Harry rationalizing an attack on Malfoy as “for the greater good,” to rid the world of a bully. If Harry had been confronted with that choice and decided against attacking Malfoy, then I’d be impressed with his actions.Another point that undermines Dumbledore’s argument is that in the Harry Potter series generally treats characters as innately good or innately evil. Even from the very beginning, Harry is portrayed as inherently good. We never see him ever learn right from wrong; he certainly didn’t acquire his sense of morality from the Dursleys. While the character might occasionally get angry, jealous, or frustrated, he never comes close to slipping toward Voldemortism. It’s worth contrasting him with Luke Skywalker in Star Wars, who clearly did give into his anger and attack enemies with aggression. In Return of the Jedi, Luke saw the danger of his actions and made a clear decision to reject the Dark Side.Then we have the Sorting Hat. When students first come to Hogwarts, they are sorted into houses – before they make any choices of consequence. Gryffindor House is clearly affiliated with the heroes, Slytherin House contains all of the villains, Ravenclaw House has the intellectuals, and Hufflepuff House has… well, I’m not quite sure what it has. Ever sinister character we meet up to this point belongs to Slytherin; there are no villains in this story who do not belong to Slytherin. There are of course a few exceptions, especially in the later books, but a character’s house affiliation is a remarkably reliable predictor of that character’s moral worldview.Ultimately, Chamber of Secrets simply isn’t a story about characters making moral choices. Does this mean that the Harry Potter books are devoid of moral dilemmas? That Harry never has to face tough decisions? No. In a way, the choices that Harry does confront in the later books are more meaningful than a simplistic choice between good and evil. I’ll save that discussion for a later review. In the meantime, just remember not to take Dumbledore’s interpretation of the story as definitive.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R104KJVC22YGMX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0439064872#wasThisHelpful","R104KJVC22YGMX","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my review of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I suggested that the structure of the Harry Potter series mirrors the process of children maturing into adulthood. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban continues the process by introducing layers of complexity and shades of grey. The book challenges Harry's - and readers' - preconceptions about Harry's world.In the previous Harry Potter books, adults were at best distant authority figures, like Dumbledore, and at worst arbitrary bullies, like Vernon Dursley. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets began to demystify adult authority figures by deconstructing the celebrity Gilderoy Lockhart and proving Hagrid's innocence. Prisoner of Azkaban allows Harry to develop meaningful relationships with adult characters and to see them as friends.For the first time, Harry finds a mentor and confidant in the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin. Previously, Harry's instinct had always been to mistrust adults and refuse to share his concerns with them. At one point, Lupin asks Harry if anything is bothering him. At first, Harry lies and responds, ""no,"" but then immediately changes his mind and says, ""yes."" He then asks Lupin why he had prevented Harry from confronting the Boggart during one of the Defense Against the Dark Arts classes. It's an important moment because Harry makes himself vulnerable by opening up to an adult. He realizes that he doesn't have all of the answers and that he can turn to adults for help - at least some adults.Harry also develops an unexpected relationship with Sirius Black. At the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban, the Ministry of Magic warns that convicted mass murderer Sirius Black had escaped  from Azkaban Prison. The book builds Sirius up as a major threat, especially after Harry overhears a conversation in which a Ministry official claims Sirius killed Harry's parents. Then, near the end, the book pulls the rug from under readers by revealing that Sirius is innocent and is in fact Harry's godfather. However, it's important that Sirius never treats Harry as just a kid; Sirius always seemed more like Harry's cool older brother than a parental figure. In a way, he acts as a bridge figure in Harry's interactions with adults.Prisoner of Azkaban trains readers to not trust first impressions. Everything in the first three-quarters of this book - the Ministry of Magic, Hogwarts professors, the media - tells Harry and the reader to fear Sirius. Only Sirius and Lupin's word - and Harry's instincts - suggest otherwise. It's a sign of Harry's maturity that he's able to abandon his preconceptions when confronted with new evidence and accept Sirius. This twist also helps prepare readers for more dramatic reveals about major characters later in the series.That said, I felt the ending cheated a bit. Harry and Hermione to use a Time-Turner to travel back in time and rescue both the Hypogriff Buckbeak and Sirius Black. Time travel stories are always problematic because of paradoxes. If somebody goes back in time and changes the past, then wouldn't that remove the initial reason for that person to originally go back to the past in the first place? Prisoner of Azkaban cleverly acknowledges this by not actually having Harry and Hermione change the past, but rather fulfill actions in the past that were simply ""off-screen."" It turns out that future versions of Harry and Hermione had already rescued Buckbeak and Sirius; we the reader just didn't realize it. However, this then opens the question of why the characters couldn't just use the Time-Turner to solve almost every problem they encounter (as spoofed by How It Should Have Ended).Ultimately, time travel stories can't get around these problems, which is why the best time travel stories use time travel as a device to tell a story, rather than merely as a device to solve a problem in the story. My favorite time travel stories put familiar characters in an unfamiliar time and place, the classic ""fish out of water"" scenario. Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home did this effectively, not only providing laughs as the Enterprise crew wanders around San Fransisco during the 1980s, but also warning against overexploitation of natural resources. Back to the Future, arguably the most famous time travel movie, is really a movie about characters, with time travel simply an excuse for Marty McFly to meet his parents as teenagers. Stories that use time travel too freely, such as Looper, tend to get bogged down in internal inconsistencies and plot holes.Unfortunately, Prisoner of Azkaban uses time travel as a plot contrivance to get Harry out of an impossible situation. Not only does it create plot holes, but it also undermines the themes of the book. By enabling Harry to save both Buckbeak and Sirius, time travel conveniently allows the heroes to have their cake and eat it too. This seems contrary to the idea layered complexity and moral ambiguity that the book introduces. I give the Harry Potter series credit for not relying too heavily on gimmicks and magical devices to resolve the characters' problems The later books don't shy away from forcing the heroes to make sacrifices. Perhaps Prisoner of Azkaban is meant to be one last hurrah for easy answers to tough problems.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J3867HUF3F4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00728DYP6#wasThisHelpful","R3J3867HUF3F4G","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine flex their Force muscles in Paul Kemp's Lords of the Sith, but the real stars of this book are Cham Syndulla and his rebellion on Ryloth. In his previous Star Wars books, Paul Kemp impressed me with his memorable characterizations and willingness to slow down the action to focus on the little details. Deceived took a generic Sith from The Old Republic MMO trailer, Darth Malgus, and gave him some real depth and emotions. In Crosscurrent and Riptide, Kemp added small character quirks for Jaden Korr and the crew of the Junker that made them stand out. I still remember the fact that Khedryn Faal had a lazy eye and Marr Idi-Shael had a chipped tooth.Kemp brings that same type of character development to Lords of the Sith, especially with the Twi'lek rebels. Cham Syndulla first appeared in The Clone Wars episode ""Liberty on Ryloth,"" but came across as simply a lofty idealist. Lords of the Sith shows his strategic acumen, as well as his internal doubts. He's not above using blackmail and sending people to their deaths. His colleague Isval has her own inner demons from the time she was kept as an Imperial slave. If anything, I was a bit surprised and disappointed that Kemp didn't take this character to darker places as it seemed like she was being set up for a ""Heart of Darkness"" style arc.Kemp's new Imperial characters also get some unique quirks. Moff Mors is the Imperial leader on Ryloth. The media made a big deal of the fact that she is officially the first lesbian character in Star Wars, but what's more interesting is that she starts the book depressed, having given up on her career. It's rare to see a Star Wars character who suffers from genuine depression and it made her character arc more meaningful. She cedes most of her authority to her assistant, Colonel Belkor. Belkor finds himself enmeshed in a conspiracy partly of his own making. The character is forced to make difficult choices and seeing him slowly slip into insanity was a treat.It was good to see Kemp give these characters their due because - through no fault of his own - the plot of this book contains little suspense or surprise. Anybody who has seen the Original Trilogy knows that Vader and the Emperor survive. Their fate is never in doubt. Moreover, the official publisher's summary spoils the plot of about 50-60% of the book (I took the liberty of removing the last paragraph of the summary so as to not spoil readers). If you've read the publisher's summary and seen the movies, you know what's going to happen here.All too often in Star Wars, the heroes are more lucky than skilled. This is particularly egregious in the Rebels TV series, where the main characters regularly barge onto Imperial ships or bases with no plan, relying on Imperial incompetence to save the day. In my review of Tarkin, I noted that the ragtag rebels in that book never seemed like worthy adversaries. Not so in Lords of the Sith. Cham's Twi'lek rebels come across as competent and careful. Cham has carefully cultivated resources and personnel. His team has to think carefully about where and when to use them. Nobody would ever accuse them of just being ""lucky."" I dare say it's probably the most realistic depiction of an insurgency we've ever gotten in Star Wars.The rebels use their resources to attack the Star Destroyer Perilous, which is carrying Emperor Palpatine, Darth Vader, and Senator Orn Free Taa. I appreciated that Kemp makes this into a Big Deal. Ever since Return of the Jedi, it's become something of a trope in Star Wars that starfighters can destroy Star Destroyers by taking out the two shield towers and then hitting the bridge. In The Clone Wars and Rebels TV shows, one gets the sense that capital ships are pretty expendable. By contrast, Cham and his rebels have to commit a lot of resources to an attack with multiple phases. Kemp also doesn't shy away from the death toll; both the Twi'leks and Imperials recognize that hundreds, likely thousands, of officers died. By the time the rebels actually destroy the ship, you feel like they've earned it.Despite its title, I was less interested in Vader and the Emperor in Lords of the Sith. The publisher's summary states that their relationship will be ""tested as never before,"" but I didn't find that to be the case. Both characters are so overpowered that they could easily destroy any obstacle that stood in their way. Obviously, I knew neither character would die, I never felt like they were seriously threatened or even stressed. Vader had a few nice character moments, particularly when he's haunted by his past, but it never seemed to me like anything they faced truly tested their relationship. Perhaps it's because in the old Expanded Universe/Legends we had so many stories in which the Emperor ""tests"" Vader and I've become inured to the concept.I've noticed that the newer Star Wars novels seem to struggle to deliver a fitting denouement. Unfortunately, this is the case with Lords of the Sith as well. The events in this book should have important consequences for both Ryloth and the galaxy at large. The Twi'leks hope that their actions will ignite a spark of rebellion throughout the galaxy. Does the Empire cover up the destruction of the Star Destroyer, as they fear, or does news of their victory spread? We simply never find out, which ironically means we don't know if the protagonists were successful in their ultimate mission. We also never get a closing scene for Moff Mors explaining her fate, which is a shame because her character underwent considerable growth and this is probably the last we'll see of her (although there are rumors that she will appear in the Rogue One spinoff film). We don't even find out what happened to Senator Orn Free Taa. Admittedly, he doesn't play a large role in this book, but he had been a prominent character in The Clone Wars.Kemp's Lords of the Sith is easily the best of the four canon novels out there. The characters are memorable and defy predictable stereotypes. The destruction of the Star Destroyer is probably the most epic moment in the new canon thus far. And I enjoyed seeing the way this band of rebels operated. I just wish there had been a bit more payoff at the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY5VJFJ8Y6PA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345511441#wasThisHelpful","RY5VJFJ8Y6PA1","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never thought I'd live to see a Metroid toy, much less one this nice. It's clearly based on the Baby Metroid from Super Metroid. The clear dome is made of a soft plastic that feels like jelly, yet retains its shape. The four mandibles both rotate and have a joint, which gives this guy a surprising amount of articulation. The paint job is simple but effective. I noticed that Jakks Pacific even used two tones on the teeth, which brings out some of the detail nicely.

"After seeing the Harry Potter movies, I was reluctant to read the books because I didn’t quite accept J.K. Rowling’s approach to world-building in the series. The setting of Harry Potter never seemed “real” in the way that J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth did, with a rich history and convincing plot progression. Harry Potter has all sorts of inconsistencies, plot holes, or in-jokes that broke my suspension of disbelief.After reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, I still think I understood Rowling’s world-building, but didn’t quite appreciate its effect on readers. Structurally, those things I’d previously viewed as “problems” actually do serve a purpose in the book. It’s a different type of world-building that seems deliberately crafted to introduce readers to this magical world.First, let me explain my original concerns about the world-building in Harry Potter. Quite frankly, the wizarding world never seemed to make any sense. Why, for example, would wizards set up platform 9 in a very busy train station and require students to walk through a brick wall to reach it if they want to avoid being seen by non-magical folk (“muggles”)? Would Hogwarts really give teachers the power to add or deduct points from students, especially when they are also members of the school houses? That’d be a clear conflict of interest. Why would wizards use Owls to send messages, which seem pretty inefficient compared to cell phones or email? Sometimes the names Rowling gives to her characters are a bit too cute, basically using Latin or Greek equivalents of their personalities. A wizard called “Vindictus” even wrote a book about revenge.Some of these issues might seem nit-picky. After all, these are small points and generally not central to the story. To some extent, it’s also a matter of preference. I admit that I tend to prefer stories that create a sense of verisimilitudeness. I usually find plot holes and contrivances very distracting. After all, if the characters don’t seem to behave like real people – to take the same precautions and have the same desires as real people – how can I become invested in them? Why would an author choose to take such a haphazard approach to world-building?The answer that Rowling provides in Sorcerer’s Stone is twofold, dealing with both the emotional effect of the book and the overall structure of the Harry Potter series.In his famous essay “On Fairy Stories,” Tolkien argued that fantasy literature enables readers to “recover” a sense of childlike wonder about the world. The world-building in Sorcerer’s Stone seems designed to do that far more than to create a believable world. By loosening the logic of Hogwarts, Rowling is able to sprinkle little surprises throughout the books. Yes, it’s highly unlikely that there would be a wizard called Vindictus, and that he would happen to write a book about revenge. Yet, those little jokes create the sense that in Harry Potter there’s something bizarre or funny – or, dare I say, “magical” – about mundane. These quirks train readers to expect to find surprising things anywhere and everywhere in this world, even in the title of a book or in a train station.The stylized world-building in Sorcerer’s Stone also helps readers understand the world from a child’s point of view. To kids, many things about the real world still do evoke a sense of wonder. Even something as common as a train station can seem a large and intimidating place. Likewise, to kids, teachers can often seem distant, arbitrary, and mean. How many times did we as kids feel that a teacher disciplined us unfairly just as Snape did to Harry? Of course, real teachers at a real Hogwarts would not behave like Snape in Sorcerer’s Stone, but the exaggerated characterizations probably better capture what it feels like to be a young child in a school.This recovery of how it feels to be a child is actually a crucial part of Sorcerer’s Stone. I’ve sometimes heard fans of the series claim that Rowling “improved” as a writer over the course of the Harry Potter series. I think that undersells her earlier books. The series as a whole seems designed to mimic the process of maturation. The first book starts off with a relatively carefree adventure that focuses on the wonder and magic of life. Events and people are seen through a very childlike perspective, and mostly in black-and-white. Just as children don’t understand all the rules of the world, the world-building is left somewhat vague and at times seemingly illogical.As the series progresses, Harry Potter matures, and so does the reading experience. As Harry begins to understand the shades of grey in the world, so too do the later books reveal layers of complexity to the reader. We’re even invited to take a more nuanced view of Snape, Harry’s father, and other characters whom Harry – and we as readers – had already categorized as “good” or “evil.” The later books also focus more on tightening up the logic of the world-building. We learn that there are specific rules that prohibit the use of electricity and modern technology in Hogwarts. As adolescents, Harry and the reader become aware of government, in the form of the Ministry of Magic, which regulates uses of magic and undoes any damage caused by improper use of magic near muggles.I definitely enjoyed this book much more than I’d thought. Given the choice, I still prefer more intricate, realistic world-building of The Lord of the Rings and Dune. The Harry Potter books will probably never be favorites of mine, but I can certainly appreciate how Rowling’s style works for the story she’s telling. Sorcerer’s Stone is not so much a book telling the story of a kid in a magical world so much as evoking the feeling of being a kid in a magical world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T938WV13FHPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00728DYRO#wasThisHelpful","R2T938WV13FHPE","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mixing two 1980s pop culture icons like the Ninja Turtles and Ghostbusters is potentially a recipe for disaster. Fortunately, it works surprisingly well here.It’s clear that writer Erik Burnham “gets” both franchises. The Ghostbusters have their snarky, world-weary humor about insurance rates and salaries, while the Turtles have their quirky, fun-loving humor.What’s even more impressive is that Burnham manages to balance both franchises well over these 4 issues. Neither the Ninja Turtles nor the Ghostbusters gets shortchanged here. This feels like both their stories. Even more impressively, the pairing isn’t done superficially. Given that each group has 4 members, there would be a natural temptation to simply “pair them off.” Instead, the relationships between the two groups is much more natural and dynamic. Obviously, Egon and Donatello have a lot in common, but it’s not like those two characters only talk with each other.The story itself is somewhat less interesting. Basically, a big bad ghost has been released and the Turtles and Ghostbusters have to stop him. It’s not particularly original and the villain is of the moustache-twirling variety. As an excuse to get the Ghostbusters and Turtles working together, it works. The team needs the skills of both the Turtles and the Ghostbusters to defeat the ghost, so it really does feel like a team effort. But the comic is ultimately more about the relationships between the Turtles and Ghostbusters than the story.The artwork is very effective. The art for humans in the Ghostbusters comics is more stylized than it is for the Turtles comics, but the two art styles blend together seamlessly here.Overall, this is a nice treat for fans of both the Ninja Turtles nor the Ghostbusters franchises.[I received a free advance copy of this book in exchange for an honest review]","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTCD7U0TANEL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631402536#wasThisHelpful","RTCD7U0TANEL0","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd heard about The Last Starfighter for years, but always from people who claimed it merely copied Star Wars. During the 1980s, many studios tried to imitate the Star Wars phenomenon. Paramount pulled Star Trek out of mothballs so it could have its own sci-fi franchise. Universal's Battlestar Galactica was embroiled in lawsuits with 20th Century Fox over copyright infringement (not surprising given that Universal hired key members of the Star Wars production team). Dozens of other copycat space adventure films from that era have faded into obscurity.Indeed, the plot of The Last Starfighter does seem eerily similar to A New Hope:- Teenager with remarkable piloting skills can't go to college because of poverty and household chores;- Wizened mentor finds him and tries to recruit him to fight against an evil empire;- Teen initially refuses, but reconsiders when the empire threatens his family;- Mentor figure dies as teenage pilot flees with companions;- Teen pilot takes down evil empire's main ship with just his starfighter;- Movie ends with victory celebration.In addition, the production design is similar to the original Star Wars. The ships of the Rylan Star League have white interiors like the Rebel Alliance's capital ships. The Ko-Dan Armada has dark grey interiors like the Empire's Death Star. Rogan's starfighter has red lasers, like the X-Wings, and the Ko-Dan ships have green lasers, like the Tie Fighters.Despite the similarities, the film feels different from Star Wars. Or, at least it feels like it has a heart and soul of its own. I think it's partly the context. The Last Starfighter doesn't take place ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"" but rather in a 1980s trailer park. Indeed, The Last Starfighter has a lot for fans of 1980s nostalgia. The film really captures what it was like to be a young sci-fi/video game fan during the 80s. Alex Rogen comes to the attention of the Rylan Star League because of his high score in an arcade game (I'm sure many of us wish our high scores had greater consequences). In A New Hope, Luke wanted an adventure; in The Last Starfighter, Rogan - like many kids - wanted to be Luke.The Last Starfighter is fun, but it lacks a rich ensemble of characters. The story is all about Rogan and his ability to shoot down enemy ships. The movie takes too long in showing Rogan's attempts to pilot the ship and fire the lasers (Star Wars smartly skipped over Luke's training). Rogan then proceeds to take down the entire Ko-Dan armada singlehandedly (the enemies make the Stormtroopers seem like crack shots). There's no sense that the victory was a team effort, or even that other pilots died on the mission with him (as during the Death Star trench run). The other characters seem to exist only to give Rogan moral and technical support rather than as a character in his own right.In 1984, The Last Starfighter was the first movie to use computer-generated effects to to depict realistic spaceships (TRON came out two years earlier, but it only used CGI to depict an abstract video game environment). The effects hold up surprisingly well, at least on my 17-inch computer screen. The film is pretty frugal with its effects and the camera doesn't linger too long on effects shots. The ships are definitely too shiny and clean, but they do look like spaceships.I recommend The Last Starfighter if you like space opera and want a 1980s nostalgia trip. The fact that it resembles A New Hope in so many ways yet feels different speaks to the diversity of stories that can be told within a single story archetype. The movie feels like an homage to the effect Star Wars had on a generation of kids, including yours truly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V9VC9DFHN04T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003PIS5XI#wasThisHelpful","R2V9VC9DFHN04T","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don’t usually read self-help books, but the title of “Should and Must” spoke to a personal dilemma I was having at the time it came out. To some extent, the book helped me clarify my thinking. It gave me encouragement for some of my decisions and forced me to reconsider others. To some extent, that’s probably the most important thing I can say in this review. Still, I had some other thoughts about the book after thinking about it for a while.For those who hadn’t read Elle’s essay, “The Crossroads of Should and Must” is about helping people overcome societal obligations and other barriers in order to achieve their passion. I don’t think the book breaks any new psychological ground, but what’s distinctive about it is the style. This isn’t a book filled with prose. Instead, it’s actually a piece of art. Every page has unique drawings, colorful script, markings, etc. It really drives home the optimistic message and definitely makes it more memorable.That said, the very design of the book tells you much about its intended audience – artists. Elle seems to be talking primarily to struggling artists. The examples she mentions are Picasso, Philip Glass, John Grisham, etc. Many of her ideas for finding your “must” involve paints, paper, etc. Computers are bad. If your “must” is to become a doctor, a president, etc., you’ll probably find that this book doesn’t speak to you as much. For me, I was looking at a writing career, so I probably fell within the target audience, but barely.I was also a bit surprised that, aside from the author’s own story, all of the examples in the book were of famous people. I know for me that one of the most intimidating aspects of “getting to must” is the recognition that I’ll probably never measure up the greats in my calling. Why try if you can only pale in comparison? I know as an aspiring artist I wouldn’t want Picasso as a standard. Instead, I’d like to learn more about how ordinary people found their “must.” What does it mean to have found your calling but to not become a celebrity in your field? That’s much more relatable and in many ways manageable.Quibbles aside, this book did help me. I’m going to take some of its advice to heart and hopefully start finding my calling. I don’t know if it’ll work, but I can recommend this as a short, easy read that might change your life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q8U2LWVWMUSC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0761184880#wasThisHelpful","R2Q8U2LWVWMUSC","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever wonder why Gandalf chose Bilbo to join Thorin's quest in The Hobbit? Or what Aragorn was talking about when he mentioned the ""Kings of Númenor""?The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings frequently mention events or characters from earlier periods of Middle-earth history. It turns out that those references actually referred to stories J.R.R. Tolkien had written but not published. In 1977, his son Christopher Tolkien published The Silmarillion, a collection of tales set during the First and Second Ages. However, Tolkien wrote many versions of these stories, some longer and more detailed than what appeared in The Silmarillion. To appreciate the full scope of Tolkien's subcreation, we need to look at his rough drafts as collected in Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth.To call the Unfinished Tales a collection of rough drafts is misleading. Tolkien's rough drafts are more polished and engaging than the final works of most fantasy authors. Nevertheless, the stories in this volume were never completed, much less publishable. Christopher Tolkien provides helpful commentary situating these stories within Tolkien's legendarium. The stories provide some fascinating background material, but it's important for readers to realize that not all of these stories fit comfortably within the Middle-earth canon. Some details contradict Tolkien's published works. As such, the best way to appreciate the Unfinished Tales is to view it as an exploration of Tolkien's storytelling.The section on the First Age contains the stories of Tuor and Túrin. Tuor is a human tasked with delivering a message to the Elven King Turgon of Gondolin. The story in Unfinished Tales primarily covers Tuor's journey to Gondolin. Tolkien is a master at describing geography and conveying the arduous nature of travel in a premodern setting. He never completed this more detailed version, which is a shame because the fall of Gondolin is one of the most epic battles in Tolkien's works. Morgoth, the dark lord of the First Age, had multiple dragons and Balrogs in his army!The ""The Children of Húrin"" story is one of my favorites not just in this book, but in all of Tolkien's works. Morgoth curses Húrin's family, including his son Túrin. Túrin finds himself in a Shakespearean struggle against fate. Yet, in Tolkien's world, men have free will, so the story sets up a subtle tension between Túrin's doom and Túrin's choices. In addition, the story has dragons, incest, brigands, and even talking swords. Although the Unfinished Tales version of the story is not complete, it provides much more detail than the Silmarillion version. Fortunately, Christopher Tolkien adapted this version into a complete novel in 2007, so I would recommend readers read The Children of Húrin to get the best experience.The Second Age focuses on the Kingdom of Númenor. The Silmarillion contains more information about the fall of Númenor, a story that echoes the myth of Atlantis. Unfinished Tales focuses on the earlier kings. ""Aldarion and Erendis"" is an fascinating romance, especially compared to Tolkien's more famous Beren and Lúthien story. Aldarion, heir to the Númenórean throne, falls in love with Erendis. However, Aldarion also loves the sea and sailing. Naturally, this creates tension in their marriage. This is the only love story I can recall that does not follow the pattern of Beren and Lúthien, and indeed almost comes across as the polar opposite of their relationship. Aldarion serves as yet another example that not all of Tolkien's heros are idealized archetypes.There have never been - and likely will never be - any authorized film adaptations of these stories. However, artists have been depicting these stories for decades. In particular, I recommend Ted Nasmith's portfolio, which was featured in the companion book Tolkien's World and influenced my images of the characters and landscapes.The Slaying of Glaurung, by Ted NasmithThe Third Age will probably be of most interest to fans of The Lord of the Rings. It explains the fate of Isildur, last king of Gondor, and origins of Kingdom of Rohan. Perhaps the most fascinating part is ""The Quest of Erebor,"" essentially an attempt to retcon The Hobbit with LOTR. As written, the former book is simply a light-hearted adventure story, whereas the latter is a serious epic. The two stories don't always fit seamlessly. Why, for example, did Gandalf waste his time with Thorin's quest for gold when he was also concerned with Sauron's return to power? In ""The Quest of Erebor,"" Gandalf explains that he wanted to prevent Smaug from allying with Sauron and attacking Rivendell. Thus, he used the Dwarves to strike a covert blow against the enemy.Like many fans of The Hobbit, I have mixed feelings about ""The Quest of Erebor."" It has a tendency to minimize the joy and serendipity in Bilbo's journey as told in the original novel. I'm not quite convinced that Gandalf was really that foresighted, especially as in The Hobbit he doesn't appear to connect Thorin's quest with the larger struggle against Sauron. However, Peter Jackson apparently saw this story as a missing link between the two stories and used it to bridge his Hobbit and LOTR trilogies. The Hobbit films are heavily influenced by Gandalf's account and reflect the tone of this version more than anything found in the book. Indeed, one of the tracks on the Desolation of Smaug soundtrack is titled ""The Quest for Erebor.""The final section of Unfinished Tales contains a mix of background material on the wizards and palantír, among other things. The section on wizards is particularly interesting. Not only do we learn more about Radagast, we also learn more about Saruman's fall. Again, parts of it contradict Tolkien's published works, as well as his later letters (for example, Tolkien later concluded that perhaps Radagast hadn't quite failed in his mission).Unfinished Tales isn't for casual Tolkien fans. Nevertheless, it provides fascinating insight into the Middle-earth subcreation and shows why Tolkien was such a master at fantasy literature.Next week, I cover The Book of Lost Tales, Part I, which includes more of Tolkien's early writing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N5XO4WXIV47X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00796E7CA#wasThisHelpful","R1N5XO4WXIV47X","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ursula K. Le Guin has said several times that she’s done with Earthsea, but she keeps returning to the archipelago. In Daughter of Odren, Weed, the titular daughter of Odren, wants to rescue her father from the spell of a corrupt wizard and her mother. In the hands of any other author, the plot itself would have been a simple revenge tale. Le Guin takes this simple concept in a darker and far more interesting direction.The Daughter of Odren is more about the telling than about the tale. Le Guin buries the story under multiple layers, as characters tell other characters what they know about Odren’s fate. At times, the accounts conflict subtly. It’s an interesting narrative technique as it gives the sense that the events we see had already become local legend. It’s also an effective way to convey the large amount of background material necessary to understand the plot.The Daughter of Odren is set in the world of Earthsea, but does not feature any of the major characters from Le Guin's other Earthsea novels. However, the story does assume some familiarity with the Earthsea system of magic, so it does not stand entirely on its own. I suggest reading at least A Wizard of Earthsea before attempting this novel.Daughter of Odren a worthy trip back to Earthsea. It doesn’t have a major impact on the Earthsea mythos, and it’s a short story (about 31 pages), but nevertheless enjoyable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI46EBCE5CHI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O70WOD0#wasThisHelpful","RI46EBCE5CHI0","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I write this, there are several trending news items on Facebook about nude celebrities. That seems fitting given the sorts of questions Ursula K. Le Guin asks in The Left Hand of Darkness. What would human society look like without gender? How would love and politics differ if we were neither male or female? Gender is such a critical part of our identity that this thought exercise turns out to be incredibly difficult. Almost all human stories have some element of romance, or at least sexual tension.In The Left Hand of Darkness, Le Guin introduces us to a society world known as Gethen. (""Winter"" in English) on which descendants of humans possess elements of both genders. The beings are asexual but during a mating season - known as kemmer - one gender dominates the other to allow for reproduction.The book starts when an envoy from an interplanetary consortium, the Ekumen, finds himself in trouble with political authorities in the kingdom of Karhide on Gethen. The envoy, Genly Ai, is definitely a male and the only male on the planet. Meanwhile, the prime minister of Karhide, Estraven, is exiled for his relationship to Genly Ai and his efforts to convince Karhide to join the Ekumen.Over the past two weeks, I reviewed two of Arthur C. Clarke's books, Childhood's End and Rendezvous with Rama. As an author, Le Guin is in many ways the polar opposite of Clarke. Where Clarke focuses on hard science fiction themes, such as aliens and technology, Le Guin uses science fiction as a setting for human analysis of the human condition.The Left Hand of Darkness excels in its depiction of characters. The book focuses on the convoluted relationship between Genly and Estraven. To describe it as a love-hate relationship would be too simple. The relationship transverses a range of human emotions, mostly platonic but at times even slightly sexual. Odd as it might be to say, there is a beauty to their suffering and the raw emotional intensity of the story.The book remains relevant over 45 years after it was first published because it touches upon such important questions about humanity. I don't believe Le Guin intended the book to be a direct metaphor for homosexuality, much less a call for homosexual, but given the political debates about gay marriage modern readers will probably make that connection. And they would be right to do so. Le Guin's complicated depiction of asexual romance might just help some readers to appreciate that love can transcend genders.Unfortunately, the book falters where Clarke so often succeeds. Le Guin does not provide much in the way of context for The Left Hand of Darkness. Although we learn a lot about the planet Gethen, its people, and culture, we learn almost nothing about the Ekumen or Genly's own culture. Technically, The Left Hand of Darkness is the fourth book in Le Guin's ""Hainish"" series, but in her introduction to the novel, Le Guin claims that The Left Hand of Darkness can be read alone. Perhaps not.Another - admittedly smaller - problem is that the point of view changes several times without warning. The book is told from a first-person perspective, but from both Genly Ai and Estraven's points of view. I only discovered this when in one of the earlier chapters the narrator refers to Genly as ""he."" I get the sense that some other readers have found this confusing. Once you realize the problem, it's not too difficult figure out who is narrating in each section, but Le Guin could have avoided much confusion by simply adding a note in the chapter headings.The Left Hand of Darkness definitely earns its place as a science-fiction classic. It definitely made me consider - or reconsider - my conceptions of gender and humanity. The book could have benefitted from some more context, as well as a longer denouement. But I always take it as a good sign when I want to learn more about an author's story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D17EN326PWV3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0441007317#wasThisHelpful","R1D17EN326PWV3","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rendezvous with Rama is widely acclaimed as Arthur C. Clarke's best book, and it definitely deserves much of the praise it's gotten. That said, the book isn't perfect, particularly when it comes to the characters.Rendezvous with Rama starts when an large, cylindrical object is detected hurtling towards the sun. The object is named ""Rama"" after the Hindu god. The United Planets sends the solar survey vessel Endeavour under the command of Commander Bill Norton to investigate. The rest of the book focuses on the crew's exploration of the alien artifact.Rama is excellent at evoking a sense of wonder. Clarke manages to convey the artifact's grandeur and to create a uniquely bizarre alien world. The structures and other things encountered do not resemble the familiar sci-fi tropes. I especially liked how Clarke takes advantage of Rama's artificial gravity (generated by the object's spin) to present the astronauts with a new challenge. Even more than the alien structures, I'll always remember the description of Commander Norton climbing ""down"" the ladder towards Rama's ""ground.""That said, Clarke demonstrates an admirable amount of discipline in not revealing everything about Rama. Some mysteries remain unanswered, and are thus all the more intriguing. I can only imagine that, when the book was first published in 1973, the effect was even greater and there were fewer books about alien worlds. I haven't read the sequels, but fear they would undermine the majesty of this book.Clarke has always focused more on alien life and technology than on characters in his stories. That said, the characters in Rama are surprisingly serviceable, if not great. Commander Norton gets enough backstory to make him relatable. Norton's interest in and admiration for James Cook, captain of an earlier Endeavour, gave him some depth. For those who know their history, it also infused the story with some foreshadowing over Norton's fate.Most of the crew members at least get a few personality quirks that help distinguish them, although few are actually memorable. The lack of characterization generally works - until it doesn't. At a few points, the book places some of these characters in danger and the reader is expected to care, but I found it hard to do so. For example, two-thirds into the book, a character whom we'd never seen before, Jimmy, suddenly appears, and then the next 15% of the book focuses on him and his trials. At the least the character would have benefitted from some sort of introduction.I've criticized Clarke's problems ending some of his stories in a satisfactory manner, especially his tendency to rely upon incongruous twists or cheats to resolve plot threads (see, for example, my review of Clarke's Childhood's End). Fortunately, Rama avoids this problem. The story ends in a manner that suits the mystery and grandeur of Rama. There is a twist at the end, but it manages to be both subtle and thought-provoking at the same time. I could see how readers demanded a sequel, but the book was designed to - and mostly manages to - stand on its own. Rendezvous for Rama isn't for anybody. This book is about exploration writ large, about drive to explore rather than the discoveries. If you want a fully realized alien civilization, this isn't the book for you. However, if you want a somewhat realistic account of how man's first contact with alien technology might occur, Rama is still a classic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MY14COI3ZG4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHIP8ZM#wasThisHelpful","R3MY14COI3ZG4B","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is frustrating. The story has several great twists, even brilliant, but it's sloppily executed and the ending veers into paranormal mysticism rather than science fiction. Too often, the story drops the really interesting ideas it raises in favor of some of the sillier concepts. I can't really discuss the problems with this book without SPOILERS, so be warned that there are spoilers throughout!The story begins rather quickly as a mysterious alien race comes to Earth and... helps mankind create a utopia! Even today, most stories about aliens are either about alien invasions or first contact. But ""Childhood's End"" presents a race of benevolent aliens actually helping mankind. Initially, the struggle becomes getting mankind to accept and trust their new ""overlords."" A group of humans resists the aliens and promises mass resistance. Great twist, right?Unfortunately, Clarke drops the part about human resistance to the aliens less than a quarter of the way through the book. Some of the great characters in the human resistance movement are suddenly abandoned as Clarke jumps 50 years into the future and abandons that plot thread. At this point in the story, all humans have magically accepted the aliens and everything is unrealistically utopian.Clarke tends to ""tell"" rather than ""show"" these developments. Clarke gives the reader large chunks of narrative text describing the utopia, but the actual characters and their own stories seem to have little to do with that utopia. I almost got the sense that Clark was writing a short essay about his vision of utopia rather than telling a story.The book still had potential because the aliens promised to reveal themselves after 50 years. This promised new opportunities for conflict and tension. The reveal itself is well handled as we learn - SPOILER - the overlords resemble devils. Imagine aliens coming to Earth and finding out that they all look like Satan!Again, great twist, but another lost opportunity. Apparently, humans had evolved sufficiently by this point to not care that the aliens looked like devils. So the whole mystery of what these aliens look like, a huge part of the first third of the book, really does nothing for the story. The characters only seem mildly perturbed. Why the buildup if no payoff?Finally, the ending of the book was horrible. It turns out that the reason the overlords came to Earth and helped mankind was... because humans have some sort of weird paranormal telepathic power that needed to be cultivated. A new generation of humans become godlike creatures. These new creatures have no personality and just seem to do randomly destructive things. We only get a brief glimpse of how regular humans react, but Clarke again tends to tell rather than show these developments.At this point, I had to wonder why Clarke brought the story to this resolution. What sort of scientific or human themes did this ending explore? Science fiction aficionados often praise Clarke for writing ""hard sci-fi,"" but this ending seemed more like magic than science. At least with something like the Force in ""Star Wars"" the mystical aspects help illuminate facets of the human condition and religion.I understand this is one of Clarke's earlier works and so I'm inclined to forgive him and not swear off any of his other books. Still, it seems like a missed opportunity. I'd love to see another author pick up on some of these ideas and do them justice.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2574I6PRLCKBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHGSVKS#wasThisHelpful","R2574I6PRLCKBG","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a lot of friends who absolutely adored this book. I finally tried it and, well, I like it a lot, even if I'm not about to adopt a pet rabbit.As the product summary states, this is a story about a group of rabbits trying to reach the safety Watership Down and fighting off the enemy Efrafan rabbit clans. Richard Adams does an amazing job bringing this admittedly odd concept to life. For the most parts, the rabbits do feel and act like real rabbits. I could almost believe that the rabbits in my backyard could be undergoing their own such dramas.The characterizations in the book were all excellent. I loved how the characters had such deep and complex emotions, yet emotions believable in the animal world. The villains were driven by insecurity in a world filled with predators and other threats. This theme is played out in the rabbit religion, which promises that although rabbits are weak they will have a fair shot at survival. The protagonist rabbits develop over the course of the book, but the development is subtle as they find the best way to utilize their unique skills to overcome insecurity.Adams' use of parallelism is the best I've seen since Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings."" Adams creates several rabbit societies and establishes clear points of comparison. The book doesn't just present the rabbit clans as good or evil. Rather, each clan has developed unique responses to the problem of insecurity. The Watership Down, the primary protagonists, clan cultivates individualism and encourages each individual rabbit to contribute his or her own skills to the greater good. In the Warren of Snares, another smaller rabbit clan, the rabbits passively accept the risk of being trapped by snares. The Efrafans, the primary antagonists, created a militaristic society to fight off predators.At times, the rabbits did seem a bit too intelligent, which took me out of the story. For example, the rabbits seem familiar with the concept of machines and tool use, particularly cars, which seems a bit too far. After all, if they were aware of the possibility of tools, why not try to build their own? Lacking opposable thumbs doesn't seem sufficient as an explanation. It's a small nitpick, but it broke the otherwise excellent illusion that these were real and realistic rabbits.Definitely recommended for fans of good literature - and rabbits.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q0WTN47WUW8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743277708#wasThisHelpful","R1Q0WTN47WUW8Z","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a big fan of James Luceno’s “Darth Plagueis,” I was excited to hear that Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin would be getting the Luceno treatment. Unfortunately, “Tarkin” isn’t quite the equal of “Darth Plagueis” in that it doesn’t provide a sweeping backstory for Tarkin. It’s more a story in which Tarkin is the central protagonist. However, we do get some great background information about Tarkin, especially about his upbringing on Eriadu. And there are some wonderful treats for fans of the old EU.*** MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD***The novel takes place about 5 years after “Revenge of the Sith.” Wilhuff Tarkin is in command of a base overseeing the construction of the Death Star. The Empire is busy hunting down former Separatists and others who oppose Palpatine’s New Order. The story starts with an unexpected attack on Tarkin’s base by a group of dissidents using advanced Holonet technology. The Emperor sends Tarkin and Darth Vader on a mission to track them down, but they in turn fall into a trap. The dissidents end up stealing Tarkin’s ship and attacking Imperial targets.This is a novel in which the context is more interesting than the text. The actual story isn’t particularly interesting or epic. Vader and Tarkin track down a bunch of dissidents who steal Tarkin’s corvette and go on a joyride. It almost seems like a task below these two iconic villains, if not for Tarkin’s personal connection to the ship and the dissidents. Nor does Tarkin rise to the occasion to display any particularly formidable investigative or tactical skills during his mission. I had been hoping to see Tarkin emerge as a larger than life character akin to Grand Admiral Thrawn in Timothy Zahn’s novels. Instead, he seems mostly along for the ride.A big part of the problem is that Tarkin’s adversaries don’t provide much of a foil. The dissidents aren’t particularly interesting characters. Even though the book spends quite a bit of time with them, I felt like I never really got to know them and had trouble telling them apart. Their motives were pretty basic. I think Star Wars characters work best when they’re based on bold archetypes (i.e., “the smuggler,” “the princess,” etc.), but the dissidents were mostly low-key individuals who had similar motives. A great hero needs a great villain – or, in this case, a great villain needs a great hero – but Tarkin just didn’t have a worthy adversary in this novel.That said, there is still much to enjoy in this book. Luceno takes the opportunity to delve into Tarkin’s upbringing on the planet Eriadu. Luceno portrays the Tarkin family as akin to early Australians or Afrikaners, whites who colonize a new land and develop a healthy respect for it, but also take great pride in taming nature. Eriadu itself has a sort of outback feel. Many of the scenes on Eriadu show Tarkin struggling against nature, but not outright destroying it. Instead, he learns how to tame nature through fear and manipulation. Thematically, it’s a nice echo of the “man versus nature” themes in “A New Hope.” I probably would have enjoyed the novel even more had it spent more time in this period of Tarkin’s life.“Tarkin” also answers a few questions fans have long had about the character. For example, we finally learn if and to what extent Tarkin knows Darth Vader’s true identity. We also learn – much to my shock – Palpatine’s first name. For fans of politics, we get to see the Imperial Ruling Council in action during this era for the first time. However, as with much of the Prequel-era of Star Wars, sometimes the fan service goes too far. We see familiar characters like Admiral Motti, Colonel Yularen, etc., but they hold the same exact rank that they do in “A New Hope.” It is simply not plausible that they would hold the same rank for over 15 years, especially for Motti, whose character in “A New Hope” was relatively young (the actor was only 30 at the time of filming).For Star Wars fans disappointed by Disney’s relaunch of the EU, Luceno goes out of his way to bring some of the stories from his previous novels into continuity. I won’t give any spoilers, but let’s just say that we see a few old EU characters reemerge in this novel. They’re not the focus of the story, but it’s a nice signal to fans that some of those stories and characters live on in the new continuity.As I said above, “Tarkin” is not nearly the equal of “Darth Plagueis.” There story isn’t particularly epic. That said, I did enjoy it, both as an adventure tale and for what we learn about Tarkin himself. I would definitely recommend the novel to Star Wars fans, but temper your expectations.Overall: 3 stars.[I received an advance version of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.]","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9SV4AXQZTF8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAFX85Y#wasThisHelpful","R9SV4AXQZTF8U","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'd actually been looking for a new dicer. This one does work a bit better than my older one, and is more compact and convenient, and has different speeds. But it's still not a fine dicer.

"I've been a big fan of Foreman grills for years. This is definitely an improvement over the last one I had. One of the bigger challenges I've had is getting the right size. I used to have a 4-serving grill but it was just too large and heavy to store and take out frequently. My 2-serving grill was a bit too small if cooking for more than two people. This one though is a good balance. It's not too heavy nor too large. It has a good amount of surface area. I also love the removable racks. Finally, the black color allows it to fit in with most kitchen decors (unlike my older red grill, which really stuck out).

"Upon finishing “Utrom Empire,” my first thought was: “Wow, I just read a comic book about a bunch of mutant brains.” My second thought was: “Wow, those brains had a more compelling character arc than many human characters in adult novels.”Yes, “Utrom Empire” is primarily about how Krang rises through the ranks and ultimately ends up on Earth. The story intercuts to the current IDW series (taking place around issue #29). We see Professor Honeycutt plot his escape from Burnow Island. The relationship between him, Baxter Stockman, and Krang becomes infinitely more complicated. It’s a great side story.But again I was struck at how well IDW has managed to develop Krang’s character. Watching the original cartoons in 1987, I’d never imagined that Krang would be anything more than a one-dimensional, brain tentacle-twirling villain. As it has with other characters, IDW decided to give him some more depth. In “Utrom Empire,” we see a Krang who also has realistic motivations, to save his people. He also finds himself at odds with his father, the ruler of the Utrom Empire. Talk about daddy issues! Through it all, one never gets the sense thatFor fans of IDW’s ongoing Ninja Turtles, “Utrom Empire” adds wonderful depth. However, I’d go so far as to say that this volume should appeal more generally to comic readers who appreciate a character story about villains. Highly recommended.[I received an advance version of this comic from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.]","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCTK53LU5RJ9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=163140024X#wasThisHelpful","RCTK53LU5RJ9K","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This story starts off slow. It actually took me a while to figure out where Tim Siedell was going. But once the comic really reaches the heart of the story, it's definitely a tale worth reading.Despite its title, “Darth Vader and the Cry of Shadows” is actually told from the point of view of a Clone Trooper, Hock. The first issue or so seem to just recapitulate Hock’s background. It’s obvious some of these plot elements and characters will come back later in the comic, but it’s not yet clear why they’re so important. In short, this first third or so just seems like a major digression from a yet-to-be-revealed story.Then we get to the Battle of Ostor. This is where the real character development happens, for both Hock and Vader. And it happens beautifully. I won’t reveal much more for fear of revealing spoilers, but Hock really becomes a fully realized character. I loved the types of challenges he’s forced to confront. There are some great battle scenes, but I really enjoyed seeing him wrestle with tough moral decisions.Siedell also handles Vader beautifully. Darth Vader in this comic has a real presence. One of my problems with depictions of Vader in recent comics is that he just becomes an all-powerful, mindless killing machine able to take down Jedi (such as in the Purge comics). Not so here. Vader is menacing, but the comic does a great job building up that menace through dialogue, artwork, and mise en scene rather than by simply having Vader kill a bunch of people. More importantly, Siedell does a great job building up Vader through the reactions of his subordinates. I found this Vader far more terrifying than anything we saw in the films!Siedell and the artists also create some innovative scenes for the comic. In one scene, after Hock crashes, the page is simply white with snippets of dialogue indicating that he’d gone unconscious. There are some other wonderful fullpage spreads. I read a digital version a single page at a time, so when those pages came up they really had a large impact.Overall, despite the slow start, this is definitely one of the better Star Wars comics I’ve read in a long time. Definitely recommended.[I received an advance version of this comic from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.]","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU6WX3OWF4449/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JENORIK#wasThisHelpful","RU6WX3OWF4449","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit, when I was younger I was a Nintendo fanboy. I remember hearing about Sega from my friends but not really getting the appeal. Some 20 years later, Blake Harris helps put a new spin on this chapter of my life as he shows what happened behind the scenes of the console wars that dominate my youth.What makes Harris' account unique is that it's not just a dry third-person narrative, but rather reconstructs dialogue between key players in the industry. At times, it almost feels like a novel. And this is one exciting story filled with confidence men, devious schemes, and sudden but inevitable betrayals. In addition to being entertained, I learned a lot about the marketing world.Ultimately, I think Harris nails the core of the Sega vs. Nintendo debate. Sega, led by marketing guru Tom Kalinske, focused on market and giving the Genesis a ""cool"" appeal, whereas Nintendo focused on quality and reaffirming its core market. I had intuitively understood this even as a kid.My one issue with the book is that it seems almost too centered on Tom Kalinske. It's almost as if he were the main protagonist of the ""novel."" I could tell that Kalinske was a or even the primary source of information for Harris. As president of Sega of America, Kalinske was certainly at the center of major developments. But I would have appreciated more insights into other players in the story. Also, Kalinske comes across sometimes as a bit too much of a ""mary sue"" (not Kalinske's fault for sure, just a consequence of Harris' way of telling the story). In fact, the most fascinating parts of the book were those focused on Nintendo.Overall, easily one of the best and most important books about this era of video gaming.

"Like many other Deep Space Nine fans, I loved Andrew J. Robinson's portrayal of Garak. Robinson knows his character and it comes out in this book. ""A Stitch in Time"" is written like a set of letters from Garak to Dr. Bashir. We get to see Garak's rise through the Obsidian Order and fall from grace. Robinson also plays with Garak's psyche and is much willing to dig deep into a character than other Trek authors.The one issue I have with the book is that the ending is a bit open-ended. I won't spoil it here, but it seems like Garak is posed to assume a new role in Cardassian society, and it seems like there should have been additional chapters to explain that role, but the ending seems almost abrupt. In some ways, I thought the more open-ended ending on the TV show worked better because it represented the end of one part of Garak's life. This book goes a bit beyond the beginning of the next phase of his life, but we don't learn enough to know where everybody's favorite tailor is headed.Overall, a must-read for fans of DS9.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C2GF3BAAN1G4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FC0UXU#wasThisHelpful","R1C2GF3BAAN1G4","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finally had a chance to see this last week. This movie is a celebration of LEGO, but more importantly it's a celebration of fun. The comedy is extremely witty and even quirky. This isn't low-brow humor. As an adult, I probably appreciated the humor more than the kids with me because I got all the references.However, what makes this film a keeper is that it's actually a good story. It's not just a string of gags. The story has a lot of heart, about the ability of ordinary individuals to become something special. It reminds me of the best of the 80s movies with that theme. The ending... well, I won't spoil it, but it blew my mind. It was an awesome twist.I haven't laughed so much at a movie in ages. I haven't cried so much at a movie in ages.

"Sorry, but somebody has to say it. It's absolutely outrageous that Paramount is double-dipping like this by holding back the Star Trek Into Darkness special features for this release. Many of us who bought the STID blu-ray last fall complained that the special features had been split up between different retailers (Best Buy, Target, Amazon, etc got different exclusives) and NO deleted scenes. As a reward for our loyalty in purchasing the blu-ray early we now get the opportunity to purchase the complete version almost a year later.To be clear, I do not mind studios releasing deluxe versions of a movie. It's great for fans of movies to have deluxe options. But I don't like the studio telling us that certain features are exclusive and then going back on that promise. Nor do I appreciate the studio not telling us that a version with the deleted scenes would be coming. For comparison, Peter Jackson has been very up front in telling fans that extended versions of the Lord of the Rings/Hobbit movies would be released and WHEN they would be released.I think it's important that movie consumers take a stand and tell Paramount that consumers will not stand for such practices. The best way to do that is to refuse to buy this set. If studios want us to buy blu-rays and not just stream movies, then treat us as premium customers rather than gullible suckers.UPDATE: There is a bit of good news. Apparently Paramount will offer a rebate for customers who had previously bought an earlier blu-ray version of STID. This is some consolation and makes the double-dip less problematic. Nevertheless, I think it is still important for consumers to send the right message.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25HSWVAUP981G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCAD24S#wasThisHelpful","R25HSWVAUP981G","AQZH7YTWQPOBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQZH7YTWQPOBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This iPhone case snaps on pretty easily and looks pretty good on the phone. The light blue aesthetic is neither too masculine nor too feminine. It doesn't look as glossy as it appears in the photo. However, I personally prefer a soft, rubbery cover for my iPhone because I'm prone to drop it quite often. The rubber absorbs the impact a bit better (and the phone even bounces, which is always fun to watch). Unfortunately, with this type of hard case, the case is more likely to crack or get chipped. The front also isn't as protected. The edges of the case don't extend far beyond the front of the phone, so if you drop the phone face-down there's not much protecting it.

"As with Book 1, Book 2 of ""The Left Hand of Destiny"" is more like a Klingon space fantasy than your typical Star Trek book. Much of what I wrote in my review of Book 1 applies to Book 2. J.G. Hertzler and Jeffrey Lang do a great job telling the story. The writing is much better than your typical Star Trek novel. The characters feel real and given the time to really develop and breath.There are a few additional points I wanted to add about Book 2. First, the plotting is a bit less smooth. The first 20% or so essentially fills the reader in on essential background. It's not an exciting beginning, but as the middle of the two-book series it's OK and probably necessary. Then, the rest of the book focuses on various parts of the Battle of Boreth. At this point, there are elements in the story that seem a bit too ""fantasy"", including mystical warriors and a magical sword. It works in the overall story, but again feels more like Klingon opera than Trek.As the conclusion to the series, some characters die. I was shocked to see which die. The book treated each of these deaths respectfully. I found each major death moving, much more emotional than anything I'd read in other media tie-in novels. It's wonderful that the books set up these characters with such depth that I ended up caring about them, and even more so that the authors weren't afraid of killing them off without some Star Trek-style ""reset button"" that resurrected them (at one point, the authors even seem to poke fun at reset buttons).I think this novel concludes Martok's epic story in a very satisfactory manner. It's not perfect, but definitely recommended.

It can honestly be used in any way you'd like and you can be free to use it in your own way. It's so diverse and has so many different uses that it's really great and my girlfriend is really loving it. She's having a ton of fun playing around with  it and still experimenting with how everything can or will work.

"This is good backing for the price. It filled up my small reel nicely and went on without a hitch. I bought it for my trout fishing reel and will be ordering some more for my steelhead setup soon. It seems to have good knot strength and I feel confident it will be able to handle the brutal runs that steelhead dish out. It also comes on a nice spool that I filled up with some 0x tippet for streamer fishing after I used the backing.

In her own words - I wish I had bought these books sooner. The usp of this book is how the writers talks to the reader in a friendly voice and imparts advice just like a friendly doctor would. The last thing you want in such books is usage of big words and long drawn out text. The book carefully avoids those and sticks to being a highly informational source.

"This eye mask is super super soft and delicate on your face. it does and excellent job of blocking out the light It is filled with a super thick foam.Plus it has earphones built into it with an audio 3.5mm jack adapter that descends from under the right eye and came with a braided nylon rope style audio cable to use with my devices. The audio cable has a volume control switch to lower or up the volume of my music. I love how cool this feels to my skin when i put it on my face. It helps me mellow out and relax. The volume is pretty decent as well and the bass is nice. i love listening to my calming sounds such as the ocean or nature while i'm falling asleep. i keep the mp3 player tucked under my pillow and i just lay there and realx and eventually just fall asleep. If i just want to use it as a sleep mask i can unzip the bottom and tuck the cable back in and put it on.

"So, for about the same amount if paint you can get chalky paint from home depot (in the sample size) for less than $9. But I didn't know that when I ordered this.Ordered 2 colors and had 2 different results. One can was really runny and the other can was thick and gloppy. Both covered well though. Make sure to use a good sealer and primer. i tested what would happen without a primer or sealer if I tried to clean a spot and all the paint came right off. So if you are going to paint a table or something  be sure to waterproof it. It also will stain if you do something like spill coffee or tea.Cans come sealed very well. I was extremely worried about opening my box and finding it full of paint. But the lids had been sealed tight and had things on top that you need to pry off. Then they wrapped in bubble wrap and plastic as well.  I was so glad to see how well they been packed!!Finish is very nice and I love the look. The colors are perfect and exactly what I was looking for.

(Without fussing) then she steals grandma's glasses, and granny puts herself in time out until Sophie brings back the glasses.

The Babe in Psychos is very different from WGP, she's more mature and slightly less self-absorbed and rude. But she's definitely still Babe.

"Perfect for toddlers and pre-k, the board book version was perfect for my 3 year old daughter to help her remember not to yell. We are still working on this but I have noticed definite improvement since we read this together. The paperback version is a longer version for older kids and I think I will be ordering that soon, since this book is very simplified.I honestly think parents and caregivers sometimes need reminding too, and this is a great book for the family to remember to lower the volume.Now if I tell my daughter, ""voices are not for yelling"" or ""i can't hear you when you yell"" she instantly knows what I mean and usually stops and tries to calm down and tell me in a calm voice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NJ50Z4C5ONHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1575425009#wasThisHelpful","R3NJ50Z4C5ONHJ","A26WHR1IP0A250","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26WHR1IP0A250?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A great little board book for kids (great for toddlers but could still work for preschool aged kiddos) to teach what could happen if you are impatient. Also is a great way to introduce kids to Greek Myths, which it seems a lot of kids love.Pandora is a little girl who wants to open a box, but her mother says to wait. Instead she opens it and cupcakes go flying everywhere. But in the box one cupcake is left, and Pandora asks her mother if she still loves her. And of course she does. In the back of the book is a short version of Pandora's tale.My own little girl can be a bit too curious at times and this is a great book for her.

"Interesting light reading if you aren't the blushing type and have a sense of humor. If you are at all familiar with erotic literature nothing in this book will shock you. This book was turned into a popular tv series and lots of other books have been published but almost all the source material was (and perhaps still is) available on her blog, where Belle posted lots of tips and anecdotes. Where the blog was more random, the book tells more of a story.Good to pick up and read if you like autobiographies or are fascinated by working girls. I really enjoy reading stories about call girls and such, it's a very different lifestyle from my own and I find it interesting like I'm sure a lot of people do. The psychology/mindset of working girls is interesting to me and this book offers a glimpse of that.Very mildly sexy. This is not going to get you going like traditional erotic literature. Belle is candid about her feelings toward her clients (they're not always so sweet) and leaves out many details that would have turned this into a literotica novel.I enjoy light reading like this when I take a break after completing a long series or dark or depressing novel so this is perfect for those times when you aren't sure what to read next and want to take a mental break.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RLU76D9IHWVV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446577251#wasThisHelpful","R1RLU76D9IHWVV","A26WHR1IP0A250","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26WHR1IP0A250?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought the board book version thru the Kindle app and while that version was good, this version was better for my daughter as it teaches more empathy than the other. Explains pets have feelings and can get hurt if you are not gentle.I definitely think a 2.5-3 year old can understand this book. The text is short so it's not too long for a toddler to sit through.This has really helped my daughter who was having trouble understanding that let's have feelings, and that what she thinks is normal playing is teasing.

"This is a lifesaver!  And boy does it work!  This comes with a battery for each of the four keyfinder attachments plus one for the transmitter button.You can put this on up to four different sets of keys, or other things you are prone to losing, and this emits a loud beeping sound when you press the button on the transmitter, alerting you to the lost item.  The transmitter has four different color-coded buttons, one for each of the four attachments, so you can select which set of keys you are hunting for.I tested this at a distance from the transmitter and it carries the signal up to at least twenty feet.  So if your keys are lost anywhere in the house you can simply walk from room to room pressing the proper button on the transmitter until you hear the beeping on the keychain.I'm putting the other beepers on a spare pair of reading glasses, on a second set of keys, and attaching the fourth with a rubber band to the remote.  Now if only I can find a way not to lose the transmitter I will be all set.

".While small, lightweight, and portable, this really is a fantastic little ice making machine.  It is small enough to leave out on my kitchen counter without taking up a lot of space and even looks cute.  I love the little window so I can watch the ice cubes being made.There are many things to love about this machine but my favorite is the way you can choose 3 sizes of ice cubes.  I love the small size best and can fit lots of them into a glass.  I can make a whole bucket of ice in about one hour, or up to  26.5 pounds in 24 hours.This has alerts for when the icemaker is on standby, and when it is finished making ice, as well as when there is not enough water in the bucket to make ice.  And you can set this to turn on automatically.  When it is finished it turns itself off.  This only stores up to 2.5 pounds of ice so you can take out the ice and put it in plastic bags for storage in your freezer and always have enough ice when guests arrive.If the ice is not removed before it melts in the icemaker the water is simply stored in the bucket for the next ice making session.  There are four LED buttons for on, off, and to set the timer for automatic ice making.Since I live in Florida we seem like we always need more ice for our drinks.  Now we won't run out again and won't be running to the store for bags of ice.

"Super soft washcloths are beautifully packaged in a way that says they are all natural and organic.  I received these at no cost to write a review on.I have not tried any fabrics made out of 100% bamboo before and was amazed to find that these are even softer than all cotton cloth.  They have a smooth velvety texture that must be felt to be appreciated.  They won't do any exfoliation and do seem a bit delicate.  These would be perfect for a child or baby's soft delicate skin.  These also are great as facial cloths due to the smooth soft texture.  I love to use these to remove my makeup as they are so gentle and are great for my rosacea prone skin.I have not used washcloths at all previously since they always have felt harsh and scratchy even when made of cotton.

"*I received this free in exchange for an unbiased honest review.Makes ice cubes in six minutesThis is the newest ice maker from Ivation, the leader in portable ice makers.  I don’t run out of ice cubes ever since I got this.  I just pour some water into the container and turn it on and wait six minutes, and have a new batch of ice cubes, perfectly frozen and shaped.There are several things I love about this ice maker, starting with its small compact size.  My counter space is at a premium in my kitchen but this can sit out on the counter and look cute without taking up much room.  It is also reasonably lightweight at 24 pounds.I usually just make a new batch of ice with this every day but when I have guests coming I let this run for twenty four hours so that I have twenty six pounds of ice which I put into my own large plastic bags to store in the freezer to make sure I don’t run out, or sometimes I make double that amount to have on hand in case I have a party.This is so simple I didn’t even need to read the instructions before I first used it.  I poured water into the bucket and turned it on.  The ice cubes came out perfectly and I could see them being made through the window in the top of the lid.  What amazed me was that they didn’t stick together.  Each one was perfectly formed and separate from the rest.When I left some ice in the machine, it melted back into the reservoir and then was turned back into ice the next day when I made more ice.  There is a drain on the bottom to let out water that is unused or the machine can be tilted to pour it outEven though this is so compact and easy to use, it has alerts to let you know when the water level is too low, and also lets you know when the ice bucket is full.  It shut itself off when it was  finished making a bucket of ice.Pros:LED buttons to turn it on and offAlerts for when it needs water and when it is finished making iceMakes 26.5 pounds of ice in 24 hoursOnly about 14 X 13 X 10 inchesSee through window to watch the ice being madeComes with a removable water tank, ice scoop and user manualI love this ice maker and will never again run out of ice, nor will I have to buy ice at the store.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAWGW66AOOBJ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKCTAHM#wasThisHelpful","RAWGW66AOOBJ4","A19UTUEBWKIZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UTUEBWKIZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have recently been through two large bags of dry catfood where Sheba would rather starve than eat it.  The local feral cats are the benefactor's of her picky eating behavior.  This one is different.  She gobbles this up and looks for more.  She has previously shown that she loves anything with duck in it and this has that and turkey, another favorite.I love the fact that this is grain free, unlike just about all dry cat foods.  Sheba is middle aged and is developing quite a poochy belly, being strictly an indoor princess.  Carbs are probably part of the problem so this is a good choice for her.  I also love that this comes in a zip lock bag to keep it fresh.  She loves it and I like it too.

"I was puzzled that the package of six rolls I received did not have any type of large printed label like regular toilet paper packages have.  They have really stripped down the overall presentation of the packaging of this.  This is half the size of a regular package of six rolls of toilet paper and I love this since I can now keep all six rolls under the sink with room to spare.Once I removed a roll from the package I could simply squeeze the roll to make it round again. This is brilliant packaging and I'm surprised they didn't think of this before.  I can imagine from a marketing standpoint that this takes up much less space on store shelves which won't be seen as a good thing as far as product placement in a store, where more shelf space puts a product on display over a larger area.  But from a consumer's standpoint this is pure genius.

"Sheba loves her canned Friskies cat food.  It is only the ""pate"" version she likes, and I have found most cats prefer this texture.  Sheba only licks the gravy off of the little bites of this, like she does with any of the ""sliced"" textured canned food.  She refuses to eat the morsels.  She even spits them out if one accidentally gets in her mouth as she licks the gravy.My neighbors who have cats have all confirmed that none of their cats like any of the sliced type canned cat food.  So I cannot actually say that this is bad food, only that like all the cat foods with this texture of bites in gravy, they will lick up the gravy and leave the actual bites of cat food.Sheba's preferred dry cat food is Nutro and she is extremely healthy and happy eating the Salmon Adult variety of that.Nutro is an excellent brand.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34GOMXLCJQKNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WEIQ0AU#wasThisHelpful","R34GOMXLCJQKNZ","A19UTUEBWKIZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UTUEBWKIZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a lover of great documentaries and this is the best of this year.The high school marching bands of New Orleans take it all the way to a new level of greatness.  This is the culture, the reason d'etre, for an entire section of this great city.  These kids live for their chance to play in the marching bands, and be in the Mardi Gras parades.See this remarkable film to understand exactly what this means to New Orleans.

"I rubbed this on my feet but it's my face and hands I am most concerned with.  That is where I notice dry skin that needs serious moisture.  So when I saw how rich and creamy this is, and how wonderful this smells, I put some on my face and hands.Wow.  The wrinkles on my skin vanished and were replaced with glowing moisturized pretty skin.This has an earthy herbal scent that is very subtle and I love it.  It smells like an herb garden.  I probably would never buy a foot cream as my feet look good.  But I would definitely buy this to put on my parched facial skin and the backs of my hands.  This is very thick but non greasy.  The tube is nice.I have loved this brand forever.  Every single product I've tried by AHAVA I have loved and this is no exception.  I don't know what exactly is in that Dead Sea mud that my skin loves so much, but it's in every product by this brand and it is a miracle ingredient.  It is healing and perfecting.  This goes on other parts besides feet and I will keep using it as a night cream.  I also love the mud mask by this brand which I am using on a daily basis.  My skin is looking fantastic now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX5L4ZC5FHWBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SUY46E#wasThisHelpful","RX5L4ZC5FHWBR","A19UTUEBWKIZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UTUEBWKIZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our little shnoodle Ringo loves this.  For a dog he can be a picky eater and refuses lots of brands of dry food but this one he loves.  He has been eating this for three weeks and he is bouncy and energetic, and in particular his coat is soft and silky and has lost the course wiriness it had.  He is doing great on this.  He no longer tries to eat the cat's food and instead prefers this one.I love that this has zero grain in it. He does not do well at all when he consumes any grains.  He is regular, happy and healthy and this is obviously a high quality made in the USA dogfood with healthy ingredients.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3500PUJO1FRV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRGJJ8A#wasThisHelpful","R3500PUJO1FRV4","A19UTUEBWKIZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UTUEBWKIZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this.  I have skin that reacts to daily foundation wearing with pimples, blackheads and oil.  This has a gentle drying effect on my messy skin. It makes the blackheads almost microscopic instantly, and the pimples seem to dry up with use over just a couple of days.  I really love this.  I'm a fan of mud masks for my problem skin in general.  This one is light but highly effective and best of all, I only need to leave it on for two minutes.  It rinses off very easily, unlike many mud masks.My skin takes on a new texture after I use this.  It feels soft and silky smooth for hours afterwards. Pores become invisible.I have used the brand of soap before and love it.  This is top quality from an Israeli company that infuses all its products with Dead Sea mud.I don't know why but this works wonders.  I want to try all the products from AHAVA.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FZO59XO353GS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TMRV8Y#wasThisHelpful","R3FZO59XO353GS","A19UTUEBWKIZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UTUEBWKIZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love shampoos which are so moisturizing that I don't need to use any conditioner after shampooing and this is one of them.This adds protein, which my fine dry colored hair drinks in and responds to better than any other ingredient.  I see no reason to use any conditioner after this.Whenever I am trying  a new shampoo for the first time I skip any conditioner to see if this makes my wish to not use conditioner come true. This shampoo conditions and smooths my dry frizzy hair better than any I've tried so far.  I did not even have as many tangles when it was wet.Nexxus has come out with some great new shampoos and conditioners lately.  If you have dry, tangle prone, fine damaged frizzy hair definitely try this one.  I will continue to use this as my hair loves it.

"This is the second product I've tried now from the new Nexxus Oil Infinite line of products.  This holds true to the positive results I have gotten from the other product.  My hair is left silky without the usual mass of frizz and tangles after shampooing with this.I gave this shampoo the true test; I did not use any conditioner at all after I shammpooed with this. And I can report that simply switching to using this shampoo made my hair silky, shiny and full of body.  I almost do not need a conditioner when I use this.  Who knew that simply adding a touch of the right oil to a shampoo would work a miracle for my hair?My hair is so dry and frizzy it does not even hang down to my shoulders, but instead stands out in a mass of frizz from my head and looks dull and parched, and is very difficult to comb when wet.  Now it hangs straight down in a shiny mass of silk.I have tried innumerable shampoos over the past few years in the Amazon Vine program and this is definitely up there in the top three.  If you have dry frizzy untamable hair give this a try, along with the other products in the Nexxus Oil Infinite line.

"I'm a long time user of Moroccan Oil since my hair is always very dry and frizzy due to home coloring, sun, wind and swimming in pools frequently.  I like this even better.I do not usually like strong scented products but this one is an exception.  I can smell it on my hair for hours after I apply it and I love it.  It is a light musky scent and probably the first musk scent I've ever liked.  It is sublime. There is some rum and a hint of patchouli in there too.This smooth and silkens and slightly straightens my hair.  It is an oil but not heavy.  Instead of my hair sticking out in a bushy mass of frizz, after this is hangs straight down almost with a soft shiny glow.  It looks like perfection.  I like to put this on my dry hair, and I use more than a few drops.  I like to shampoo at least every other day or more, so I don't worry about any oily buildup of this.Would I buy this even though it costs a lot?  You bet I would.  This is one of my rare ten star products.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11OI4AQRB9JH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SNL8ZZK#wasThisHelpful","R11OI4AQRB9JH3","A19UTUEBWKIZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UTUEBWKIZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a creamy white lotion that has a delicious scent of musky coconut.  After you bathe and cleanse your body, you then apply this and rub it around and rinse it off.  I found that it rinses away cleanly and does not make my shower or tub slippery at all.  I do not use this lavishly but instead have found that about two teaspoonfuls will cover most of my body.  I then allow the shower to rinse it off and my skin is noticeably softer and smoother.This smells delicious, and it is a big economical bottle.  My one gripe is that this has to stand on it's somewhat unstable cap, upside down.  It is prone to falling over this way.  Otherwise I like this very much and I found that applying moisturizer in the shower, when I'm wet, is much easier and faster than doing it afterwards.  I also love this as a shave cream when shaving my legs.  I recommend this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T720UX8KRJCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0107QOZR0#wasThisHelpful","R3T720UX8KRJCF","A19UTUEBWKIZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UTUEBWKIZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This brush was a needed accessory for my makeup brush collection.  This has a very long handle and the spoolie end is substantial.  It grabs ahold of my unruly brows and I can hold each hair almost straight up with this and then trim them to a uniform length.I then apply some hairspray on a cotton ball to hold them in the desired position.  Then I use the little straight edge angled brush on the other end of this to apply the perfect shade of eyeshadow, a pale brownish taupe.  And voila, perfect looking brows, each hair standing in the correct position.  I like using eyeshadow for my brows since I have never found the ideal shade of brow makeup.  And it's subtle.The pros of this deluxe brow brush are:long easy to hold handlesubstantial, thick well made spoolie-brushperfect soft small angle brush to apply eye makeup and brow makeupIf you have used the inferior, smaller type of spoolie brush on your brows, get this one and throw that one away.  This really gets a good grip and each and every hair and holds it firmly while I trim them.  My brows have never looked as perfect as they do now.  I even have a supersharp pencil I use to fill in the thin areas.  It's easy with my magnifying mirror and this brush.  No set of makeup brushes is complete without a fantastic brow brush and this is it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD2YKMK9Z2JUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012C1QQG6#wasThisHelpful","RD2YKMK9Z2JUX","A19UTUEBWKIZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UTUEBWKIZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This sands the callouses off my feet easily and it's fun to use.  A small wheel turns rapidly and there is a gentle sandpaper type roller that simply sands off the callouses and dead skin from my feet.  A fine white dust which is the dead skin forms as I use this so it is recommended to use this over a towel.This is fast and gentle and in under five minutes my feet were smooth and callous free. This came with batteries and a small case and is neatly packages and was sent quickly.  This is a lot of fun to use and can be used on elbows also.  It also can be used in the shower.  There is no reason to have callouses anymore and feet look and feel better when they are smooth and callous free.

"I've been a long time user of Tresemme conditioners, for the past few years now.  Tresemme conditioners remove all the frizz from my incredibly frizzy, dry hair.

My hair is very find, color processed, fly away, dry, damaged and a complete wreck.I've also used Fekkai conditioners lately and they are also good but require several minutes to really work.

"What a great magnifying glass this is.  I use this mainly for reading tiny print, which is on packages, and credit cards.  It is a very handy item to have around the house.  And with a little button to push to shine a bright light on what I am magnifying, this has allowed me to get a splinter out of my daughter's finger that was almost invisible but quite painful for her.This is ideal as a reading magnifier if you often read books with very small print, since this is very large, and very lightweight.  The lens is acrylic, making it incredibly light.  There is also no frame around the lens so that nothing gets blocked.  This is not a magnifying glass that will increase the size immensely, but the 2X magnification is perfect for reading.  This also has a very small area that magnifies a lot more and I was able to see that the tiny bump on my arm is indeed a very tiny wart with this.  What really clinched it for me was that light that is extremely bright, and shines right on whatever I am magnifying.  Without that and it would have forever remained a mystery what that bump was.I recommend this if you ever have trouble seeing very tiny print, or simply want a very handy large shatterproof magnifying glass.  You don't know how handy this thing is until you have one.  Then you wonder how you ever lived without it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHNMMR670M0R9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011AGVKII#wasThisHelpful","RHNMMR670M0R9","A19UTUEBWKIZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UTUEBWKIZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is a novel idea to make chips out of black beans and these would be ok with some onion dip on them but think about what black beans taste like.  They do not have a lot of flavor and are bland.  So are these almost black chips.  These are crispy and have good crunch, a somewhat hard crunch, and I can taste the salt, other than that texture, the flavor wasn't anything that would make me buy these. I think it's a great idea to make chips out of a healthy product such as black beans.

"I've been a fan of Nutro cat food as long as I've had Sheba, my giant Manx calico, which is about eight years.  It's been her primary food and she has never stopped growing the entire time I've had her from a four week old kitten, which is typical of her breed. She is now huge and gorgeous.  Her fur is incredible and she is the picture of health.  She refuses any other dry food but Nutro.Now our Schnoodle Ringo has taken a liking to his new Nutro Adult Wholesome Essential Dog Food with Chicken.  His constant itching and scratching at himself has stopped finally since he has been on this and he is bright eyed and energetic more than usual since switching him to this. Apparently he had developed a food allergy to his previous kibble but this has cured him and he is much happier and never scratches and bites at himself like he used to since eating only this food.I've researched dog foods on the internet and Nutro dog foods are consistently rated as very high quality in comparison to most other dog foods.  And the price is competitive with lesser quality foods, particularly in the thirty pound bags.  We will keep our precious Ringo on this food.  He loves it and is not allergic to it.  He seems to be very healthy and happy on it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33PY0M0WD4G8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZGABAY#wasThisHelpful","R33PY0M0WD4G8C","A19UTUEBWKIZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UTUEBWKIZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a large machine which comes with a large variety of blades, all tucked neatly into a big storage container.  The thing that sets this apart the most from my trusty Cuisinart processor is that dicing blade.  It's great when I make my soups and salads.I always felt bad when I needed a different blade for my other expensive food processor and had to spend a lot of money on it, and also buy the container to keep those extra blades in.  This requires no further purchases of either blades or the storage bin for them.This is plenty powerful and does everything you could want a food processor to do.  If there is one problem with it, it is the size of both the processor itself and the storage bin, but with all those blades and accessories that are included with this a large storage container is a necessity.This has two bowls, a smaller one and a larger one, and a lid is included for the smaller one to store the food in after it's processed.  They've really included everything here.Black and Decker has been coming out with lots of excellent kitchen appliances lately, and I've tried several and found them all top quality, better than the competition, such as the small convection ovens that are half the price and work better than the expensive brands they are competing with.  This is the same.  This does it all, work as well or better, and is one third the price or even less if you add in all those accessories that are included.If you need a food processor this is the one to get in my opinion.And from now on if I need any type of countertop appliance in my kitchen Black and Decker will be the brand I choose, based on what I've seen of their recent kitchen offerings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R0HL8OKIT05S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VHLXLZM#wasThisHelpful","R1R0HL8OKIT05S","A19UTUEBWKIZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UTUEBWKIZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So now we have our Schnoodle Ringo on this Nutro Limited Ingredient dog food in an effort to help him with his relentless itching which is most likely a food allergy.He is not itching as much since eating only this food, although I have been reading it can take up to two months for the itch allergic response to stop completely.  He loves this food and is his usualy happy healthy energetic self on this.  It seems to be very crunching and instead of gobbling and swallowing this whole as he does with almost everything he eats, he slows down and really chews and crunches this up before swallowing it.  We feel this is probably a good thing.So far he likes this and we like this brand.

"This is actually more of a powder for the entire face than a blush, once you apply it and see the lack of any type of obvious pigments in the formula.I have lily white skin and these do not add any sort of color to my skin that is apparent. I do like how finely milled the powder is, and the soft feeling of it on my skin. It adds a barely there tone and although I have three different shades, none of the three do much of anything in the way of adding color.If you need a nude face powder, these would be great for that, but if you are looking for something that adds any color or blush to your skin keep looking. These won't do that.EDIT: Wow!  I was so wrong.  I've been using these colors and found that I simply cannot live without the Luminous shade of this.  I have never used any face powder in my life before since I always wanted a dewy moist finish on my skin.  Well let me tell you--this makes my skin perfect, glowy and simply gorgeous in the Luminous shade.  I can't believe the perfection of my skin when I liberally dust this one over my entire face.  It still has a dewy look but it glows and is flawless.  This even conceals shadows under eyes and evens out the skintones and valleys so the entire face looks radient and even.  I want to stock on on this particular shade.  I also use the Bronze shade on my eyelids for the most subtle but gorgeous eyeshadow.  These are not going to add much if any color.  Subtle is the word here.  But if you want perfect looking skin get these, especially Luminous.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UTJGE5JFDKI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2VQWFE#wasThisHelpful","R2UTJGE5JFDKI2","A19UTUEBWKIZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UTUEBWKIZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The box of this dog food I got has two 4 pound bags of food in it but I understand that now they are selling it in one bag. These are clear sturdy bags inside a box, and each bag has what looks just like bright green sawdust in it. The instructions on the box say to mix about one cup of this meal with about 1.5 to 2 cups of water.The result of mixing this green powder with water is a soup that smells strongly of dried fish. There are small pieces of what appear to be bites of fish floating in the soup, and Ringo, our schnoodle, loved it. He went crazy for this stinky fish soup. Our cat Sheba also found it to her liking, although this is sold as a dog food.This is not a solid food. It is more of a powder you mix with water to make a soup, or possibly with less water, a mush. This is too loose a food product for us to want to feed it exclusively to our beloved little Ringo, but we are going to give this to him in portions of a half cup to a cup a day, mixed with water, since he loves it so much and it apparently is very nutritious, being made of dehydrated fish and some dried vegetables. We feel it is an excellent food product and will supplement his, and our cat Sheba's, diet very well. It will be his afternoon treat before his daily run at the dog park.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VRUSBPI22H0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZBI9DD6#wasThisHelpful","R1VRUSBPI22H0C","A19UTUEBWKIZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UTUEBWKIZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My only gripe is the cost, around $3.50 per roll at this writing.  These are extra large rolls.  I used a couple to clean out a really grimey bathtub and sink and it was easy and fun to use these.  I love them but the price so far is too much since you can just put some Dawn on a paper towel but for the convenience and if price is no object, these are great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CPS2SOJXFLQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYAMVTK#wasThisHelpful","R3CPS2SOJXFLQX","A19UTUEBWKIZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UTUEBWKIZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These were like marshmallow candy bars, with some white marshmallowy stuff and nuts  and cranberries mixed in.  This was much more candybar-like than any other protein bar I've tried.  It is delicious.  I'm not sure I want my protein bar to be so good I eat half the box in one sitting.  I had to check and double check again the ingredients to be sure they were healthy and they are, although I still can't wrap my head around the idea that something so gooey and candy like is actually a protein bar.If you, unlike me, are not tempted to overindulge when you have a whole box of gooey sweet protein bars that taste like delicious candy, then get these.  They are not as filling as some I've had but they are probably the best tasting.  I am snacking on fruit these days but if I wanted a treat, this would be it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UBBFYFR7ENOW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WED5QOQ#wasThisHelpful","R2UBBFYFR7ENOW","A19UTUEBWKIZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UTUEBWKIZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually like to make my own mac and cheese using separate cheddar cheese to go on the pasta, mixed with a little milk on the stove to melt it together.  I was eager to see what gluten free mac and cheese would be like and it is delicious.  While I am not on a gluten free diet, this would be wonderful to add to the diets of those who are on such a diet.  And this is organic, and I am now always using organic dairy products so that would be reason enough to switch to this.  It's a fairly small package and it about two small servings.  It takes great and can be made in the microwave for a quick snack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30PPU55NFBHVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTR0S8C#wasThisHelpful","R30PPU55NFBHVY","A19UTUEBWKIZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UTUEBWKIZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the size, small, and the way it looks.  This is a pretty attractive little clock.First the good things about it:*small and attractive---the one I got is rectangular, not the square one in the picture, and I prefer the rectangular shape*not only shows the time and date, but the temperature in either farenheit or celcius*can stay plugged into the USB port of my computer, or as I have it now, with the USB cord it comes with plugged into a wall outlet adapter*the alarm can be set on either 5 days to go off, or 7 days, allowing you to not have it wake you on weekends*can run on the internal rechargeable battery, although I have not tested how long it will stay on with only battery powerNow the less than good things about it:*cannot be plugged into a wall outlet unless you have the type of adapter which allows you to plug USB plugs into the wall*It took some time to get the date and time set up, many buttons on the back to test out*If the battery runs out you will have to set it up all over again*And the MAIN PROBLEM WITH THIS IS-- it is very hard to read the time due to the dark grey background and black numbers, unless you push the button on top to activate the light.For some people who want zero light in their bedroom at night, this feature of having a dark unreadable screen might be an advantage, but it is almost impossible to see the time unless you reach over and push the button on top to make the screen light up.Overall I do like this and find it a nice clock, as long as it is very close to my bed so I can see the time since from a distance it is impossible due to the dark numbers on a dark screen.  For that reason alone I would not buy it but since I was sent this for testing purposes it is ok.*Sample was sent to me for a review and testing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17R9RBCQAR5VL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZHP07HE#wasThisHelpful","R17R9RBCQAR5VL","A19UTUEBWKIZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UTUEBWKIZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was disappointed to find when I unboxed this that this had a huge blank strip down the middle of the screen.  It appears that I might have gotten one that had previously been purchased and returned but I'm not sure.  The keyboard, which is of major importance to me in any laptop, was very good, with the key pressure and distance between keys to be a perfect touch typing experience.This was lightweight and responsive and I would have loved it had there not been that big missing pixel strip down the middle. Not sure how this could have possibly passed quality control!  It looked as if it may have been dropped hard as  the box was a bit dented on one corner.  I have owned Dell's in the past and loved each and every one of them for their bright perfect screens, great keyboards, and most of all their amazing reliability over almost any other brand.

"This is very crunchy with almonds, not too sweet, and some chewy cheery pieces make this very good tasting.  It has a great chewy-crunchy texture and you really almost have to force yourself to eat an entire bar in one sitting it is so filling.  After eating one I feel absolutely stuffed.  I have never eaten this standard sized protein bar before that had such a filling effect.  This is a great mid afternoon snack therefore for anyone on a diet.The ingredients are all healthful. There are five bars per box, and this comes in a box of six boxes for a total of 30 protein bars.  Each bar has ten grams of protein.  I have always loved Cliff Bars, and still prefer the taste of those, but those are sweeter and more like candy bars compared to these.  These are to fill you up until dinner time.  I really love these for that reason and can see this becoming a regular daily part of my weight loss effort.

"I am using this in a bedroom that is 12 X 15 feet.  It pulls dampness out of the air and we empty the container that collects water about once per week.  We are selling our home here in humid south Florida and we no longer live there, so to save on electricity we keep the air conditioner set on 86 degrees, which is ok except for the extreme humidity, which can cause mold to begin to grow.  This makes a very noticeable difference in the dampest room which is one of the bedrooms.  The air stays dry and fresh smelling in there.We have a smaller version of this same dehumidifier by Ivation in a large closet and it also does a fine job of keeping it dry.  Since these use much less electricity than the central air conditioning system does, we can keep that turned up, while not worrying about mold and dampness.I have been testing and reviewing Ivations products for a long time and have been impressed by all of them.  Ivation stands out as being a very quality conscious company with perfect quality control, excellent packaging and shipping, products that exceed my expectations, reliability, attractiveness, and ease of use.This little mid-sized dehumidifier from Ivation is exactly right for our medium sized bedroom so don't think this only can be used in a closet.  This also will work in a bedroom or office and do a great job.  I also love the fact that it is almost completely silent.*Thank you Ivation for sending me this for testing and review--love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A93CYW9HWZ31/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZQ33GBG#wasThisHelpful","R3A93CYW9HWZ31","A19UTUEBWKIZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UTUEBWKIZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I also love how this orange scented essential oil has the power to eliminate our ant problem within 24 hours.  I wish more people knew about this trick.  Ants cannot tolerate the smell of oranges for a minute and disappear when it is in the air.I can't say this is a calming scent although it smells delicious.  It actually seems to give me energy and clears my thinking.  It's a great scent in the early morning to wake up to.  This is a potent oil and one of the better essential oils I've smelled.

"These are very well packaged in a sturdy attractive case.  They have mirror fronts which not only look very cool but do a great job of blocking the sun.  I can see perfectly out of these under water and they don't fog up like many I've had.The best thing about these is the way they prevent even one drop of water from getting into the inside of them, but also these are incredibly comfortable. These have two very soft rubber flanges around each eye piece that cup each eye comfortably feel great.  Some goggles can be very uncomfortable but due to the softness of each of the surrounding rubber flanges, these hug my eyes without causing pain or discomfort.The strap that goes around my head is also unusually comfortable, also being soft rubber that is very stretchy.  I didn't even have to adjust it the first time I put it on.

"I have long, thick, wavy hair.  I got this hoping it could be a more cost effective substitute for the DevaCurl products I have been using.  This is good in that it does define my waves, but I find I still prefer the Deva Curl in that it seems easier to wash out of my hair with the gentler conditioning washes I use, keeps my hair less frizzy and still soft looking and to the touch.

"I got this to replace a 10 year old Grohe faucet in my guest bathroom.  Thankfully, we had recently installed a new faucet in the kitchen so we were already familiar with the process of switching out a faucet and were able to do this without calling a plumber.  We found this to be slightly easier in terms of installation since the other faucet had a touchless sensor feature that involved installing a new outlet.  We thought it was appropriate for a couple of minimally skilled DIY’ers to do in a couple hours.But more than anything else I love the look and function of this product.  My biggest peeve with a lot of faucets is that they feel and look cheap.  This is the EXACT opposite of that.  The design and chrome finish are really pretty and operating this the metal feels substantial and like it is built to last.  The one concern I had was whether this would look too modern in my more transitional home (Condo originally built in 1919, but updated) but I thought it looked great and really gave my sink an upgrade.  My towel rack, hand towel ring and toilet paper holder are all the Ashbury line in polished chrome from Restoration Hardware and I was originally concerned that the more roundish look of the fixtures from this line and the more square look of the faucet wouldn’t mesh but they look great together.  (I’ve come to like that it coordinates and ‘goes’ without being matchy matchy.)I also find this operates perfectly with a nice flow and no leaks.I’d recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JITVSHAA6ZBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1FWAFW#wasThisHelpful","R3JITVSHAA6ZBH","AHN86VFJIJ2JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHN86VFJIJ2JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not gluten free, but I have a great co-worker who is and it makes me less inclined to bring baked goods into the office because I like to bring things she can enjoy.  Accordingly, this mix got me excited.  I love that the ingredient list is simple and without hard to understand ingredients.  Essentially, this replaces the flour, sugar, and leaveners and also includes some vanilla extract for taste.  This does mean you need to add substantial fresh ingredients (heavy cream, butter, eggs) to complete the recipe.  If you're looking for a recipe that requires little additional fresh ingredients or if you have a gluten free flour blend you already love and have great success substituting in scone recipes, this likely isn't the product for you.  But as someone who generally cooks with gluten but likes to cook gluten free occasionally for my co-worker, it's a great option.  I also love that you can switch up the mix-ins to try different flavors with one mix.  Just make sure whatever you add is gluten-free.I will also say I'm not sure these are the product for the beginning baker.  Cutting in the butter and getting the right texture can take a little bit of practice.  I do think it is easier if you work with frozen butter, which I typically do.I was also thrilled with the results.  I love the taste of millet flour and bake with it on my own even when I'm not trying to be gluten free so I thought these tasted great and are proof that gluten free products have come a long way over the years.  The texture does seem a bit different than the typical scones I'm used to, but it's close enough that these are still pretty satisfying.Would recommend","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROJZSZW5T83DS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LOV27I#wasThisHelpful","ROJZSZW5T83DS","AHN86VFJIJ2JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHN86VFJIJ2JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm absolutely smitten with this polish.  I've been a long time fan of Essie.  I love the formula.  It's a bit thinner than most I use which I find makes it easier to apply evenly and with a good topcoat (I'm currently using and loving Seche Vite) and a good base coat (I use Essie) I get a long wear out of my mani.  But what really gets me with this polish is the color.  While I think the picture is pretty true to color, the shimmer is even more pretty in person.  It's a lovely purple with a light teal shimmer that is subtle, but absolutely stunning at the right angle and in the right light.  Paired with the matte finish it reminds me a lot of the look of more indie polishes, but at an affordable price.  I love, love, love this.

"I love the tactile feel of writing on a pad, but also appreciate the convenience of writing on a tablet so you can more easily access your notes later.  The Wacom Bamboo Spark is amazing because it blends the best of both worlds.  I love that you physically take notes with an actual pen that feels more comfortable and natural than styluses (which I've previously purchased but never really used for that reason) but then with a push of a button it digitally captures them so you can access them later.It comes with the Bamboo Spark pen, 30 page notepad, 2 replacement ink cartridges, nib removal tool, USB cable, and quick start guide.So far, I've found a lot to love about this gadget.  I love that the pocket is perfect not just for storing my iPhone but business cards and small papers.  I also love that if you're not connected to your device the Bamboo Spark can hold up to 100 pages.  I love that it is lightweight and small so it's not a hassle to carry it to meetings or travel with it.  I also wasn't sure how often I would really digitally store my notes, but I've been surprised at how many times it has come in handy.  It is more convenient when someone asks me to share notes from a meeting or when I'm sketching out a rough idea of what I want something to look like for our designers.  My only want would have been more options for case colors and patterns, but this is a nice neutral case that is very professional.I love this!ETA 10/9/15: I wanted to update this review as I've continued to get more experience with this product.  I continue to LOVE the functionality.  It's continued to be very handy and I find myself using it a lot for both professional and personal use.  My only nit is I think the software might be in need of an update.  It is supposed to sync automatically in the background, but it seems to be hit or miss whether it does this and I often have to repair the device which is making this a tad less convenient.

"I have long color treated blonde hair that is wavy and coarse (type 2C for you curly girls).  In the past couple years I've been embracing my natural wave more, using DevaCurl products to cleanse and style my hair.  The routine has definitely made a huge difference.  My waves are more defined, my hair feels softer, and I get compliments on my wavy hair days.  Having my wavy hair under control I've now been curious about salt-infused sprays meant to give hair more of that beachy, windswept look.  So far I've tried a few products like Oribe Après Beach Wave and Shine Spray, Bumble and Bumble Surf Spray, and Bumble and Bumble Shampoo and Conditioner, and of course, this Sea Mineral Infusion Texturizing Sea Salt Spray.I've been playing around with these different products and different approaches for awhile (i.e. using these salt-infused sprays on their own, using them with my other wave/curl styling products, etc.).  I've come to the conclusion that at least among the brands I've tried, Suave included, I don't really care for what any of these sprays do on their own.  As a standalone product, I just don't love what any of them do for my hair.  It's possible there is a miracle sea salt-infused spray out there that will perform better that I haven't tried yet, but given that I've tried multiple brands at a range of price points, I'm thinking this type of product just isn't a holy grail for me on it's own.That said, I have had better results when I try this spray with my other products.  I'm much happier when I use my Devacurl Light Defining Gel and Styling Cream and give my hair a few generous sprays with this product after.  It seems to give my hair a little more texture and help with defining my waves.  That said, after all this testing I'm convinced this product is probably not meant for my hair type.  Since my hair is on the coarse side naturally it always looks a bit more textured and windswept without any help from products so I'm not sure the results are dramatic enough with any brand to convince me I need this product.Overall, this is an interesting product, but I'm not sure it's meant for my hair type","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KM7YM16QBY7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R0UJV4O#wasThisHelpful","R3KM7YM16QBY7P","AHN86VFJIJ2JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHN86VFJIJ2JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These body pads are meant to help treat body acne and do seem to work for that purpose.  Essentially, after cleaning the skin (I use Glytone Exfoliating Body wash as recommended by my dermatologist) you rub the pad over your acne prone or effective areas.  It does seem to do a nice job of helping heal and prevent breakouts without over drying the skin.  I especially appreciate that there are no ingredients that damage your clothing, like benzoyl peroxide since I'm usually in a hurry and throw on clothing or pajamas after using these.That said, there are a couple of caveats worth stating about the product.  First, these are only effective if your acne responds to the active ingredients.  If you skin is typically not responsive to salicylic acid and gycolic acid, these likely won't help you.  I know this is common sense but for years I was guilty of trying may products that all used the same active ingredients and finding myself confused that none of them worked.  It wasn't until I explored other active ingredients (largely prescription products) that I saw better results.  I also wish these came with a tool to help make application easier.  One of the biggest reasons I've always struggled to use topical treatments consistently for body acne is that most of my acne clusters in the middle of the back, which I find hard to reach.  For creams you can use a back lotion applicator, but I haven't found anything that aids with using pads.  Obviously if your acne is in more easily reachable places this is not an issue, but was for me based on my acne lotion.Other than that, I do like these pads and would recommend them to people whose body acne is responsive to  salicylic acid and gycolic acid.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P27M2459C9YB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY418J0#wasThisHelpful","R3P27M2459C9YB","AHN86VFJIJ2JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHN86VFJIJ2JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like some of other reviewers, I'm still not 100% sure why Cetaphil needs a lotion specific for men.  On one level I get it since many lotions have a very perfume-y smell that even as a woman I don't care for.  But as a long time Cetaphil user I've always found their products to be relatively unscented and perfectly gender neutral.  That said, I recognize that the fear of a perfume-y lotion is so strong that a 'for men' product is an easy cue when you're shopping the aisle that the lotion isn't going to leave you smelling like a flower patch, which this lotion doesn't.  Though some 'for men' products have more of a musky, cologne smell, and this doesn't have that either since it is unscented.That discussion aside, this is a great lotion for those who have sensitive or acne prone skin.  It moistures and provides some sun protection (though not enough, say, for a day at the beach since most people don't apply nearly as much lotion as they do sunscreen and this isn't meant to be water resistant) without clogging pores or irritating skin.  It's definitely meant for someone with normal or oily skin though so if your skin is dry or very dry you may not find this gives you enough moisture.Overall, I think this a nice lotion for those (male or female) who have sensitive and/or acne-prone skin and want a suitable lotion that also provides some SPF.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ODX0LVSGIQUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHNZUS2#wasThisHelpful","R2ODX0LVSGIQUZ","AHN86VFJIJ2JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHN86VFJIJ2JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a feeling these were going to be a huge hit with my dog because while he likes a wide range of types and brands of treats, jerky-type treats tend to be his favorite.  So even though I had no pervious experience with Prairie Dog, I was excited to order these for my 22-pound Cockapoo.True to my expectations, he loves these.  A single piece of jerky is a little large for him to manage on his own, but thankfully these are easier to break into smaller pieces more appropriate for small and medium size dogs.  He's very excited to be offered these and wolfs them down quickly.  He seems to find them very palatable and also easy to eat (the latter is rarely a concern, but sometimes the more cookie like treats are hard to break up unless I use a knife and if they are too big, he seems to struggle to eat them).I like that the smell isn't unpleasant and pungent like some dog treats and that they aren't extremely crumbly.  The latter is selfishly a nice feature for me because it means I don't find crumbs of treats everywhere and don't mind if he eats them on the rug and other places where I would prefer dog treat crumbs don't get left behind.I thought these were great treats and would definitely by them again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IDBYUAG1PEBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WSSLAP6#wasThisHelpful","R1IDBYUAG1PEBU","AHN86VFJIJ2JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHN86VFJIJ2JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had my eye on this faucet for awhile but hesitated because I worried installation might be more hassle than it's worth and that the faucet might not perform as expected (If you've ever had a bad experience with a sensor faucet in a public restroom you know my worry).  Accordingly, I did exhaustive research exploring many brands and types of faucets, but nothing else seemed to have the combination of esthetics and functionality I was looking for like this faucet so eventually even with all the worry I bought it anyway.I'm so glad I did.  First, the installation was nowhere near as bad as I expected.  It did require putting in an additional outlet, but it was an easy enough task for an intermediate DIY'er to take on.  This was installed at the same time as a new sink and garbage disposal and the rest of the installation was straight forward and without hiccups.  The directions were straight forward and easy to understand.And now that it is installed I absolutely love it.  The design of this faucet gave my kitchen a much needed upgrade.  I worried it might be too modern for the aesthetics of my condo, which are more transitional, but I was wrong.  It blends in perfectly and looks and feels high end.  I especially love that the pull out portion of the faucet is stainless steel since so many I was encountering were plastic with a faux stainless finish and looked cheap.  (Not to mention my old faucet was this way and the finish flaked off over time and looked worn.)The touchless feature also works flawlessly.  I was worried there might be false triggers, but so far the sensor seems to be ideally located so that doesn't happen.  I also wasn't sure if I would actually use the touchless feature but I find myself taking advantage of it several times a day.  I love it when I'm cooking and have messy hands that I need to watch and I also find it helpful when I'm washing dishes because I can more easily turn the water off between rinsing individual pieces so I waste less.  It's also handy when I fill a big pot with water and need to turn the water off when my hands are full.  I expected to use it when my hands were dirty, but hadn't imagined the other scenarios so I'm happy about the other ways I am finding this to be helpful.Beyond the functionality of the sensor, I like a lot of other aspects of this faucet.  The water pressure both during normal mode and when using the sprayer are perfect.  The sprayer pulls out smoothly.  I also haven't had any issues with it leaking out of the base or any other component.Overall my only regret is that I waited so long to get this because now that it is installed I absolutely love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZD57K2Y33LDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B2N0VTY#wasThisHelpful","R1ZD57K2Y33LDX","AHN86VFJIJ2JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHN86VFJIJ2JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was curious to try this because it's a new brand for me.  It's worth noting that this doesn't seem to be related to PHYTO the haircare line, they seem to be completely unrelated brands as far as I can tell.  The deferentiating characteristic of this product vs. other exfoliating products seems to be that it is made from largely natural ingredients, a huge plus for those who prefer natural skincare in general or those specifically seeking to avoid microbeads.I applied it after washing my face and massaged it into my skin for a couple of minutes.  It has a more natural, light cinnamon smell to it.  This was a welcome surprise compared to other products that can be pungent smelling or heavily perfumed.  The texture is very creamy.  It has small particles in it to help exfoliate your face but they feel less abrasive than other face exfoliators I've tried.  It does a good job of sloughing off dead skin without irritating my skin.  I find this to be a little more gentle than Laura Mercier Face Polish and much more gentle than Kate Somerville ExfoliKate.The results are also great.  It leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth and looking healthy.  That said, I'm not sure I saw or felt a huge difference in my skin vs. other exfoliating products.  I've used many and they all seem to generate similar results, at least when comparing department store and boutique brands.  I do think you will definitely notice a difference if you haven't previously been exfoliating but I'm not sure this provides noticeably different results than other exfoliants.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33WR8RYFPULR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WB85WKW#wasThisHelpful","R33WR8RYFPULR7","AHN86VFJIJ2JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHN86VFJIJ2JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I resisted picking up this book for a long time because I don't identify as a religious person and as such, find a lot of books that reference God in the title to be (understandably) not really meant for someone like me.  However, I was struggling with the kind of food issues this book focuses on and having seen the book referenced in many other books and sites related to disordered eating I decided to pick it up from the library.  I figured if worst came to worst I could put it down midway through and return it to the library, without being out a cent.  Thankfully, my worries were unfounded and I got so much value out of the whole book.I think the author might be limiting her audience by calling out God so strongly in the title (and frankly disappointing those who expect a religiously-based text).  Her definition of god is so broad and her references to god so few and far between that I would never have noticed them had the title not called them out.  To me this is really less of a religiously-guided approach to food as it is about cultivating a healthier relationship with food.  That focus is what made this book so inspiring to me.  So many books focus on what we're supposed to be eating, not why we might have our current habits or the complex emotional context that often comes into play.  It's a big reason for me why so many diets seem overly simplistic and why it is so easy to fail and relapse into bad behaviors long term.  A lot of it reads like therapy-speak so I can see why to some people it might seem hokey, but I do think if you're willing to be open minded and do some introspection it can be really, really helpful.  I also think that some of the lessons seem deceptively obvious or straightforward, but can still be illuminating or challenging to put into practice.The only thing I didn't really care for is that the narrative structure of the book heavily references Roth's time leading therapy sessions and I found this became a bit boring and repetitive over time.  However, because Roth has such an approachable and nonjudgmental (though still challenging) way of presenting information, I was willing to deal with this.Overall I think this is an excellent read for anyone who is struggling to implement healthier habits and who has an inkling there is more to it than just knowing what to eat or how to move one's body.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R355LS0XXJF310/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1416543082#wasThisHelpful","R355LS0XXJF310","AHN86VFJIJ2JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHN86VFJIJ2JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been considering going back to grad school but have been very nervous about the quant portion of the GMAT exam since my career uses little more than basic statistic skills and math has never been my strong suit (my last math class was Calculus for Social Science majors in college and I haven't taken an additional class since).This book makes it abundantly clear upfront that it is not for everyone (or at least, as it qualifies, it's not meant for everyone right away).  It's really designed for someone who got a raw score of at least 47 on the quant section of either the Manhattan Prep or the GMATPrep practice CATs, for those who have already worked through the five math-focused Manhattan Prep Strategy guides, or those who are already comfortable with the core principles of these topics.  If these don't apply to you, you're better off starting with a more general guide and then going here for additional practice to get a higher score.  At least based on my background, I found these recommendations to be pretty accurate.  Perhaps if I had a stronger math background I could have jumped into this book right away, but at least for me it required more general math test prep first.The goal of the book is to prepare test takers for the most challenging math problems on the GMAT, which they define as being problems that have topical nuances or obscure principles, or those that have complex structures.  Given this focus it makes sense why the book requires you to start with a foundation of knowledge before working up to these type of problems.  Make no mistake, these problems are hard, at least for someone with my background.  But I did appreciate that the book does a good job of breaking problems down and making them as easy to understand as possible.  Given the kind of material they are dealing with, I'm not sure they could make it more straight forward or easier to understand than they do.  I also like that they really are teaching you to solve the problems, not giving you cheats or shortcuts.  If that is what you are looking for you will likely be disappointed as this book expects you to put in the hard work to figure out how to solve these kind of problems successfully.Other than the book itself, I like that this gives you access to online resources for a year (after you register) including six full length practice exas GMAT advanced quant question banks, and five free interact lessons.  This seems to be pretty par for the course these days and frankly, I'm surprised when any text book or prep book doesn't come with online features to reinforce learning, but it's still appreciated.Overall, I like this book for learning how to solve the more advanced quant questions on the GMAT.  It's definitely meant for a very specific audience and will disappoint those who expect to jump into it with no previous GMAT prep background, but it does what it sets out to do well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RPY2AWWQNCVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941234356#wasThisHelpful","R3RPY2AWWQNCVJ","AHN86VFJIJ2JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHN86VFJIJ2JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am very prone to hand dryness so these days I'm rarely without a tube of hand cream in my purse.  Currently Caudalie's Hand and Nail Cream has been my favorite so I was curious to see how this would compare.  As described, this tube is the perfect size for an everyday purse or hand bag or for traveling.  When I first applied this, I wasn't sure I liked it as it initially felt greasier than my Caudalie hand cream and I worried it would leave my fingers slippery.  My fears, however, were unfounded as this really does absorb quickly and makes skin feel soft and hydrated without leaving much, if any residue behind.  It's a great choice if you want to be able to quickly put on hand cream and go about your day.  In my case that meant take a bar workout class and I had no problems with my finger sliding on the bar or the weights.  I also appreciate that the hydration lasts.  Sometimes when I apply drugstore hand creams it feels like I need to constantly reapply because my hands start feeling dry again quite quickly, but with this I seem to be able to go a couple hours before I need to apply again.The one thing I did not care for at all was the smell.  To be far, I'm quite picky about fragrances and tend to either love or hate something with little in-between.  Unfortunately the scent here is a dislike for me.  It strikes me as very floral and for some reason with every sniff of it, it reminded me of old lady perfume.  Because I like the benefits it's something I'm able to get over, but comparatively Caudalie's nail and hand cream smells better to me (even though I find the scent of some of their products to be unbearable or noxious, that particular one by Caudalie is fine by me).  The hard thing with scents is it is, of course, a matter of taste and what is unappealing to someone can be a signature scent for another.  If you're like me and picky about scent it's probably worth seeing if you can try this out somewhere before you buy to see whether it's for you.Overall though I'm really impressed with the feel and benefits of this hand cream.  If you don't mind the smell, it's an effective choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T4GZB7SENTFR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052OUDLU#wasThisHelpful","R2T4GZB7SENTFR","AHN86VFJIJ2JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHN86VFJIJ2JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my third Blu-Ray Disk Player and the second one I own from Panasonic (I also own the LG BP620 3D Blu-Ray Player with Built-In Wi-Fi - Black and Panasonic DMP-BDT230 Smart Wi-Fi 3D Blu-Ray Player (2013 Model)).  Both of those Blu-Ray players, as well as this one, for context, have been and are being used with LG Smart TV's.  Having gotten previous Blu-Ray Players in 2012 and 2013 it's pretty evident that these players have gotten smaller and more affordable over time which is great for anyone just entering the market or anyone who wants to get the player for a bedroom or other space in the house.Having had really great experiences with my Panasonic DMP-BDT230 Smart Wi-Fi 3D Blu-Ray Player I had high in-going expectations for this player and it delivers.  The interface is really easy to navigate and as others have said, playing Blu-Ray discs and DVDs is really only part of the experience, you can also get access to online video content through services like Amazon prime video and Netflix.  We found connecting to and navigating through these services to be just as intuitive and reliable as our experiences with other Blu-Ray players as well as our experience accessing the content through our Playstation.  I also appreciate that overall this Blu-Ray player runs very reliably.  We don't have issues with it dropping the network connection or freezing or skipping when playing Blu-Ray discs or DVDs, which I appreciate.  I also expect the longevity to be good since I've had zero problems with my Panasonic DMP-BD93 Smart Network Blu-Ray Disc Player in the two years I've had it.Really the only thing missing here is 3D, but I have to say, I don't miss it.  I got it with my previous TVs and Blu-Ray players just in case I wanted it, but it's a feature that in the 3 years since I got my first 3D smart TV I've never really used.  I played with it in the beginning to impress friends, but since then it's just not something I use.  If you have children or love the 3D experience you might feel differently, but I don't find I need it.Overall, I'm impressed with this Blu-Ray player.

"I live in a remote rural area and although it's not a high crime area, I am away from home often. The ability to watch over the internet what's going on outside my home is reassuring. (To be honest though, so far what I have seen is mostly deer, wild turkeys and one black bear, who seem to sense when no one is home and sniff around the house!) The Q-See company has brought down the price of multi camera security systems to a level the average homeowner can afford. Although some of their systems are commercial and cost thousands, I have a four camera Q-See which was only about $500 including a disk drive to record surveillance.This dome camera is an upgrade or alternative to a basic camera. It is a very wide angle camera, plus a bank of near infrared LED light sources which illuminate a large area outdoors. This infrared light is visible to the sensors but not to the human eye, so individuals (or deer) being surveilled are not aware they are lit up. Also it records very high res images, 2688 x 1520. It's basically a plug in replacement for one of the simpler cameras that came with my system.It works. The high res wide angle outdoor night scenes lit up by infrared are very striking and detailed and there is not much going on out there that you will not see. They claim the IR works to a distance of 80 feet but I actually get pretty good pictures farther than that.

"I gave this to my girlfriend to test; she is concerned her skin is ageing. (Actually, she is a beauty.) Her report:Skincare companies are always telling us ""what dermatologists recommend."" I've asked and what they really seem to recommend, to protect skin from aging, is to stay out of the sun! That's the main thing. The primary ingredient here is a solid coverage sunscreen which is likely to be protective if used consistently every day. Sunscreens generally have two drawbacks though; they are dense and don't smell very good - the actual block agents can't be made without a certain smell of their own. L'Oreal has done a good job here of submerging the native sunblock scent - it is certainly more pleasant than Banana Boat. Finally this is in a base of quality creme which presents a moisture barrier and actually does not easily dissolve in water. I think L'Oreal has done a good job here on getting the functionality within something pleasant to use.This is a good formulation if one understands it is not a cosmetic but a medically correct sunblock to be protective of the real threats to sensitive skin.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VA2KYBODL878/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01648QGU4#wasThisHelpful","R2VA2KYBODL878","ADKZOXAOV8EXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADKZOXAOV8EXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Most householders would not normally buy these but it's a good idea to consider - the price is about the same as the lowest quantity price for basic paper towels but the paper is much more substantial.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FNDONGAE37CK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00375LQJ4#wasThisHelpful","R3FNDONGAE37CK","ADKZOXAOV8EXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADKZOXAOV8EXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Olympus along with Sony have pretty much cornered the market on small voice recorders. One problem is they put out so many models - more than 20 from Olympus - it is hard to know which to choose. I keep a voice recorder in my truck, an Olympus DP-311, to take notes as I drive. To use it safely it must be easy to read and ideally have its own light source in the display. Another problem - too complicated. I chose the DP-311 because it's simpler than others, and has larger buttons -- Olympus says this model is for ""elderly"" users, thanks. To compare this new WS-853, I used a new setting called ""Simple Mode"" which means the more specialized settings are suppressed to give just basic recording functions, and also the font on the display is larger and easier to read. I suspect that Olympus included this ""Simple Mode"" because of complaints from customers like me that their recorders had become too tricky.Neither recorder is instantly on; if they have been off for awhile, it's necessary to press (any) button to wake them up before they can record. This is annoying, but the startup time of the 853 is noticeably quicker than the 311. It also has distinctly better sound, and stereo, although this is more significant for recording meetings than in the front seat of my truck.The big new wrinkle of the 853 is computer-friendliness. Whereas the 311 can only be played back by actually listening and scribbling notes, the 853 has a USB connector on the top and when plugged into my Mac, comes up as a folder full of sound files without the need to do anything special. It is only necessary to click on these and the computer plays back the memos, very handy and easily saved as sound files with no need to transcribe. (It seems it may also possible to use voice recognition software to actually transcribe the memos, but I haven't figured out how to do that yet.) Also the batteries are rechargeable and charge while it's plugged in.Although the 311 has a larger display and is easier to read and use at night, the 853 is more sophisticated and higher in sound quality. It is better suited for recording of meetings, and definitely convenient if you work with a computer all day. Not expensive either. Recommended. Five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S69IRBOW498Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014658DHQ#wasThisHelpful","R2S69IRBOW498Z","ADKZOXAOV8EXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADKZOXAOV8EXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Burberry Weekend is a classic women's scent on the market since 1997. It was formulated for Burberry by Nathalie Lorson, a well known perfumer who has created more than 70 formulations for various brands. Burberry is an old line British firm and on the conservative side, and this is a traditional fragrance, not too exotic or otherworldly. ""Weekend"" is not for teenagers either; it's a scent for a grown woman, perhaps a professional woman. It is a fresh scent and can be worn every day, with a bit of tangerine on top, wild rose in the middle and a layer of musk and sandalwood on the bottom. It's sexy in a digified way.I gave this to a woman friend and she loves it. Not cheap but a classic and a safe bet as a gift.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMN97PWSY4YDK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BOJGITI#wasThisHelpful","RMN97PWSY4YDK","ADKZOXAOV8EXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADKZOXAOV8EXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are very inexpensive steak knives but I actually don't use them that way: I keep eight in a box for everyday use in food prep, then throw them in the dishwasher.

But these are as much Stainless Steel as I am Arnold Schwarzenegger. The blades spot with rust immediately coming from the dishwasher. Blatantly false advertising.Second, they can't be sharpened, certainly not at home. The edge shape is a complex curve formed by some machine or laser manufacturing process.

"This worked much better than I had expected. The wireless in my house is only useful a few feet into the yard. There is another building, a workshop, 150' from the house, without any internet or telephone access. So I set this up, first in the house to be sure it worked, then moved to the workshop. Amazingly, it worked! This appears to be the maximum extreme range however, as the light on the unit was mostly pink and not green. But it did connect. (I actually have two wireless routers in the house, one 5 GHz band the other 2.4 GHz band. It worked better with the former network.)At the fringes of the range, it does slow the connection down. My normal download speed in the house is 8 Mbps. Using the Linksys by plugging an ethernet cable into the box and into my MacBook, it slowed to 3.4 Mbps. If I used the secondary wireless instead of the ethernet cable, slowed further to 2 Mbps. But certainly better than nothing!I'm impressed!

First, the construction: they can be folded up into a fairly compact shape, the brushed metal looks fierce, and they also pivot side to side so they fit perfectly over the ear.

"Down the line of an all-in-one survival knife, the Chaos Ready has some good things going for it.  I like the weight and balance of the knife, which is pretty good given that the handle has a few extras tucked into it.  It sits well in the hand, and the blade is a solid lock blade which is easy (but not too easy) to disengage.  The blade was delivered fairly sharp (but I always sharpen my knives after delivery), and the design is good: it has some serrations at the thickest part of the blade and the backside has a bottle/can opener.  The handle has a metal prong at the end (glass breaker) and a seat belt cutter too.The included flashlight is very, very small.  When I removed the cardboard, the light that it emitted was not exactly bright either.  But, after taking the batteries out of the sleeve and re stacking an inserting them, the flashlight worked and it was quite bright for such a small light.  As for the fire starter I had difficulty getting it to work, but my guess is that I had to scrape down a bit to get it to spark.I like the knife, and though I would not use it as a backpacking/camping knife, it will be a great tool to add to my office emergency bag since, given the extras in it seem to be a bit more useful in an urban environment.In all, an interesting knife, which I received for a straightforward review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HE13HUOQN4GC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011FR5G1E#wasThisHelpful","R1HE13HUOQN4GC","A2Q3WSU5PS2MZO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q3WSU5PS2MZO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Also, it can be used with a plugin power source AND can be plugged into a battery pack, making it awesomely portable.The picture quality is pretty good, if you have your expectations realistic given this is not a $300 projector.  We shone it up on the ceiling, and it made a pretty good picture at a size of about 6 feet (see pictures).

"The U.S. Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), the U.S. military's most elite fighting force, combining the Army's Delta Force, the Navy's SEAL Team 6, and various Army and Air Force special mission helicopter and aircraft squadrons is unearthed in this fascinating book.  Many of their operations have been documented over time, but the their missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Syria and other places are still secret.This book unearths the history in all of its good, bad, and ugly glory.  Apparently, there is a bit of controversy as to whether the material contained within is or should be classified, but Naylor gets around the highly classified nature of many of these missions by using  available primary and official sources with interviews from soldiers who have written their own books.The book is very readable and feels like it is part fiction and part military history which keeps the reader engaged, but does not hold back on being sure to analyze the some of the darker moments of this elite force.  There is simply too much ground to cover in this review, but the story is exhaustive on detailing the whole evolution of this organization including its controversial missions in the 1980s and 1990s in Central and South America, the invasions of Grenada and Panama.The timeliness of the book is good particularly given the increasing role of special ops during this time.  On the whole, this is one of the must-read military history books of the year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CX5GMMJ22JZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250014549#wasThisHelpful","R2CX5GMMJ22JZN","A2Q3WSU5PS2MZO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q3WSU5PS2MZO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Raqpak Reflective Cord, as others have mentioned, is on par with a 550 Paracord about 4mm thick.  Works great for just about any paracord use, from guylines, tents, lashing things to backpacks, and laundry lines.  I especially like it for laundry lines, since as anyone who has walked around a campsite at night may know, running into a line at night can be treacherous.  With the little reflective flecks in the casing, the line reflects just enough in a headlamp to make it noticeable that you do not end up running into it.  This makes it also a great application for fly tie downs (tripping over those is a specialty of mine).  Would note that I'm not sure why I would get the green rope again, since it can be hard to see in the day compared to a bright color which would be more visible in the daytime.On the whole, a good rope which will be put to good use, which I received as a free sample for a direct and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA0A4LY0QTDSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010EJ528G#wasThisHelpful","RA0A4LY0QTDSP","A2Q3WSU5PS2MZO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q3WSU5PS2MZO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those who remember Ali from In Living Color, we already know her as a brilliant comedienne.  As a writer, I have to say that her wit was new to me.  This book was simply absurdly funny.

This books is focused on her anxieties and misgivings that seize her as she faces as she approaches her 50th birthday.  Her method of trying to reinvent herself and the sometimes unfortunate remedies she resorts to in trying to overcome them lead from one funny story to the next.

I would note that the heads on these brushes are the standard oral-b heads which mean they might be a tiny bit large for the 6 and under crowd, particularly in the gum line.

"Kids are always fascinated about treasures.  This book is a great companion book to have for any California road trip as it covers 313 different legends of lost treasures, hidden mines, and even sunken treasure ships.  Each site is described in a fairly succinct paragraph which is sufficient detail to maybe get the kids dreaming about a treasure site, but the book does not provide much detail such that someone could begin any treasure hunt in earnest.  That said, the book even notes that this is not the point of the book, rather, it is meant as an overview of some of the bigger treasure legends in California.  The book also comes with a fold out map which maps out the various locations of these legends, and has a very short section on hazards of exploring in the back.

"Harlan Coben is one of the best mystery and suspense writers in the business so there are always high expectations which come with his books.  For the most part, Coben does not disappoint with his latest book,The Stranger, an addictive mystery novel driven by great characters.The Stranger is a mystery set around a seemingly happy and mundane family Adam and wife, Corinne, and their two sons Ryan and Thomas who live in a nice suburban neighborhood in New Jersey. But, upon meeting a stranger at an American Legion Hall, Adam's life starts to unwind with a slow burning paranoia. The Stranger is a normal looking guy who knows things about Adam's wife and family. He knows things about his wife that a stranger should not.  With each piece of information, Adam is thrown deeper and deeper into doubt and disbelief about his own reality.In classic Coben style we have elements of mystery, strong characters, and relevant and current themes as here where the book relates to the prevalence of information in the internet age.  The stories herein have a strong edge to them as they feel like situations which could actually be occurring and are realistically drawn as they begin in the normal and mundane world and then take a hard left into intrigue.  However, The Stranger is a bit different than Coben's other books, and though it has classic twists, turns, suspense, and wit, the book tends to slow down in the middle as its flips between characters and the confusion that has ensued because of mysterious stranger.  The book also has parts which are not particularly believable and downright strange.  That said, the whole the story heads to a classic Coben stunning conclusion, which makes up for the pacing issues.On the whole, though not at his best, Coben fans will probably like the book.  Any general mystery reader will enjoy it too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X2HOABQRBYV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SC1LOQS#wasThisHelpful","R1X2HOABQRBYV5","A2Q3WSU5PS2MZO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q3WSU5PS2MZO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are so many issues with this book, it is difficult to even know where to start.  As with all ""do this and you will make tons of money"" books, the first thing to look at are the assumptions and assumed projections, which are usually how authors manage to get to their ""amazing"" returns.  Lichtenfeld suggests that investors need to focus on just three things: initial yield, dividend growth rate, and payout ratio. There is nothing about assessing the quality of the underlying business and the book does not touch on valuation of the businesses.  For starters, there are no guarantees that a company paying a big dividend will continue to do so, particularly in down markets.Tellingly, the author presents some historical data showing how well dividend stocks have done in the past and guesses where they will go in the future, but then provides no proof that his system can produce the results he claims in actual practice. Even in his ""Perpetual Income Portfolio"" he does not report its long-term returns nor the stocks in it.There certainly is a spot in a portfolio for high dividend stock, but as anyone knows by now, there is no ""surefire"" way to have double digit returns.  Blue chips, high dividend, emerging markets, small cap stocks, they all sound great until they are not. Also, note there are much better books far better books on dividend growth investing out there like The Dividend Toolkit by Matt Alden and The Single Best Investment by Lowell Miller.So, dividend stocks may be a good part of a portfolio, but this book misses on a lot of critical issues.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK5FEV3Y9IIJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118994132#wasThisHelpful","RK5FEV3Y9IIJT","A2Q3WSU5PS2MZO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q3WSU5PS2MZO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In Dead Wake, as in past books, Larson touches on the surreal and unlikely intersections that often arise in some of the biggest turning points in history. Larson's narrative story centers on the RMS Lusitania, a British ocean liner whose sinking by a German submarine provided Britain with a propaganda opportunity and shifted public opinion in the United States against Germany, which played a part in influencing America's eventual declaration of war.Larson's book narrates the story from divergent perspectives, including those of U-boot-20 and its captain Walther Schwieger, the crew and passengers aboard the luxury transatlantic liner the Lusitania, and the political buildup to World War I. A work of narrative nonfiction, it draws from historical records, letters, and journal entries to tell the story all during a time when Germany, France, and England were are already locked in combat while America remained neutral.  The continuing tension between the naivete of the passengers of the luxury liner, the pacifism of the Americans who underestimated the German threat, the failures of British intelligence, and the patient stalking of the U-boat build throughout Larson's book, make for a compelling story.That said, this book does not quite live up to the greatness of In the Garden of Beasts and Devil in the White City, which both felt more like the author unearthed a story that had not yet been explored.  The Lusitania story is one that has been much discussed in the past, and thus the book misses the fresh feel of those other ones.Anyone with a casual interest in history will likely enjoy this book, but those who hold Larson to the high standards of his prior works may not be quite as impressed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38PGN5X311BYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307408868#wasThisHelpful","R38PGN5X311BYL","A2Q3WSU5PS2MZO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q3WSU5PS2MZO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dream With Me Now of a Dinosaur Dash is a cute nighttime book for any young dinosaur loving kid.

"These earbuds make a great first impression: the braided line looks very refined comared to the normal slick nylon lines, the wood on the bud look sophisticated, and the general design of the wood, chrome, and black looks good together.  The packaging is also fun with great graphics and nice presentation.  In all, first impressions are that they look more expensive than their price, and would make a nice looking gift.I tested the out in comparison to a pair of older apple earbuds, and listened to everything from havey base old school rap, jazz, classical and pop tunes.  The mid and highs on the buds are good, but I found the base and fullness of sound to be fine but not as good as the apple buds.  They sit comfortably in the ear, and, unlike apple earbuds, are certainly highly noise isolating.  I did notice that because of the tight isolation, any abrasion to the braided chord would sound transmitted to my ears, which would mildly interfere with the sound.On the whole, awesome first impression, and ok performance.  For the price, they look nicer than they cost, and their performance is probably on par with price point.I received these for an unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DR7933JLNX3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K35XI88#wasThisHelpful","R2DR7933JLNX3S","A2Q3WSU5PS2MZO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q3WSU5PS2MZO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fun, inexpensive bath toy that is supposed to serve a double purpose of testing the bath water temp. The problem is, the duck thinks almost all water is too hot, even if it is Luke warm. So, if you're looking for a true gauge of safety, I wouldn't rely on this. I use a good quality instant read thermometer to test water temp. However, I do love that it doesn't have any air holes and therefore doesn't fill up with water (that is hard to get our and gets stinky over long term).

"No more fear of using a slicer, grater or knives! I just received these to begin drying apples. The apples needed slicing on a mandolin slicer as well as to be peeled. With my new gloves on, I deliberately slid my finger across the grader - not even a pick in the glove. I was impressed. Also, no issues whatsoever with using the slicer. I am thankful for having these, only wish I would have had them years ago, would have saved me lots of pain! easy to clean I just leave them on and put dish soap on them and wash them like your washing your hands rinse and hang them to dry.

"I absolutely love this tablet!! I was in the market for buying the note 10.1 2014 edition but when I found out about the note pro 12.2, I knew that the additional screen size would come in more handy for note taking for school, internet browsing, media consumption, etc. The added multitasking features such as having four apps opened at the same time come in very handy when doing research, jotting down notes, and writing a word document all at the same time! A lot of people are saying that it is too big, but I have not had an issue with that at all and you come to get used to it quite fast. The Hancom office suite that comes with the tablet is the closest to microsoft office that I have ever seen on any mobile platform and simply better than any app out there that I have seen so far, for those interested on having a similar experience as the microsoft office apps. The Spen features come in very handy for note taking, drawing, cutting and pasting pictures or objects onto some other documebts or apps. Knowing that it uses wacom software technology, this allows the spen to have pressure sensitivity on the tablet which straight out beats and puts to shame any ordinary stylus out there. Ever since getting this tablet mainly for use at college, I have never once pulled out a paper and pencil since I now do it all on the note pro, thus possibly saving me money on buying paper and pencils/pens while also giving me a better experience than I can get out of paper and pencil. The note pro 12.2 is simply a beast of a device as I have not had any issues at all with the software because it has 3gb of ram so it allows multiple apps to run at once without slowing down the device nor causing any hiccups or freezing. No other device can stand up to this note pro 12.2, the kindles and ipads have nothing on this device. Im not here to rip on any of those two devices, im simply just stating what is true because none of those two allow you to do as much as the note pro 12.2 allows you to do. I know this device is not cheap, but it is worth every dollar if you are looking for a very capable device for work/school with lots of power and multitasking features.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAQI3TO8L7S2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWMPROS#wasThisHelpful","RAQI3TO8L7S2T","AB094YABX21WQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB094YABX21WQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Even after seeing some less than positive reviews of this product on Amazon I ordered this case anyway. Having purchased Case Logic in the past, and having never been disappointed, it seemed a good bet. And the bet paid off. Great case, well constructed and allows for additional pages to be added, to a reasonable limit of course. The zipper is admittedly not super heavy duty and would not not likely stand up to overly aggressive use. Despite this single hypothetical flaw, Case Logic has always been a reliable brand, and based upon my impression of this purchase I have no reason to change that opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVIPDNKYR7KFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005ATMB#wasThisHelpful","RVIPDNKYR7KFY","AB094YABX21WQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB094YABX21WQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have always known the movie 'Deliverance' because of the dueling banjos tune and that is why I finally wanted to see this movie. Turns out that this is one of the best movies I have seen in a long long time.It is the story of four Atlanta businessmen on a rafting trip. While on the river they encounter some 'crackers'. One of the four gets raped and the other almost before one of the businessmen (someone who does not believe in law) kills the attacker with an arrow. Because the whole valley will be flooded soon they decide to leave the body there and tell no one. The one with a heavy heart falls overboard however.What is right? What is wrong? are questions asked in this movie and no one is sure. The movie is very disturbing, a strange look into the human mind and human society and also that part of the world where civilization as we know it does not exist.The duelling banjos are fun, but the movie is really good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SE4IMCX6ARPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0091W5Q7K#wasThisHelpful","R2SE4IMCX6ARPZ","AB094YABX21WQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB094YABX21WQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I’ve been using this vacuum flask bottle to take cold juice with me to work every day for the last three weeks. Though the bottle needs to sit in my truck for about five hours before I get my lunch break, my juice always tastes fresh-from-the-fridge cold and ready to drink. The flask’s screw-on top has an ergonomic design that makes removal easy, even with dirty or sweat-streaked hands. Cold water, hot coffee, or juice: ready for a desperately thirsty worker to drink.And it comes with a handy small insert that I couldn’t figure out at first. It sits inside the mouth of the bottle, holds about two teaspoons of something, and is perforated on the bottom. It took me a while to realize this is a tea infuser. Put hot or warm water into your bottle, slip the infuser with some loose leaf tea into the top so water comes through the perforations, and by lunchtime, your tea is ready to drink.

"Since I started working construction earlier this year, I've learned one absolute rule: keep your tools on your person. Not only do you not know what you need until you need it, but tools set aside have an annoying propensity to walk away. But jeans only have so many pockets. The easiest way to deal with that is to get yourself some added pockets that you can carry around with you. Like, say, this.This tool pouch is made of heavyweight leather, chain-stitched on the edges with what appears to by nylon thread. Many points through the center are reinforced with rivets, like classic Levi's. It has different sized pockets to hold a range of tools, everything from small narrow slip pockets for your pen or your tire gauge, to metal loops to catch your claw hammer, to long narrow pockets sized appropriately for standard pry bars, utility knives, and speed squares. I like having everything right there. And I like that, because this isn't a complete belt, I can place it wherever I want it, and know where to grab my tools.So far, I've had no complaints about this system. It has withstood use and abuse, and simplifies the requirements of my job. It's constructed solidly enough that I feel confident doing multiple job-related tasks under a range of conditions. I've read some other reviewers say this system *might* come apart under repeated use, but it's done me quite well so far. If you have to carry a range of tools, and grab them at a moment's notice, this system may take a great deal of pressure off an already complicated job situation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H7P5WCTBQPD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQE7ONQ#wasThisHelpful","R2H7P5WCTBQPD4","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew I was probably facing a difficult slog with this novel in Chapter One, one character took three pages to descend a staircase. Not because she was slow-moving, or descending from the highest tower, but because author Staub kept intruding long expository recollections between steps. That set the tone for this entire novel: it’s difficult to make even incremental progress, because even minor actions trigger rambling recollections.In today’s networked age, local actions have potentially global circumstances. Meredith Heywood is the unofficial mother hen of a blogger’s circle, comprised entirely of breast cancer patients and survivors. These women have built a transnational friendship, without bothering to meet, or in some cases to learn one another’s real names. So Meredith’s death prompts their first-ever meeting, at her funeral. Too bad Meredith was actually murdered.Staub crafts a massive ensemble for a modernized, tech-friendly rendition of a classic Agatha Christie locked-room mystery. At its heart, the women bloggers have deep connections which they’ve shared only online. They believe they know one another intensely, but with passing scenes, it transpires that each keeps deep secrets they don’t divulge digitally. One of these friends has mysterious motives. And now they’re all in danger.But upon this intriguing premise, Staub has layered countless, disjointed internal monologues. Every character has a backstory, expounded interminably, whether they advance the story or not. The cast of thousands each get their own moments, to the detriment of pacing. Single conversations challenge readers’ patience, because between successive exchanges, Staub inserts Proustian recollections, sometimes pages long. The promised mystery never quite begins, because these recollections never quite cease.I wanted to enjoy this book, but Staub wouldn’t let me. In today’s media-saturated age, authors realistically get about thirty pages to engage readers’ attention in books this long; but well past page 100, Staub still indulges in chugging expository scene-setting. The narrow thematic focus prevents this being a Jane Austen-ish character novel, but Staub’s interminable narration doesn’t let it be a mystery. I tried, but I just got bored.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VNYH8AZBKJ7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062222406#wasThisHelpful","R3VNYH8AZBKJ7R","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Because I work construction, which often involves close detail work in confined spaces where built-in lights haven’t been installed, having a flashlight is frequently very important—all the more so as winter rolls in and we board up windows that haven’t been glassed in. This pocket-sized flashlight provides illumination for diverse tasks in less-than-ideal circumstances. I’ve only had it about a week, and I’ve already gotten enough use from it to justify the (admittedly modest) price.It has multiple brightness settings, making it ideal for a range of tasks: sometimes you need only a dim glow, just enough light to line up screws and drive them in securely. Other times you need light bright enough to read instructions and perform kludge repairs on power tools. And sometimes—probably more in the car than at work—you need a flashing strobe that will get people’s attention and let passers-by know you require immediate assistance. This one does all of that.It’s not perfect. Though it advertises that a simple tug turns it into a camp lantern, even at full brightness the lantern function isn’t very bright. The single LED light source, which shines pretty well when it’s focused into a narrow cone, becomes diffuse enough when spread out to be functionally useless. Though someone might use the lantern function to avoid being trapped in pitch blackness during a power outage, it’s not bright enough to do camp functions like cook or build a fire.Therefore I must conclude that this light, though useful for most circumstances where you’ll need a flashlight, is imperfect. Most people probably won’t notice the imperfections in most practical circumstances. When you need a flashlight, you usually need a tight beam, which this energy-efficient beauty provides. So if you’re seeking a cheap, long-lived beam flashlight, consider this one. Just don’t expect the lantern to do you much good in camp conditions.The manufacturer offered me a sample of this product, at their own expense, in return for an honest review.

"Francis Bacon has grown bored and lovelorn in London. No, not that Francis Bacon, the other one: the Anglo-Irish figurative painter whose tortured, distorted human forms revolutionized postwar British art. So he follows his paramour and sometime torturer David to colonial Morocco, a paradise of anonymous sex and late imperial exoticism. Once in Tangier, however, he finds a warren of crime, including a mysterious murder tied to local art forgery.Though this is American novelist Janice Law’s third, and reputedly final, “Francis Bacon Mystery,” the book itself is functionally freestanding. It doesn’t require any particular familiarity with prior novels, or Francis Bacon, or art generally, to grasp Law’s narrative of cruel romance, venal empire, and postwar chicanery. Though marketed as a mystery, Law essentially crafts a tale of character and circumstance, which just coincidentally involves fraud and murder.Bacon simply wants to drink copiously and romance as many Moroccan “beach boys” as limited time and money allow. When one prominently flamboyant party host’s newly purchased Picasso proves forged, however, the local constable blackmails Francis into joining the investigation. Seems they have a blank warrant for David’s arrest, which they’ll sign if he doesn’t comply. Thus Francis becomes an unwilling, but entirely too proficient, art counterfeiter.When it appears everybody lies about this deeply conflicted case, nobody appears particularly surprised, except perhaps Francis himself. The police have political motivations that don’t involve aestheticism or intellectual property. The party host proves remarkably duplicitous when the spotlight shines elsewhere. When Francis finds himself stalked by a suspiciously James Bond-like agent of the British Legation, he realizes he’s stumbled into a case with truly international implications.Tangier, in Law’s telling, has a familiar yet discordant ring. As a colonial capital, it catches every expatriate the European homeland doesn’t want to see. But unlike Bogart’s Casablanca, this African melting pot doesn’t catch diverse wartime refugees fleeing Naziism and generalized homeland oppression; Tangier caters specifically to sexual outcasts, the bon vivants and sybarites forced into exile from Continental homes where homosexuality remains wholly illegal.David, the man who induced Bacon’s newfound expat status, is the consummate charming abuser. A masterful musician and storyteller when sober, a raconteur of wartime extravagance, his fondness for gin transforms him into a knife-wielding psychopath. Francis admits his fondness for “rough trade,” but also opens his narrative by fleeing into a hog barn overnight to avoid David’s homicidal wrath. The romance apparently flees rough trade pretty quickly.Yet Francis remains steadfastly willing to defend David, whose distant but amorous attentions combine mentor, lover, and big brother in equal, and equally terrifying, measures. The fact that neither Francis nor David remains particularly faithful reflects, not homosexuals’ innate moral corruption, but how pliable ethics become under circumstances of official oppression. As first-person narrator Francis explains, police often serve traumatic beat-downs to “beach boys” for sport.Readers selecting this book for gripping mystery may find this book awkwardly slow-moving compared to contemporary thrillers. Law doesn’t expend energy on creating complex mental puzzles, and though she does well in concealing her culprit, she doesn’t particularly care about red herrings and other familiar tropes. For Law’s money, historic Tangier and its milieu of Crumbled Empire decadence holds more interest. This is mainly a historical novel and costume drama.And what a historical novel. More literate critics than I have extolled Law’s scrupulous attention to detail. Where less meticulous authors have recently frustrated me for their willingness to compromise accuracy to create a better-selling paperback, Law creates a narrative for audiences who desire the more difficult journey. Like visiting a foreign land, one gets the feeling nothing here is sanitized for modern Anglo-American sentiments. Bacon’s Tangier is very dangerous.This painstaking accuracy sometimes results in moments that make modern readers distinctly uncomfortable. Watching the revolutionary independence movement evolve from their rooftop divans, Bacon and David are sometimes prone to observations we’d call racist. And although I balk at modern complaints about “cultural appropriation,” Bacon’s tendency to regard Moroccan culture as a profligate shopping trip uncomfortably reduces African culture to a shopping mall. As imperial conquerors often do.But these very uncomfortable moments contribute to the immediacy of Law’s narrative. As Bacon navigates Tangier’s difficult political byroads, we sympathize with him, while still realizing he’s a colonial monster. We want him to win, but not too much. Where suit-clad Bogart represented a pre-war antihero model, Bacon epitomizes postwar moral collapse. His narrative is immersive, and perilous. And we emerge wondering: how much am I like these colonial taskmasters?","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39UHJ3KOSOC2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497641497#wasThisHelpful","R39UHJ3KOSOC2V","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you’ve ever felt adrift in today’s technological world, helpless amid infinite options, unable to make meaningful decisions in buying or reading or even just watching five hundred TV channels, you’re not alone. UCLA behavioral economist Shlomo Benartzi has reliable scientific evidence demonstrating what perceptive people already know, that today’s online environment creates a panicked, lost-in-the-woods feeling in most people. Fortunately, wise engineering can reverse this paralyzing trend.From its earliest origins, pro-Web enthusiasm has gushed over the Internet’s capacity to provide users more information, more choices, and more autonomy. It’s been the classic capitalist assertion, that simply having more options available flushes bad choices away and consolidates good choices. But anyone who’s shopped for consumer electronics online recently knows that simply having more choices isn’t good enough. Without guidance, increased options generate snap judgments, haste, and paralysis.Benartzi himself has participated in new research demonstrating how screen users handle information overload. His conclusion, based on his own research and the published discoveries of his peers: human attention isn’t adapted for broad, undifferentiated knowledge dumps. (Anyone who’s read government reports recently knows this.) Wise information merchants going forward will need to make the digital screen conform to what Benartzi calls “the mental screen”—our attention capacity.“It's not that screens are making us more superficial,” Benartzi writes. “Rather, the world of screens merely makes it easier for us to act on those superficial first impressions.” We gravitate toward first options, self-indulgence, and whatever’s placed in the center of the screen. When people order food digitally, Benartzi says (with generous scholarly evidence), we’re more likely to pick unhealthy options. When we get doused with a firehose of buying options, we pick familiar images, not good choices.Too often, Benartzi and his sources claim, humans rely upon facile heuristics to comprehend digital resources. (Anyone who’s read Daniel Kahneman already knows this, but Benartzi proves how this applies specifically to screens.) We think better when we enjoy instant feedback… until we become overwhelmed. We think in purely present-tense terms, unless prompted. Simple design tweaks can transform not only our experiences, but our thinking about those experiences.Similar tweaks have the potential for abuse. Benartzi describes circumstances where unscrupulous operators have manipulated screen options to maximize unfair trades, and places where even worse abuse is possible. Some online vendors, for instance, have gotten caught spotlighting more expensive options on mobile devices than on computers, because apparently the smaller the screen, the smaller our attention to detail. Crooked vendors manipulate our impatience and forgetfulness for venal ends.This tendency has remarkable ramifications. As America enters an election season, unprecedented numbers of voters will garner political opinions from articles read online. This seems innocent, except we don’t read well off screens. Benartzi writes: “screens allow us to read more than ever before, but they also encourage us to read poorly, and to remember less of what we read.” Screens encourage casual, unengaged, incomplete reading… and thinking.Every fault Benartzi describes, though, has easy fixes. Some involve top-end design improvements. Counterintuitive as it seems, evidence demonstrates that we read better when confronted with clunky, inelegant typefaces. When confronted by endless buying choices (Amazon sells over 100,000 breakfast cereal varieties), categories help us prevent getting overwhelmed and numb. The disastrous Healthcare.gov rollout could’ve been salvaged with March Madness-style brackets.Benartzi also suggests end-user improvements, though these are less numerous. In giving feedback, for instance, actually sign your name; this prevents the Disinhibition Effect. Seek carefully for resources which encourage without criticizing and which have meaningful action plans. Allocate attention carefully: it’s impossible to actually read those bottomless “terms and conditions” we all click on, but when somebody asks you a real question, read the whole thing before answering.The answers aren’t always easy, and seldom one-size-fits-all. The problem with digital reading, for instance, has different solutions for different audiences. Younger readers will probably finish reading this review better on Amazon’s brightly colored, graphics-heavy layout, while my blog’s muted colors and text-driven format will attract older readers. Other problems have similarly nuanced solutions. My final takeaway from Benartzi’s explanation: effective design is more art than science.Late in this book, Benartzi states what could arguably be his thesis: “We don't want endless possibility. What we really crave is effective curation.” The Internet has become a vast repository of information, much of it exciting, some terrifying; and new information gets created or repackaged daily. Top-level providers who follow Benartzi’s guidelines will more likely earn users’ attention, today’s real economic prize.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20N3QOCQ7C0AA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591847869#wasThisHelpful","R20N3QOCQ7C0AA","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you need an inexpensive polo shirt to wear to the company picnic or a casual night out, this one might be a good place to start. It fits like a t-shirt, has a collar that stands up nicely, and pairs well with your choice of sport coat, jacket, flannel shirt, or other garment. (It’s thin enough that, if you wear it by itself, you’ll want an undershirt.) It lacks a breast pocket, so if you’re accustomed to carrying stuff right there, you may want to make sure you’re wearing trousers with a pen pocket, or something.

"Let’s not kid ourselves: in our society, we pass snap judgments on women for their bustlines, and men for their hairlines. It’s unfair, but that doesn’t make it any less real. I’ve been dismissed by women, mocked by men, and insulted by anonymous persons online for my vastly receding hairline. If I had a firm, butch halo like Ed Harris, that wouldn’t be any problem, but the patchy ghost of hair I have doesn’t reflect the smart, assertive guy I actually am.So when the manufacturer offered me a chance to sample and review this product at no obligation, I jumped at the chance. After taking the full thirty-day supply, I can say I’m glad I did. Though my widow’s peak and bald spot have not yet filled back in, I have baby-fine new hair growing into those spaces, while my existing halo is growing in thicker and darker—my few grays are actually getting color back in them. I’m not back to my hirsute twenties yet, but my hair does look better.This product works by blocking dihydrotestosterone, a more potent androgen than the common testosterone in male bodies. As with the high dose of female hormones used in hormonal birth control pills, DHT is an example of too much of a good thing: rather than doing what androgens ought to do, like putting hair on your chest and muscles on your arms, DHT actually overpowers and blocks these functions. And it causes certain forms of male pattern baldness.As the accompanying sequence of photos shows, after taking the full thirty-day regimen, I don’t have the full head I enjoyed as an undergraduate. This isn’t a miracle drug; like new hair growing on a baby’s head, it will take some time to fully revitalize all your follicles. However, the photos clearly show that, in just one month, my hair has already begun reversing the decline that I’ve suffered over the last decade. I’ve decided, having used up my sample supply, to buy more and make this part of my regular routine.The manufacturer offered me a sample supply of this supplement, at their own expense, in return for an honest review.

"Unless you’ve lived or worked in China since 2010, you’ve probably never encountered Earth’s third-largest mobile phone company, Xiaomi. The company, whose name translates as “Little Rice” in Chinese, currently dominates China’s mid-range smartphone market. Despite having no market presence in North America or Europe, Xiaomi’s global aspirations have flourished, and in five years, it has progressed from geek-oriented software startup to punching above its weight class.Clay Shirky, NYU professor and new media cheerleader, sees Xiaomi as emblematic, not of the mobile phone industry, but of China’s changing place in global technology leadership. China has a lengthy reputation as America’s favorite offshore dumping ground; Apple famously labels its products “Designed In California; Assembled In China.” But as Chinese manufacturers become increasingly comfortable with American designs, many have assumed the design role and created native products domestically.If you’ve experienced the existential dread of realizing you’ve forgotten your phone, you understand how important networked mobile technology has become. This goes double for poor countries. As rising technology puts mobile phones within mass customer reach, villagers in Africa and Asia who cannot afford laptops, cars, or books, nevertheless have global access with affordable phones. Networked mobile access puts poor, distant villagers on (theoretically) equal footing with everyone else.Shirky quotes technology maven Jan Chipchase that mobile phones have joined money and keys as the three things without which we cannot leave the house. This presents China unprecedented opportunity and unique obstacles. Mainland China remains among Earth’s last nominally Communist nations, though “Communist” now means more party control than economic principle. Mobile phones offer instant global access to information, but also permit instantaneous coordination, anathema to one-party states.Xiaomi straddles this complicated line. The corporation got its start pitching an open-source Android variant operating system, crowdsourcing critical design elements. This democratic hybrid business model remains central to Xiaomi’s success, even as they’ve transitioned into hardware development. But the corporation must tapdance between the Party’s twin mandates of unprecedented personal liberty, and absolute political autocracy. Xiaomi’s technology must permit everyone to do everything… except challenge the state.Chinese President Xi Jinping has recently pushed something he calls the Chinese Dream. Unlike Maoist slogans of expunging both ancient and Western influences, Xi’s vision has a distinctive monetary value. Like the American Dream, the Chinese Dream involves home ownership, wealth management, and upward mobility. However, it infuses distinct collectivist tenets into its language. Xi wants Chinese to become wealthy in ways that redound positively upon the state.China actively restricts domestic access to global Internet sources. Chinese citizens can access Amazon, Gmail, and other international sites through demi-legal network loopholes, and enforcement runs two-tiered for elites versus plebeians. Whatever advances business and globalization, the Party deems good, or anyway tacitly permits; whatever permits citizens to organize, coordinate, or pitch any alternative to the state, the Party squashes. (State speech codes forbid puns, to excise double meanings.)This creates market narrowing for Chinese firms outside China. Shirky describes how, when Xiaomi first marketed phones in South Asia, Indian media generated panic that Xiaomi was shipping user data into China. Well, all mobile service providers store metadata on native server farms; Apple and Samsung do it. Their servers merely dwell in non-totalitarian states. Xiaomi, by contrast, must simultaneously appease state officials and free-market buyers, a difficult global sell.For Shirky, Xiaomi isn’t another corporation, despite its massive size (its market is huge enough to dwarf international firms while remaining primarily locked inside China’s borders). Rather, Xiaomi represents China’s strange relationship with modernity. China has become economically free but politically restricted; socially diverse but ethnically homogenous; global yet totalitarian. If it survives ten more years, the People’s Republic will become history’s longest-lived one-party state.Thus China is already making history, even if that history feels muddled to technocratic Western observers. It’s yoked competing influences together, with apparent success, and seems to be winning the global three-legged race. But China’s aggregate wealth hasn’t translated into individual well-being; the typical Chinese citizen remains poor by world standards. How information firms like Xiaomi fare in coming years will define how China faces today’s global situation.Shirky’s writing combines journalism with technical expertise to describe powerful conflicting influences which will define global market considerations within our lifetimes. Xiaomi’s rapid advance, from zygote to market dominance inside five years, and its odd, counterintuitive business model, are symbolic, for Shirky, of China’s changing role in global economics. To understand China through analogy, Shirty says, let’s understand Xiaomi. That isn’t easy, but it’s decidedly unnerving.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15NU13V61O1AT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990976327#wasThisHelpful","R15NU13V61O1AT","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I confess, when the manufacturer offered me these cloths for review, I had my doubts. When I heard they were woven from bamboo fibers, I feared they’d feel like jute, hemp, and other non-cotton natural fibers: lump, itchy, and prone to disintegrate after a few washings. It makes me very happy in this case that I find myself proven wrong.Popping these washcloths from the package (they come in a six-pack), I noticed they were baby-soft and very thin. Don’t let the lack of thickness fool you. These are as sturdy as any terry washcloths you already own, and you can lather them up with soap, shaving foam, baby wash, or whatever you’d like. They’ll spread your lather widely and efficiently, without the coarse texture that irritates a baby’s skin… or your own freshly shaved skin.And despite their light weight, they hold up to multiple washings. I got a huge splotch of blood on one of these when I cut myself shaving, and failed to blot it out right away. This cloth shed the stain after only one washing, which would take several washings with my cotton washcloth. Washing my face with this soft cloth simply feels good after a warm shave.These cloths are designed for babies’ tender skin. But lemme tell you, once you use one on your own face and body, you’ll keep your own cloths in reserve for washing yourself. I’d simply resigned myself to the idea that lathering with a washcloth meant cotton terry. But this stuff makes cotton feel downright unpleasant. This will quickly become your favored washcloth.The manufacturer offered me these cloths at their own expense in exchange for an honest review.

"I find it refreshing that historian Gil Troy doesn’t conceal personal positions behind mealy-mouthed bipartisanship attempts. Around this book’s one-quarter mark, he writes: “Clinton’s alluring idealism, passion for people, and atomic smarts mixed unstably with a hard-edged will to power, a puppy-dog neediness, and a super-human buoyancy--during a time of cultural, technological, and economic upheaval.” This perfectly encapsulates Troy’s attempt to do everything at once, with predictably chaotic results.Gil Troy, whose published bibliography includes multiple collaborations with the progressive historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., proposes with this book to create an overview of the entire 1990s, with Bill Clinton as emblem of the era. Like Reagan in the 1980s or FDR in the 1930s, Clinton’s name is so linked with his American decade that we cannot explain one without another. Troy proposes to examine person and time together.His success seems, at best, mixed. In early chapters, before Clinton’s campaign and presidency, his emphasis lies on a synoptic overview of the spotlighted years. Once Bill entered national affairs, however, Troy’s focus shifts to personality. On occasion, he resembles the “gotcha” journalists he mocks and deplores within his text. Though Troy putatively approaches his subject with historians’ dispassion, I find myself wondering what subtextual purpose he’s really pursuing.Troy lards his exposition, at seemingly random intervals, with weasel words and personal imprecations: Bill had not dodged, but “slithered past the draft.” Troy characterizes Clinton’s administration as “campaign kids” versus “professional grown-ups.” Or he repeats talk radio ad hominem attacks, often without endnote citations: Hillary’s leadership in Health Care Reform and other issues struck Americans as “Byzantine and Stalinist.” Troy comes across as a moralizing jerk.But weirdly, Troy also exempts Clinton from his most cutting contemporary criticism. From the very prologue, Troy emphasizes Clinton's success injecting centrist morality into conventional Democratic politics; yet he wholly writes out Clinton's critics from the moral Left, like Reverend Jim Wallis or Rabbi Michael Lerner. The latter contributed heavily to Hillary's “Politics of Meaning” speech, which Troy acknowledges as her biggest early misstep, and found himself exiled for it.In fairness, Rabbi Lerner himself kept mum about such issues for over a decade. If Troy wants to examine a particular decade, citing sources not written until 2006 might arguably seem reasonable. But Reverend Wallis had no such compunctions. He openly criticized President Clinton as early as 1995. He certainly had audience enough to receive and repeat his criticisms. Why then doesn’t he merit precious column inches?This complex “what to leave in, what to leave out” issue persistently confounds Troy’s narrative. Early on, Troy declares his intent to focus on preponderantly domestic issues. Foreign policy, while perhaps interesting, lies too far afield for our purposes. But then Troy offers only hat-tip acknowledgments of the Defense of Marriage Act and the Glass-Steagall Act repeal, the two pieces of domestic policy that debatably most defined Clinton’s lingering legacy.Policy little interests Troy; he’d rather talk personalities. George Stephanopolous; Zoe Baird; Ken Starr; Vince Foster. That’s saying nothing of more rabble-rousing personalities, like Rush Limbaugh, whose popularity peaked during Clinton’s first term. Troy busily name-checks every personnel misstep and media gadfly, while spending little time on actual Clinton accomplishments, that I felt less like I’d read a comprehensive history, more like I’d dived into a morass of tabloid journalism redux.Meanwhile, the decade itself gets some sporadic treatment. Remember, the 1990s saw tech-stock CEOs getting rock-star treatment, appearing on Rolling Stone covers, speaking to applauding stadium crowds, making millions on stock offerings that actually produced nothing. With the Cold War over, American attention spans wavered on countless brightly colored do-funnies and financial mousetraps. Troy mentions some, but lingers on not one long enough for true comprehension.Full disclosure: I’m no Clinton loyalist. During the 1990s, I voted Republican, but converted to liberalism after 9/11. Since then, I’ve drifted toward Distributism, a Third Way political-economic theory based on moral precepts. Bill Clinton’s willingness to appease his opponents (cf. Ian Haney López or Barry Glassner) strike me, then as now, as craven. And anyone expecting anything different from Mrs. Clinton seems incredibly nave.That said, Troy’s low-tension, milquetoast synopsis will satisfy neither inveterate Clinton haters nor died-in-the-wool True Believers. He surveys the decade with great breadth but little depth, often stumbling into the very traps he contends doomed Clinton’s contemporaries. I simply learned more reading Conason and Lyons’ The Hunting of the President. Too flimsy for readers my age, too superficial for younger readers, this book just drifts.The author's publicist provided me a copy of this book, at their own expense, in exchange for an honest review.

"Imagine a renowned physicist predicted we’d find an entirely new planet, in our own solar system. The math holds, according to Newtonian physics. This particular scientist accurately anticipated a new planet once before, telling astronomers exactly where it’d be on a certain date. The prediction appears perfect, except… the planet isn’t there. That’s the situation faced by Urbain Jean Joseph Le Verrer, whose foretold intra-Mercury planet, Vulcan, never materialized.November 2015 marks the centennial of Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity. Marking the occasion, MIT science writer Thomas Levenson spotlights one of science history’s weirder, less-remembered occasions, the struggle to find planet Vulcan. Le Verrer, who used Newton’s mathematics to precisely locate the previously undiscovered planet Neptune, found an eccentric wobble in Mercury’s perihelion of orbit. The only conceivable explanation: an undiscovered planet or asteroid inside Mercury’s orbit.Levenson’s narrative sweeps from 17th Century Britain, to Paris in the 19th, to Berlin in the 20th. He focuses on three major personalities in the development of physics: Isaac Newton, whose theories of gravity and motion described an orderly, predictable universe; Le Verrer, who turned Newton’s descriptions into tools to anticipate new discoveries; and Einstein, whose theories did the unthinkable, challenging Newton’s supremacy. This book reads like an epic novel.Newton, who had fallen into reclusive midlife eccentricity, came very close to becoming a historical footnote. However, his friend Edmond Halley’s observations about comets rekindled Newton’s thinking about planetary orbits. Calculating equations from known observations, he realized seemingly unpredictable events actually had concrete explanations, attributable to a mysterious force he called “gravity.” Published in an era when alchemy still ruled, Newton’s principles threatened how Christian Europeans perceived the world.French astronomer Pierre Simon Laplace proved Newton’s mathematics applied throughout the solar system. But, writing during the Napoleonic Wars, Laplace’s reasoning would go frustratingly untested during his lifetime. It fell to Le Verrer, a surprising unknown from a tobacco-making background, to test and perfect Newton’s theories. When he did the previously unthinkable, forecasting the location of an unknown planet without ever peeking into a telescope, Le Verrer became science’s most powerful personality.Le Verrer’s theories came to dominate 19th Century astronomy. So when he confronted one of science’s most inscrutable puzzles, the slippage in Mercury’s apparent orbit, his explanation became dominant worldwide. Astronomers searched diligently for planet Vulcan, which absolutely had to be there. After all, the math resolved perfectly. Le Verrer predicted its location, mass, orbit… but, even decades after Le Verrer’s death, Vulcan resolutely refused to make itself visible.Meanwhile, a Zurich patent clerk, Albert Einstein, began incrementally unpacking mysteries of physics, a process apparently propelled by daydreams and intuition. Theories like Special Relativity and the photoelectric effect transformed modern science. But only once he’d transitioned to the full-time professoriate did Einstein enjoy time enough to pursue his ultimate accomplishment, General Relativity. And, almost accidentally, Einstein happened upon an ironclad explanation why planet Vulcan couldn’t possibly exist.Readers familiar with Thomas Kuhn’s theories about scientific advancement will recognize important themes in Levenson’s narrative. The importance of personalities, for instance: planet Vulcan’s staying power, despite complete absence of evidence, relied substantially on the fact that Le Verrer himself predicted it. Einstein, an unknown upon his first publications in 1905, faced pushback because he contradicted Newtonian physics. And dammit, no upstart ever challenges luminaries like Newton. Ever!Or the importance of reasoning by analogy: Newtonian physics initially faced significant hurdles because it separated cause from effect. Planets move because motion persists, not because God propels creation. Einstein’s theories don’t behave like anything we’ll encounter in daily life, so straight-up descriptions fumble in most people’s understanding. Levenson makes Einstein somewhat comprehensible with analogies to moving trains, flying rockets, and workmen falling off roofs.Through these themes, Levenson demonstrates not only how cool science is, but also how contingent. Our comprehension of reality may appear more complete than prior generations, but all explanations remain subject to tests. Einstein made errors and followed blind paths; just because we agree his theories are correct today doesn’t mean that outcome was inevitable. Science, Levenson demonstrates, is the product of people and culture as much as of reality.For readers who, like me, love physics without truly understanding it, Levenson’s narrative serves two themes. It helps unpack the forces that shape modern scientific reasoning, often without our recognizing them; and it translates difficult scientific precepts into common language. Through his artful analogies and nuanced approach, Levenson’s science reaches the level of poetry. With gripping conflicts, fractious characters, and world-shattering discoveries, Levenson’s story outpunches even the best world-class novels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UXXNALO6V13Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812998987#wasThisHelpful","R2UXXNALO6V13Q","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One thing I like about this story is that, simply put, the roles between the Doctor and his Companion are reversed. After years and years, we're really familiar with the Doctor and his story, especially the Eighth Doctor, who, after years of Big Finish audio productions, probably has more canonical content than any prior Doctor. Companion Lucie Miller, however, clearly keeps her secrets. As this episode develops, Lucie slips up, inadvertently revealing that she doesn't tell the Doctor everything she knows. But what that is, remains to be seen.That said, this isn't a perfect episode. The climax features a battle between two Dalek sects, battling over bloodline purity in a manner that later came up repeatedly during Russell T. Davies' run as head writer for the TV series. Great concept, except that it comes across as primarily visual. We get lots of ""Whizz! Bang! Pew!"" sound effects, but then the Doctor has to tell us how things wrapped up, because in the overwhelmingly visual world of fight scenes and crowd scenes (and this climax is both), all we have is an admittedly well-mixed batch of sound.As the second half of a pilot for the radio series that emerged from Doctor Who's TV revival, this episode is pretty decent. It establishes the primary sources of tension that will, presumably, recur through the radio series. Particularly the personality conflict between Lucie and the Doctor: for perhaps the first time, the Doctor and his Companion basically don't like one another. It also establishes themes of identity, played out by Hayley ""Agent Carter"" Atwell, at an early career stage here, playing more than one character, one atop another.As the third launch for the canonical Eighth Doctor (after the 1996 TV movie and the prior Big Finish productions), it weaves a careful balance between introducing a character, and expanding existing material. It doesn't always do so perfectly. If you haven't heard the straight-to-CD episodes featuring Charlie and Krizz, as I've only heard some, this two-parter does nothing to close your gaps. However, by throwing listeners in the deep end, it does an interesting, if abbreviated, job introducing the Doctor's tense relationship, not only with Lucie, but with the Time Lords who force them together.Therefore, I have to give this episode some credit. This episode suffers because the creative team was thinking visually in an auditory medium; but on a storytelling level, this episode does what we expect a pilot episode to do. That is, it provides decent expository narrative, and gets several threads running that the creative team can expand upon in later episodes. And while some reviewers dislike the antagonistic relationship between the Doctor and Lucie, I find it promising. Here's hoping that, in future episodes, they keep the focus on our ears, not our eyes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TL916RXUDHD8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1844352560#wasThisHelpful","R2TL916RXUDHD8","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first started taking Omega-3 supplements after reading Dr. Stephen Ilardi’s book The Depression Cure. Ilardi’s plan, called Therapeutic Lifestyle Change (TLC), mostly involves behavioral changes, like getting plenty of sunlight daily, and spending meaningful time with friends. It does, however, include exactly one pill: he recommends users take an Omega-3 supplement daily. Not just any supplement, though; make sure it includes at least 1000 mg of Omega-3, with a roughly 2:1 ratio of EPA to DHA.This supplement includes 1400 mg total fish oil, including 1050 of Omega-3, in 2 softgel capsules. That’s 644 mg of EPA to 336 mg of DHA, almost exactly the numbers and ratio Ilardi calls for in his book. The supplement is also molecularly distilled, meaning it won’t taste like spoiled fish, even after you’ve left it out for some time. And the softgels are much smaller and more rounded than those often sold in health food stores, so the pills will go down more easily than the horse-choking nuggets you probably got at GNC.I’ve tried several different varieties of Omega-3 since I read Dr. Ilardi’s book. I’ve never had one I was out-and-out dissatisfied with, since they’re all made in consultation with working scientists and the latest science. However, some supplements go down easier than others. This one vanishes in a gulp of water, leaves no fishy aftertaste, and goes right to work. Therefore, though I’d recommend most fish-oil supplements, I especially recommend this one for people with pill phobias or gag tendencies. It goes down easy, and it works.The manufacturer provided me a sample of this product, at manufacturer's expense, in return for an honest review.

"What is it with superheroes blowing up American cities today? At a climactic point in this movie, I saw a beam of light blasting down from the sky, discharging evil aliens from another dimension into midtown Manhattan, and thought: this looks exactly like the climax from Man of Steel. Exactly. Superhero movies have ramped up American anxieties so profoundly that, lemming-like, they can only reheat 9/11 fears the same way time and again.Don’t get me wrong; I don’t dislike this movie. It has reasonably interesting characters, an engaging plot, and moves along at a robust clip. Though running nearly two-and-a-half hours, unusually long for a superhero movie, I never got the feeling that it was “long.” Every moment serves the purpose. Writer-director Joss Whedon successfully integrates a complicated nest of storylines in a manner that never lags, and for the most part is downright fun.There: I’ve said it. This movie has plenty to like. Unfortunately, it feels really, really familiar. I began getting a sinking feeling when the aircraft carrier our heroes occupied suddenly lifted out of the water and became sky-borne. I thought: didn’t Doctor Who do this in 2008? Then our stable of protagonists (this movie features six Avengers) gets into a heated verbal scuffle right before something goes BOOM! and they have to team up to save everyone.Thus my essential problem with this movie. It does everything right, and we know it does everything right because it does everything exactly the same way we’ve seen countless movies and TV shows do everything for the last several years. Loki’s carefully timed deception; Captain America’s personal redemption when given a new mission; the Hulk learning to be a team player. It works smoothly, each moment justifying the next, but it all just feels so familiar.For what it is, I enjoyed this movie. For an evening’s engaging entertainment, it wasn’t half bad; it has enough diversity of story influences for both a date night film and a guys’ night out. But at no point did I ever feel particularly surprised or challenged by it. This movie essentially rewards passive viewing by assembling a “best of superheroes” montage across a feature-length film. It’s okay; I just expected better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TBCTEM9BGI7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008NCSZQ8#wasThisHelpful","R2TBCTEM9BGI7M","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Young Grace insists she witnessed her mother’s murder. Daughter of a Special Forces veteran and granddaughter of America’s esteemed ambassador to Adria, Grace knows something about keeping secrets; but her willful streak won’t let her keep quiet. When she moves into her grandfather’s embassy, she expects a life of diplomatic glad-handing and general boredom. Then, across a crowded palace, she spots the man who murdered her mother.Grace insists she knows her mother’s murderer with such dedicated assurance, we know that by book’s end, she’ll either be spectacularly vindicated or have her entire universe turned upside down. Ally Carter, a generous author, attempts both. Having written two prior series featuring teenaged spy heroines, Carter turns her seasoned aplomb to true world affairs. Unfortunately, even part-time news followers will quickly spot serious problems with Carter’s universe.Ancient, dynamic Valancia, capital of Adria, overlooks the Mediterranean shoreline, hosting many glamorous embassies in Renaissance-era manors. Carter’s description combines elements of Monaco, Dubrovnik, and istanbul with fanciful imaginings of European splendor. This includes, apparently, remarkably modest land values, since embassies, not jet-setting millionaires, control Valancia’s prestigious waterfront properties. Also, nobody apparently pushes mops or waits tables. Carter creates a world of relentless, polished spy movie spectacle, and nothing else.Into this world, Grace inserts herself, among children of Earth’s most influential embassies. Youth from the local International School flit among social circles with apparent abandon; ambassadors’ children apparently wed and start families, while functionally stateless teenagers weave continual soap-operatic social webs. This suggests a remarkably settled diplomatic corps. Grace’s grandfather says he’s spent twenty-five years in Adria. I don’t buy it; I’ve read In the Garden of Beasts.But Grace remains undaunted, both by diplomatic prestige and monied splendor. She vaults walls into neighboring embassies, functionally invading other countries. She pulls James Bond surveillance in crowded Byzantine-era streets. She moves from begowned diplomatic receptions to arguments in rain-soaked streets with ease that makes Kate Beckinsale look flustered. One starts to suspect somebody’s keeping things both feasible and dramatic for her.Then there’s Grace’s absolute certainty. She knows, undeniably knows, she witnessed the Scarred Man assassinate her mother, the ambassador’s daughter. The complete lack of physical evidence—the absence of the bullet wound, the lack of accelerant from the bomb—does nothing to persuade Grace that this assassination couldn’t possibly have happened. Her dogged persistence, admirable in early chapters, gets wearing. But YA readers know, adult uselessness is a foregone conclusion.This theme, admittedly, has become my Achilles’ heel recently. Adult uselessness has become so ubiquitous, it’s become the marketing segment’s signature move. Most recent YA novels commence with the understanding that children, unburdened by knowledge or predisposition, see truths adults willingly ignore. Sometimes this works: Katniss Everdeen challenges corrupt demagogues because she has no insider standing, no bills to pay. But sometimes, age and experience know things.Surrounded by more embassies than any city outside the Hague, Grace nevertheless kicks doors, conducts espionage, and gathers guerilla evidence. Her grandfather attempts to teach her diplomacy; she defies him, in ways subtle and coarse. She clearly believes, and convinces fellow ambassadors’ kids, that world problems get better if diplomats stop acting diplomatically and practice teenagers’ unbridled honesty. Anyone who’s argued politics with college freshmen knows how that works.Instead, Grace rampages through Valancia, aided by a cadre of fellows too young to drive. Sometimes she’s stymied and learns to behave discreetly; more often, her headstrong ways yield bountiful rewards. Grace resembles the kind of teenager who breaks others’ things because she doesn’t know what stuff costs. She yells, screams, threatens, engages in psychological blackmail, and by such degrees ekes out victory. That, frustratingly, seems to be our moral.Carter assembles this novel from stereotypes salvaged from John le Carré novels, Pretty Little Liars episodes, and James Bond movies. Everything happens because it’s supposed to. Heroines like Grace deserve a sidekick, so Carter gives her one. Carter gives Grace a chaste but adversarial romance with the Russian ambassador’s son. Carter gives Grace friends willing to risk sedition and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to get in with the in crowd.In early chapters, Grace had my sympathy. I believed her conspiracy theory, because I’ve read YA, and I accept the genre’s premises.

"The first trait I noticed about this charger cord is its wide, flat, rubberized surface. This would be a very good charger cord to take with you while traveling, especially while traveling with pets, because its surface and its texture would make it resistant to getting dropped, shoved into a suitcase, trampled on, or chewed by animals. Its distinctive design at the ends makes it resistant to getting caught in, say, a drawer or a shoe or a puppy's mouth. When I received it, it proved incompatible with my phone (I must read these things more carefully), but when I loaned it to my ex-girlfriend to charge her phone, it lit right up and was at full charge inside about ninety minutes. So in terms of safety, utility, convenience, and design, I see this as a clear winner.The manufacturer provided me this device at their own expense in return for an honest review.

"On a recent long-distance drive, I tested this device out in the usual way, by charging my phone as I toddled on down the highway. Because this device has three ports, I also charged my USB speaker in an adjacent port, just to see how it handled double-teaming. Despite pulling power for two accessories, both of which were virtually dry when I plugged them in, this device had them both charged and running at full capacity inside an hour. This is remarkable in part because it takes my phone nearly twice that long to charge from the AC wall socket, so I can only assume this charger runs very, very efficiently.The manufacturer sent me this device at their own expense in return for an honest review.

"I figured I had the ultimate test of this device worked out when I went to visit my ex-girlfriend: she's iPhone, I'm Android. The manufacturer claims the five onboard USB chargers are ""smart"" and can detect the device style connected to them. So she randomly selected one port to plug in her phone, I chose another to plug mine, and we went to watch television. Sure enough, ninety minutes later, we had two fully charged phones, ready for immediate use.In this day, as more and more electronics are sold with only a USB charger cord, and not AC wall-socket adapter, it's important to have ways of plugging stuff in. After all, we can't leave our computers plugged in and drawing power 24/7, that's costly and inefficient. But because different manufacturers have different, nominally incompatible charging standards, the risk is a huge fistful of chargers, adapters, and cords. This device, just placed in a convenient location where you can organize your cord, gives you the ability to prevent such chaos.With its fashionable pastel color, low profile, and five charging ports, this device is useful without being obtrusive. I placed it between my desktop computer and my printer, so it'll remain subtle yet available for ready, constant use. Because I have so many non-computer devices, including speakers, lamps, and an essential oil diffuser, which came with USB cords, I expect to get plenty of use from this doodad. It brings all my devices together, and lets me charge them all in one place.The manufacturer offered me this device at their own expense, in exchange for an honest review.

"Those who know me know that I'm way past the point in life where I'm wearing pretty hair accessories; male pattern baldness has a way of choosing which kinds of vanity still work. So I let a pretty young woman friend try these out. Turns out they have scalloped wide ends, resembling pretty leaves, and like the picture, they come with one dark-colored pin, one light-colored pin. The wide ends taper into shafts about six inches long, which pin into your hair in a way that looks quite pretty. See the accompanying photo for more detail.However, this comes with one limitation. The shafts are polished to a very sleek, glossy sheen, which slides into and out of most hair very smoothly. My friend has very finely textured hair. This means if she's doing anything even slightly strenuous, like say walking, the pins have a tendency to slide out. She finds herself spending a great deal of time pushing her pins back into place, lest they get lost. They're completely out of the question if she wants to go out and do anything more effortful, like skee-ball or pool.Which is a shame, because they look very pretty in her hair. They do exactly what you'd expect something like this to do: with their two-tone colors, they really highlight her mid-range, strawberry blonde coloring, making a hair tone that sometimes looks nondescript really stand out. She loves wearing them, and expresses frustration at having to repeatedly either push them into place, or pluck them out and keep them in her purse. She doesn't want to score the surface to give them better staying power. I suggested gelling her hair. She squinted weirdly at me.So, in purchasing these, realize they've far slicker than the plastic or lacquered wood hairpins you likely buy at the typical discount or mall accessory store. You need to know exactly what your hair type is, to make sure you aren't constantly adjusting your 'do like a Hollywood diva. However, if your hair is thick and textured enough to handle these accessories' smooth finish, they look like a million dollars, without costing that way. They're very, very pretty, and would certainly go with nearly every hair color available.The manufacturer provided me these accessories at no cost, in exchange for an honest review.

"I was surprised by this stuff. I don't know exactly what I expected, since this stuff primarily promises to help build lean muscle mass, but I was pleased to discover that, if I drink one of these after a hard day of work, I would be blessed with enough mental acuity to continue getting things done for the rest of the day. I've gotten frustratingly accustomed to coming home, popping a soda-pop, cooking (or, more often, reheating) dinner, and vegging out in front of the TV. But if I drink one of these promptly upon getting home, I have the wherewithal to clean, cook with fresh ingredients, and even write for a couple of hours before bed.Like they say, just add water. Pour water into the neck of the expandable bottle to dissolve the powder. There's a printed fill line on the back, so you can see if you've added what they consider enough water for the purpose, but I've found that if you stop at their fill line, you probably haven't put in enough. Go one, maybe two fingers above their fill line if you want all the powder in the packet to dissolve and be drinkable. If you remember drinking Nestle's Quik as a kid (I think they call it Nesquik now), this has a very similar milk chocolate flavor: maybe a little sweet for most adults, but if whey tastes anything like it smells, that sweet probably helps this stuff go down.At this writing, this stuff has a going price of $10.67 per six-pack. For people who work out a reasonable three times per week, that's enough to get through two weeks. I don't have a formal exercise regimen; instead, I work construction, which includes all the bending, stretching, lifting, carrying, squatting, and twisting my friends pay good money to do at the gym. If I take one after every eight-hour workday, and one after my recreational Saturday bike ride, we're looking at enough with one six-pack to get me through a week. Considering what this gives me, the price isn't unreasonable. I may have just discovered the latest addition to my daily routine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R7QS1GIUU7UT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJGFRWE#wasThisHelpful","R3R7QS1GIUU7UT","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I sprung for one of these when I needed to be out of town overnight and didn't want my little ones getting all thirsty and whiny. However, after I got back into town, I left it out for a bit because it still had water in it. To my surprise, they preferred the water out of this dish over the water from their traditional bowl. I think (but cannot prove) that they prefer this water because, as the bottle lets in only the smallest amount of air at a time, and only through a very narrow opening, the water flowing in remains clean and pure-tasting much longer.So they get plentiful, self-replenishing water, which I have to refill far less often. The dish is easy to clean: wipe the drinking bowl out with a soapy rag, rinse, and done. The bottle has too narrow a neck to reach inside that way, but you can get the entire inside with a common kitchen brush. This means that, using this dish, I can keep it full without having to check it two or three times daily, I can clean it without having to run it through the dishwasher, and my kids can feel confident in their plentiful clean water always being there for them.With its one-gallon capacity, it's good for cats and small dogs. I don't recommend it for large dogs, or for households where more than two or three animals will drink out of it simultaneously, as that usage level will slurp it dry fast. (I also don't recommend it for outdoor use, because you don't want to encourage strays.) So, for ordinary households with just one or a few pets, or a household like mine—a bachelor with two furballs and not enough hours in the day—this may prove a breakthrough for both you and your animals.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV6JAN63B8KJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01271FPQS#wasThisHelpful","RV6JAN63B8KJQ","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I immediately liked Martin Ott’s latest, deeply autobiographical poetry collection when the first poem, “The Interrogator In Retirement,” began with these lines:He’s waiting for the reversemetamorphosis, for the extrafeelers to fold in or fall off,to wake one morning a man.Ott’s unsubtle but well-placed literary reference pings off his own military career, which clearly still troubles him. But if I found these lines smart and engaging, I knew I’d love Ott’s verse just pages later, with the opening of “Survivor’s Manual to Love and War”:Death is a loving dogwith no children or chew toysto occupy its attention.It will lick you into submission,this inevitable pack instinct,to join the vast departed.I first noticed Martin Ott nearly one year ago as co-author, with John F. Buckley, of the collection Yankee Broadcast Network. That collection’s hilarious, gimlet-eyed angle on American celebrity culture had crafty ways of making me think it’d pander to my anti-mass-media prejudices, then upsetting my expectations in ways both shocking and illuminating. Ott, working solo, extends that tendency, but along lines more personal and melancholy than that collection permitted.Like the best poets, Ott feels simultaneously familiar and jarring. Reading lines like “Death is a loving dog,” the contradiction between mental frames will, and should, dislodge our expectations.  Yet we inevitably recall other poets with similar approaches, like TS Eliot or John Ashbery, who have done similarly. If Ott plants surprising crops, he nevertheless farms well-tilled ground.Ott’s best poems have a narrative quality, a cogent through-line, once common with poets like Browning or Tennyson. But Ott combines this almost retro storytelling ability with very contemporary sensibilities about language. I appreciate this dualism, because it gives readers firm grounding to anchor their attention, while immersing us in his surprising insights. Most poets either guide us, or defamiliarize us; Ott, notably, does both:Ten days of rain a year in Los Angelesinvokes the legend of sheathed umbrellas.My mother once told me a storyabout a boy who lost an eyeon an umbrella’s undercarriage.Mary Poppins has proven that you canget swept away by unbridled passion.Is an umbrella actually an umbrella?—”Why I Don’t Carry an Umbrella”I once believed that poets, like Ott, whose metaphoric language and unexpected leaps reveal surprising truths, just see life differently than us readers. Perhaps, like Van Gogh, light hits their eyes in personal ways that we consumers cannot share. But reading Ott, I realized: he doesn’t see differently than me, not prospectively. He uses language to help himself see anew. He’s just invited me along for the journey.No, Ott doesn’t contribute some unique viewpoint, so much as construct one through language. His contribution is less some pre-existing attitude, more a willingness to test his personal experiences by milling them with words, a stone-bladed metaphor excising everything ordinary from his ordeals until their truth shines through. Sometimes, as with his military career, Ott explains what truths he’s revealing. Other times, facts fall away as unnecessary trappings:She is a whisper filtering through shadowyoffice ducts, a wind chime for coworkers,a snare drum to delivery men, a Stradivariusto the woman in the corner office. She isthe guttural chant that drove a thousand timesa thousand workers to erect a pyramid of gossip,a stairwell that groans a symphony of sex.—”What is Left”One feels, reading the specificity of images that continue accumulating, that “she” is a real person, not some agglomeration of personal stereotypes. But Ott cleaves off identifying characteristics as mere, needless facts. The truth lies beneath anything concrete we’d describe in a police report or dating profile.That, perhaps, represents Ott’s greatest contribution. His language sometimes includes specific details— Los Angeles, Fort Leonard Wood, Naked Lunch, JD Salinger. Yet his language mills away accidents of form, the history of accumulated expectations. Ott invites us to join him removing everything unnecessary from experience, like Michelangelo removing everything from the marble that isn’t David. The result is both collaborative and unpredictable:The white page is an eyeballrolled back on the verge, glowingwith knowledge of the depths.It is a blizzard beyond snow-caps or celestial freeze, blindingnothingness, numb fingers to becut. The white sheet fills our bedwith unwritten tomes of exploration,fear stained into it, a serif font.—”Ink Quake”I love poetry that invites me on a journey. Reading Ott, I feel I’ve journeyed beyond myself, and returned refreshed, restored, new.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GJUDVGQKOBCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0268037396#wasThisHelpful","R1GJUDVGQKOBCQ","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Many moons ago, I encountered the writerly advice: “This story ends where it should begin.” I resolved never to give such advice, because it sounded like crap. Then I took first-semester undergraduate creative writing, and learned its meaning. Writers sometimes invest noble efforts into scene-setting, exposition, and character notes, but forget the actual story. So it’s legitimate criticism. I just never thought I’d say it to Umberto Eco.Back in 1992, when newspapers still mattered, a shyster editor hires a washed-up old hack to ghost-write his memoir of a new start-up tabloid. The trick: it’s a dummy paper. Every issue will be numbered Zero, because this newspaper isn’t intended for public elucidation. The paper’s primary backer wants to threaten society’s upper echelons by promising to reveal their darkest, sloppiest secrets. Basically, he invents doxxing a full decade early.This reads less like a novel, more like the preparatory background notes an author makes for something they expect to write later. I don’t mean that metaphorically. Eco includes lengthy discursive monologues, many sprawling over multiple chapters, describing ideas that should occur through action or dialogue. Characters exist, not to do anything or develop across scenes, but to voice respective viewpoints about our media-saturated society.Our first-person hack narrator, Colonna, gives the fake journalists lectures on how to prevaricate and evade with words. The writers’ pen includes the slimy editor, the cynical veteran, the the spy for the opposition, and the misplaced, vaguely antiquated voice of journalistic ethics. Oh, and the one obligatory “chick writer” who aspires to journalistic legitimacy, but gets fobbed off with celebrity news and horoscopes. (Spoiler: she puts out.)And it includes the drunk who spouts conspiracy theories. One-third of the way through, this guy finally divulges the subplot that eventually drives the novel’s back half: he knows Benito Mussolini’s real ultimate fate. We thought he died in a hail of partisan gunfire after the Allies took Rome. But Braggadocio (seriously, that’s his name) has proof—proof, I tell you—that Il Duce got the Eichmann treatment in Argentina.Umberto Eco loves conspiracies. His best novels, including The Name of the Rose and Foucault’s Pendulum, feature characters unlocking the gulf between symbolic reality, and the underlying truth concealed behind language and metaphor. His best characters take stands against mere comforting illusion. A trailblazer in semiotics, Eco’s novels generally represent ways humans make meaning through communication, sometimes despite reality’s nihilistic tendency to deny humans any valid significance.Admittedly, Braggadocio’s theory has remarkable potential. It involves not only Mussolini’s (purported) death, but the hush-hush Vatican machinations, the death of Aldo Moro, CIA back-channels covertly funding the Red Brigades, and multiple failed coups in postwar Italian history. Braggadocio makes 9/11 Truthers look unambitious and shy. Eco could’ve built this into an intriguing premise for a more complicated novel, if he’d gone beyond mere idea.But story-wise, this novel marches in place. The characters don’t do anything, and interact only sporadically; they just discourse at one another, sometimes in paragraphs that run over two pages. In particular, the characters don’t change. They exist to represent viewpoints in public debates. Though Colonna himself briefly engages in liquor-fueled existential despair toward the final pages, he ultimately, like everyone else, finishes mostly where he started.Eco dips briefly into important events. The paper’s venal financial backer, Commendatore Vimercate, uncannily resembles media magnate turned politician Silvio Berlusconi. Editor Simei’s flip dismissal of cell phones and computers as meaningful lifestyle trends (remember, this is 1992) grimly hints why many Italian, and international, newspapers looked simply out-of-touch after the Millennium. Eco cuttingly satirizes the devolution of journalism into celebrity exposés, reprinting official press releases, and ad hominem mudslinging.Then in the final pages, Spoiler Alert, he does nothing with it. Braggadocio dies violently, Colonna assumes it was to prevent publication of his theories, but offers no particular proof. Colonna flees town, waiting the assassin’s bullet. Then he turns on the TV and sees Allan Francovich’s BBC documentary detailing virtually everything Eco spent an entire book spelling out. Wait, did Eco actually write anything new, or just paraphrase Francovich?Basically, Eco creates an idea, but rather than put anything in motion, he just stops. Boom, done. I expect better from a writer of Eco’s caliber. His past novels are talky, admittedly, but something actually happens; characters change; situations develop. This, well, he creates an opportunity for something to happen, then he does nothing with it. It’s a squandered chance, the epitome of “This story ends where it should begin.”","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXXH8FLB4R7DM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544635086#wasThisHelpful","RXXH8FLB4R7DM","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Deep within the Time Vortex, the Doctor's companion Leela is suffering nightmares about incidents in her past. She remembers the moment when her half-wild tribe put her on trial for heresy, and her father died in her place. Except, now, she remembers thrusting her father into his death. What really happened? Is she a killer? In the midst of this existential crisis, the TARDIS materializes in a seemingly abandoned luxury space cruiser. Confronted by a hired investigator, the Doctor becomes a prime suspect for murder. But much larger forces are in play, forces which put Leela on a collision course with her most powerful enemy yet, the Doctor.In the special features interviews following the main event, the actors involved in this production describe the classic 1970s Doctor Who serials, the shows I grew up with, as ""under-written."" This story explicitly aims to reverse Leela's seemingly blase attitude toward her father's death in the 1977 four-parter ""The Face of Evil,"" one of my favorites. This criticism is partly unfair, since in the 1970s, the BBC's Saturday-night action dramas, like Doctor Who, were much more plot-driven, and character moments would've bogged the story down. But this criticism is partly fair, too: though running around one hour, this story packs as much actual content as the four-part classics, most of it character-driven.Which is good, except that, just as the story really reaches the point where it promises to open Leela's character in a positive way, the music kicks in and the story peters out. Throughout most of the story, Leela engages in existential self-flagellation that makes her seem less tortured than indecisive. It feels like plenty of prologue, and pretty good prologue at that, but just as soon as we get through the prologue and promise to jump into the real meat, the story is over. I never thought I'd say this, after criticizing the Eleventh Doctor's run for long, talky denouements, but this story really needs a longer tail to resolve the questions its main body raises.The result is a perfectly pleasant story that, sadly, never quite reaches its potential. Which, come to think of it, describes quite a few 1970s-era Doctor Who episodes: always almost there, always promising just enough to keep loyal watchers hooked, but somehow, in the resolution, always winding down rather than resolving. This one-hour story combines the 1970s feel with the 2010s storytelling ethic, to create a product that's certainly entertaining, but doesn't add much to the Fourth Doctor's story arc. I'm not sorry I listened to it, and I know I'll listen to it again. I just feel this could have been so much better if the creative team hadn't held themselves back.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NQXPP5BVDAOQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781782938#wasThisHelpful","R3NQXPP5BVDAOQ","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just got back from Kansas City, a five-hour drive that heavily takes me through regions where, let's just say, local radio distinctly leaves something to be desired. Lovers of edgy, ambitious music can go truly nuts driving through central Kansas and Nebraska, trying to find anything worth listening to. So when the manufacturer offered me the opportunity to receive and review this product, I knew I'd found something that might potentially make the transit more pleasurable. I'm pleased to say, this product provided everything I anticipated.By receiving audio content from any Bluetooth-equipped device, such as a mobile phone or mp3 player, and translating it into a low-power FM signal, it makes digital signals readable on most car radios, including that on my truck, much too old to read mp3 or iPod signals. By connecting to standardized car lighter ports, it runs on the vehicle's own internal power, ensuring that it will work as long as your vehicle has power. Thus everything is standardized, allowing this device to translate between the very newest mobile technology, and the oldest working street-worthy cars.I've previously used FM short-range broadcasting devices to connect older car radios to newer audio systems, like iPods and CD players, back when CD players mattered. For the most part, I haven't cared for them; they don't work when there's any form of interference, including other car radios, conflicting broadcast signals, or even metal-frame buildings creating resonance. So I had my doubts about this device. However, as I say, I just drove five hours each way with this in my truck, and I can now say, from experience, that the signal never wavered, twitched, or sounded weak.So. It receives, and it transmits. It does both with alacrity, in a way that reconciles my fairly new smartphone with my fairly old truck, allowing me to hear the music I really enjoy, even while driving through the fairly tame, commercialized radio signals of my area. The instructions are simple and easily savvied, and the signal uses standard power, but not very much of it. This device does everything the product advertises, and does so without needless button pushing. So I can only recommend it, without reservation, because it works well.The manufacturer provided this product in return for my honest review.

"I purchased these pencils for use in the workplace. I work construction, and often need to mark where wood needs cut, or where screws need driven, or whatever. Ballpoint ink just isn't very good for that; in my business, we use pencil.First I noticed the line this pencil produces is very faint. Fair enough, they're designed for use on white paper, not two-by-fours. That's my problem,  not the pencil's. But then I notices the mechanism broke after two days' non-strenuous use. Not just once, either: three pencils in a row broke after two eight-hour workdays.Sure, these are ""only"" classroom pencils. But I wasn't useing them under extreme or adverse conditions.

"This simple plug-in device has thirteen LED bulbs with two power settings: merely bright and super-bright. You charge it by connecting the two-prong plug to any standard American AC outlet, and when it’s had some time to charge, you can get five hours of light from the “merely” bright setting, which is more than bright enough to read by, cook by, or get underneath your car and check for damages by.So as a light, it’s good; but here’s where the problem arises. Supposedly, if you have a power failure, this device automatically activates, giving you a powerful emergency light. Well, I haven’t had a power failure since I received this device, so I cannot vouch for that, but as an experiment, I flipped the breaker connected to its power outlet. Nothing. Nada. Zip. The device completely failed to activate, giving me no confidence in an emergency.Thus, I approve of the light; consider the photos I’ve shared with this review to see just how bright it is. If I need light during an emergency, or if I just want to negotiate a twisting hallway at midnight without turning on a light, I’d consider this a good device. But the promise, partly, was that it would provide me a halo of light the minute power went off, and unless I’m doing something wrong, nope. So it’s a split decision.This product was provided, at manufacturer expense, in exchange for an honest review. As always, the opinions are exclusively my own.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B10T09IDX9DB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z90U8Q2#wasThisHelpful","R3B10T09IDX9DB","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One buzzword has appeared frequently in business guidebooks I've received for review: engagement. Because authors mostly haven't defined that word, I've assumed that derives from topics taught in MBA classrooms. It's definitely something quantifiable, as it entails ""engagement scores."" Mostly I've shined the topic off as just another opaque metric which management consultants cite to remind us they're more educated than us peons.Canadian consultant Brady G. Wilson believes engagement, while important, is half the continuum. Early in this book, he describes what he calls The Engagement Paradox: ""the more companies focus on engagement, the more disengagement they produce."" Having read something similar recently in research psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, I'll buy that. For Wilson, engagement means nothing for workplace teams lacking energy.And whoopsie, Wilson immediately repeats that frustrating mistake from other business writers: he never defines ""energy."" Does he intend that workers remain frenetic, bouncy, and gregarious constantly? One recalls Susan Cain's discussion of how MBA programs prefer extroverted applicants, even when they observably don't listen or communicate reciprocally. The term ""energy"" is broad enough to render conflicting, even contradictory, meanings if left undefined.Let's postpone that debate, though. Because Wilson otherwise uses sound evidence to make sound, thorough claims about ways leaders can make measurable differences in employee outcomes. He breaks his process down into ten chapters, each summarized by simple, easily memorable bromides: ""Manage Energy, Not Engagement."" ""Trust Conversations, Not Surveys."" ""Meet Needs, Not Scores."" It's hard to dispute Wilson's arguments.Wilson relies heavily on up-to-date science and field research to describe how stats-driven management styles consistently disappoint, because they don't reach workers where their hearts live. In my favorite chapter, for instance, Wilson explains how too many managers rely upon in-house metrical evaluations to gauge employee engagement, when they should have conversations with their workers. I've said something similar myself previously.Thus, Wilson crafts something seemingly paradoxical: a data-driven explanation of why smart managers shouldn't over-rely upon data. Instead, wise managers find ways, through face-to-face conversation, managed tension, and shared vision, to encourage employees' energetic investment in corporate outcomes. As Wilson observes, many workers would surprisingly rather have autonomy, flexibility, and strength left for their families, than more pay.I'll buy all that. Even without any meaningful definition of ""energy,"" Wilson pitches a smart case for how existing management techniques discourage committed workers and reward people who only do the minimum. He also crafts an engaging counter-proposal, a vision of corporate management focused on keeping workers energized, customers happy, and numbers high. He pitches an engaging alternative to today's tightly controlled, essentially meaningless corporatocracy.I like Wilson's vision, within its parameters. His reliance on actual science, rather than abstract algorithms, makes a refreshing change from other consultancy handbooks. His use of relevant examples from his own portfolio gives his prose an active, personal edge. If you share Wilson's starting premises, many of which remain unvoiced, you'll find plenty to like. Just realize, not every topic he broaches gets explained.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROB3LKN08NFWK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1772360171#wasThisHelpful","ROB3LKN08NFWK","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know if I believe the claims about therapeutic magnets. Some people swear by them, but I cannot vouch whether they're objectively any better than placebos. That said, if you believe the anecdotes, this attractive copper cuff makes both a good-looking accessory and a potentially useful alternative medicine aide.It's made of a single piece of copper, designed to be opened by gently bending the metal apart by hand, then gently bending it closed around your wrist. The metal is soft enough to be malleable, yet resilient enough that I've worn it out biking or pulling weeds, and it's stayed firmly in place and resisted ordinary wear and tear. All that is to say, it's workable, but durable.The magnets are placed just right to fit over your pulse points. (Also, if I remember some of my charts, it also corresponds with certain chi lines, but that's really outside my expertise.) Again, I don't know if I believe magnets have medicinal qualities, but I have found wearing this, particularly after a stressful workday, very cooling and relaxing.Also, it comes in an attractive dark-navy velour gift bag, perfect for storage or for giving as a gift. So, if you want a good-looking accessory that doubles as alternative medicine, or if you just want something that takes a little edge off physical stress and hard work, maybe give this piece a try. I've had good experiences with it, and I'm a cynical skeptic. If you believe, maybe it'll do even better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4YHBPZNVQQO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SJUBSB8#wasThisHelpful","R4YHBPZNVQQO8","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An American teenager testing her limits in Venice’s salacious nightlife falls victim to kidnappers. The Carabinieri, Italy’s national police, swings into action, while American Army personnel at controversial Camp Ederle watch. But these aren’t ordinary kidnappers. While the Carabinieri fumble badly, the kidnappers begin transmitting young Mia Elston’s tortures online— tortures that look chillingly familiar to anybody who’s watched the news since 2003.The second novel in Jonathan Holt’s Carnivia Trilogy, following last year’s The Abomination, treads similar ground while telling an altogether separate story. As before, it spotlights the collision of three worlds: Venice’s sensual nihilism, lingering Cold War repression at Ederle, and the complete shedding of limits in Carnivia, an elaborate website combining elements of Facebook, Silk Road, and Ashley Madison. Holt’s love for secrets and conspiracy continues unabated.Following events of the previous volume, Carabinieri Captain Kat Tapo finds herself busted to menial tasks. Male colleagues leave vulgar graffiti on her stationhouse locker. Mia Elston’s kidnapping strikes Kat’s empathetic nature, yes, but it also signals an opportunity to redeem herself before the bureaucracy that’s abandoned her. So she contacts two people she believes she can trust, though she previously squandered their good graces altogether.Lieutenant Holly Boland works the Civilian Liaison desk at Ederle, but keeps an apartment in Venice. Once Kat’s best friend, they had a bitter split, for reasons kept murky until very late. Holly believes her superiors distrust her because she gets along well with Italians, but her problems run far deeper. As Mia Elston’s kidnappers prove elusive, the Army demands Holly’s ability to straddle two cultures, but rising tensions make her situation increasingly perilous.Daniele Barbo, genius hacker who founded Carnivia, hates everything. Childhood trauma rendered him deeply distrustful of authority, and severe facial scars make every trip outdoors an odyssey. But as it becomes increasingly obvious that Mia’s kidnappers are using Carnivia to coordinate their increasingly brutal crimes, Daniele’s deeply buried compassion stirs; he wants to trust, but has forgotten how. He finds his loyalties torn between two absolute, irreconcilable moral codes.This tapestry of characters and situations collides violently with the kidnappers, who clearly desire to make some ill-defined point. Mia, a dedicated survivor, begins working her captors’ ideological loyalties, unpacking what makes their barbarity tick. But her kidnappers prove only the surface of a deeper scheme. Powerful, deeply connected interests are using Mia to distract Italian and international forces from a conspiracy dating to the very beginnings of the Cold War.Jonathan Holt loves playing in the past. Though Ederle’s presence overlooking Venice seems a lingering Cold War ghost, partly outdated now that Venice isn’t the border between NATO and WARSAW, in Holt’s telling, it retains connections to the past, built partly on abandoned Nazi foundations, and present, located centrally for airlifts from North Africa and the Middle East. In Holt’s world, the past is never really gone.Holt tells a gripping story. While his characters face the absolute implacability of awful people doing terrible things to a defenseless girl, they must persevere through their own interior struggles. Every principal character has scars lingering from the previous novel. Each also faces stubborn rules established by their respective bureaucracies. If our protagonists hope to rescue Mia, they must first overcome their own circumstances.That said, this novel isn’t perfect. Besides his story, Holt has a point he hopes readers remember, a point regarding how realpolitik creates a gulf between a people’s ideals and its practices. He occasionally stops the narrative to lecture readers about his message, with increasing frequency as the story progresses. If your text has a thesis statement, consider, please, whether you’d rather write nonfiction than a political thriller.Some early readers have criticized Holt’s storytelling because he views American global involvement very dimly. Some say this story makes America the “bad guy.” I disagree: though American military leadership emerges shamefaced from Holt’s story, so does the Carabinieri, the EU, and the international justice system. Holt, a political liberal but social conservative, clearly dislikes governments broadly. That just happens to include America’s. Anti-state Republicans may find their loyalties torn.Essentially, Holt wants to cobble a realistic political thriller from a medley of real-world and fictional elements. He mostly succeeds. If he intermittently feels compelled to remind readers how we ought to receive his message, that’s high-handed, but in light of his gripping narrative, forgivable. Because his characters and situations are undeniably engaging, and his lectures short, the story proceeds apace. Overall, the story readers come seeking, they will find.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OWZSJKEIBUDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062267043#wasThisHelpful","R2OWZSJKEIBUDA","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A fluke accident kills James Putnam on a midnight Minneapolis byway, everything seems normal. Putnam lived quietly, made no waves, and vanished as noiselessly as he lived. Except a crooked trial lawyer discovers that the deceased isn’t James Putnam. Now disgraced detective Alexander Rupert, busted to Frauds Division, has a genuine mystery to unravel. And fake James Putnam’s lies may only represent the merest shadow of the real horror.Allen Eskens’ second novel provides an interesting dualism. His concept, about the ways everybody assumes false identities, brims with potential. As Detective Rupert investigates fake Putnam, he also struggles with his own pending corruption investigation. He confronts his possibly unfaithful wife. His wife strives to appear rich, and failing that, strives to act single. Distraught, Rupert vanishes into fake Putnam’s mysterious girlfriend, who appears strangely un-bereaved.But while Eskens proffers this interesting theme, he writes in very prosaic, declarative tones. Nearly every scene of dialog involves two people in a room. Virtually all exposition comes in blocks, many of which take up entire chapters (which are very short, averaging barely four pages). Eskins describes Rupert’s discovery of his wife’s likely infidelity in the same blunt tones as a witness in a prior chapter describing a fifteen-year-old crime.This creates tension between Eskens’ smart, rich themes, and his leaden storytelling. Eskens’ press bio says he’s enjoyed a twenty-year defense attorney career, which probably explains plenty. Lawyers strive to excise ambiguity and subjectivity from language, creating something everyone can agree upon as clearly defined, the dialect known as “legal-ese.” In this novel, as in business contracts, all meaning exists, immune from debate, right at the surface.Not that that’s always bad. This actually serves the subplot regarding Rupert’s pending corruption investigation. Thought caught in an overly broad dragnet, Rupert must nevertheless prove his innocence versus his blatantly corrupt ex-partner. Rupert’s brother Max, a senior detective, coaches Rupert in answering questions in ways that crafty lawyers cannot entrap him later. It forces Rupert into domains of honesty that make him deeply uncomfortable.But elsewhere, this law-minded approach doesn’t work equally well. Eskens describes a world divided into camps of good and evil. Rupert, a Medal of Valor winner before his disgrace, is undeniably good. Eskens pits him against a ruthless assassin, Drago Basta, who is undeniably bad. Not only does Eskens describe Drago’s ruthless glee in violence, and his first-resort reliance on killing, he explicitly describes Drago as having “no soul.”Even excepting the theological implications of such nonsense, this Manichean gulf rings hollow. As Eskens unspools Drago’s personal history, I felt remarkable sympathy. Born amid violence, he survived by wits, grit, and refusal to let fear rule him. But after the war ended, the tools that kept him alive proved maladaptive to peacetime. In another novel, possibly by William Morrell, Drago would’ve been the protagonist, or a worthy antihero anyway.Sadly, this represents Eskens’ entire approach. His story occupies entirely black-and-white ethical space, exemplified by characters’ names. The brother Rupert considers the ultimate barometer of goodness and order is named Max. As James Putnam’s wall of lies collapses, the investigation turns to someone named Jericho Pope. (Men with JP initials are weirdly common.) And Rupert battles Drago Basta, whose name is an obvious cognate for “Dragon Bastard.”I wanted to like this book. I persevered through Eskens’ laboured prose, perforated with chapters so short you could practically see the camera cuts and crossfades, because I found his premise interesting. I wanted to see how he’d continue unpacking his themes of dishonesty, false faces, and the gap between who we want to be and how others receive us. Eskens’ ideas are, without qualification, quite good.But his writing is a blunt instrument. He doesn’t tease out the implications of his themes, leading his audience on a journey; he declares the discoveries and their points. At times, as with Drago Basta’s morally ambiguous backstory, Eskens’ attempts to steer our perceptions (“he felt the last trace of his soul leave his body”) made me balk. I wanted to scream: that’s not what your story actually says!Perhaps this book works for audiences who prefer to exclude ambiguity. Perhaps some readers like being told what to think. But Eskens’ committed core audience reads mysteries and thrillers regularly, and would, I believe, prefer authors who take them on a journey. This is less like exploring Eskens’ world, more like a theme park attraction, everything prescreened and controlled. I reached the end, put the book down, and merely shrugged.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12H474DJXDLBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633880761#wasThisHelpful","R12H474DJXDLBU","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Its 36 bright white LED bulbs create an ambient glow almost the same color as full sunlight, making reading off a white page, or a reflective (non-backlit) surface like a Kindle, much more of a pleasure and much less of an eye strain than reading in yellowish incandescent light. The swing arm has three points of adjustment, and the head rotates a full 180 degrees, making positioning this light for utmost reading clarity both easy and pleasant.

"When I was in high school, my phys-ed teachers put me onto jumping rope as a good form of cardio exercise that doesn't require team-sports competition, which I dislike. Having been previously told that jump ropes were for little girls, using one sized for a tall, gangly geek like me turned out to be a pleasant revelation. But after school ended, the only jump rope I had access to was my sister's... and that ended when I moved out of my parents' house. Sporting goods clerks look at you funny if you ask about jump ropes. Oh well.Decades later, the manufacturer offered me the opportunity to review this jump rope, and it was like coming home. I took it out on the porch and began pushing myself to see how long I could keep up the exercise. This nylon cord, with hard plastic handles, turned out to be lightweight enough that its weight didn't get in the way of my jumping. Also the rope itself is a single piece of nylon, not woven fibers like the ones I used in class, so there's less risk of fraying and damage, This is truly a jump rope suitable both for child's play and adult exercise.The manufacturer deftly handles every fear I had before this device arrived. I'm unusually tall, so I expected to have difficulty making this rope work for my size. But it's adjustable, and has more than enough length to embrace my six-foot-four frame. The hollow handles are lightweight enough to let me focus all my energy on my jumping, but sturdy enough to ensure I won't negligently crush them in my grip. Also, the handles have non-slip texture. I almost beaned a classmate in phys-ed with a slippery handle, so that's important to me.Also, the integrated counter, in the right handle, lets you match your jump numbers with your time invested, without having to keep count in your head. I appreciate that, since I don't like having to divide my attention while I'm exercising: my workouts are like Buddhist meditation, I want to be completely in the moment. Without having to count myself, or do the ""A My Name Is Alice"" thing, I can focus my attention entirely on making sure I'm getting the most efficient, powerful muscular improvement out of my efforts. Because, for me, paying 100% attention is just more fun.So, in short, whether you want a jump rope for exercise or for fun—though of course it can be both!—this is a good product which you'll find useful for years. If you give it to children, the adjustable rope allows the length to grow with them. If you give it to adults, it makes for good, aerobically focused exercise that gets the blood pumping without the frustration of team sports. And if, like me, you simply want to keep moving and stay young, it's a good way to make your workouts into a game. I've missed my ropes. It's good to have one back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14SVRQBTPRQ3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UUNPHHI#wasThisHelpful","R14SVRQBTPRQ3P","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a longstanding fondness for cereal bars and other handheld snack foods. My parents often gave me Nature Valley granola bars to tide me over after school. So, given the opportunity to taste-test and evaluate this product, I jumped on the chance. It's right up my street. I have many good compliments to lavish upon this product; I have only one criticism, and you can decide how important it is.First, this product is tasty. As the ""cheesecake"" name suggests, it has flavors of fruit and cream cheese, so it's generally sweet; but it isn't the kind of sweet that makes my dental work hurt. It has an understated, grown-up sort of sweetness that makes for a nice snack, maybe something to stick in a lunchbox or picnic basket, so you can feel mildly self-indulgent by eating a cheesecake bar after finishing your vegetables.It also has a robust texture. I grow frustrated buying products like this, to find that when I bite into them, they often feel either like a mushy sponge cake, or so crispy I'm afraid I'll break my teeth. Not this one. This feels firm but chewy, they texture of my mother's homemade raisin bread, so it feels substantial between your teeth, like a real meal, but not crunchy. This snack has substance, but doesn't feel like work.The basic problem is, it isn't very filling. Having received one box for review, I took it to work with me, figuring I could have one per day as a midday snack for the entire week. Instead, I wolfed the entire box in one sitting, without really thinking about it until I noticed I was holding an empty box. If you're even slightly hungry when you start on this, you'll inhale the entire box before you've noticed yourself doing it.So. It's a tasty, substantial snack. According to the box, it's rich in nutrition, including—not surprising from Fiber One—fiber, so it's actually good for you, not just candy. But each bar is so small that just one isn't enough. It's embarassingly easy to wind up scarfing the whole thing down mindlessly. So if you get this, dole it out to yourself cautiously. Otherwise, you'll eat an all-carb meal before you even notice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LPBN568JE3NQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VLSZABY#wasThisHelpful","R1LPBN568JE3NQ","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Former Olympic downhill skier Luke Cooper thought he'd lost everything when a globally televised wipeout shattered his body. French physician Henri de Salvo did more than heal Luke's body; he revitalized Luke's spirit. Now a doctor himself, Luke has returned to France to join his mentor's charitable clinic. But de Salvo's philanthropic faade conceals dark secrets, which powerful, connected individuals might kill to uncover... or bury. Luke finds himself in someone's crosshairs. The first question is, whose?Dr. Stacy Childs, MD, apparently hopes to claim similar territory to Robin Cook, American surgeon turned thriller writer. Like Cook, Childs melds cutting-edge medical research with the oldest secrets powerful men vigorously conceal. Unfortunately, like Cook, he lards an otherwise promising story with obvious personal wish fulfillment. Childs' protagonist has such incisive medical insight, athletic accomplishment, and sexual prowess, it's tough to avoid thinking Dr. Childs is projecting his personal aspirations through a rose-colored lens.I knew I was in for a bad ride when a ""staggeringly beautiful"" but conveniently nameless woman, without asking first, undresses and sexually ravishes our protagonist before page 30. This just pages after a massive state-sponsored beating, including multiple kidney punches. That Cooper can walk, much less have sex, defies likelihood. Childs rushes so furiously to name-check standard James Bond tropes that he doesn't bother to first make sure we actually care about his character.Childs' medical grounding has solid foundation. Almost immediately after arriving, Luke discovers that his mentor's charitable clinic conceals a top-secret facility, almost science fictional in its technological advancement, conducting mind-bending experimental medicine, for those who can afford it. But Dr. de Salvo's motivations aren't entirely humanitarian. De Salvo might be skirting medical ethics in pursuing salvation. He's certainly experimenting on human subjects. His success justifies further risk-taking, and Luke might be an experimenter, or getting experimented upon.This pitches Luke into terrible conflicts. Though Dr. de Salvo's motivations make him squirm, the forces arrayed against de Salvo aren't much better. State-based thugs, criminal syndicates, and international terrorists want what this clinic produces. Some want to silence de Salvo's discoveries; others want to steal and misuse them. And it's impossible for Luke to identify who really deserves his trust. He's forced to step outside the order, playing both sides against the middle, to discover the truth.Okay, so: the raw thumbnail of Childs' story concept sounds exciting. I wanted to like Childs' narrative, and persevered long after his prose became discouragingly stereotyped. Like Robin Cook or Michael Palmer, his medical specificity lends his narrative a veneer of realistic, even educational, heft. But like them, Childs' realism dresses stories that veer into extravaganzas of Dan Brown-ish implausibility. Their mysteries often spiral uncontrollably, presenting doctor heroes who are half Quincy, half Charles Bronson.Basically, I wanted to like this book better. I tried to like this book. But the author kept getting between me and the story, spotlighting the nakedly recycled tropes, authorial wish fulfillment, and Bruce Wayne-ish protagonist. The more I set this book down, the harder it became to pick it back up again. At some point, I realized I hadn't read any more in three days. That, I realized, is everything you'll need to know.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IW8BJ7DKYN33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937530868#wasThisHelpful","R1IW8BJ7DKYN33","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I find myself torn in how to review this series. I like the stand-up clips around which this series is built, and find myself laughing frequently. The producers use prepared live performance clips, mostly from L.A. venues but also some other locations, of female comedians doing material that’s targeted at women, but also accessible to dudes. I gave many genuine laughs while watching this, because it moves rapidly, stays fresh, and never bogs down on any one performer.But the formatting suffers. First, whoever did the final digital transfer clearly went from one aspect ratio to another, leaving the picture distorted. All the images are anamorphically squashed, making the women look short and fat. (Okay, some *are* short and fat, and joke about it. Nevertheless…) I could only get good image quality by watching this on my smartphone and turning the screen forty-five degrees from my eyeline. Otherwise, everybody just looked weird, and the picture was hard to stomach.And the linking content doesn’t help. The first five episodes are “hosted” by Marianne Sierk, who mugs briefly and does stilted introductions to each performer. I’ve seen live footage of Sierk, so I know she isn’t actually this stiff and uncomfortable in performance. I can only imagine that standing before a green-screen backdrop and performing for a single unmoving camera sucks the energy from the room, because she’s usually much better than this. Then, from episode four, they replace Sierk with Jamie Brunton, who, if anything, looks even *more* unnatural and wooden.So to really enjoy this show, I have to compartmentalize. I do like the performers. I know this is unpopular to say, but I generally prefer women stand-ups anyway; this show’s sibling series, Man Up Stand-Up, is little more than a series of unfunny grunts, where this has genuine character. But to enjoy this show, I have to work around the visually unpleasant formatting and the fakey MC footage. I like parts of this show. But, like getting pearls from clams, I must work around what I don’t like.

But when a rogue rabbi and a zealous g-man pressure Stone to relinquish secrets even he doesn’t know, he realizes his father concealed untold power deep within his beloved books.

Seasoned readers will recognize the same Jewish literary heritage that nourishes David Mamet, Jonathan Lethem, and countless less-famous writers. Papernick’s story isn’t even original to Jonathan Papernick; this novel is a reworked re-release of ""Who By Fire, Who By Blood"", by “Jon” Papernick. This book follows trails already familiar and well-respected.Don’t misunderstand me. Though Papernick participates in Jewish literary tradition, he doesn’t merely obey it. Like his protagonist, he darts into and out from tradition, suddenly religious, now humanist; alternately separatist and assimilated; militantly Hebrew and steadfastly Anglophone. He uses tradition without ever feeling anchored to it. Thus, Papernick’s story frequently feels familiar without ever becoming common. What readers receive will reflect what they expect.Stone comes from deeply mixed birthright. His grandfather Julius Stone reputedly served as triggerman for the notorious Brownsville Mafia. Julius’ son Walter Stone rejected Julius, studied law, and became The Judge. But The Judge was reputedly corrupt, doctoring cases to let fellow Jews walk. And after The Judge’s death, it appears he funneled money to violent Zionist organizations, possibly using Julius’ old connections. Connections hidden in Stone’s bequest of books.Abandoned by his mother, dominated by his father, unwilling to learn Hebrew or participate in Jewish religion, Stone makes the perfect picture of half-secularized Brooklyn turmoil. But following The Judge’s passing, Stone realizes everything he believed was fabricated. His mother had reasons to flee. The Judge’s coldness probably represented a long plan cut short by mortality. Getting both criminals and cops off his back may require returning to the faith.Deep among Stones secrets lies Fairuza. Following a rather self-indulgent collegiate breakdown, The Judge packed Stone off to a West Bank kibbutz, thinking time spent in the Homeland would cure Stone’s vapors. But Stone fled to Jerusalem, where he romanced Fairuza, a beautiful Palestinian Christian, embodiment of everything The Judge despises. Stone could’ve defied The Judge, but didn’t; Fairuza’s faith after Stone’s return to America proves his biggest guilt, and most powerful secret.Papernick’s publisher markets this novel as a “thriller,” which perhaps isn’t altogether true, considering how Papernick’s cerebral storytelling somewhat mutes his story’s thrills. Papernick writes deliberately, thoughtfully, more interested in characters’ motivations than cinematic display. This cultivates dawning awareness rather than shocking jolts. Despite his gangland milieu, Papernick clearly prefers guiding audiences to deep revelations, than peppering us with sudden explosions.This tone requires certain trade-offs. Anyone buying this novel expecting James Patterson-ish plot-driven commotion will find Papernick’s style confounding. Protagonist Stone (consistently addressed thus, “Stone”) spends early chapters enrapt in long, wretched self-pity. He requires nearly a quarter of this book’s considerable mass to overcome inertia and begin unpacking The Judge’s riddles—though that quarter proves immensely valuable later. Getting into this book requires some effort.Persistent readers will find this book rewards such investments with generous dividends. Stone finds himself inheriting the nexus of a transnational conspiracy that should’ve been his father’s responsibility. Forced into his father’s footsteps, the path he’s always avoided, Stone begins reevaluating everything he’s ever believed, including himself. Reality, as Stone knows it, proves to be a massive edifice of lies; I didn’t mention David Mamet frivolously earlier.If the review volumes I’ve received accurately reflect the larger publishing world, 2015 is proving the Year of the Jew. I’ve received three times as many Jewish-themed books in 2015 to date as I’ve received since I began reviewing. But this trend isn’t uniformly self-congratulatory. Besides giddy autobiographical novels and laudatory histories, I’ve read apostasy memoirs, novels of deceit, and this often-opaque tale of self-loathing and ethnic violence.This novel doesn’t reveal its secrets lightly, not to its protagonist, and not to us. It resists casual beach reading. But for readers willing to brave Papernick’s densely plotted writing—and his annoyingly low-key tone—will find a story reflecting Jewish America’s, and all America’s, struggles between tradition and individuality. Don’t undertake this novel flippantly. It demands big sacrifices from intellectually engaged readers, but offers generous rewards and vast insights in return.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPQOT4F72U61B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941493041#wasThisHelpful","RPQOT4F72U61B","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Inspector Robbie Lewis learned police work from the best. Having apprenticed under the late Inspector Morse, he absorbed the three most important skills: asking questions that provoke suspects to confess more than they realize, making facts equal more than the sum of their parts, and getting under his superiors’ skin.  Now Oxford’s CID has given him his own leads. And he’s more than ready to crush anyone who gets in his way.This series, simply entitled “Lewis” in Britain, is ITV’s first attempt to create a sequel to its eternally lucrative “Inspector Morse” franchise. It succeeds because it creates the same tension its parent series enjoyed, but doesn’t merely copy past successes. The creative team offers distinctive, complex characters in difficult situations, and trusts the audience to follow fairly intricate plots. It follows Morse’s patterns without slavishly aping them.Where Lewis was once Morse’s sergeant, streetwise but lacking his superior’s book learning or experience, Lewis is now the master. He still doesn’t have book smarts; for that he relies upon his own sergeant, Hathaway, a Cambridge boy who inexplicably turned copper. But if Lewis lacks comprehensive knowledge, he’s learned how to find and apply facts appropriately. He’s become quite the researcher, finding and utilizing knowledge where it advances his case.As before, stories turn around the contrast between Oxford University and the working class community surrounding it. All three first-series (first-season) episodes feature university denizens preying upon the community, or vice versa: a bacchanalian secret society that literally uses poor people’s bodies as resources, and the vengeful survivor who perpetrates the ultimate lie to uncover them.A machiavellian student journalist who finds a career-making story at the nexus of celebrity gossip and public security paranoia, and pays for her discovery with her life.A guilt-ridden old professor who knows the real reason a pretty young mother died violently, but won’t disclose the truth unless the police do his dirty work for him.This series (season) comprises three ninety-minute episodes. Though that’s broadly shorter than the old Morse series, which generally consisted of three or four two-hour episodes, the slightly shorter story arcs have a certain punchy clarity. Even fans like me will admit many Morse stories had “hammock” content, scenes where little happened, which served to fill out the allotted length. No such filler here. These stories hit high tension early, and never flag.The popularity of short-run series with feature length episodes has exploded internationally, mainly behind the influence of the BBC’s “Sherlock.” But American viewers, like me, who discovered Morse on PBS in the 1990s remember when such stories were our own little secret. This feels like our reward for remembering the old days. It’s every inch Morse’s successor without being its knock-off. I love it. If you watched Morse, you probably will too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1URJA3CS1KEO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0079W9QDE#wasThisHelpful","R1URJA3CS1KEO0","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm of two minds about energy drinks. Too often they taste medicinal, and besides being loaded with caffeine and sugar, many have dangerously high levels of vitamin B complex.

"Back around the middle 1990s, the Centre Pompidou, one of France’s nerve centers of public intellectualism, commissioned Marxist philosopher Jacques Rancière to write mid-length essays coinciding with exhibitions of film and art, respectively. These essays provided snapshots into Rancière’s thought, without needing to grasp his exceedingly dense prose stylings. But the essays languished unreprinted, and untranslated into English, for nearly twenty years. Until now.These essays, one on historical film and one on art-on-canvas, focus a socially engaged conviction onto Twentieth Century art expression. Such artworks, Rancière contends, represent a distinct relationship with power. This may reflect the power exhibited by traditional control centers— he commences by describing a powerful general instructing peasants how to kneel before the czar— or the power artists exercise in determining what does, or doesn’t, merit immortalization in art.Rancière, whom humanist thinkers would consider a patron saint of the 1968 uprisings if sainthood didn’t require transcendence, maintains a sideline in modernist aesthetics. Yet for him, as for George Orwell, art and politics are inextricable: all art carries a message, and that message resonates with institutions of power. Art may lack political party, but it exists within a social continuum of power and subordination. Rancière purposes to pick this continuum apart.Reading these essays involves a trade-off. Anyone familiar with Twentieth Century French philosophy knows authors pride themselves on hermetic inscrutability; finding a thesis or through-line is often prohibitively difficult. So it remains here; but in exchange, these two essays together total under 100 pages, and are essentially self-contained. This permits more casual reading, since you needn’t have savvied Rancière’s preceding corpus, though it never becomes easy.For Rancière, “history” isn’t some objective facts which students can memorize. We constantly make and remake history, he contends, with the stories we tell about the past. Rancière, in the second, and probably more digestible, essay, identifies “four senses of history” and “three forms of history [art].” Therefore, many debates active today about how to utilize history in the present exist because people don’t realize they’re using different sense and different forms.In Rancière’s first essay, he focuses on historical representations in cinema, both documentary and artistic. The camera, he says, is essentially an instrument of power: it shows what directors, writers, and in state-controlled media, what politicians want it to show. Yet being inanimate, its power is offset by remarkable passivity. This tension comes across in storytelling techniques that combine staunch realism with novelistic narrative. The combination, he implies, sits uneasy.His second essay deals with painting, though its implications could apply to all static art. He particularly focuses on modernist aesthetic, which distorts and upends conventional historical narratives. This sometimes involves ventures into the pre-modernist milieu that nurtured modernism; he particularly appreciates the twin threads of rebelliousness and commercialism implied in Francisco Goya’s works. This reflects how art simultaneously challenges and appeases power.Rancière’s choice of source material may stymie non-Francophone readers. His film essay name-checks multiple art films, mostly French and German, mostly from the 1980s and 1990s, which you’ve probably never seen. Throughout his art essay, I recognized only two named artists, Goya and Warhol. The book provides no reference illustrations, a severe limitation; I found myself searching images on my smartphone every few minutes. Digital image-checkers will aid in reading.Nevertheless, Rancière provides an engaging survey of how visual arts read history. His revisionist Marxist perspective shines throughout his telling; for him, aesthetics inevitably reflect power structures, an interpretation that certainly won’t sit with the “I just want to be entertained” crowd. However, as he carefully dismantles the unspoken assumptions permeating art’s sweeping gestalt, it’s hard to deny his viewpoint may have some legitimate foundation.This book strikes a difficult balance. It isn’t easy fun-time reading, certainly. But compared to most philosophy by living thinkers, Rancière included, it’s remarkably accessible, with an eye toward audiences who haven’t already exhaustively read Rancière’s back catalog. This makes an interesting introduction to contemporary Marxist aesthetic, or an alternate viewpoint for art and film buffs. But however you elect to read it, rest assured, it asks questions you’ll struggle to answer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8R9E0QEF3ISV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745679579#wasThisHelpful","R8R9E0QEF3ISV","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two other Bluetooth speakers from this manufacturer, so I opened the package with high expectations. And this product didn't disappoint. It's slightly longer than my palm, and the width is such that I can wrap my fist around it. Too big to make it disappear like a coin onstage, but small enough to fit in a coat pocket or the outside pocket of your attache case. It's also plenty big enough to carry your music, your audio book, or to double as a speakerphone attachment for voice calls.As I said, I found this speaker every bit equal to others I've owned from this same manufacturer, in terms of its sound ability. But just to be sure, I tried an experiment: I took this puppy to work with me. I work construction, and between the sounds of various motorized equipment, power tools, people shouting, and general outdoor noise from the adjoining street, my workplace has no concept of the word ""quiet."" What better place to test a speaker's quality than a place where the ambient noise level is always high?The sound quality proved more than sufficient to compete with ordinary sound. When I had to run an electric hammer drill, or when one of the forklifts drove twenty feet away, my music continued loud and clear. It couldn't compete with exceptional sound, like when I had to fire up my diesel-powered scissor lift and run the engine up to the second story. But nothing can compete with that; people standing right next to me have to shout to make themselves heard. So this speaker works for ordinary sounds you'll likely encounter.It also has an unusually rich bass line. Though the picture above shows it sitting up, looking unidirectional, and one side does have rubberized feet, suggesting there's a correct way to set this up for regular use, I've found that, if you lay it on its back, the sound radiates outward, capturing the acoustics of the entire room, while accentuating the bass for optimum resonance. This is a very good speaker for music and other audio uses, and will do you proud. (I haven't had a chance to try the speakerphone feature.)So if, like me, you got your smartphone so you could download streaming audio players, or if you want to connect a quality speaker to you mp3 player and make a homemade boom box, this one will do the trick. Just remember, it's a regular speaker, not a loudspeaker, and it'll satisfy your every reasonable demand.Acknowledgements to the manufacturer, who provided a sample for review. As always, my opinions are entirely my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C109SJXEYZRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GGX8LBA#wasThisHelpful","R3C109SJXEYZRX","A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Several people had recommended I try bentonite clay and I am glad a friend gave me a chance to try this product. As a first warning do not mix this clay onto something metal, it will decrease the effectiveness of the clay.I have used this clay for a few things now. Initially I bought it to heal a burn that left a red mark, a pretty large red mark. It's been working on that. I've also started using it on my chin which has helped with the discoloration and blackheads that i thought were permanent dark marks of pores that constantly got blackheads. My chin is clear.I used this as a foot detox as well.The best though, I used this on a boil, and it drew out the gross stuff right away. This will be my go to for boils, as well as bug bites. This works way better than calamine lotion on bug bites.Some info about bentonite incase you don't know:According to Mountain Rose Herbs:“Bentonite, also referred to as Montmorillonite, is one of the most effective and powerful healing clays. Bentonite can be used externally as a clay poultice, mud pack or in the bath and, in skin care recipes. A good quality Bentonite should be a grey/cream color and anything bordering “pure white” is suspect. It has a very fine, velveteen feel and is odorless and non-staining. The type of bentonite offered by Mountain Rose herbs is a Sodium Bentonite.”Bentonite Clay is composed of aged volcanic ash.

"Very easy to put on my dog and she doesn't mind it at all, this has stopped her pulling to the point that it is manageable.I did not measure her prior to buying this, she is a 45lb mixed breed however she is muscular and chesty and this just barely fit her. It would be lovely if they come out with more sizes as this would not fit my larger dog, who doesn't really need one, but it would be helpful for other owners.It's very nice looking and well made and the leash is comfortable to hold. I prefer a slightly thicker leash however I can switch leashes as needed depending on what I am doing with the dogs. Great deal considering I've paid more than $15 for a harness alone without a leash for my dogs in the past, and this is much better quality than many of the ones I have bought in the past.Very easy to adjust the size. The ease of use of this harness makes it well worth it for the benefits of a no pull harness.This is not a front clip harness, or a tightening front clip harness which are generally what someone would want in a no pull harness.

No, and you can't expect it to. The original had different humor than seen in other movies, once it's done once you can't expect to laugh the same in a sequel. It was still funny though. I wish they had more from the quiet asian. It still made both of us laugh.Was there new humor or was it the same style as the first? There was new humor. The magician had some great lines and Fat Amy and Bumper have some great moments together.We both enjoyed the film, not as much as the first but it was still great. Would I buy the movie? I don't know, I likely will buy it because I would still watch it again. The soundtrack was not as good as the first.I would not recommend watching this movie if you haven't seen the first.

"The vials are listed as 1/4 Dram, and then in the description they say 1 dram (1.5ml). The volume of the ones I recieved is 1.5ml, which is not 1/4 dram or 1 dram, but just 1.5ml.  1/4 dram is .92ml.  I use them for making essential oil blends when I want to make a small amount. They hold approximately 30 drops. So if you are using them for this purpose and you also have 1.5 ml bottles, 30 drops is what I use for my master blends.I do not use the reducers on these, I use an eye dropper or a pippette to get the oil out when I want to use them.The glass is weak like another reviewer stated, however I have not found any in this bottle style that are stronger. If you want a stronger 1-2ml bottle you should purchase the taller style bottles,w hich have rather thick glass. OR use the clear glass vials that look like perfume testers, and you can stick many of them inside one amber or colbalt jar for storage.

"Great sound from these, I was very surprised since I own other small speakers that didn't get sound close to this.This has a 2000mAh battery that you recharge through USB. This works with any of those external battery packs to give you longer battery life if you are camping.I got the blue and it was accurate to the photo, I love the colors of these. It's a little heavy for me to consider attaching it with a carbiner to carry around would be a good idea. But for drunk camping or outdoor parties, the carbiner attachment is always good just to add that extra level of protection to ensure the speaker doesn't go flying. It does seem durable enough to take a big fall though. I got a chance to try this product out at a discount as part of a review panel to provide feedback, and I am very glad because it's an awesome bluetooth speaker and better than the others I have, and perfect for outdoors.Charge time really was 3 hours. Playback time is 10 hours.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKR8F118FO9NO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OACKLBC#wasThisHelpful","RKR8F118FO9NO","A2KNQJAOR4741E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KNQJAOR4741E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Clove, Cinnamon Bark, Rosemary, Lemon and Eucalyptus make up this blend, this is an undiluted 100% pure therapeutic blend of essential oils.Scent: I like the scent, it is a strong scent though, but christmasy, which most people like, I can't imagine someone finding this scent to be offensive.I apply this at a 2% dilution on me, to my feet at the pressure points in my feet and my spine, and then I follow the pressure points associated with what illness I am trying to ward off. I have no doubt that this oil is effective because my husband is military and around new Marines non stop as he is an instructor, and with that amount of people he brought home pretty much every cold and flu I could think of. I haven't gotten sick since using this blend, which is about 6 months now.I highly recommend dilution starting with a low dilution because of the hot oils in it. I have sensitive skin so I started with 1% to see how I handled it, and I stayed at 2% and find this works just fine. Wash your hands after because it is not pleasant to get this in your eye by accident, or your lips. I have seen others recommend this oil applied to the lips, but I can not recommend that because the clove and cinnamon bark may irritate as they are powerful oils.If you don't know the story behind the Four Thieves I recommend you read it just so you know where this came from. It's about 4 thieves who were robbing graves and using these ingredients to ward off the plague. It's interesting to just know the story behind it.There are a ton of uses for this oil and you will find many just by using google.

I am all about essential oils and their benefit, but no, they are not better than probiotics, if you need probiotics take probiotics please.

"I am reviewing the 16 slot charger, which charges AA and AAA batteries. Things I like about this-I can charge an odd number of batteries, this charger doesn't care, unlike some others that needed two at a time-It will charge AA and AAA at the same time.-It can discharge and charge , I didn't actually realize that until I got the unit-When i put the batteries in, I set it to discharge, once discharged they will automatically switch over and charge them.-The screen lets you monitor what each battery is doingNow what I don't like-It's a little hard to get the batteries out-I've noticed sometimes my batteries seem like they are in, but aren't quite clicked in and I have to go back to at least one every time and click it in so it will show up on the screenI have charged several brands in this, not sure if that makes a difference to people, but eneloops, the amazon brand ones, duracell and panasonic brands, as well as sunlabz own batteries. All charge just fine. All discharge just fine.I am very glad I got to try sunlabz, I got to try this product out as a tester and provide honest feedback and an unbiased review, I also got to try their batteries which were right up there with the expensive ones.

"Ill be honest, I bought this because it was the only one like it that I could find. I had previously used storage tubs, and the type, but i am very glad I purchased this. It is deep, the handle is strong and easy to carry without spilling and very high quality, I doubt the handle will break.I soak for 30 minunites and it stays hot the entire time. I put 1 cup epsom salt in.If you are soaking with epsom salt, you need to soak for at least 12 minutes for any transdermal absorbption of the mangesium sulfate to take place. In case you don't know, magnesium chloride (the magnesium flakes, which are much more expensive), once mixed into water both the magnesium chloride and the magnesium sulfate break from their bond, so you end up with Mag either way, so if you are trying to soak, there really is no reason at all to soak in the more expensive magnesium chloride vs the magnesium sulfate.If you want to add essential oils to your food soak, oils do not mix with water so they will not be diluted, which can be harsh on the skin, they will also sit on top of the water. The best way to avoid this is to drop essential oil drops in the salt, or the baking soda first, which will help disperse the oils throughout the water, they will still not mix as oil is still not soluble in water, but they will be more dispersed.I went through so many of the more expensive massage type foot baths and they all ended up being crap, I am so glad I purchased this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30SDKHNJG3GCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002TCV6GE#wasThisHelpful","R30SDKHNJG3GCX","A2KNQJAOR4741E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KNQJAOR4741E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This has the ingredients in it to allow me to replace 2 products. I was previously applying tea tree, and benzyl peroxide separately.

They will minimize chipping and peeling of your nails.- Glass nail files are easier to shape with and easier to remove discoloration on your nails without making your nail look like you ran it across pavement- Glass files are last forever. They are permanent etched and will never wear down.- They are easy to clean. You can easily sterilize a glass nail file with hot water and soap, alcohol, etc. This is huge to eliminate any issues of contamination and fungus-Glass files are beautiful and elegant.

"Here is the info I found off their websiteGeneral Information: Packaged in dark amber glass bottle with euro style dropper.Botanical Name: Melaleuca alternifoliaPlant Part: LeavesExtraction Method: Steam DistilledOrigin: AustraliaColor: Colorless to pale yellow clear liquid.Consistency: ThinAromatic Scent: Tee Tree Essential Oil has a fresh, antiseptic and medicinal scent. It also has characteristic mint and spice back-notes.Strength of Aroma: MediumBlends well with: Cinnamon Bark, Clary Sage, Clove Bud, Geranium, Lavender, Lemon, Myrrh, Nutmeg, Rosewood, Rosemary and Thyme.IndicationsContemporary Uses: Tea Tree Essential Oil is best known as a very powerful immune stimulant. It can help to fight all three categories of infectious organisms (bacteria, fungi, and viruses), and there is evidence that Tea Tree Oil massages prior to an operation may help to fortify the body and reduce post-operative shock. Used in vapor therapy, Tea Tree Oil can help with colds, measles, sinusitis and viral infections. For skin and hair, Tea Tree has been used to combat acne, oily skin, head lice, dandruff, toenail fungus, yeast infections, skin tags, cold sores, dandruff, and ringworm.I like tea tree oil for skin tags and for getting rid of dust mites. It's also great for adding to a foot soak. Essential oils don't mix with water so you are best putting them in epsom salt first before a foot bath to help disperse them. Also you can make a rollerball of this with a carrier oil diluted (diluted is really best to avoid irritation and sensitization)I really like that this company puts the bottled date on the bottle.

You can leave it in as long as you want, and wrap your hair in saran wrap for an even more intense conditioning. When you have a good idea of how much to use, you can do it on damp hair. You can mix with coconut oil if you want the benefits of both. Wash it out with a good lathering shampoo after.If you want to use it as a leave in, I recommend just two drops applied to the ends and then the fly aways. I put the drops in my palm and rub my hands together and apply just 2 drops. Unless you have really thick hair you don't really need more.

"What is it about cinematic psychos, in particular the two best villains in recent memory, Anton Chigurh from No Country For Old Men and Lorne Malvo from Fargo, and terrible hair? In the case of those two, both of them deadly beyond normal reckoning, but apparently possessed by the spirits of trickster gods, following their strange and arbitrary whims regardless of the mostly fatal consequences, it's like a taunt. A page-boy and a bowl-cut. Two of the stupidest-looking styles ever devised by barbers, both unskilled and evil, on two of the most dangerous and compelling characters in fiction. I can only surmise they were selected as the looks most likely to provoke laughter and/or ridicule from strangers, providing all the reason they'd need to indulge their murderous predilections.Malvo may have actually been another incarnation of Chigurh; it may have been Fargo writer Noah Hawley's way of combining the two best Coen Bros films into one brilliant series... but Thornton did some great work with the character, a far more playful, but just as charismatic and malevolent version of the enigma that Javier Bardem made all his own.This second season takes us back a couple decades. It's awesome, even without Malvo... or Chigurh. But there's some newly minted killers playing deadly serious games of their own, and a lot of really bad hair. It bodes well for the gods of blood and chaos... and every last bit of it's still as true as the film was.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1899X9RLMC0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016624Z7Y#wasThisHelpful","R1899X9RLMC0C","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know why I'd expect anything better, but Supernatural fans are drinking the cult Kool-Aid if they think this series still deserves three stars or higher. It's now reached the tipping point -- after 5 very entertaining seasons and 5 mostly terrible seasons, these are the episodes that will decide matters, the metaphorical weighing of the soul. Clearly, none of the writers or producers care at this point. 'The Darkness'? Kripke and the original writing staff got away with a lot of very stupid ideas, sometimes thanks to a clever sense of humor, but mostly by dropping hangers on the worst ideas, the not-so subtle winks and nods that let you know they were in on the joke; 'yeah, it's ridiculous, but this is a show about werewolves and demons, we don't take ourselves all that seriously.' Fair enough. But for the last three years in particular, there's been nothing clever, nothing new. The actors are on cruise control. This all feels a bit like life after death, as if the fans are keeping a brain-dead corpse on life-support because they don't want to let go. Ackles and Padalecki have gotten a taste of their post-Supernatural prospects, and they're both willing to ride this beast into hell... or 'The Darkness'... or whatever crap they come up with next to insult viewer intelligence. For any of us still watching at this point -- myself included -- that seems like an oxymoron. Continuing to watch just encourages them to make more of this drek. It's not as bad as 'Under the Dome', but it's knocking on the big glass fish-bowl.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CIYXNUNMPX3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014P62U02#wasThisHelpful","R2CIYXNUNMPX3M","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If Season 1 didn't really beat the fact into your skull, Season 2 will: Nic Pizzolato loves James Ellroy. Deciding to do a modern-day adaptation of Ellroy's L.A. Confidential was a gutsy decision, especially since he changed up the names and put the super-dense plot of the novel into a blender with a small amount of Chinatown and The Wire. No, we didn't really need another L.A. Confidential of any species after the brilliant, Oscar-winning mid-nineties adaptation... but I don't give a damn. This season came close to its celebrated predecessor in terms of smart, satisfying entertainment, but even if it were the best thing ever committed to film, you'd still hear someone whining about it.To make it clear, my references to a contemporary adaptation of L.A. Confidential were made in jest, but carried a gentle but valid criticism; maybe Pizzolato was unaware of it while writing, but he comes dangerously close to owing Ellroy royalties and a story credit. There's more than enough fresh inspiration and brilliance to forgive his literary love affairs, however, and enjoy the mystery as it unfolds.As cinematic art it falls short of the first block of episodes, but not all that far. Vince Vaughn, Colin Farrell, Rachel McAdams and Taylor Kitsch all deliver great performances, but none of them have the skull-rattling intensity Matt brought to Rust Cohle. In some ways, the writing and pacing are better in Season 2, but most will likely disagree with me there. Believe it or not, True Detective's first storyline was not particularly revolutionary... it was about cops with personal demons chasing down a serial killer. It 'just' did everything very, very well. This season doesn't have the originality of the first, and there's some questionable, predictable and illogical moments as the writer sends his messed-up cops careening towards their shot at redemption and a bad end -- perhaps in more ways then one.Still, if these episodes had been sent through a wormhole, dropped on the door-step of HBO circa 2003... this would be unanimously hailed as brilliant.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BOM5XFDD38QK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0106RTB9W#wasThisHelpful","R1BOM5XFDD38QK","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I thought I had already seen Beksinski's best work; after being introduced via Juxtapoz a few years back, I picked up the Morpheus book, and then the first of the Editions Treville volumes. The Morpheus volume is pretty slight and terribly designed, with one of the ugliest art-book layouts I've ever seen. The Editions Treville book is beautiful, and features many of the same oil paintings, but is a bit longer, up to 120 pages from the 80 or so in the Morpheus collection.This volume from Bosz is a far more satisfying overview of the artist's career, and also serves as an excellent biography, in both Polish AND English. It features a good number of the paintings that made his name in North America, large oil canvases that were a dark fusion of Surrealism and Fantastic Realism. He is often compared to Swiss Surrealist H.R. Giger, and both men are visionary talents who created worlds that are mysterious, disturbing and almost nihilistic; but Beksinski is by far the better artist of the two, in my opinion. He could also be compared to Ernst Fuchs and Fabrizio Clerici, especially the connection to Symbolist painters of the late 1800's, like Arnold Boecklin and Jean Delville. Beksinski's Symbolism is more instinctive, however; he did not consciously emulate the art of the past.The history of modern painting that critics like Clement Greenberg proposed, a linear succession with closely parallel movements and trends, is now obviously myopic. Anything that didn't fit in with his philosophy of painting's destiny, one that ejects all trompe l'oeil illusionism and embraces it's 2-Dimensional essence, was deliberately ignored. This was a knee-jerk reaction to photography's ascension to high art, prompting an existential crisis... suddenly, oils were not the most faithful method of capturing the world as it is. The answer -- abandon realism! But another line of historical development -- from the romantics, to the symbolists, to the cubists, futurists, new objectivists, pittura metafisica, surrealists, and fantastic realists -- culminates in the growing number of representational painters who have made their peace with photography. One of the early 20th Century artists to influence Beksinski is Otto dix... both artists have a misanthropic streak that refuses to lie and make humanity look prettier than she really is.What is most surprising about the art collected here is the number of 'new works' -- the canvases painted between the mid-90's and his death in 2005. They're absolutely stunning. As much as I like his 'Fantastic Realism', the even more surreal, sometimes abstract work he produced in the decade before his murder is the best of his career. Neither of the volumes mentioned above include substantial selections from this period, so it might be a revelation for other Beksinski fans familiar mostly with the oils from the 70's and 80's.The common criticism that followed Beksinski throughout his career is that his work is relentlessly bleak and disturbing, a pointless excursion into the ugliest corners of existence. To me, anyone who holds that opinion has simply missed the point... but it's very easy to find. Beksinski's entire career was an existential campaign to find beauty and mystery in those regions of psychic geography most fear to tread. Desolation and despair are claimed, then shaped into archetypal imagery. The horrors of the past, from mass crucifixions and impalements to the death camp holocausts of Soblibor and Treblinka, and the Atomic holocausts of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, become monstrously desolate dreamscapes where the organic and inorganic, the living and the dead, have fused. There is life in death, and death in life. Monoliths constructed from wasted corpses, skyscrapers and cathedrals wrapped in tattered, ancient leather, the actual bones and ligaments of its architectural skeleton exposed and open to the caustic, thinning atmosphere.Everything has been altered by some alchemical perversion, faces and identities obliterated. The wasteland over which Beksinski presides is also populated by living and similarly faceless creatures, usually desiccated, with too many limbs and fingers, and always blind. Everyone in Beksinski's other-earth is blind, but there is music -- the dozens of fingers are employed on horns and trumpets and flutes, making music humanity is not yet ready to hear. Our always loyal friends -- dogs and horses -- have followed humanity into the wasteland, and have been doomed to similar fates. This desolate place has music, it has faith, and it has incomprehensible rituals we can only make some sense of in our nightmares. It is beautiful. It is inspiring. Even in the wasteland there is something wonderful, if you can find the ears to hear it, the fingers to feel it. But no one had the eyes to see it, before Beksinski. He has found a way to appreciate both the threat and the promise of total nuclear annihilation, WWIII, the viral apocalypse, the great and terrible dying of all things.If you find no beauty or mystery in this book and the art, it's because you're unwilling to peer through this artists' eyes. To be clear: it's not for everyone... but it's rare that visionary art ever is. Zdzislaw Beksinski went deeper into these dark places than almost every artist before or since... his predecessors and peers: Hieronymus Bosch, Pieter Bruegel, Salvator Rosa, John Martin, Fransisco de Goya, Arnold Boecklin, Gustave Moreau, Giovanni Segantini, Jean Delville, Otto Dix, George Grosz, Ernst Fuchs, Fabrizio Clerici, Werner Tubke, Michael Triegel, Ken Currie, Glenn Brown, Ruprecht Von Kaufmann, et al.Beksinski's son, Tomasz, committed suicide in 1999. It was after this loss that Beksinski completed the most powerful and perfect works of his entire oeuvre... they are beautiful and tragic, even when divorced from their context. The artist always wanted his works to exist on their own, and insisted that any meaning should be created by the viewer. Every single painting in his (as yet uncollected) catalogue raisonne is untitled. The son dead by his own hand, the wife gone as well, the father, husband and artist left alone, finally murdered, an act of senseless violence. Beksinski knew the taste and textures of despair... and is one of the few to succeed in the alchemical transmutation of elements, turning filth into gold.P.S.: As good as this volume is, it includes works donated by Beksinski, his friends, and his patrons to the museum in his home city of Sanok. Many or most of his best work from the 70's, 80's, and 90's is held in private collections, making it difficult for any monograph to obtain their own high resolution photography... especially when it's hanging in the homes of the rich and famous. The three-volume series collecting Beksinski's work by Editions Treville, a Japanese artbook publisher, is probably the most complete. Books 1 and 2 are devoted to his paintings and photography, while Book 3 is dedicated to his drawings. Volume 1 is going for ridiculous prices, and they're all steadily increasing. The Editions Treville site still has a few copies of Book 1 left, as well as Books 2 and 3. If you buy all three together from ET, it'll cost a total of 165$ USD, shipping by EMS airmail included (it's something like 20 000 yen). I've seen volume 1 alone going for 180$, so that's a pretty good price. Here's a link to their site: http://treville.ocnk.net/product-group/14There is also a fourth 'Editions Treville' Beksinski collection, released a few years before the three volume set. I own all four ET books, the Bosz book, and the Morpheus book. The only one that doesn't contain largely unique material is the latter. Again, it sucks. The others, and this one -- brilliant.

"It is a rare thing, finding an artistic visionary who can find the trace elements of beauty in utter desolation. Beksinski went deeper and darker than anyone before or since, exploring the vast abyssal cave-systems where existential dread is born, facing a universal emptiness in which life is a just an insignificant spark that flared and died without meaning or consequence. Anyone trying to overcome this dread must learn to accept life and death for everything they are -- the very worst along with the best, and find beauty in squalor, injustice, absurdity, disease, suffering, cruelty, cowardice, hatred.In Beksinski's paintings, the living and the dead are one; organic and inorganic are often fused, and individual identity nullified. Facelessness is the way of things, as victims of some inconceivable torture akin to crucifixion and impalement are seamlessly joined by the face to their death-stakes -- this mysterious obliteration has erased them as living beings, and they are locked together, fossilized midway through a circuit of dehumanization.I thought I had already seen Beksinski's best work; after being introduced via Juxtapoz a few years back, I picked up the Morpheus book, and then the first of the Editions Treville volumes. The Morpheus volume is pretty slight and terribly designed, with one of the ugliest art-book layouts I've ever seen. The Editions Treville book is beautiful, and features many of the same oil paintings, but is a bit longer, up to 120 pages from the 80 or so in the Morpheus collection.This volume from Bosz is a far more satisfying overview of the artist's career, and also serves as an excellent biography, in both Polish AND English. It features a good number of the paintings that made his name in North America, large oil canvases that were a dark fusion of Surrealism and Fantastic Realism. He is often compared to Swiss Surrealist H.R. Giger, and both men are visionary talents who created worlds that are mysterious, disturbing and almost nihilistic; but Beksinski is by far the better artist of the two, in my opinion. He could also be compared to Ernst Fuchs and Fabrizio Clerici, especially the connection to Symbolist painters of the late 1800's, like Arnold Boecklin and Jean Delville. Beksinski's Symbolism is more instinctive, however; he did not consciously emulate the art of the past.The history of modern painting that critics like Clement Greenberg proposed, a linear succession with closely parallel movements and trends, is now obviously myopic. Anything that didn't fit in with his philosophy of painting's destiny, one that ejects all trompe l'oeil illusionism and embraces it's 2-Dimensional essence, was deliberately ignored. This was a knee-jerk reaction to photography's ascension to high art, prompting an existential crisis... suddenly, oils were not the most faithful method of capturing the world as it is. The answer -- abandon realism! But another line of historical development -- from the romantics, to the symbolists, to the cubists, futurists, new objectivists, pittura metafisica, surrealists, and fantastic realists -- culminates in the growing number of representational painters who have made their peace with photography. One of the early 20th Century artists to influence Beksinski is Otto Dix... both artists have a misanthropic streak that refuses to lie and make humanity look like something prettier or nobler than it really is.What is most surprising about the art collected here is the number of 'new works' -- the canvases painted between the mid-90's and his death in 2005. They're absolutely stunning. As much as I like his 'Fantastic Realism', the even more surreal, sometimes abstract work he produced in the decade before his murder is the best of his career. Neither of the volumes mentioned above include substantial selections from this period, so it might be a revelation for other Beksinski fans familiar mostly with the oils from the 70's and 80's.The common criticism that followed Beksinski throughout his career is that his work is relentlessly bleak and disturbing, a pointless excursion into the ugliest corners of existence. To me, anyone who holds that opinion has simply missed the point... but it's very easy to find. Beksinski's entire career was an existential campaign to find beauty and mystery in those regions of psychic geography most fear to tread. Desolation and despair are claimed, then shaped into archetypal imagery. The horrors of the past, from mass crucifixions and impalements to the death camp holocausts of Soblibor and Treblinka, and the Atomic holocausts of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, become monstrously desolate dreamscapes where the organic and inorganic, the living and the dead, have fused.

"Exactly how much drama -- measured in Drams, Hitchcocks, or SSU's (Swiss Suspense Units) -- can an author wring from a 'man vs. nature' theme, especially when the 'nature' in question is the dead red sand of Mars? Quite a bit, actually. That kind of speculation drives much of the action in Andy Weir's incredibly popular novel, 'The Martian'. If a first-person novel that involves copious amounts of ultra-detailed descriptions of the technology that any near-future Mars mission would likely use doesn't interest you, then just put the Kindle down and slowly back away...After their Mars expedition is cut short due to a sandstorm, the mission's botanist and engineer, Mark Watney, is separated from the rest of the crew during the evacuation. His suit sends physical telemetry telling them he's dead, and they are forced to leave without him. Determined to survive, he uses every scrap of knowledge and imagination he possesses to stretch his supplies out long enough for a rescue mission to reach him. Using whatever technology lies buried from Mars missions past and present, he becomes an accidental colonist, and the first true 'Martian'.If you can't calculate the SSUs (or Hitchcocks) in Watney's account of using an iridium catalyst and an open-freakin'-flame to break hydrazine down to its elemental parts (in a risky attempt to make enough water for a makeshift hydroponic garden), you should probably pass on it. It's one of those novels, however, that defies the best publishing prognosticator's guesstimates about who the hell might like this book, and how many copies it might sell. Weir does an excellent job of keeping the story buoyant, never letting it get sunk by dry, scientific exposition. It is precisely this attention to detail, however, that makes it so utterly convincing. Is it 100% accurate, based on current trends in space exploration technology? F***, I have no idea. It sounds good though. If it were 100% accurate, I guess, the book would have never been written, because the future of manned space missions looks kind of grim at the moment. This is a scientifically-literate and realistic SF love-letter to the spirit of exploration... and it's a great read; Weir's passion for the material is really the rocket-fuel that puts 'The Martian' into orbit, and never lets it decay -- work like this is the best hope for resuscitating public interest in space travel.In case you're wondering, the protagonist's first-person journal entries aren't the whole story; Weir alternates between 'Letters from Mars', a third-person account of the desperate rescue mission being organized on Earth, and his despondent crewmates, still making the long trip home onboard the shuttlecraft. The break in perspective provides added suspense, as Mark Watney's plight becomes big news around the world, and differing ideas about the best course of action lead to heated struggles and painful defeats.This novel deserves all the praise and attention it's received, and I recommend it highly for anyone who loves 'realistic science fiction' -- 'The Martian' is proof-positive that the label is not an oxy-moron. The fact that Ridley Scott will be adapting it for the screen, with Matt Damon playing Watney, is a very good sign that the film version will do the source material justice. I'm not surprised that a director like Scott snapped up the movie rights; with over 340 SSUs (or 0.8 Hitchcocks), he would have been crazy to let a lesser director have it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30MWNYO2ASYK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553418025#wasThisHelpful","R30MWNYO2ASYK8","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Slysz Bowie just arrived in my mailbox, and I haven't been this impressed with a Spyderco since... well, ever. I'm a fan of the Taiwanese models, but the Southard, despite being a beautifully made knife with one of the best steels available and excellent fit and finish, just didn't work for me in terms of ergonomics. I prefer larger knives, so when the K2 and the Slysz Bowie came out, and a marketplace seller on Amazon.ca was selling the K2 for the ridiculously low price of 210$ Canadian (about 175$ USD), I didn't hesitate. The K2 is an awesome knife, with a huge CPM 10V blade that is razor sharp; it spyder-flicks open with a smooth, easy action, and has very nice stonewashed titanium and a unique faux-spherical polished standoff. But it's an eccentric design, to say the least, over 10-inches long but thinner than a Sebenza, only vaguely ergonomic, and with an eternally sticky lockbar that requires injecting steroids into your thumb to close (I'm kidding, obviously, it's not all that bad now that it's broken in after a few weeks; but it still sticks, and all the graphite in the world won't stop it... on the positive, it is an incredibly secure lock-up -- about 80%, due to the thinness of the profile and the tension on the lockbar). While I do really love the K2, in all its massive, oddball glory, the Slysz Bowie hasn't required the same kind of parent-like unconditional acceptance. It's a virtually perfect knife. An excellent video by Solo's Knife Reviews pointed out the two minor questions related to the design -- a flat surface on the tang connecting with a round stop-pin, and thicker-than-usual bronze washers. Given how silky smooth the action was on mine out of the box (Sebenza smooth, without the grease!), I've already decided the washers are a positive, and the tolerances are pretty tight anyway. As for the former, while a rounded notch might have been better, or a flat-faced, D-shaped stop-pin, I don't think the pin is likely to flatten (creating theoretical up and down blade-play in the lock-up) any time soon. Even if it did, I don't see why I couldn't simply spin the stop-pin 90-180 degrees so it could hypothetically start flattening the other side. After those two minor-to-non-existent concerns, there's nothing to criticize. I would have preferred CTS-204P, I guess, but CTS-XHP is purportedly an excellent steel as well, a lower vanadium alternative to CPM S30V, S35VN, or Elmax. Like CPM Cruwear, PSF 27, Sleipner, and many other steels, XHP has been compared to D2 (or CPM D2, since XHP uses Carpenter's version of particle metallurgical technology), with better corrosion resistance. I've also heard it tastes like chicken. The fit and finish on the Slysz is truly impressive. The Spyderco full-flat grind and long, distal taper are combined with a beautiful stone-washed finish; it has what looks like a transparent protective layer of something like cerakote (virtually identical to the Southard's stone-washed finish), giving it a glassy smooth texture that no doubt contributes to the smooth action as well. The blade spine has fairly 'passive' jimping (as opposed to aggressive jimping), but it does provide some traction when heavy pressure is applied. The jimping on the stylish G-10 backspacer, on the other hand, is very functional with minimal pressure, helping to offset the untextured ti surface. About an inch-and-a-quarter past the handle, the gentle angle of the Bowie profile leading to the point has been flawlessly radiused, a touch I particularly like. The stone-washed blade has been matched with stone-washed titanium handle scales, and the Taichung factory has once again nailed the details. While it looked similar to the K2 when I first saw them, the Slysz is a completely different species, expertly refined to justify the higher price. The contoured titanium, in contrast to the flat scales of the Farid Mehr design, is an expensive feature that only knife aficionados are likely to appreciate, and the same can be said for much of this knife's finer points. One thing everyone can appreciate is out-of-the-box cutting ability. It came with a very sharp edge -- something Spyderco is known for -- but even relative to Spyderco standards, it might be the sharpest of the dozen or so models I've owned. Yes, it's important to be comfortable sharpening your own knives, but I still hate getting brand new blades that are too dull to cleanly slice paper or deal with arm hair. It immediately darkens my view of a maker when I'm shipped an expensive cutting tool that can't f***ing cut. I know some people immediately put their new knives on a Sharpmaker or Wicked Edge for that beautiful mirror-polished look, but I shouldn't HAVE to sharpen a new blade. Thankfully, the Slysz Bowie comes with a neater, sharper cutting edge than I'm ever able to get with my Lansky stones. The lock-up is perfect, and unlike the K2, there isn't the faintest trace of stickiness. One minor concern related to opening is that -- again, unlike the K2 -- it's extremely difficult to 'spyder-flick' right-handed, but it 'thumb-flicks' open using the hole with ease. This is because of the cut-out providing access on the presentation side, which doesn't help lefties who prefer using their thumb for opening, since the lock-bar obscures 50% of the hole; the spyder-flick, however, is very doable for a primary left-handed opening method. So: thumb-flick for right-handed users, spyder-flick for left-handed users. The much-loved, occasionally disparaged wire-clip allows tip-up left-handed carry, so even though it's not as truly ambidextrous as spine-lock and ball-bearing-lock alternatives, it's not quite as righty-centric as it seems. I keep comparing it to the K2, but if comparisons are going to be made, the Slysz Bowie is clearly emulating the Sebenza, and doing a damn fine job. It might not be quite as good as Chris Reeve's crowning achievement, but at 55-60% the price, it is most assuredly 55-60% as good... maybe even 70%. That's high praise, I know, but I think it's justified.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R347R02IY5OC2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O55B98I#wasThisHelpful","R347R02IY5OC2Z","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"'Late Harvest' accompanies an exhibition at the Nevada Museum of Art, and was part of a larger conference addressing ecological concerns. This attractive, well-constructed 'turtleback' -- which has rigid covers with rough-cut edges and a thick, glued spine, held together like a softcover -- gives the reader a contrast between the way wildlife was portrayed in late 19th and early 20th century paintings, and how contemporary artists express a far more complex relationship between man and animal, artist and subject, using a variety of media. Taxidermy, in particular, has been used extensively, in works by the Icelandic duo 'Idiots!', Damien Hirst, and British pARTners Tim Noble and Sue Webster. The pseudo silhouette sculptures of the latter, for example, use a tangled mess of rats and frogs and birds to create two perfectly formed shadows on the white screen behind it, giving us the severed heads of the artists in profile, mounted on stakes. This obvious interpretation would be a commentary on our exploitation of the natural world for the sake of vanity and selfish greed. The artists retain their usual self-deprecating humor, and include themselves in this almost playful condemnation; the severed heads on pikes might symbolize a punishment, meant to serve as a warning -- but they cheated the executioner, leaving the 'vermin' they sacrificed as disgusting duplicates. Leelee Fernandez uses staged photographs, costumes and sculptures in her multi-media projects. A photographic diptych portrays the artist herself half-transformed: naked from the waist up, with the legs of a black bear, then naked from the crotch down, with the torso and head of a bear. Many of the artists selected, like Fernandez, are dedicated wildlife and ecology conservationists. The idea that there is no excuse for mistreating animals, that we need to see them as beautiful creatures who have emotions and thoughts that are different from ours, perhaps simpler, but no less valid, is something most of the contemporary artists featured share.The romantic themes and fashionable, mildly impressionistic styles of the American wildlife painters, provide no evidence of the idealistic philosophies and passionate concern that drives their 21st century successors. There doesn't even seem to be a hint of the bittersweet sadness that many felt as the frontiers of America were finally 'tamed'. It was all too vast for man to inflict any real damage. What they chose to paint were scenes of a beautiful wilderness, the grandeur of the forests and mountains, continuing the romantic tradition of Bierstadt and Church.While I found the eclectic, almost haphazard assortment of artists interesting, and admire the curatorial focus on taxidermy in contemporary art, the exhibition's glaring omissions were just as noteworthy as the submissions. Elizabeth McGrath should be a part of any important look at taxidermy in post-modern art, but she's curiously absent. And how could any exhibition on the relationship between man and animal, on humanity's changing perception of the natural world, without including work by Walton Ford, who has built an ingenious oeuvre spanning over twenty years on exactly those subjects. Utilizing the style of eighteenth and nineteenth century Natural Historians/artists like Audubon and Haeckel, he uses written accounts drawn from scientific journals, religious texts, and obscure historical ephemera, and creates vibrant, breathing allegories that hint at influences as distant as Bosch and Dali. Instead, we have Andrew Zuckerman, who takes photos of animals that are slick and attractive, and make for nice, oversized books your Aunt will like; but his work says nothing but 'Behold! An Elephant!'","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UH9MNYNSXVRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=3777423505#wasThisHelpful","R2UH9MNYNSXVRG","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Some Minor Spoilers, but the Biggest Twists and Surprises are Still in their Original Packaging]There's been a great deal of negativity directed toward this film, something I find somewhat baffling after watching it. It might be the wheat-fields, barns and farm-houses, as well as the Steinbeck-meets-Heinlein vision of a dust-bowl future where agriculture has become the most vital concern (I get that; sometimes wheat-fields make me so angry I go blind and piss myself). Earth is no longer viable for much of the remaining population, as grim ecological forecasts come to pass. McConaughey plays a pilot-turned-farmer and father whose hopes for his children are dying with the crops. A seemingly supernatural encounter leads to the discovery of a top-secret space program (it's not quite as ridiculous as it sounds), run by a former professor of his, played by Michael Caine. He is recruited for a desperate space-mission unlike anything NASA has ever attempted, an intergalactic journey through a mysteriously convenient worm-hole, leading to a solar system that has planets that are very Earth-like, one or more of which might be capable of supporting human life.The odds of these phenomena converging by chance are too slim to merit serious consideration; someone, somewhere, has thrown a metaphorical lifesaver to a drowning man. They've opened a door in space-time for a doomed planet, giving humanity another shot at survival. The hero must leave behind his young children in order to save humanity, and the sacrifices he will be forced to make become increasingly painful. McConaughey gives another dead-on portrayal, settling into middle-age well as one of the finest actors in Hollywood, while Anne Hathaway and Matt Damon are both excellent in supporting roles.Interstellar gives the viewer a look at space travel that is far more realistic than most of the science fiction tales that have made it to the screen. Man is his own greatest enemy in 'Interstellar'; the conflict between the selfish motives of the individual and the selfless concerns of the greater good is always raging, as the crew members struggle not just with one another, but with themselves. Man isn't the only enemy, however. Relativity is perhaps the most frightening threat the expedition will face in 'Interstellar', as the characters confront the harsh extremes of time-dilation. Hours, days, months, and years become very real concerns, with time no longer the inexorable, predictable force it appears to be. The river still flows in one direction (mostly), but the current is slower near the banks and faster near the center, pulling one far downriver in the blink of an eye, as intense gravitational fields stretch space-time 'thin'; Einstein's ground-breaking discovery is no longer just an intimidating or baffling abstraction, a monkey-wrench jamming up the elegant precision of Newton's clockwork-universe; it becomes something almost as tangible and terrifying as the barrel of a cocked .45-magnum, 'making your day' into decades. Black holes and relativistic speeds will kill your family and everything you ever loved or knew; one might fall asleep aboard a space-ship that is moving at a certain velocity, or straying too close to an accretion disk, and wake up several hours later, without realizing that decades have passed on Earth, and everyone you've been trying to save is gone. Father Time -- according to the proverb -- may indeed be the greatest of teachers; but he kills every last one of his students.I liked 'Interstellar' immensely, but it's not for everyone. The conclusion is not as strong as it could have been, and there are plot holes -- or at least questionable narrative decisions -- scattered occasionally throughout. That, however, is something I can say about every SF film ever made. Perfection, or near-perfection, is rare in every genre, but in science fiction it's impossible; 'Interstellar' comes about as close as any film since '2001'. I think that audiences expecting an 'Avatar'-like experience will be disappointed. I hated 'Avatar'; this is the kind of science fiction I wish there was more of, and yet another brilliant film by Christopher Nolan. If you liked '2001', 'Moon', or 'Gravity', I highly recommend this film. If you enjoyed 'Jupiter Ascending'... I'm surprised you can read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R365HOB8VNC4ZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI7GCJK#wasThisHelpful","R365HOB8VNC4ZN","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Apologies to fans of the Spyderco 'Tatanka' -- which is essentially just an 'Endura' on steroids -- but the biggest, most impressive blade in the Spyderco catalog is the Farid Mehr 'K2'... which is, essentially, a Sebenza on steroids. I love titanium, and I love frame-locks, both of which Spyderco is making more of from their high-end 'designer-knife' facility in Taiwan. This is one of the biggest Sebenza-style knives I've seen, with an OAL of 10-inches, and a 4.54-inch blade with the full-flat grind and distal taper that is so effective for deep slicing. The 'K2' may be a brute, but the simplicity of the design is almost elegant; it has small, tasteful accents like a unique, serpentine cut between handle and lockbar, and a faux-spherical backspacer/stand-off.Spyderco has always used the best cutlery steels available for each design, releasing limited sprint runs and mules to get knife user feedback on newer or more exotic varieties. The CPM 10V blade on this knife was a huge part of its appeal. This knife can cut through ridiculous amounts of rope and cardboard without dulling or damage, a blade with the best retention of any production folder. For an excellent review with rigorous testing go here:http://www.bladeforums.com/forums/showthread.php/1222344-Spyderco-FArid-K2-Full-Review-and-testingIt might sound similar to CPM S30V or S35VN, but it's not. A heavy duty tool steel manufactured using Crucible's 'particle metallurgical' process, it has a very high 2.5% carbon content and just as high 10% vanadium, helping give it the best edge retention possible, better than ZDP-189, Stellite 6K, CPM Rex M4, Vanax 75, Maxamet, or Cowry X; the only possible exceptions are CPM 15V, CPM Rex 121, and the equally rare and difficult to work CPM S110V & CPM S125V (three of these share the record for highest carbon level - 3.40%). CPM 10V's ability to take a razor edge and hold it means -- according to the fairly exhaustive tests found here:http://www.bladeforums.com/forums/showthread.php/793481-Ranking-of-Steels-in-Categories-based-on-Edge-Retention-cutting-5-8-quot-rope-- that where a knife with VG-10 made 160 cuts before dulling, and one with CTS-XHP made 240, CPM S30V made 300, M390/CTS-204P and ZDP-189 made 420, the Spyderco Farid Mehr with CPM 10V made an unbelievable 1100 cuts. This test has been added to, edited and updated regularly since 2010, with the last one done on Jan. 15 2015. The Spyderco Manix 2 using CPM S110V did just as well (after a regrind of the cutting edge, that is), with 1100 cuts before dulling; rope was used as the test material in this case, but the reviewer also uses cardboard and carpet, all of which make for consistent test subjects.But the best performer of all was another knife using CPM 10V, by custom maker Phil Wilson. An acknowledged master of high performance fixed blades, Wilson uses most of the high-vanadium steels that terrify other makers (I'm joking, obviously, but the amount of work that 10V, S110V, S125V, Rex 121, Maxamet, Stellite 6K, Talonite and Vanax demand make them dauntingly expensive, time-consuming, and frustrating choices); instead of being hardened to 63 Rockwell, like the 'K2', the 10V was hardened to 64.5, and managed a seemingly incredible 2400 cuts. Increasing the hardness by just 1.5 Rockwell more than doubled its already unbelievable edge retention. Whether or not that causes 10V to become too brittle for hard use, or impossible to re-sharpen, with results like that, it might be worth it. 1100 cuts is still far more than most people will make with material as abrasive as rope, however, let alone 2400.The only criticism I can make is that the lock-bar face is sticky, making it difficult to disengage. Spyderco should use the stainless steel lock-bar inserts that Zero Tolerance have made standard issue for their frame-locks, at least on the K2. The Slysz Bowie works as well as any frame-lock I've tried without the insert, and the Southard usually has a problem-free lock-up. The other caveat is that the Farid Mehr K2 is BIG. I know, that point has been made repeatedly in reviews and descriptions, but past experience suggests that someone will eventually post a review complaining that the K2 is way bigger than they thought it would be. To be clear: it has a 4.54"" blade, a full inch longer than the blade of a Spyderco Paramilitary 2 or Southard, and is 10"" overall. The photo will make it fairly obvious, if the repetition hasn't.P.S.: After a couple weeks of use I've been cutting things up like a psycho, with no discernible dulling whatsoever. Not that I expected any. It speaks to Spyderco's care with blades that the K2 came shaving sharp, and sliced a magazine in half with relative ease. If you try it, though, make sure there's no staples in whatever mag you're cutting, it can still chip.On the down side, the lock is still sticky and very stiff; this is not a knife for women -- unless you happen to be a woman with freakishly large and powerful man-thumbs -- and it's not a knife for guys with small or delicate hands.I've also noticed that because the placement of the pocket clip, I tend to place my fingers above it for solid purchase, and end up putting them on top of the wide lock-bar, pressing in with my fingers while pressing out with my thumb, and making things difficult. It's another argument against tip-down placement when there's no choice of a different configuration. It means you have to be conscious of your grip when dis-engaging the lock, but I got used to it quick enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31TWPB7IU5F9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O556WOE#wasThisHelpful","R31TWPB7IU5F9H","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This knife is a thing of beauty. I was one of the people who showed up a minute too late to get the limited edition ZT 0454, which is as close as I could get to a custom Dmitry Sinkevich like the 'Cardinator' it's based on. A day after the release, it was being sold on eBay for 1500$, 2000$, and even higher, for a knife with a 500$ price-tag. Unfortunately, that happens a lot with Zero Tolerance limited editions, particularly the 0777 or 0888.The 0452CF retains the scale, profile and essence of the 0454, but for a much more affordable price. The CPM D2 and Sandvik composite has been replaced by a sleek and deadly looking two-tone blade of CPM S35VN; the 3D-contoured carbon fiber is now chamfered on the presentation-side; and the sub-frame-lock titanium-and-CF is now solid, stone-washed titanium. Of course, it has all the Zero Tolerance details, like a lock-bar stabilizer, replaceable stainless steel insert, oversized decorative pivot, KVT caged ball-bearings, and a tip-up clip fit for right or left-hand carry (the carbon fiber has been pre-drilled, and threaded steel sleeves keep the screws from stripping out the carbon fiber).This is a big knife, with a 4.15-inch blade and 9.3-inch OAL, which makes the 4.6 ounce weight truly impressive. ZT took full advantage of the carbon fiber, using it not just as a scale laminated to a steel or titanium liner, but as a full, thick handle; carbon fiber has the structural strength of steel at a far lighter weight. The look of the CF is stunning, and it has a different pattern from the type used on the 0562CF Hinderer 'Slicer' -- another example of Zero Tolerance's dominance in the world of high-end production knives -- which has a 3.5-inch blade and an 8.25-inch OAL, with a weight of 5.6 ounces. Even though the 0452CF is over an inch longer than the 0562CF, it's a full ounce lighter; it's also one of the most streamlined knives you'll ever find for carry, similar to a Spyderco Southard in terms of thickness and width.With the KVT caged ball-bearing pivot system, Zero Tolerance flippers are known for firing better and having smoother action than many custom or midtech alternatives. The 0452CF may be their best flipper yet; it has a stiff detent, and the standard 'light-switch' method fires the blade out with an authority that makes a failed deployment virtually impossible -- the bare minimum of stored kinetic energy required to break the detent is more than enough to launch the blade into the locked position. Even not quite closed, in a position just before the detent ball pulls the blade shut, I'm able to hit the flipper and fully engage the blade without wrist movement.The pocket-clip is a bit odd. For a knife as large as the 0452CF Sinkevich, you might expect it to have an XL clip. But it doesn't; it doesn't even have a standard size clip, opting for a miniature clip I've never seen on a ZT. The reason for this, I think, is because the regular size ZT clip would end over the milled-out pocket. The small clip works great however, so it doesn't really qualify as a negative.The move to CPM S35VN will please some, no doubt; Crucible is an American steel manufacturer who pioneered the first cutting-edge 'particulate/powder metallurgical' formula specifically for cutlery, gathering input and advice from a who's who of custom knife-makers to develop CPM S30V. It quickly became the gold standard for high-end blades, used extensively on customs, midtechs, and high end production companies like Spyderco. Chris Reeve was largely responsible for the development of CPM S35VN, a variation of CPM S30V that added Niobium to the matrix to make it easier to sharpen. Both are excellent choices, and many consider them the best all around stainless steels for knives available.Zero Tolerance has used CPM S35VN (and CPM S30V) before on the 0550, but has preferred Austrian manufacturer Bohler-Uddeholm's own specially-made cutlery steels using 'powder metallurgical' technology, Elmax and M390. I've found Elmax to be slightly better than CPM S30V/S35VN, overall, but others have disparaged it for various reasons. M390 is, along with Carpenter's CTS-204P, the best knife steel for folders yet developed, in my opinion -- an assessment many people agree with (despite the fact that it's pretty close to Elmax, with higher levels of Carbon, Chromium and Vanadium, and the addition of 0.7% Tungsten). The popularity of M390, especially on the ZT 0562CF and 0620CF, has led to a shortage. ZT's decision to use the widely available CPM S35VN for all four of the models introduced in 2015 was a good one, in the end. It's not as cool as M390, but it has decent corrosion resistance, is easy to sharpen, and has good edge retention. The 0452CF came wickedly-sharp, even for ZT, who usually make certain their knives ship with a truly sharp edge. This is another brilliant release from Zero Tolerance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R169PJQ1JHY4QV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UGN81B6#wasThisHelpful","R169PJQ1JHY4QV","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everything seems to be converging to form a career rebirth for Alejandro Jodorowsky. Not that he ever really went through a decline, in any way; he's remained one of the most prolific writers of bande dessinee since the early 80's, and has written books on various subjects, such as the Tarot and ritual magic. But with the critical acclaim garnered by the fascinating documentary 'Jodorowsky's Dune', and the long-anticipated conclusion and collected edition of 'Final Incal', he seems more vital now than he has since creating the cult film 'El Topo' over forty years ago. 'Final Incal' completes the central trilogy in the massively complex series of graphic novels that share a continuity dubbed 'The Jodoverse'. Moebius, who illustrated the original Incal, creating one of his most important and visionary works around Jodo's brilliantly eccentric story, also completed one chapter of 'Apres L'Incal' before abandoning the project. Retitled as 'Final Incal', Ladronn started over, and spent nearly a decade crafting some of the most gorgeous artwork in comic history.With so much attention devoted to 'Final Incal', another corner of the Jodoverse, based on an enigmatic character from the original Incal -- The Metabaron -- has almost been overlooked. 'The Metabarons', lavishly illustrated by Spaniard Juan Gimenez, was the dark companion to 'The Incal', a brutal, incredibly violent, multi-generational epic relating the bloody history of the Metabaron caste. Like a futuristic, technologically advanced version of the medieval Samurai, adhering to a warrior-code -- Bushitaka -- very similar to the Samurai's battlefield philosophy of Bushido, the Metabarons were the most feared men in the Jodoverse.Following Juan Gimenez, Travis Charest matched Ladronn's sublime artistic perfection in the all-too-brief, 64-page follow-up to the 550+ page original in 'Weapons of the Metabarons'. Although he is excruciatingly self-critical, and this demand for perfection makes for slow work, it provides a showcase for what the Canadian artist is capable.While 'Final Incal' takes us to the end, Jorowsky's 'Metabarons Genesis: Castaka', takes us to the beginning. While Charest is an incredible talent, producing this 112-page volume would have taken far too long. In his place. Das Pastoras was the choice to illustrate this prequel to 'The Metabarons' -- which was itself a prequel -- taking the story back to Castaka, the home world,before the Metabaron caste had been established. If The Metabarons represent the Tokugawa Shogunate of Edo-period Japan, then this gorgeously rendered story takes us back to the Sengoku period, the era of the warring states, which culminated in the battle of Sekigara, and after a short time of struggle between the generals of the victorious army, a stable, unified Japan ruled by the Shogunate. The correlations are obvious, after reading it.'Castaka' is another masterpiece for Jodo, and an ending. It has been taking us backwards -- the 'first' Metabaron is introduced simply as 'The Last Metabaron', and the MB saga begins with the first. This final installment is a prequel that tells us how their horrific traditions began, stemming from a long conflict between the two tribes that originally populated Castaka, both fighting for control of the marble-planets meager life-sustaining resources. Das Pastoras establishes himself as an artist of the highest order. His fully-painted art is every bit as awe-inspiring as Ladronn's, and is worth it for the art alone.These two artists have helped Jodorwsky realize his vision perfectly, and it will be interesting to see what he does next, both in the Jodoverse and out. 'Castaka' is a stunning book, both for it's art and its' design. It's a deluxe limited edition, numbered somewhere between 0001 and 1500 (mine was 0351), and is an over-sized !0"" x 13"" hardcover, complete with slipcase. Don't ignore this book for Final Incal, go ahead and buy both, because prices will skyrocket soon on both (I pre-ordered a copy of the original deluxe, slip-cased, edition of 'The Incal: Classic Collection' in 2010, just as Humanoids was stepping up its English translations for the US market again. It had the same over-sized dimensions as 'Castaka', and announced on the slipcase-cover that it was limited to 750 copies. If you didn't pre-order it through a comic-shop, you were out of luck -- the 100$ USD book never made it to the shelves, selling-out fast enough that even the later pre-orders never got their copy. I have yet to see one for sale).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SRDM7TQ7IUMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RWTA5EI#wasThisHelpful","R1SRDM7TQ7IUMK","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked the premise, and this is the kind of story that Warren Ellis used to excel at. 'Trees', however, is an example of his occasional tendency to burn out after a strong start, slowing the momentum to a crawl as if unable to decide on a direction -- usually a sign the idea is not premium Ellis. To be clear: 'Trees' is definitely NOT premium Ellis. This is one of those scripts he writes with his left hand while his right hand takes care of the 'important' work (any innuendos that come to mind are completely unintentional). I'm not sure what's most important to Ellis now, what stokes his creative fires -- his novels would be my guess -- but there is none of the anarchistic zeal that defines his best material in 'Trees'. It's a paycheck, and a movie-pitch... call it 'left-handed story-telling' (my apologies to lefties -- in your case, reverse the analogy).The massive, world-encompassing alien phenomenon is intriguing, but the mystery of the trees gets lost in a patchwork soap opera involving unconvincing characters from around the world. The personal melodrama -- for example, a Chinese artist's sexual confusion after joining an unlikely community of freethinkers that has congregated around the base of an extra-terrestrial tree -- seems trite and irrelevant in the shadow of a looming extinction-level event. Even the researchers actively involved in uncovering the secrets of these bizarre organisms (you can probably guess their purpose, but I won't offer any explanations for those determined to read this tepid tale) seem mostly uninterested in them, and Ellis gives us more snarky arguments and shallow conflict. The plot moves forward at a crawl, as Ellis drags the minimal suspense out for as many pages as he can, stretching a thin story to the snapping point.While Ellis is clearly treading water with 'Trees', he's not the only problem. The art matches the story perfectly with its mediocrity. That's harsh, I know. I don't like disparaging an artist's work, but with the ever-growing number of truly talented people vying for jobs, there's no reason for putting up with lazy, uninspired art. Jason Howard has a style that catches the eye, but it quickly becomes apparent that it's a hack approach; it's quick and sketchy, an attempt to camouflage a very limited grasp of the basics of representational art. Awkward, unnecessary cross-hatching runs rampant throughout 'Trees'... and I'll leave it at that.Or maybe I won't. To be fair, art isn't quantitative; maybe you're into over-scribbled, under-considered styles. The same applies to story-telling: I think this is one of those Warren Ellis books I wish he'd never written -- like Black Gas, Tokyo Storm Warning, and Red (yes, Red kind of sucked, IMO) -- but you might enjoy a tale that comes roaring out of the gate at 150mph with a pretty good idea, then inexplicably drops back into first and does slow figure-eights. I'm far from an Ellis hater; I've got somewhere between thirty and forty of his collections in my actual, molecular library -- from Transmetropolitan to Stormwatch, the Authority and Planetary; from Global Frequency to Gravel, Freakangels and the rest of his Avatar titles. Ellis may not be in the same league as Alan Moore, or Grant Morrison, but he's still a far better writer than 'Trees' might indicate.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34KX2UG7C52P2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632152703#wasThisHelpful","R34KX2UG7C52P2","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you want a summary of the premise for 'The Following', try this:An FBI agent hunting a vicious serial killer seeks the aid of a brilliant university professor for his insight into the murderer's motivations. As it happens, the prof IS the serial killer. When the truth is revealed, a brutal life or death struggle ensues, except... neither man dies. The killer is fast, striking first and striking hard, but the agent hangs on to consciousness long enough to stop him from finishing the job. The psychopathic professor is badly wounded, but is patched up and sent to prison. The hero is more seriously injured, and bears emotional as well as physical scars. Years later, the now-retired agent is called upon to help with another series of killings that his maniacal nemesis is the key to stopping.That's actually a summary of the premise for 'Red Dragon', but it also sums up the back-story for 'The Following' perfectly well, and comes pretty close to quite a few other serial killer movies and TV shows, of varying quality and limited originality, that have appeared since 'Silence of the Lambs'. The show's writer and creator, Kevin Williamson, knows all about clichés, making a name for himself with 'Scream'; it was a clever satire that played with the comically repetitive tropes of the horror genre, and a fairly suspenseful horror film in its own right. He also created 'Dawson's Creek', and some truly mediocre movies like 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'. There's no real excuse, then, for the criminally derivative aspects of 'The Following', especially coming from a writer as attuned to pop culture precedent as Williamson; actually, there's never any excuse for the recycled garbage that ends up as 'cop show 5267B', but...'The Following' manages to rise above the mire from which it sprang, to some extent. The idea of a serial killer who becomes the leader of a cult devoted enough to carry out his nefarious, convoluted schemes, isn't THAT hard to accept, after the Manson family, and the Patty Hearst case, and Jonestown, etc. Memories of the Heaven's Gate cult, the corpses neatly arrayed in bunk-beds, with their identical track-suits and running shoes, provide a vivid example of the power a disturbed but magnetic guru can exert over followers; murder seems like it's just a couple stops past drinking the poisoned kool-aid on the weirdo-cult crazy train. The Manson family's brief rampage, however, has remained an isolated event in the annals of American crime. What's more, the power a cult leader exerts over his followers is based almost entirely on a freakishly powerful charisma, and once removed from that strange gravity, critical thought processes begin to function in whatever diminished capacity passes for normal amongst cult members, and loyalty wanes. Nevertheless, if the guru was charismatic enough, he might be able to pair his will with a pseudo-religion or philosophy compelling enough to start his own holy war.The idea of using Edgar Allan Poe as a sacred text, however, is pretty uninspired. It's not as whacky as using the lyrics to a Beatles song as a divine manuscript, like Manson did, but 'truth is stranger than fiction', and fiction writers -- unfortunately -- have to try harder than Manson did for something believable; oftentimes motives are a mystery in the real world, but never in fiction. Williamson's use of Poe is pretty lazy. Once again, he stole the idea from 'Red Dragon', in which a serial killer has formulated his own hermetic philosophy based on the art and poetry of William Blake. Blake is a far more interesting inspiration than Poe, who is seemingly the writer of choice for every crappy horror movie and TV show. For all aspiring writers: you might think Poe, Dickens, and Twain are fascinating, and you might believe you have a profound connection to their literature, but dig a little deeper. Williamson, I think, just pulled the name closest to hand and easiest.Everyone else involved tries harder than Williamson did, which isn't that unusual, in network television. James Purefoy is one of my favorite actors. I had a fairly well-defined image of Mark Antony in my mind before watching the HBO series 'Rome', but by the time the series was done, his performance as one of history's most fascinating characters had made Purefoy indistinguishable from the real figure. He was one of the many reasons that series stands out as one of the best ever made -- top 5, unquestionably. In fact, if you haven't seen it yet, forget 'The Following' for now, and watch both seasons of 'Rome'. The same goes for 'The Wire'. If you haven't seen 'The Wire', WTF are you doing here? If, however, you've already gone through the 'best of' list, and have now worked your way down to 'The Following' (waaay down), its got enough story and suspense to hold your interest, and the cast is excellent. The writers have their moments as well, suffering occasional fits of creativity that save the story from drowning in a swamp of deja view.Compared to the inexcusable crap that passes for crime drama on network TV -- like CSI: Miami, Law & Order: SVU, NCIS and Criminal Minds (profilers are only marginally more useful than psychics to any serious investigation -- 'We need an APB on a middle-aged Caucasian male, who may or may not be a bed-wetter, and who probably molested woodchucks as a boy... judging by the pattern of the stab wounds and the butterfly-like shape of the blood-splatters, it is believed this unsub might be dangerous...'), 'The Following' represents a sharp improvement. Compared to the one series whose creators, producers and writers paid for the privilege of ransacking Dr. Lecter's storage locker, however, 'The Following' is far inferior. 'Hannibal' reinterprets the mythos created by author Thomas Harris in ways that are very clever and unexpected. Ironically, it's also the rare show about serial killers and FBI agents that actively avoids falling into the deep ruts previous incarnations of the Hannibal saga have cut into the trail. If it's a question of finding the best take on ingenious psychopathic killers, it's 'Hannibal'. If you can't get enough of this sort of thing, 'The Following' is a distant-but-decent second-place finisher (or third place, if you put 'Bates Motel' in the same category).The inexplicable stupidity really does run rampant: Bacon's character is just a 'consulting agent' (Ugh. How many times...), but every episode finds him rushing to the scene ahead of everyone with just one agent for back-up. Every time this happens, instead of waiting for back-up, he decides to 'go in', but not before sending his partner off to 'cover' the back of the warehouse/farm house/crack house, and face off against multiple armed and dangerous suspects alone. No agent would allow another one to enter a situation like that alone -- and especially not when they're the ones giving the orders. Nevertheless, when the agent in charge of the case allows him to run into the abandoned factory without her in episode 08, she proves completely useless -- the three or four surviving 'followers' come rushing out the door she's been left to cover (they're all armed, but flee when Bacon surprises them and kills the extras without speaking parts, despite the fact that he's alone with a close-to-spent clip), pile into the vehicle she should have rendered inoperable by pulling a spark-plug, or cutting the tires, and escape before the backup that should of accompanied them from the start. Bacon gets held at gunpoint by Joe and his followers over and over again, at which point the gunman always looks smug, says he can't die yet, then makes vague, grandiose threats. He usually manages to get the upper hand before long, and chase his captors before they ultimately escape, capture one of them, or kill them. Hollywood gives the average FBI agent way too much credit for intelligence, imagination, and common sense, and 'The Following' is no different. But the stupidity they display in every crucial situation almost seems like Williamson's anti-authoritarian, passive-aggressive way of giving the feds a narrative b***h-slap.So... the Feds in this series are brain-dead, and they're also way better at killing people than the actual serial killers, and... less bothered by it. The bad guys let them live, then get murdered by Kevin Bacon. Maybe the worst thing, however, the cliché that has it's roots in Greek mythology and drama, is the nemesis. The killer is always the dark reflection of the hero cop. In 'Hannibal', they get back to the myth, in which your nemesis is a doppelganger wearing the antlers of a stag. Will Graham is haunted by stag imagery throughout the series, often in surprising and creepy ways, symbolic of his powerful connection to Hannibal Lecter. So far, Hannibal has avoided uttering some pathetic variation of the line that makes me ill - 'We're not so different, you and I'. It has popped up in hundreds, and possibly thousands, of films and TV episodes since Belloche popularized it in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', freeing it from its pulp fiction and comic-book origins. Purefoy is a great Nemesis, but the idea is just exhausted. Played out. Done. End it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA48CVO91SUGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGI076M#wasThisHelpful","RA48CVO91SUGE","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[NOTE: To R. Rodriguez -- I nor anyone I know has any relationship to Avatar or anyone even remotely involved with the making of Caliban, and received no free 'review copy' or payment of any sort. Feel better? Of course not. Now STFU with the dumb insinuations. Some people like things you don't like, and I probably hate a couple of the books you think are just freakin' wonderful. It happens. This is the realm of opinion, not fact (for example, I thought 'El Mariachi' and 'Desperadoes' kind of sucked, but your first adaptation of 'Sin City' was excellent)Caliban is not Ennis' best book -- I'd call it a 3.5 out of 5 --  but it's entertaining; if anyone thinks this is his worst, I'm going to make the same kind of BS implications you're apparently into, and say you haven't read much of his work at all. 303 and True Faith - terrible. Streets of Glory, his work on The Darkness -- which was not salvageable, true -- pretty bad. Hitman sucked as well, IMO, and so did his work on the Punisher... or what I read before giving up on it. He tends to work with artists he's also friends with, which is unfortunate, because as much as I loved Preacher back in the day, Steve Dillon proves that being a good person won't make up for being a crappy artist. John McCrea, Carlos Ezquerra, and Mike Wolfer in particular -- all terrible hacks, IMO. Fercundo Percio, on the other hand, is getting quite good, and Jacen Burrows has his moments.]Garth Ennis always gets the first class treatment when he pens a series for Avatar, and rightfully so. Ennis joined Warren Ellis after 'Strange Kiss' and it's sequels (collected in Gravel: Never A Dull Day) introduced William Gravel. After some infuriating editorial meddling and straight-up censorship prompted Ellis to give DC, Vertigo and 'Hellblazer' a cheery 'f**k you'*(See Below), he decided to find an indie label that was big enough to promote and distribute his work effectively, but were willing to let him do whatever the hell he wanted. Avatar, who specialized in publishing some of the most laughably 'written', exploitative tits-and-gore comic trash around, were ecstatic at the notion of becoming the scrap-idea receptacle for one of the hottest writers around. Garth Ennis, who has a genius for writing stories about characters in extreme situations**, was the next writer to find success at Avatar. Alan Moore, Jamie Delano, Jonathan Hickman, David Lapham and Keiron Gillen are among the many acclaimed writers who have followed the Ellis-Ennis lead, and Avatar has made the unlikely transition from a purveyor of SUB-sub-mediocre, ultra-violent softcore porn-comics, to a source of stories too shocking for Vertigo and Image, from some of the mainstream medium's very best writers. While Ellis is still one of the biggest names, and titles like 'Freakangels' (art by Paul Duffield) and 'Crecy' (art by Raulo Caceres) are among the best of his prolific career, it is 'Crossed' by Ennis that is the definitive Avatar book, perhaps the most horrifying and shocking horror-comic of all time.The first-class treatment, in this context, means that any Ennis story gets one of their 'A-List' artists. There's only so many truly talented artists out there, and while Avatar have obviously paid generously to keep Jacen Burrows, Paul Duffield, Gianluca Pagliarani, etc. from being poached by publishers with deeper pockets, others like Oscar Jimenez have moved on to better (paying) things. For 'Caliban', his brilliant take on the space-horror genre, Ennis was matched with Fercundo Percio, one of Avatar's star scribblers, who is absolutely perfect for the futuristic, hardware-heavy backgrounds that the story requires. Wally Wood-type banks of rectangular grids representing buttons or indicators show up here and there, as well as the loops of insulated wire that artists love to add, but overall Percio does an excellent job. Anyone who's tried to draw realistic machinery from a near-future space-ship knows how hard it is to make them look convincing. There's a reason why other artists are so in awe of the 50's/60's SF-work of Wally Wood in particular, and why Geof Darrow's artwork is so revered. Somewhere between Bryan Hitch and John Cassaday, or perhaps Kevin Nowlan, Percio has a nice understanding of contrast, balancing bold outlines with a subtle but exact method of texturing that is fairly unique. Since the first time I discovered his art on the Ellis-scripted Avatar title 'Anna Mercury - Volume 1: The Cutter', his work has greatly improved... and it was pretty damn good to begin with.Starting with an 'Event Horizon', 'Sunshine' or 'Prometheus'-like setting, 'Caliban' begins on a futuristic spaceship with a crew that is obviously jaded to the wonders of warp-travel, but discussion alerts the reader that intelligent life is still an exclusively Earth-bound phenomenon. A mysterious 'collision' that occurs in the no-man's-land of warp-space, however, promises to change everything. Surveying the damage as the 'Caliban' drifts through something analogous to 'the Bleed' (an Ellis 'Planetary' concept), the shaken survivors of the incident discover that their vessel has fused with another ship. They did not collide, but instead occupied the same area of 'subspace' simultaneously. Metal and flesh alike were instantly incorporated, fusing with the alien alloys of the intruding structure. As strange and dire as their situation is, the crew is completely unprepared for the things now inside the crippled, half-alien Siamese-twin that was 'The Caliban'. It might have been a floating cosmic zoo, or an alien scientific expedition returning with specimens, but not everything from the 'xeno-vessel' is dead. As the crew scrambles to seal hatches and protect their remaining atmosphere, and work to make contact with the other ship's operating system via their own computer, one member of their crew is seemingly possessed by something inhuman. When the killing starts, it's as horrifying and brutal as Ennis fans expect. He has a genius for writing violence that is always shocking and unforgettable. Shouldn't violence, even fictional violence, always be shocking? The only gratuitous violence, in my opinion, is the kind that allows readers to pass over it without a second thought. Death should always make an impact, even on the other side of our galaxy. 84/100[INCIDENTAL NOTE: I just watched the mediocre science fiction thriller 'Supernova' on Netflix, a 15-year-old film starring James Spader and Angela Bassett. It concerns a deep-space rescue vessel that takes on board a passenger and a mysterious alien artifact. It alters him physically, and he begins hunting and killing the crew. It's really similar to Caliban, but nowhere near as good. I wonder if Ennis watched this movie when it was released, then promptly forgot all about it, just like everyone else. If it was lodged in his subconscious when he created 'Caliban', at least something positive came from a crappy film... and there's plenty of significant differences.]* (A POST-SCRIPT ABOUT HELLBLAZER, WARREN ELLIS, & AVATAR THAT IS ONLY INDIRECTLY RELATED TO 'CALIBAN' [But it's not like I'll run out of page-space -- no trees were murdered because of this tangent -- I wonder if you could write a book-length review? A 100-page review for a 200-page graphic novel?]) In a match-up that John Constantine fans had been demanding, Vertigo finally hired Warren Ellis to write for the long-running horror comic 'Hellblazer'. It was a 'spin-off', based on the foul-mouthed, chain-smoking, English sorcerer created by Alan Moore in the pages of 'Swamp Thing', and was one of Vertigo's only house brands, since the 'mature reader'-label's primary attraction was that it allowed creator's to retain the rights to their work... for the most part. Ellis's Vertigo cult-hit 'Transmetropolitan' {Transmetropolitan, Vol. 1: Back on the Street} had demonstrated his gift for pitch-black humor, acidic political criticism, and big, crazy idea's. The central character, an infamous journalist nearly driven mad by the hypocrisy, greed and injustice that plagued his 'transmetropolitan' super-city of the near-ish future, shared a lot in common with John Constantine. Ellis was better suited to write 'Hellblazer' than perhaps any writer before or since, including the Irish writer who did more to make Constantine such a fascinating, indelible anti-hero -- Garth Ennis (his run is one of the longest and the best, although Brian Azzarello's version of the character is also unforgettable).The first couple issues of the Warren Ellis run were excellent, particularly those featuring art by the criminally overlooked genius of Marcelo Frusin, and hinted at what was to come (Frusin has a wicked chiaroscuro/ligne-claire style, similar to that of Eduardo Risso, and he was obviously a favorite partner-in-crime for Azzarello. Of all the esteemed artists charged with interpreting the iconic character -- Simon Bisley, Mark Buckingham, Richard Corben, Steve Dillon, Jock, David Lloyd, Leonardo Manco, and Sean Phillips, to name a few -- Frusin's near-perfect art captured the darkness at Constantine's core the most vividly, reminding everyone that he was a dangerous man).Then everything went to hell for Hellblazer. An Ellis script involving guns and angry school-kids was scrapped by DC, due to a then-recent real-life school-shooting. Ellis was furious at having an entire storyline rejected, and drama ensued. A few months later, a British S.A.S.'Combat Magician' started having all manner of wild and disturbing adventures, beginning with the 3-issue mini-series 'Strange Kiss', as Ellis adapted his ideas for John Constantine to fit the equally intriguing William Gravel. I think Ellis was so high on righteous indignation he could have cared less who published the 'Gravel' stories. He wanted an editor-free environment, but it was almost as much about giving DC the middle finger (or two fingers in a 'V', as Brits prefer) as it was about comics. DC has inspired this kind of hatred before (most notably after infuriating Alan Moore with a passive-aggressive campaign of intimidation, insults and harassment. They nearly drove him insane with their vindictive persecution and petty, sleazy punishments, all intended to induce cooperation regarding their awful film adaptations of his brilliant work. Why they would be so childish and aggressively hostile to the writer gave them the greatest superhero stories ever written, and some of their biggest money-makers, is baffling).The modern Avatar is built on spite, but they definitely profited from the deal, becoming a home for angry British ex-pats who write comics that grab the reader by the throat and shake like a Rottweiler. They publish crap as well; Hickman's 'God is Dead' had promise, but went very wrong right from the start, with Hickman providing rough storylines that his partner proceeded to butcher, and a D-list artist who is among the worst hacks I've come across. P.S.: Warren Ellis and DC made peace, or at least agreed to a truce, eventually... and the rejected Ellis storyline was published a few years later. 'Hellblazer' passed away, recently. After reaching the ripe old age of 300 (issues, that is), DC 'cancelled' the Vertigo title and moved 'Constantine' back into the DC Universe, where he can play with Wonder Woman and Green Lantern. The new 'Constantine' TV series hasn't quite managed to catch the magic of the Vertigo series; if it were a bit nastier, and uglier, it could be quite good, I think. The actor they found to play the title role is perfect, with exactly the look and punk rock attitude necessary, and a huge improvement on Keanu freakin' Reeves.**Garth Ennis, A Recommended Reading List For People With Strong Stomachs: ('Hellblazer: Tainted Love', 'Fear and Loathing' and 'Damnation's Flame'; Preacher: Book 1 - 6; War Stories: Volume 1 and 2; Garth Ennis' Complete Battlefields: Volume 1 - 3; Crossed, Volume 1 and 4; Rover Red Charlie: Volume 1)","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20CS1WE9PP2X8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592912508#wasThisHelpful","R20CS1WE9PP2X8","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dig this premise, 'cause it's going to blow the top of your head off (if you have absolutely no knowledge of the Judaeo-Christian and Islamic mythologies that people still enjoy killing each other about): Jews and Christians have used every crumbling scroll and codex to get their sneak peek of Armageddon, and secretive, fundamentalist factions devoted to each of their respective visions of the near-future are actively conspiring to bother God until he pushes the big red button... or whatever mechanism he keeps handy just in case a rescheduling of the planned Heat Death of the Universe is in order. Reacting to the birth of a red Norwegian cow (! and ?), Hasidic Jews somehow crash an amazingly unprotected archaeological dig-site under Temple Mount (which is perhaps the most contentious chunk of religious real estate in the Western world, sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims); they then entreat Adonai in the divine language he seems to prefer -- candles, chanting, and goat's blood (apparently the only frequency God hears is still the 'dead animal channel', so you can either stop praying, or buy your chicken so fresh it can both cluck and die). Christians in Nevada, meanwhile, have their own crazy-ass ideas about the apocalypse, involving what might be a 'Boys From Brazil'-type scenario, based on Gnostic variations of the New Testament long ago expunged with the other apocryphal scriptures (maybe...).Is your head blown off? No? You don't find the religious prophecy that's been bleated loudly in all directions for thousands of years fresh and exciting? Hell, I don't know, maybe you do. Why not go to church and get the story? I'm kidding, obviously, nobody's going to do something that ridiculous. Myself, I wasn't too interested in yet another take on the Judaeo-Christian End-of-days, which I consider to be about as likely as Ragnarok or a zombie plague. I was less interested still in seeing it done by Tim Kring, who created 'Heroes'. I don't think I need to explain why. But the commercials looked pretty good, so I gave it a try.After all of that poking at deeply-held-convictions with a sharp stick, you might be confused by the four-star constellation shining down on this review. 'Dig' may start with a very old and tattered idea, and Tim Kring is responsible for a terrible atrocity that can never be forgiven, but the pilot was pretty entertaining. Mining details from 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'The Boys From Brazil', Kring stole from the best and made it all his own, but specifics will give too much away. Jason Isaacs is an excellent actor, and a great choice for the male lead. He plays FBI agent Peter Connelly, who is stationed in Israel... for some reason; he becomes personally entangled in a case that puts him in the midst of all the religious conspiring. Anne Heche is also very good as his superior, with whom he is once again 'personally entangled', as the kids like to say. It feels like Heche fell off the edge of the world a decade or so back, but she has returned from her cryo-tube unchanged, for the most part. Burkas aren't a good idea in Israel, but she should think about making a dangerous fashion statement and wearing one, because her skin is way too pale for the Middle East. With that brilliant observation, I'll stop reviewing and describing. It's too early to say with any certainty how successful this show will be, but the pilot was both surprising and entertaining; not revolutionary, but unique in a way I wasn't expecting, and the international locations add to its intriguing take on a tired subject. There was some silliness here and there, but the writing was very solid. I'll give this a 4.5 out of 5, and hope for the best.P.S.: 5 episodes in, it looks like my early guesses about 'Boys From Brazil'-type clones of Jesus were right. But... since Jesus was/is the Son of God, or one of His three aspects, it's doubtful that cloning his physical 'vessel' would force Almighty God to reprise his critically acclaimed role as Mankind's savior, since he likes to take credit for creating the universe. If the clones were not made as pre-teen prisons for Jesus/God, the other option is obvious -- he's the Anti-Christ, a necessary component for the machinations of Armageddon. While some people have been pretty hard on this series, I've been pleasantly surprised.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WBFRP2ZW9GEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TSP9X10#wasThisHelpful","R2WBFRP2ZW9GEJ","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OR: The Alien Rapture; The Figurative Becomes Its Symbolic Essence, Ascending as Pure Abstraction... Something Like That.For anyone who appreciates the art of Ali Banisadr: buy this book now, and do so quickly. For those unfamiliar with the name -- why are you reading this? ;) . Ali Banisadr is the most important artist of his generation, and that little secret has reached very few ears. This beautiful, clothbound hardcover, '125 Paintings', is a catalogue raisonne of his artistic output to date. Since previous monographs have only collected about half the work included, this is one of those rare times that the book I've been wishing someone would make actually got made... and surpassed my hopes and expectations. I own hundreds of art-books, and this one has immediately moved into my top five.*Trying to explain what you see in the work of an artist is always difficult, but that's never stopped me from trying to do with words what a Google Image search will do instantly and perfectly... If you combine -- 1.) the complicated and delicate beauty of the Persian miniatures (relics of his Iranian heritage and childhood; his family fled the chaos of the 1979 revolution, emigrating to the US); 2.) the bird's eye view and intricate, sprawling triptychs of Bosch; 3.) the equally complex works of Bruegel and Altdorfer; 4.) the graphic language of motion invented by the Futurist painters Boccioni, Balla and Depero; 5.) the mix of modern subjects and medieval allegory introduced by Werner Tubke and Ernst Fuchs; 6.) the early abstraction of Kupka and Kandinsky; 7.) the abstract Surrealism of Matta-Echaurren; 8.) the fusion of form and movement that define the disturbing vision of Francis Bacon; and 9.) the methods of paint removal found in the abstract oeuvre of Gerhard Richter; as well as 10.) the meticulous layering, archaeological-feel, and pentimento-like effects of uncovering those buried layers, in works like De Kooning's 'Excavation' -- you might get a basic idea of the genius that is evident in the paintings of Ali Banisadr.No artist has so successfully blended the figurative and the abstract, with stunningly rich colors and delicately rendered forms that vaguely resemble costumed revelers or scenes of monstrous carnage. His 'characters' are like lavishly, garishly adorned supernatural entities, moving too quickly for the eye to accurately see, captured on camera mid-motion, out-of-focus and under-exposed... the viewer might be looking down on another circle of existence, a demonic mandala of nameless demi-gods oblivious to humanity, gathering on what might be a battlefield, or a marketplace, or a graveyard. There appear sometimes revelers in brightly-hued silken finery and grotesque masks, costumed for a Venetian carnival that itself masks a Satanic ritual at its heart. We might be looking through the golden retinas of an angel in flight, seeing the souls shining through the skin of ordinary mortals... or an alien perspective in 11 dimensions, translated back into 2D oil on linen and canvas after the artist received this intergalactic-telepathic-transmission he interpreted as a dream. Or maybe it's just... stuff, informed by a deep connection to the great artists of the past. I don't care. His work is endlessly fascinating and beautiful.This 250-page, 9 x 12-inch volume features an interesting and well-written introductory essay and a great interview with the artist. Following his artistic progression between 2007 and 2015, this monograph is unbelievably dense and rich. Charting his evolution with perfect clarity, the early paintings of 2007 and 2008 could almost be called figurative. With his transitional masterwork 'The Hashashins', however, he moved in the direction that would soon crystallize into his own unique, immediately recognizable style -- the canvases exhibited by Galerie Thaddeus Ropac and collected in the accompanying 2010 catalog.That catalog (now selling for ridiculous prices) was my introduction to Banisadr's work, a complete revelation I stumbled onto while checking out the work of Raqib Shaw (another inspired artist exhibited by GTR). Those often massive, groundbreaking canvases and diptychs -- like 'The Gatekeepers', 'The Merchants', 'What They Cannot See', 'Nothing That is So is So', 'The Charlatans', and 'The Magians' --  illustrate just how quickly and confidently Banisadr embraced this new approach; those mysterious visions of a secret world, with their evocative, alchemical titles and themes, encapsulated everything that I love about art.'One Hundred and Twenty Five Paintings' collects his early efforts from group and solo shows, all of the works from the GTR catalogues, as well as the just released HC catalog from his latest exhibition, 'Motherboard'. Best of all, it features his newest, as yet uncollected works from 2014/15, including a double gatefold spread of the monumental 5' x 24'-triptych, 'At Once', the central piece from his first solo UK show. This stunningly ambitious painting might be his masterpiece, incorporating all the themes, textures, and brilliant, carefully considered colors that have defined his vision for the last six years -- reflection and dichotomy; fixation, and forms caught in the midst of furious, preternatural motion; chimerical fusions and mutations; a division between heaven and earth, spirit and matter, ancient and modern; subtle monochromatic miniatures and massively-scaled explosions of vibrant, violent color.Using glossy, acid-free archival stock of the highest quality, this monograph features several gatefold reproductions and many full-page details; needless to say, the plates are all photographed with the resolution and clarity you'd expect from such a publication, even though I've come across some other-wise well-made art-books with terribly reproduced plates. '125 Paintings' does what it's meant to do -- serve as a massive retrospective exhibition, the best source available for art-lovers. Banisadr's paintings are too expensive for most of us, but even the rich will have only a couple works. Exhibitions shows eventually close, and much of his work is scattered all over the planet, hidden away in private collections, or galleries, or in specialized art storage house. This book is the best and most complete source on the art of Ali Banisadr. Highest Recommendations.P.S.: If there are no copies for sale on Amazon, you can try here, directly from the publisher (it's where I went; shipping was pricey, but it arrived in 6 business days):http://www.blainsouthern.com/bookshop/50P.S.2: *[Footnote for the end of Paragraph 1] The last monograph I was this enthused about, transcending some already high expectations, was Walton Ford's 'Pancha Tantra'; with over 300 pages collecting his most important work, a brilliant watercolor fusion of natural history, allegory, and under-stated Surrealism/Symbolism, the power of the art was translated very faithfully into the bibliographic medium. Beautifully produced and over 11 x 15 inches, it still has a couple minor 'flaws' -- it's a trilingual international edition, and doesn't match the level of quality materials and construction found in '125 Paintings'. The only other contemporary art favorites that share a similar proximity to monographic perfection would be: The Gagosian Gallery and Rizzoli's 'Glenn Brown: Three Exhibitions'; their slipcased retrospective on the career of Lucian Freud; the Hatje Cantz publication 'Neo Rauch: Paintings -- Leipzig-Munich'; the D.A.P. and Marlborough Gallery collaboration on 'Vincent Desiderio: Paintings - 1975-2005'; 'Akira Yamaguchi: The Big Picture', by Seigensha; 'Michael Borremans: As Sweet as it Gets', by Hatje Cantz; 'Flogging a Dead Horse: The Life and Work of Jake & Dinos Chapman', by Rizzoli; 'Darren Waterston: Representing the Invisible', by Charta; and the Hatje Cantz edition of my favorite book of Photograhy, 'Taryn Simon: An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar'. Those are just a few examples of what I consider the best Contemporary Art-Books; if you consider books on various artists from throughout Art History, the list gets even more difficult to limit to a few volumes.[In anticipation of the increasingly rare comments whining about word-counts: I apologize if that review seemed overly long, without actually feeling apologetic. Too long? Stop reading. This isn't a newspaper -- journalists aren't clawing each others eyes out over page-space; no trees will die due to a rambling editorial that requires an extra 4-page fold. In fact, I'd say I was remarkably concise; if a picture's worth a thousand words, I still owe Mr. Banisadr One Hundred and Twenty Four Grand, but I'm sure he'll let the debt slide.]","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R81VOK5KMMPUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0992663466#wasThisHelpful","R81VOK5KMMPUD","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's Yet Another gritty blend of mystery and police procedural, following the investigation into the death of a 11-year old boy.

Any synopsis is going to completely fail in its attempt to convey the power of this short, nearly perfect series. I had heard comments about 'Broadchurch', but a brief look at the premise suggested 'just another well-done, mostly forgettable BBC-ITV series'. It took a while, due to my lack of enthusiasm, but I finally got around to watching it. Needless to say, I'm glad I did. Forget the plot, forget the actors -- although the two leads are brilliant, particularly David Tennant -- all you need to know is that, along with the French series 'The Returned', this is the best European television drama of the last few years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29Q0W5VILRHPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HGE90Z4#wasThisHelpful","R29Q0W5VILRHPF","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the abandoned warehouses that post-apocalyptic survivors always enjoy visiting, scientific shenanigans are underway. They send Cole back a few decades, to 2015. He does the typical time-tourist bulls**t, flirting with dead girls, shooting people and then making speeches that underline the importance of his world-saving mission, one that nullifies all ethical dilemmas. That's fine. A viral armageddon is imminent, so kill whoever you want. Suddenly, he begins to flicker like a hologram run through an old-timey silent-film era projector, then disappears. He re-appears in the Lazy-Boy recliner/time-machine. 'What happened?' he asks. 'We had to bring you back early', is the reply. Huh. That makes no sense. The idea of sending someone decades into the past means that you can set the return time -- be it one minute or one week or one year -- and bring them back ASAP. The notion of the people behind the time machine switches WAITING on Cole, praying he manages to learn what he needs to learn in 2 hours -- even though that two hour period already happened twenty years ago -- and being forced by attacking Road Warrior-extras to bring him home after just 1 hour and 34 minutes, because they can't WAIT any longer... that's just too stupid to justify. I've seen other time-travel stories that use the same inexplicably moronic premise, and it's a clear indicator of lazy writing. You don't have to wait one hour to give a time traveller one hour in the past. You send him back, set his return for sixty minutes later, and immediately bring him home -- to him sixty minutes passed, to the time-machine operators from the future, thirty seconds have passed. But... 'racing against time' is the soul of suspense, so in 'Twelve Monkeys' we get this inexplicable fixed-time correlation, something they ignore when it's inconvenient.The concept of time-travel is almost always terribly executed in film -- reverse time travel is ridiculous (even if it is theoretically possible), but forward time-travel is not just possible, it's something that's always 'happening' throughout the universe, thanks to relativity; fictional space-ships that approach the speed of light experience time-dilation, with travellers on board experiencing just a fraction of the years that passed back on earth. Gravity stretches space-time: even the atomic clocks on satellites in high-orbit record time as 'faster', relative to those of us feeling the full gravitational pull of Earth's modest mass. The atomic clocks from downed satellites, compared with those on the ground they were originally synchronized with, always differ by exactly the nanoseconds predicted.Then there's multiversal possibilities, and M-theory -- seeing 'time-travel' as multiversal navigation amongst infinite narrative tracks. Hollywood is still stuck with a time machine created by H.G. Wells, a distinctly Newtonian SF vision that predated relativity and quantum mechanics.Still... the original '12 Monkeys', directed by Terry Gilliam and written by David Peoples, was one of the best SF films of the nineties. This series is basically a remake, and while it ejects much of the brilliance Gilliam brought to the endeavor, the show's creators find enough inspiration of their own to make for an entertaining story... as long as you don't think about it much. The actors do a fine job, particularly Kirk Acevedo in a supporting role; he's making a career out of stories featuring monkeys, the apocalypse, time-travel and parallel realities: from '12 Monkeys' to 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes', 'Fringe' and 'The Walking Dead'. Aaron Stanford, who plays Cole, seemed to drop off the Hollywood grid after a big start in the indie film 'Tadpole' and 'X-Men' 2 and 3. The time-travel notwithstanding, each episode has improved on the one before it, and the writing maintains a level of suspense that allows you to enjoy the ride without giving that critical voice a chance to get too yappy.

"Yeah... I'd feel like a hypocrite praising 'Under the Skin' and completely dismissing 'Beyond the Black Rainbow'. It's a rich audio-visual experience. The film-maker has been digesting much of the cult-cinema from the seventies and eighties, cheap SF television, the culture of paranoia that trailed behind the cold war and the constant threat of nuclear annihilation. After metabolizing this toxic goo for a couple decades, 'Beyond the Black Rainbow' is either the strange energy he managed to harvest, or the crap he left behind. Or both. Let's say 'both'. I loved the regressive trip back into my earliest childhood memories; the eighties have almost become something I thought they'd never, ever, be -- nostalgic. The imagery is lifted from films like 'The Hunger' and 'Alien', very heavy on the Scott-school of movie-making. As for the story... who the f*** cares. If you're looking for an engaging story, flee now, and start screaming 'No' if anyone you care about suggests giving it a try, rocking back and forth in the fetal position and whimpering until they've forgotten all about it. If you suffer from insomnia, I heartily recommend it; insomniacs are going to be almost the only people able to watch the whole thing without passing out, and there's a good chance it'll cure them. Seriously. If you're high, I'm going to offer some counter-intuitive advice, and say stay the hell away... especially if it happens to be an hallucinogenic or psychotropic substance. Visually rich does not equal entertaining... In fact, other than insomniacs and speed-freaks trying to come down, I can't recommend this film to anyone.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37Q2KIINZSU8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008B9JTDQ#wasThisHelpful","R37Q2KIINZSU8E","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kramer's Ergot established itself as the most important comics anthology of the millennium, particularly Volumes 5, 6 and 7. Volume 7 is the legendary over-sized 16 x 21-inch hardcover, borrowing the format introduced by Sunday Press for their equally ground-breaking centenary reprints of the original 'Little Nemo in Slumberland' pages. Reproducing the exact dimensions of the fin-de-siècle broadsheets, these archival facsimiles were a revelation for McCay fans new and old; Kramers Ergot creator-editor-contributor Sammy Harkham had the idea to allow some of the world's most brilliant and cutting edge cartoonists a chance to create work in the same massive tabloid scale, a challenge that yielded brilliant results. Volumes 5 and 6 were both produced as 10 x 11.5-inch flexi-bound books with vinyl covers, and were both around 350-pages long. They share the same high-quality materials and design as Volume 7, and feature a rich and diverse assortment of avant garde artists working at their peak.Volume 8 faced a couple of serious problems. Firstly, it was released by Picturebox instead of Buenaventura Press; Picturebox is an excellent indie publisher, but previous instalments benefitted from the creative input of co-editor and publisher Alvin Buenaventura. In his absence, the eighth outing experienced a quality decline on every level. Secondly, Kramer's Ergot faced a clear navigational crisis. Having made its name as a consistently surprising and ambitious anthology, the question of where to go after releasing a book as stunning as Volume 7 became a serious one. No matter what they did, it would seem like a regression... so they didn't bother to try. It's not as bad as other reviewers have made it out to be -- at least IMO, for what it's worth -- but it doesn't stand up to past volumes. It's a smaller, clothbound edition, but it's nicely constructed, with several changes in paper stock to best suit the material. It's also shorter than 5 or 6, with stories from the usual suspects that range from brilliant to uninspired. New contributors fail to leave any positive impressions, particularly the selections of artwork chosen to illustrate the book's loose thematic direction.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LN1VPUY8117S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0984589279#wasThisHelpful","R3LN1VPUY8117S","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Considering there have been about 28 people killed in the sleepy little town of White Pines since the Bates showed up, the residents are remarkably unfazed. If they have a population of 2800, 1% of the town's residents have been murdered in a period of several months. If that death-rate continues, Norman, Dylan, and Sheriff Romero will wipe out the entire community in just under six years, AND all three of them have full-time jobs or school to deal with. Excellent work.I had fairly low hopes for this show. Gus Van Sant's remake of 'Psycho' was a perfect example of 'Why are we doing this again?'-film-making; a shot-for-shot redux of Hitchcock's classic. But 'Bates Motel' is a very different breed of stuffed owl; it sets the iconic house and motel in a modern-day environment, and takes on the ambitious task of charting the transformation of Norman Bates -- from the polite, helpful. sensitive boy who is intensely close to his mother, to the completely insane 'Psycho' who stuffs her dead body and becomes 'possessed' by her murderously punitive pseudo-personality. There's more soap than subtlety here, but the writers keep the drama simmering 1-degree below boiling-point whenever a situation isn't in straight-up melt-down mode. The town of White Pines is like Twin Peaks, if the residents traded in their LSD and Shrooms for good old-fashioned coke and a few metric tonnes of sour diesel. Nestor Carbonell is brilliant as Sheriff Romero, bringing a gravity and enigmatic charisma with him from 'Lost' (where several of the writers and producers, like Carlton Cuse and Javier Grillo Marxuach, were scribbling and pointing and yelling before they moved into the Bates Motel). Max Theriot -- who joins Nestor in the 'Guys who look like they're wearing eye-liner, even though they aren't'-club -- plays Norman's brother, Dylan Masset, the true wild card thrown into the game. As the older half-brother who has long been treated like an outsider, forced to endure his the obvious favoritism she displays toward Norman. As Dylan becomes an integral part of the drug-production that props up the local economy, with plenty of his own troubles, he is forced to do terrible things to protect his family, saving their lives again and again. Dylan is the voice of reason, and along with Emma, the conscience of the series. The fact that he's a drug-trafficker and a killer makes it all the more sweetly ironic. After the shock he received in season 2 about his father, and the position of power he has stumbled into, season 3 promises to be interesting. Norma and Norman are the crux of the matter, however; Vera Farmiga has been creeping up on genius in her performance, handling the one character more complicated than Norman with a deftness and subtlety that is lacking in the story. And then there's Norman himself -- facing the crucible that might trigger the inevitable break in his psyche, like an egg cell dividing to produce twins.The series is a bit uneven at times, with over-the-top scenarios that no one seems to be reacting to in a realistic way -- (SPOILERS) the storyline involving Keith Summers' sex-slave ring ends with the girl they rescued being chased into the woods by the Deputy; after he's dead, they're all sitting around devising a story, instead of trying to find her -- he claimed to have killed her, but he might have been lying, or he might have been wrong; she could have been badly injured, but alive. No one's going to see how the poor sex slave is doing? Really? Then there's the question that gets repeated about 20 times per episode, in many creative combinations: 'Are you alright?' 'I'm fine.' 'Are you okay?' 'Yep!' 'Is there something wrong?' 'No, why would there be anything wrong?' 'You know you can tell me what's troubling you Norman, you know that, right?' 'I do know that. And thank you. But everything's fine.' Everyone's constantly asking each other if they're 'fine' or 'okay'. It happens quite frequently, and once I noticed, it became pretty annoying. But it's not that big a deal. I suggest you forget I mentioned it in the first place. You'll be okay, right?This is yet another addictive, beautifully crafted series that threatens to overtake the traditional film in terms of artistic importance. There have been very few films that are as powerful as The Wire, Game of Thrones, Rome, Breaking Bad, The Pacific and Band of Brothers, Deadwood, The Walking Dead, The Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire, Fargo, Broadchurch, The Returned, The Shield, Vikings, The Borgias, Banshee, Penny Dreadful, Black Sails, Orphan Black, Bates Motel... and those are just some of the best dramas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TULUUYOC4M41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ICSVPSI#wasThisHelpful","R2TULUUYOC4M41","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Or maybe not; it's always engaging and smartly written, but it's probably not one of the upper echelon shows... close, but no.

The last few may not belong in the same class as the first few, but they're pretty darn entertaining, and still going strong. When the final episode has aired, we'll have a better chance at deciding where Bates Motel ranks.UPDATE: Season 3 was far from a disappointment, in my opinion, but it represented a significant change in the scope of the narrative. Bates Motel during seasons 1 and 2 was much more of a high-end soap opera in the Twin Peaks tradition, and the townspeople played larger roles, making for a large, ensemble cast. Season 3 has tightened its focus on the Bates family and their closest friends and enemies. The psychological degeneration of Norman has accelerated, and Norma has served as the clear axis-point. Her relationships define the course of events throughout this ten-episode run -- with the son she'll do anything to protect, but is starting to fear; with the prodigal son, Dylan, who she has become close to again, and has come to rely upon more than anyone else; with Sheriff Romero, who now seems to feel as strongly about her as she might feel about him; and with new friends and enemies, like the helpful psychiatrist she becomes romantically involved with, and the murderous proprietor of a very exclusive, sociopathic social club, who she tries to blackmail. I won't reveal anything more, because there are many surprises throughout. There are some predictable moments as well, but all in all, Bates Motel is still one of the most compelling shows on television.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UG40KMNVKF0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TT53YSW#wasThisHelpful","R1UG40KMNVKF0R","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just a brief review and a piece of advice, to be taken or left behind, for Clerici fans. Heellooo! Are there any people interested in one of the 20th century's greatest, and by far, most under-rated artists? I honestly have no idea; as someone whose interests have always diverged from those of friends and family, I'm used to making earnest, impassioned speeches about things that make the other person's eyes go dead and fishlike, as they silently implore some ancient demon to kill me -- or at least f*** up my voice-box.Since Skira published this beautiful retrospective monograph on the centenary of his birth, there's definitely a couple of us scattered across the 'New World', but most of the artistic appreciation still derives from his homeland of Italy. I am drawn to surrealism, but the group that orbited Andre Masson in Paris were not the beginning-point of surrealism in it's broader sense, and they certainly weren't the end. Bosch, Bruegel, Durer, Arcimboldo, Rosa, Goya, Bocklin, Moreau, Redon, Segantini, Hodler, Delville, Khnopff, Ensor, Klinger, Von Stuck, Klimt, Picasso, Dix, Grosz, Radziwill, Boccioni, Balla, Carra, De Chirico -- throughout art history, the fantastic has found its way to the canvas; artists have mined the dreaming-worlds for unnatural resources long before Ernst and Dali.Clerici is my pick for the greatest surrealist painter of the last century; both Clerici and DeChirico were powerfully influenced by another criminally under-appreciated artist, this time from the 19th century -- Arnold Bocklin. Again and again, Clerici takes imagery from the great Symbolist's oeuvre, particularly one of the most famous of his many masterpieces, 'The Isle of the Dead'. But Clerici's paintings are far different from any artist who came before him; comparing his work to other 20th century Surrealists, you find the subtle yet powerful compositional mysteries of DeChirico, with a mastery of fantastic realism that exceeded even the prodigious technical abilities of Dali. This is the book on Clerici that I've been waiting for, and thankfully, it includes an English translation next to the Italian..","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XQJ5UXSOB48U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8857221156#wasThisHelpful","R2XQJ5UXSOB48U","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If someone crammed Hernan Bas, Peter Doig, and Adrian Ghenie into a super-collider, you would end up with three dead, liquefied artists, their flesh, bone and viscera reduced to a spreadable paste.If you forget about the super-collider and the dead-artist condiments, Marius Bercea could be seen as an aesthetic and thematic synthesis of the aforementioned trio. He possesses the Gauguin-influenced oil-on-linen eeriness of Doig; some of the playful, surreal, faux-primitivism of Bas; and aspects of Adrian Ghenie and Victor Man's high-concept fusion of dark symbolism, abstraction, and the Richter-inspired photo-realism that informed their early development.Like Ghenie and Man, Bercea is part of the 'Cluj School', a group of talented figurative painters who have helped to revitalize the Romanian art-world. While they are linked by age (roughly), geography and shared history, and are all painters who prefer figurative styles, there is more difference between the work of Bercea and fellow Cluj-schooler Serban Savu than there is between Bercea and Canadian/British painter Peter Doig. Nevertheless, the Romanian painters are giving the art-world good reason to pay attention, doing their part to resuscitate an artistic heritage that was almost obliterated after decades of political and cultural oppression by pseudo-Communist dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17K40VXL5LAOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0992663423#wasThisHelpful","R17K40VXL5LAOY","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Beksinski belongs to an elite class of fantastic realists who transcend the 'Spectrum'-crowd. It's not easy to explain the distinction between the work that ends up on paperback covers -- from sword-and-sorcery heavyweights of old like Frank Frazetta, to modern day favorites like Brom -- from the art of painters like Zdzislaw Beksinski, Ernst Fuchs, and Takato Yamamoto. The difference between fine art and illustration often seems completely arbitrary; it's a matter of subjective judgements, often influenced by the professional status of the artist: if the artist paints book covers for a living, and the work in question was commissioned for, and based upon, a fantasy or science fiction novel, it's illustration. That doesn't mean that illustration can't stand on its own merits, and be appreciated as fine art, of course.But in the realm of figurative/representational artwork based on dreams, imagination, and symbolism, you find the most confusing array of often over-lapping categories in modern and post-modern art:Surrealism (the original European group including Dali, Ernst and Magritte), Neo-Surrealism (modern-day contemporary artists like Neo Rauch, Jonas Burgert, Ruprecht Von Kaufmann, and Glenn Brown);Pop Surrealism (an 'alternative' art trend that includes Robert Williams, Mark Ryden, Todd Schorr, Tiffany Bozic, and James Jean);Fantastic Realism (Ernst Fuchs, Werner Tubke, H.R. Giger, Zdzislaw Beksinski, and younger artists like Michael Triegel);andMagic Realism (which is also the category many of the most popular and talented fantasy/science fiction illustrators best fit into, such as Brom, Kinuko J. Craft, Gil Bruvel, Michael Hiep, and Rodney Wood).There's others that share similar themes and subject matter, of course. Romanticism, particularly the strain dubbed 'Dark Romanticism' in a brilliant exhibition and monograph of the same name, is where the modern incarnations of the fantastic can trace their lineage. Even more important, Dark Romanticism evolved into the loosely defined movement known as Symbolism; from the Romantics like Goya, John Martin and Caspar David Friedrich, the most influential and original Symbolists -- Gustave Moreau, Henri Fusseli, Arnold Bocklin, Ferdinand Hodler, Giovanni Segantini, Edward Burne-Jones, George Frederick Watts, John William Waterhouse, Fernand Khnopff, Jean Delville, Leon Frederic, Odilon Redon, Carlos Schwabe, Sascha Schneider, Max Klinger -- embraced the sublime and the fantastic in a way that hadn't been done since the days of Bosch, Bruegel and Durer.Before Surrealism had really taken root, New Objectivist artists Otto Dix, George Grosz and Max Beckmann explored the darkest, most nightmarish elements of the subconscious and the ugly truths they had to tell about humanity's violent and selfish nature. In the late 20's and 30's, Dix in particular painted very dark dreamlike allegories that were very different from the experimental, instinctive methods that the Surrealist philosophy developed by Andre Masson advocated. Dix wasn't afraid to walk through all the doors of the mind we usually lock up tight, and scrawl ominous latin warnings over the lintel in pig's blood.Beksinski was closest, aesthetically, to Fantastic Realists like Fuchs, Tubke and Giger. But he also shared the unedited working philosophy of Surrealism, Dali especially. His grim, thoroughly nihilistic visions put him close to Dix as well. His art defines the nightmares of the cold war, with deathscapes of a barren, irradiated world, populated by wraiths, monsters and corpses. He might've been the great visionary artist of the 20th century.This book, published by Morpheus, is just as ugly as every other monograph they release. It's not a bad volume -- it's about 10"" wide x 12.25"" tall, with well-reproduced plates that make good use of the page-space, and about 96 pages in length -- but it's not great. The Beksinski collections from Editions Treville and their Pan-Exotica line are brilliant; there is a 130 page hardcover collecting some of his most powerful paintings that I recommend very highly. But for anyone looking for a more comprehensive look at the artist will want the 3-volume catalogue raisonne, each book of which contains another aspect of his artistic output, including his drawings, sculpture and photographs. All four books are of the highest quality, and perfectly designed.In comparison, the Morpheus album looks like a self-published venture. The layout and fonts are pretty tasteless. Given the price it's selling for, find the Editions Treville single volume instead.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRVKVZSZTTJXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=188339838X#wasThisHelpful","RRVKVZSZTTJXY","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A frozen waterfall is seen many times in 'The Captive'; it is visible through the windows of a hotel room, where Cassandra's mother is working as a maid. Years after Cassandra was kidnapped, objects with very specific emotional links to the missing girl keep turning up in that room, and she's beginning to question her sanity. Director Atom Egoyan carefully keeps that wall of ice in frame throughout these scenes. It's a powerful image. For the parents of a missing child, it's like life freezes over, and time has stopped; all that water, all that pressure, just frozen in time and space, waiting for the thaw... in this case, as the years go on, it becomes less and less likely that 'the spring' -- the resolution, a break in the investigation -- will bring good news. But in order for the waters to flow and fall, there has to be an answer: a girl who is suddenly a teenager, or a collection of bones in a shallow grave. Until then, they live life on hold. frozen in place, all that weight crushing down without relent... Or something along those lines. Cassandra's father, Matthew --  Ryan Reynolds, in a moving performance -- is tortured by guilt, ashamed that when he went into a store to buy a pie, someone stole his daughter from the back seat of his truck. In the film's standout performance, Mireille Enos (from the TV series 'The Killing') portrays Tina, a mother whose pain is so acute it threatens to destroy her; she is unable and/or unwilling to help assuage her husband's suffering, and uses that moment Cas was taken as a weapon to hurt him further, as if the more pain she can inflict on him, the less she'll feel herself. Matthew bears his wife's bitterness, and the baseless accusations, much better than most people would, I think.Atom Egoyan's latest film returns to the same cold, starkly beautiful emotional and geographical terrain he examined in 'The Sweet Hereafter'. This film seems like a mix of the low-key art-film and a standard-issue police procedural, with odd narrative choices that leave the viewer confused. It leaves the grand tragedy of 'The Sweet Hereafter', its schoolbus full of children disappearing over an icy slope, for a more private, personal tragedy. The narrative jumps back and forth through the eight-year period of Cassandra's disappearance. In 2005, a detective named Jeffrey -- Scott Speedman -- joins an RCMP unit tracking missing children and crimes against children. His new commanding officer is Nicole -- Rosario Dawson -- whom he will later become romantically involved with. Cassandra, meanwhile, is very much alive. Having endured years of terrible abuse at the hands of her abductor, she is now old enough that he has lost interest in her sexually, thankfully. Mika is a monstrous anomaly, but incredibly, he belongs to a group of like-minded freaks in an online pedophilia ring. They have a bizarre fixation with the mundane stories of their victims, and Cassandra is kept alive to not just tell these stories to an audience of perverts, but to someday ensnare another young girl. Kevin Durand is excellent, as usual, interpreting yet another psychotic monster in an unusual way. He deserves credit for taking on such a thoroughly repugnant character in the first place. Mika is aided by a mysterious woman... the question hangs unanswered of whether or not she began as a victim herself, before turning into his accomplice. The pedophiles enjoy witnessing the agony of Cassandra's parents; Mika has installed camera's in the rooms where Tina works, and he begins leaving significant objects for her to find, and witness her pain and confusion. Matthew feels compelled to traverse the snow-covered highways, hoping for a miracle, that the next girl he sees hitch-hiking will be his daughter.The problem with 'The Captive' is that it involves too many characters and subplots... and leaves almost all of them unaddressed. It's not that the story is over-sized or convoluted; other films have juggled far larger casts and far more complicated stories with ease. But there were obviously scenes cut from the film, in an attempt to keep down the running-time. Whatever choices were made in the cutting room, they were issues that should have been addressed in the screenplay, because you can't solve every problem with editing. Jumping forward and back in time is a device that can be intriguing, dropping clues to quickly grab attention, i.e. the early scene in which Jeffrey is interrogating Mika's boss (Bruce Greenwood, portraying one of the several characters who serve no function whatsoever, except perhaps as red herrings in a previous draft that didn't give away the mystery immediately) and the audience learns that Nicole has gone missing in 2013... but since her character doesn't appear until afterward, it's easy to miss this detail, especially if you haven't been paying attention to the dates that pop up briefly every scene. When it does rewind to 2005, it doesn't help much to propel the plot. Nicole heads up the team of RCMP detectives working on cases involving children; Jeffrey is the hotshot with the 'excellent clearance rate' who has transferred from homicide for mysterious reasons; that doesn't stop her from 'testing' him with some awful piece of child porn, then acting smug when he expresses disgust and outrage, as if he didn't realize that this would be a part of his mandate in a squad investigating child abuse. Then both Jeffrey and the viewer meet the eclectic group of cops on the team, in the contrived manner of NCIS or CSI: Miami -- the tech guy, the science guy, the pattern recognition guy... wait, the what? So they dump out a large puzzle on the table in a jumbled mess, and he soon describes in detail the finished picture on the box. 'That's impressive', says the new guy. Sure is. Too bad this 'pattern recognition' character does absolutely nothing through the rest of the film. There are other examples that I won't get into, for spoilage reasons. Needless to say, I was surprised by the seriously flawed story-telling; the chronological confusion is exacerbated by the number of 'jumps' - 2005, 2006, 2011, 2012, 2013... it's an amateurish mistake. Maybe I expect too much from Atom Egoyan. Usually, I associate Egoyan with prestigious, artistic film-making, but I don't think that reputation exists south of the border. In Canada, he deserves as much credit as David Cronenberg and Denis Villeneuve for establishing a Canadian cinematic identity, for 'Exotica' and 'The Sweet Hereafter' alone. But that was a long time ago. If I didn't know that Egoyan directed this film, I probably wouldn't have been so patient with the disjointed, off-putting mess that is made of the story. There are inconsistencies in the tale that no brilliant performance, no poignant visual metaphors can balance out.Nevertheless, it's beautifully shot, it has deep emotional resonancy, and it's suspenseful, even if it's not prime Egoyan; if you're willing to be patient with an often frustrating narrative, it's worth watching.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K7BEFOWENRDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PJW34PC#wasThisHelpful","R3K7BEFOWENRDI","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[SPOILERS!]'Kill the Messenger' is the negative image of 'American Sniper', a counterpunch in some strange contest of propaganda cinema. Like 'American Sniper', it's also a very entertaining film; it isn't groundbreaking, as it follows a deep narrative track carved out by movies like 'All the Presidents Men' and 'JFK'. There's an inevitability to the plot that doesn't trace back to the title, or even the viewer's familiarity with the book or the original articles; it feels inevitable because it's predictable, and it's predictable because its been done. The only reason a legit true story has for fitting itself to the well-worn grooves and cogs of Hollywood formula is because it's targeting a wider audience. But as was the case in 'American Sniper', smoothing those rough edges for the sake of mass appeal makes it harder to hang on to, less memorable and less true. The compromises that converted these true-life biopics into Hollywood product are also the variables that kept them from greatness.The 'Sniper/Messenger' parallel is purely conjectural, but the similarities aren't hard to spot. Both films are based on best-selling books about public figures who did something remarkable, but were also heavily criticised for their accomplishments. Chris Kyle was a Navy SEAL who killed over 150 people as a sniper in the occupation of Iraq, more than any other sniper in US military history. Gary Webb was a San Jose Mercury News Reporter who exposed the link between the CIA's funding of Nicaraguan rebels and the widespread trafficking of crack cocaine in cities across the US. Both men become symbols for a political POV, and both men died by gunshot wounds to the head -- Kyle by another veteran allegedly suffering from PTSD, while Webb's death was ruled a suicide. Conspiracy theories accusing the government for responsibility in both deaths are fairly popular; Webb suffered two fatal gunshot wounds to the head, which always raises red flags in a death that was ruled as a suicide.Although Webb was initially celebrated in the journalistic community, organizations like the LA Times and Washington Post criticized his series of articles -- 'Dark Alliance' -- as ethically reckless, and discredited both Webb and his work. He was never able to support himself as a journalist after his editor backed away from the stories. Claims that Webb was the victim of a smear campaign form the basic premise of 'Kill the Messenger'.Even though I was well aware of Webb's articles -- which were later vindicated to a large extent by a CIA document admitting to their involvement with known drug traffickers -- it was still fascinating to watch as Webb began pulling at the threads of the mask, the cover-up, which were hanging there for anyone to pull, but no one did. It was a sloppy operation, which kind of makes sense when you realize that the CIA are better at acting like spies than being spies. Like any huge, government bureaucracy, there were too many people to keep the secret forever. But they're well aware that forever isn't necessary. They just have to keep it long enough to protect the company men and important assets who were directly involved. So the truth always comes out, twenty or thirty years later, and its all new faces by then, who insist that the CIA is done with drugs and president killing. Or maybe not.Jeremy Renner is a great actor, and he does an excellent job as Webb. If it's a warrior to warrior battle between Jeremy Renner and 'The Hurt Locker' versus Bradley Cooper and 'American Sniper', there's no question -- 'The Hurt Locker' is a masterpiece, and Renner killed it; 'American Sniper' is a good movie, but not on that same level of greatness. 'Kill the Messenger' isn't on that level either... it's enjoyable, and powerful at times, but it's also clear that Webb's tale -- like Kyle's -- has been repackaged and adjusted to make it more palatable for the American public, which compromises the original story, in my opinion. Hollywood doesn't need more propaganda. And since I have my own problems with the 'War on Drugs' in the first place, a prohibition that oversteps governmental authority, I think that 'Kill the Messenger' ends up losing its grasp on the sheer hypocrisy behind the audacity; I think Gary Webb broke an important story, but the film might end up replacing the facts.Still, it's a film worth watching. When you set the political context aside, it moves very well, with some standout supporting roles by a lot of respected actors. Oliver Platt and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are great as Webb's worried, then supportive, then actively unhelpful editors. The ending bogs down, as the story becomes progressively darker, and concludes on the aforementioned inevitable and depressing note. While it's not intended to be a feel-good film, the speech Webb delivers to a now hostile room full of reporters is excruciating to watch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37I20DHL2HT7Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P6VLL0G#wasThisHelpful","R37I20DHL2HT7Q","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is basically an oversized special-issue of Blade Magazine... which is what I was looking for. It has some interesting articles, including a fine piece by Michael Janich about his personal history with 'tactical folders'; if it were anyone else, that might seem lame, but fortunately, Janich played an integral role in the modern history of tactical knives, so his perspective is pretty damn interesting. Much of the page-space is devoted to blade porn, of course. You get hundreds of pages of beautifully photographed custom knives, most of them by American Bladesmith Society members. This means lots of traditional Bowies and Fighters, lots of Mammoth-tusk and brass bolsters and mosaic Damascus. The majority are knives too pretty for using, really, but there's also a selection of more 'cutting edge' designs, i.e. tactical flippers dressed up in Mokume and Moku-ti, 'Timascus', 'lightning strike' carbon fiber, 'Super-Collider' and 'Super-Conductor' and Zirconium... which are also too pretty and pricey for using. There's also a huge reference section, essentially a phonebook for the knife community, which takes up more space than it should, given the book's cover price. This is information you can easily find online. Needless to say, it's a book for hardcore knife-aficionados only.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJFIJSC032KG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8GUR54#wasThisHelpful","RJFIJSC032KG","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are beautifully-produced, high-quality playing cards. I'm not trying to be David Blaine, and I'm not trying to win the World Series of Poker. I was attracted to this deck as an art object, and as deadly weapons, and they're very impressive in both respects. It would have been interesting to see artist Tom Lane's style applied to a visionary redesign of the 'face' cards, but the classic Bicycle Kings and Queens work too.As far as the construction, these are a very thick, sturdy stock, with a slick, plasticized surface for quick shuffling and dealing; but they also have a finely-grained texture that prevents them from being too slippery. And most importantly, if it becomes necessary to employ the 'Archangels' as deadly weapons, you can unleash divine wrath and retribution without worrying about blood stains.The price was pretty reasonable, and the variety of aesthetically pleasing card decks available makes this the kind of collectible you can get into without going broke. Also, I can use my Bicycle deck to master the martial arts of 'card-jitsu' and 'deck fu', throwing them with enough force to slice up fruit. I know, kitchen knives and blenders work better for food processing, or so the Nazi-Zionist-Scientologist-Anarcho-Buddhist media would have you believe. But if I can accomplish all my fruit-slicing needs with a 3$ deck of playing cards, I can use the savings to retire early in the proverbial lap of luxury...

"""'I killed Richie Wheeler...' 'Sure you did.' BLAM.""Brace yourself for this shocking revelation: the acting in this tightly coiled, ingeniously crafted crime drama, starring Tom Hardy, James Gandolfini, and Noomi Rapace, is quite good. It made me believe they were people with completely different names and everything. Yes, that sentence is so stupid, you'd probably be disappointed with your cat for saying it. There is, however, a 5-carat 100-Rockwell diamond of hard, shiny truth in it, since I'm sick of watching actors who can't even be convincing when they're essentially playing themselves.Tom Hardy is the best actor of his generation -- as much as I like Jake Gyllenhaal, Ed Norton and Joaquin Phoenix, Hardy is better. I have a tendency to step outside the narrative, vivisecting films as they play, examining the story, the editing, the direction -- the guts of the work. Nothing triggers this more frequently than an apparent 'flaw', and flawed acting is the most common variety. The better a film is -- usually -- the less often this happens. I don't remember anything pulling me from the story in 'The Drop'. Tom Hardy is as impressive here as he was in 'Locke'. That's a big, important statement that I don't take lightly, believe me. And while it was sad to watch James Gandolfini's final role, this is the final performance and the final film that every actor prays for. Hardy and Gandolfini are absolutely incredible, and Noomi Rapace is game for the challenge of matching them, never flagging, never faltering.Novelist Dennis Lehane and director Michael R. Roskam deserve much of the credit, obviously. I've been keeping up with Lehane's novels for over a decade, and as one of the crime writers David Simon and Ed Burns hand-picked for 'The Wire' -- one of the 3 best TV series of all time -- his name is cast in platinum, as far as I'm concerned. He's also had his novels adapted into consistently brilliant films: 'Mystic River', directed by Clint Eastwood; 'Shutter Island', directed by Martin Scorcese; and 'Gone Baby Gone', directed by Ben Affleck. Considering the filmography that the first two directors have behind them, it seems crazy that the best of these three excellent films was Ben Affleck's directorial debut, but it's true.Mastering yet another tiny regional accent (the region is tiny, not the accent), Hardy plays Bob Sagowski in 'The Drop'. He's a simple, earnest bartender in Brooklyn, albeit one with a criminal history, and a loose connection to Chechnyan mobsters. The bar was once owned by 'Cousin Marv', portrayed by Gandolfini, whose aspirations as a neighborhood bookie and gangster were crushed when Chechnya invaded his particular corner of Brooklyn. Still managing and tending the bar with Bob, Marv's bitterness leads him down a dangerous road. The illicit cash proceeds of various criminal endeavors throughout the Borough are collected in a floating 'drop': one of the many bars under the mobster's aegis, decided on with very little notice. So Marv is waiting for the word, and making very bad plans.Bob is slow, good-natured, and unambitious. His career as a gangster ended the same day Cousin Marv's did, and now he's just another American errand boy for the new mobster management. But what Lehane is getting at with Bob's habit of attending mass without taking communion, what the director hints at, and Hardy himself communicates with the subtlest changes of expression, is eventually made very clear: don't f*** with Bob. He's not just the sweet, dumb guy he seems to be, he's dangerous; and he might even have a couple skeletons in his closet (or basement, or wherever the proper place for skeletons might be... I'm not an HGTV fan). When he finds an abused and abandoned pitbull puppy in a garbage can, he meets Nadia -- Noomi Rapace. She's got a dark past herself of course, involving a psychopath who made his reputation by allegedly killing a local who vanished years earlier. As Bob and Nadia build a relationship around the foundling puppy, a small-time robbery puts Bob and Marv squarely responsible for the lost money, and raises the suspicion of both the mob and the cops. Tension mounts when Bob is confronted by the thug who left his pup in Nadia's garbage can -- her ex-boyfriend. When he threatens to take his dog back, s*** gets real.Unless you're one of those super-religious types who get all twitchy when people use words like s*** and f***, you need to go watch 'The Drop' (a.k.a. 'Leave the Puppy Alone, Part 1') right now. Forget about volunteer work, prayer, or bathing your smelly cat, and watch this movie. It will make you a better person. It will make you cool. It will regenerate that missing kidney you've been whining about. Do it now (or whenever you've got the time, its not important).P.S.: *Leave the Puppy Alone, Part 1: The Drop, is far better than its less realistic sequel -- Leave the Puppy Alone, Part 2: John Wick. In fact, it almost seems like a completely unrelated story. If it weren't for the puppy, and the title -- which, admittedly, I made up -- you wouldn't guess there was any connection at all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A4A3ELSLFISQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4UQ038#wasThisHelpful","R3A4A3ELSLFISQ","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pitch Black was premium-grade science-fiction/horror. It gathered up all the creative detritus left behind by the Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, Star Trek, and E.C. Comics like Weird Science, retro-fitted them for use in a CGI-equipped modern-day monster movie, and hit the ignition. It didn't explode. Or it did, but in a good way.A space-ship full of cosmic pilgrims crash-lands on a thoroughly alien world. They find themselves in a scorched wasteland, a desert graveyard holding the bones of hill-sized behemoths. It seems bad, and the presence of a convict named Riddick makes things seem even worse. When they learn that subterranean tunnels house myriads upon myriads of nocturnal exo-monstrosities, like terrifying hybrids of the Hammerhead shark, Komodo dragon, Bengal tiger, and the alien from `Alien', they're relieved that these terrifying things can't handle sunlight... starlight... whatever. When they learn that the hourglass is about to be flipped, and the planet's eccentric orbit and axial rotation will result in something too `lastingly dark' to call `night', well... it's a bit scary. Riddick ends up being the pitch-black anti-hero his badge-wearing escort isn't, and Radha Mitchell finds classic 1961-style redemption for her selfish past.Director David Twohy earned his stellar reputation among SF and horror fans with `Pitch Black', and deservedly so.

"[Some Spoilers]This kind of film should probably be on the endangered species list. The 'Multiversal Dinner Party' sub-genre isn't going to be trading punches with Captain America at the box office, but that's alright. If the creators of this crafty little pic had trans-festival ticket-sale aspirations, they're living in a fantasy world where money doesn't matter and philosophers are sex symbols.'Coherence' gets a bit incoherent at times -- one would assume by design -- using a cinema verite approach with semi-improvised dialogue, conversations melding into white noise as the actors talk over each other, sentences dropping off mid-way through, or drifting into... But this naturalism makes the strangeness to come all the more convincing.This could have easily been an off-Broadway play. It has no CGI or FX make-up, and takes place almost entirely in the dining-room of a suburban L.A. bungalow. It begins with a small dinner-party attended by several affluent 30 and 40-somethings. The viewer learns that a comet is in the solar neighborhood, and when cell-phone touch-screens spontaneously shatter, it is assumed to be somehow responsible. They move on to other topics, however, introducing a 'Birdman'-like parallel when Mike mentions being a long-time regular on the TV-series 'Roswell'; another guest claims to be a fan of the series, but doesn't remember him. The actor who portrays Mike, Nicholas Brendon, played 'Xander' on 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer', which was on the same network as 'Roswell', at roughly the same time; they also shared a large and devoted fan-base, appealing to identical demographics. This comical exchange has a slight factual dissonance -- or a symmetrical confusion -- that might be explained by unknowingly stepping through a doorway, inexplicably opened in the wake of the comet, that leads into the next universe over... like a needle skipping onto the closest of a seemingly infinite number of alternate narrative tracks*; it serves as foreshadowing for events to come.When the lights go out, it triggers a kind of instinctive Cro-Magnon panic, especially since they fear it might also relate to the comet. The candles come out, and high anxiety settles into a slightly paranoid disquiet. When they notice a house nearby with lights on, two of the men venture out to see if they know more. That's when things get weird. They return looking shaken, if not terrified, to report that when they looked through the window of the other house... they saw themselves. The entire group. Sitting around the table. This baffling tale is followed by a knock and a mysterious note on the door.Doppelgangers, glow-sticks, code words, and games with photos and numbers; as the group overthinks, then underthinks, always over-reacting, they only succeed in generally freaking one another out. By the end, the story really is incoherent. But it never made much sense in the first place; the strength of the film is the actors, and the characters, and watching thousands of years of intellectual and social progression completely unravel.Highly recommended.P.S.: FOOTNOTE *(Each universe might differ by as little as the super-positional possibilities of a subatomic particle -- defined by the probability wave function that famously collapses when someone gets curious enough to crack the lid and check up on the cat... who was alive AND dead, thanks to the poison gas triggered/not-triggered by the decay of a cesium isotope. 'As above, so below' -- in this case, a thought experiment by Erwin Schrodinger, the cat is either alive or dead; but it elucidated the alchemical maxim by demonstrating how the counter-intuitive weirdness of quantum mechanics and the subatomic level in general, can also affect the world at the macro-level. Calculating all the possible positions of every particle, for every nano-second in the last 13 billion years, multiplied exponentially by the super-positional nano-seconds of every other particle in the universe, produces a number of theoretical multiversal variations so vast it approaches the infinite.

"[Spoiler-Free and long, with a rambling intro; skip down to the paragraph preceded by two stars (**) if you’re only interested in ‘Gone Girl’.]David Fincher has built a body of work that is stylistically distinctive, increasingly complex, and thoroughly engaging. Movies like ‘Alien3’, ‘Panic Room’, and ‘The Game’ all had moments of brilliance and visual power reminiscent of Ridley Scott. ‘Se7en’ was his first real success, a slick, stylish thriller that was the most horrifying serial killer film of the nineties, with the exception of ‘Silence of the Lambs’. But criticism that Fincher was approaching movie-making with the techniques and aesthetics that made him famous as a director of music videos -- flashy and exciting, but essentially hollow -- certainly had some merit. ‘Fight Club’, however, Fincher's cult hit based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel, was a flawed masterpiece of undeniable originality, power, and messy, sticky substance.‘Zodiac’ was a far more mature take on serial killers. A brilliant adaptation of a difficult true-crime memoir, it is one of the best films of the millennium. It was the product of an incredibly talented and confident film-maker who had harnessed a high-voltage vision and propulsive narrative style. It’s hard to imagine ‘Zodiac’ in another director’s hands; the story is incredibly complicated, relying on minute details and cryptic clues, with multiple suspects, and a frustrating variety of red herrings and dead-ends. Fincher juggles what could have been a tedious and confusing tale with utter genius.Even movies I had no interest in before learning that he directed them – ‘The Social Network’ and ‘The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo’ – ended up blowing me away. The latter, based on the first book of the best-selling Liz Salander trilogy, is probably what led to Fincher’s latest project, another adaptation of a mega-selling novel.**‘Gone Girl’ deserves all the superlatives and hyperbole being flung at it. I was thoroughly uninterested in (unaware of?) the novel; but the intentional correlations to the Scott and Lacie Peterson murder case sparked my curiosity, as did interesting twists such as the title character’s role in a series of Nancy Drew-type children’s books – created by her parents -- called ‘Amazing Amy’. Once again, in another director’s hands, this could have been a mediocre, made-for-TV mystery. To be fair, the writer deserves credit; this is a clever subversion of viewer expectations, which in turn becomes a sly commentary on media manipulation.Ben Affleck is the perfect choice for the lead as Nick Dunne, and his physical resemblance to Scott Peterson deepens the meta-contextual associations (I never thought I’d utter those words, and yet Birdman and Gone Girl both rely on specific but never specified mass-cultural awareness), and viewer assumptions about his character – even though the intentional similarities to the case soon diverge from reality. His portrayal of Nick Dunne -- a charming and selfish ‘alpha male’ who’s used to getting his way – isn’t too much of a stretch. The way in which he walks the line of viewer judgement and perception, moving from one side of the margin to the other, from concerned husband, to unfairly accused victim, to probable killer and terrible person, et cetera… is impressive.Not as impressive as Rosamund Pike, however. She’s one of those rare-beautiful actresses whose appearance stands out, as opposed to the eternal queue of bakery-fresh generic beauties lined up at the gates of celluloid stardom. As viewers and police alike struggle to uncover the truth behind the disappearance of ‘Amazing Amy’, Pike creates an utterly fascinating mystery in the character of Amy Dunne herself.Fincher takes us through the pages of ‘Amazing Amy’s Diary’, beginning with a storybook romance, but a venomous serpent is sleeping, nestled in one of these lover’s hearts. The ‘diary flashbacks’ soon begin to diverge from the ‘reality’ that Nick Dunne is giving police. As the investigation of Amy’s disappearance begins to look harder into the husband’s story, the evidence seeks him out like a lodestone.As thoroughly engaging as ‘Gone Girl’ is as a mystery and a thriller, it is just as noteworthy for its satirical critique of ‘news entertainment’, and the savage manner that the media tears people apart over a smile at the wrong moment, and uses the tragedy of others as obscene amusement. At the risk of sounding like a smug, self-righteous jerk, I’ve always tried to question the assertions force-fed to us by the media; but I’m well aware that I often fail in that regard. Humans are programmed to make assumptions; to gather information from a trusted source and accept it as truth. Questioning the information we’ve already accepted as ‘fact’ is not natural, and in most cases, without real reward or advantage. ‘Gone Girl’ -- like Dan Gilroy’s ‘Nightcrawler’ -- is a brilliant thriller, but it also happens to be a clever satirical examination of truth, justice, and the media. Wow. That sounded excessively heavy and dry. Suffice it to say that David Fincher has created another 5-star film, one that is beautifully shot, cut, and performed. It’s gripping and very, very surprising. [91/100][ I went into ‘Gone Girl’ without the spoilers, so I’m refraining from spoilers in this review. I suggest anyone who hasn’t read the book, or seen the film, cautiously avoid spoilers before hitting play. There’s not that many films for which I feel such warnings are necessary, but this is one.]","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8DF96FROT894/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4USLK8#wasThisHelpful","R8DF96FROT894","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cormac McCarthy, James Carlos Blake, Ron Hansen, Larry McMurtry, and Charles Frazier are the reigning lords of the hard-eyed American historical novel. 'Blood Meridian' can't be called a 'western', any more than 'Wildwood Boys' or 'Desperadoes'. Larry McMurtry comes closest to embracing the tropes of the 'western' genre, but subverts reader expectations at every turn. The frontier was not settled by singing cowboys. Native Americans weren't simple savages, but they weren't the noble nature-loving quasi-Buddhists that became the Hollywood cliché in the late-sixties and seventies. The 'New World' was a brutal, vicious battleground, where every random encounter between strangers would very likely end violently.Patrick DeWitt has joined this august company with `The Sisters Brothers', a novel that combines the flawlessly crafted prose of Charles Frazier or fellow Canadian Michael Ondaatje, with a darkly comical tale that suggests Charles Portis -- 'True Grit' as realized by the Coen Brothers - and James Carlos Blake - particularly his brutal masterpiece `In the Rogue Blood'. Like the latter, DeWitt's book is a story about brothers who are born killers made for a bloody world; like the former, it has a darkly comedic intelligence. As a Canadian myself, I felt bad about NOT feeling bad about the lack of native literary fiber in my pulp-heavy diet. Ondaatje, yes. Atwood, sure. But beyond `Oryx and Crake', I can't remember the last time I read another Canadian novel. Tony Burgess and `Pontypool Changes Everything', I guess, preceded by the loosely connected stories in `The Hellmouths of Bewdley'... 10, 15 years ago. Which means that I'm confessing to being a bad Canadian. Even before Jian Gomeshi was unmasked as Jack the Ripper, I still fled in terror when `Canada Reads' infected the CBC airwaves, with a suitably terrifying frontman. I knew that anyone who could create music as undeniably evil as the sonic terrorism of Moxy Fruvous had to house rows of retractable shark teeth behind that smile...I feel like Dewitt has finally crafted Canlit that doesn't feel like a homework assignment. `The Sisters Brothers' is a cocaine counterpoint to the literary laxatives of `Two Solitudes' and `The Stone Angel'. If the point of using Hugh f*****g McLennan and Margaret f*****g Lawrence was to scare kids away from Canlit forever - brilliant. They could also have value as practical demonstrations of Relativity: narrative black holes clearly distorting space-time, each paragraph requires a dogged determination; when you manage to break free of it's oppressive gravitational pull, hours have passed... and you're still on the same page.It's probably true that those wacky kids would hate any book they're forced to read. But the chances of creating an entire generation of anti-Canlit jihadists will be significantly reduced if we take a sledge-hammer to `The Stone Angel' and go with `The Sisters Brothers' instead. Unless teenagers completely suck. I'm willing to consider that possibility.What's it about, you ask? Due to my severe case of CBPTSD (Canlit-based Post Traumatic Stress Dissorder), any attempts at literary synopsis or criticism may result in projectile vomit, pointy eyeballs, and an elegant, convulsive style of dance that is like an unholy union of Krumpin', Riverdance, and the Macarena... but it's actually a Grand Mal seizure. Still, I'm doing this for my country, dammit!Eli and Charlie Sisters are cold-blooded killers employed by a man known as `The Commodore'. Eli is the narrator of the tale, and he often defers to his brother. Eli has a soft streak that Charlie doesn't seem to possess, showing a sympathy and occasional empathy that is totally inappropriate for a hired gun. Charlie is very different person - lean and quick and calculating, with a violent temper that often affects his trigger finger... his primary source of income.The story opens in Oregon City, as the Sisters brothers set out on orders to murder a prospector named Hermann Kermit Warm, whom the Commodore has denounced simply as a thief. Their journey to San Francisco is an eventful one, and Charlie begins to express anger with The Commodore, and dissatisfaction with their arrangement. Upon arriving in the city, they track down a friend of Warm's, who reveals some very interesting details concerning the German prospector's partnership and subsequent falling-out with The Commodore. It involves a method of finding and extracting gold from riverbeds, based on a chemical of Warm's devising. He absconded with his work and secrets when he realized that his partner would certainly kill him once the formula was done. Eli and Charlie now must decide between loyalty to their employer, and a chance to get rich by betraying him.In between, `The Sisters Brothers' is rich to overflowing with fascinating characters and stories. The dynamic between Eli and Charlie provides the most memorable relationships and characters I've come across in ages. This is one of my new favorites, and it feels super patriotic to say that Patrick DeWitt is one of my favorite authors. He's saved fiction in Canada. If someone says that Canadian Literature doesn't need saving - smite them with a righteous vengeance!... Or start a conversation. Either way is good. But READ this book... Do it for Canada (Or if you're American, read it because it f*****g rocks).","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OHJBSFWA4V1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062041282#wasThisHelpful","R3OHJBSFWA4V1D","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked the idea of the series, and I thought I liked the laid-back manner the producers used, so the artist could explain their process, inspirations, personal history, and so on. I thought that was what I wanted. But after watching the entire 6 season run, I found two memorable segments on artists who were personal favorites -- particularly Walton Ford -- and one memorable segment on an artist I was unfamiliar with, and who has since become a new favorite, Shahzia Sikander.It didn't take long to remember why I usually avoid reading interviews with my favorite artists. It's f***ing torture. Sometimes, it's the fault of the interviewer, but it's never enlightening (I'll amend that to 'rarely'; I have read interesting artist comments, but it's 1 time in 20. Critics always do a better job than the artist. Call it the ""Yeah, Ditto"" phenomenon). Even Gerhard Richter, one of the artists I respect more than any other, isn't able to say anything meaningful about his massive catalogue raisonne. They're not writers. And the 'good talker/bad artist's who end up famous are usually con-men (con-people?); they're an insult to the real artists killing themselves with Cheetos at the moment, because they haven't learned schmoozing and the jargon-laden language of bulls*** common to crappy artists, tech salesmen and politicians. 'How to Say Nothing in Eighty Words or Higher'... until people assume the fault lies with them, and drift away with a glazed look in their eye... Hint: if the listener doesn't understand what the speaker is saying, the fault probably lies with the speaker, not the listener -- art is not quantum mechanics. Art is another form of communication. If an artist has failed to communicate their meaning to an audience, the fault probably lies with the artist.Too many of the artists featured had achieved success through trendy whims that breeze through the galleries of New York and Paris, making ugly, meaningless works that spark no feelings and no intellectual curiosity, sold by agents and gallery owners who market personalities, regardless of their talent or utter lack thereof. The goal is to convince people that the artist and their acolytes understand something, see something that others do not, even though this failure to effectively communicate means an artist has failed. But rich Americans believe in the 'fake it til you make it' principle, and will buy any moronic piece of crap that the 'in crowd' believe to be cutting edge brilliance.After listening to dozens of famous pretend artists stumble through their used car salesman routine for the three hundredth time, obviously possessing no talent and no way of articulating a clever explanation for superficial trash, it gets really dull. A bit of variety would have been nice; more artists with craft and skill -- it's okay to be talented again... you don't have to deliberately make crap that looks like it was slapped together by a retarded kid (sorry, that's unfair to mentally handicapped kids).This would make a great sleep aid. I'm getting drowsy just thinking about it... and I LOVE art.P.S.: Reading this again, it sounds pretty hostile. Wow. I must have been in a bad mood. Check the PBS website for a list of the artists involved, if you like even a quarter of the people featured, you'll likely get way more out of this than I did. If you're into some of the styles that the show-runners favor, that's all that matters anyway. And the price was really reasonable for the amount of material collected. If you don't recognize any names... you should probably skip it and check out some info first.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDCY6B84DAVJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081NAUK8#wasThisHelpful","RDCY6B84DAVJU","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This stunning book, published by Somogy, was released to coincide with the accompanying exhibition in 2001. Arnold Bocklin, one of the most brilliant and still under-rated artists of the 19th Century, produced a work that has deeply affected generations of admirers, 'The Isle of the Dead'. This French-language monograph includes dozens of works by a diverse array of talents, all created for the exhibition and inspired by Bocklin's most famous piece. It also includes scholarly articles on the paintings' unique and lasting appeal, inspiring some of the 20th Century's greatest artists. Ernst Fuchs, H.R. Giger and Fabrizio Clerici are just three of the contributors that make this book as fascinating as it is. It has also been selling for ridiculous prices, unfortunately, owing to the quality of the work and the resurgent interest in Arnold Bocklin.

"This is an absolutely beautiful book. Schwabe was a Swiss Symbolist who was not as well known as most of his contemporaries, but who produced a remarkable body of work as both a painter and illustrator. The only artist I can really compare him with is Max Klinger, in terms of 2-D subject matter and media. But Klinger is best known as an Art Nouveau sculptor, something for which Scwabe never made his name known.The reproductions in this volume are excellent, especially given the book's age -- it was published in the mid-nineties. It contains his most famous and important paintings, as well as lesser-known works and preliminary studies. His illustrations are just as fascinating, providing work for Baudelaire and some of the other most notorious writers of the time. His drawings are not as explicitly sexual or satanic as the oeuvre of Felicien Rops, and he wasn't the proto-surrealist visionary that Klinger was, but his pictures are still far ahead of their time, and brilliantly executed. The downside -- the text is in French. If you can't read French, here's a great book to learn with. Or screw it...

"Whenever a monograph is released in conjunction with a gallery or museum exhibition, it usually shares the faults and successes of the show that inspired it. The biggest problem here is that it has a very limited selection of Hunt's paintings, reflecting the real-world logistical difficulties of convincing private owners and public galleries to part with such rare, expensive and delicate treasures. The reproductions in the book are limited, therefore, and on more than one occasion include slightly different variations of the same painting, as well as thoroughly irrelevant photographs of Hunt's homemade shirts and skirts and whatnot. As a consumer, I would appreciate a selection of the works they couldn't acquire for the exhibition; there is no reason for not including them, and it would improve the anemic limitations of the catalogue. One more gripe: many of the reproductions are of a poor quality, which there is no excuse for. Hunt enthusiasts should wait for a Phaidon monograph, a publisher who has done brilliant work with Millais, Waterhouse, and Alma-Tadema.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HHTX2DRYBJCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300148321#wasThisHelpful","R1HHTX2DRYBJCU","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The third and final volume of Charles Burns' latest sequential art masterpiece is here. This is not his magnum opus. That honor goes to 'Black Hole' (which, on an unrelated note, featured prominently in 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes', as the graphic novel that a human character offers to the wise, semi-literate Orangutan; later, he reads from it to his new friend, before things go wrong at the hydro dam). This trilogy -- which is made up of X'ed Out (Bk.1), The Hive (Bk.2), and Sugar Skull (Bk.3) -- is something exciting for a long time Burns fan like myself.The color art allows the strong European influences to show, and the 'ligne claire' technique he employs for the deepest dream levels of the story tie in to the narrative as well. Doug, the protagonist, is a performance artist and poet who goes by the stage-name 'Nitnit' -- 'Tintin' in reverse. His 'act' is an unfortunate variation of the Burroughs/Gysin 'cut-up' method -- imagine collage poetry and automatic writing puking on one another. The Moroccan motifs of the 'Interzone' world with its Mugwumps and lizard-men, are executed in the style of Herge and Jacobs, as are the endpapers and the design of the albums themselves -- all based on the adventures of a globe-trotting (and moon-hopping) teenage journalist from Belgium. Even Doug's silent Virgil, a dead black cat named 'Inky', is a direct contrast to Tintin's little white dog, 'Snowy'... who could speak (though I don't think anyone understood him).The Burroughs influence is just as strong -- the Moroccan Interzone-world where Doug has layered his memories in 'Naked Lunch'-nightmares -- and it signals Doug's state of mind as a morphine addict, as well as the horrors of withdrawal. We also learn that there is nothing in Doug's life so horrible that it justifies his fear. He's a coward, which is no doubt a terrifying revelation itself. He really is Nitnit, the reverse of Tintin. If Tintin represents bravery, curiosity, and a love of life, Doug has become the anti-Tintin.As to the specifics of the story, I'll keep this spoiler-free. This is essentially a dark psychological drama, with a very sad outcome. But this trilogy is one of the most beautifully executed examples of comic art ever. Period. I can't say that it's better, artistically, than the infinite pools of Feldstein spot-blacks that make up the 360-pages of Black Hole, but it's close.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R109NC26TYWDHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307907902#wasThisHelpful","R109NC26TYWDHA","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[No, I'm not serious. But the violence is far more realistic than the last anime incarnation of 'Berserk'.]If you've ever wanted to see a realistic film depiction of Medieval siege-warfare, well... go elsewhere. `Berserk' is a strange, hyper-violent vision of European sword and sorcery, from a Japanese POV. It looks like the dark ages, but there's no historical connection whatsoever; instead, it serves as a brutal playground for Kentaro Miura's twisted imagination.This film trilogy is actually a reboot; it takes the viewer back to the first meeting of Guts the Black Swordsman and The Band of the Hawk, rather than acting as a sequel to the first series. It's different from the manga as well, but retains the essence of the tale.While I liked the original anime, I wasn't terribly impressed with the animation. This film, as well as the two that follow, are spectacular in comparison. The blend of animation and CGI isn't flawless, but it's pretty damn good, providing much more detailed art and realistic movements. The battle scenes, in particular, are very dynamic, giving the violence the kind of impact it needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZRFIDAHEXJLK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008UE8ICK#wasThisHelpful","R2ZRFIDAHEXJLK","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're a Walking Dead viewer wondering if the comic is as good as the series -- the short answer is yes. In some ways, the show has transcended the source material, and as someone who followed the comics before the series, I don't say that lightly. But in other ways, the comic is incredibly powerful, and remains the soul and center. One thing Kirkman, Adlard, and the writers of the show deserve praise for is the way both storylines have diverged. 'The Walking Dead' is essentially two parallel worlds, and both have really bad luck. If you know the comic, you will still have no idea what's going to happen in the show, and vice versa. There are moments where both stories seem to coalesce, but then break apart to follow separate roads once again.This is the format to buy, without question. The deluxe hardcover is larger, the 8"" x 11"" oversized edition instead of the standard 7"" x 10"". Each hardcover book contains two of the softcover volumes; so Book 1 collects Volumes 1 and 2. Every storyline is about the same length -- 6 comicbook issues. So the Volumes are around 150 pages, and the Books are a bit longer, 320 or so pages; they come with extras -- like the original single-issue covers, and miscellaneous artwork from Charlie Adlard and Tony Moore -- that the softcover Volumes do not. While Adlard has been the series artist for a very long time, and does a brilliant, remarkably quick, and consistent job, Tony Moore's art in Book 1 played a big part in the success of 'The Walking Dead'. He's one of the many artists I consider a 'favorite', but he couldn't keep up with the unforgiving monthly pace. Pricewise, each oversized, extra-long hardcover Book is about the same price as the two softcover volumes it collects. Highly recommended.P.S.: The Compendiums are the most affordable way to pick up the comic -- collecting 48 single issues/8 Volumes/4 Books/2 Omnibus(es) (Omnibae?). They're a bit awkward though. The Omnibus is the super-deluxe format, similar to the Absolute Editions from DC. Image does as excellent job producing each.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3053FJBMF68BT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1582406197#wasThisHelpful","R3053FJBMF68BT","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"`He just viciously murdered like... eighty people!?'`Yeah. It was a really cute dog.'`He seemed angrier about the car.'`It was a nice car.''John Wick' is another rousing entry in the ever-expanding action sub-genre known as `Now... you know you done ****** up, now, don't ya?'** To get more specific, there's actually a few basic templates; there's the `Taken' scenario, where the protagonist is a former special ops bad*ss turned bodyguard to the stars, and someone kidnaps his daughter, or kills his girl. Then there's the `Red' variation, where the hero is a former secret agent badass, who has been living quietly in retirement, until someone in the agency learns of his existence, labels him an unacceptable liability who knows way too much, and gives the order to terminate with mild prejudice. The scenario that `John Wick' shares with quite a few films, including `The Professional', by Luc Besson, and David Cronenberg's `A History of Violence', is a classic. It always involves a notoriously gifted hitman who has retired, gone into hiding, or been betrayed by his employer. He might be an emotionally stunted killer who finally makes a human connection - as in `The Professional' - or a one-time gangster who disappeared and made a new life for himself, forced to return to his violent ways to protect his family - as in `A History of Violence'.In `John Wick', Keanu Reeves plays a killer of prodigious ability who retired when he met the love of his life. When she succumbs to a sudden illness, Wick is grief-stricken. After the funeral, a posthumous delivery from his wife arrives. It's an adorable beagle puppy, and the accompanying card from the woman he just buried says she doesn't want him to forget how to love. Sniff. A ridiculously unfortunate gas-station encounter -- with the son of the Russian gangster he used to work for -- leads to a home invasion. Neither party recognizes the other, they just want his 1970 Mustang. None of this makes any sense. As the viewer later learns, his father is very rich. And yet, they orchestrate a violent armed robbery to steal a car. They take Wick for a `nobody', who would certainly report the crime, so they'll have to sell the car, which they try to do. They wear Bellaclavas to hide their faces, but the mobster's son lifts his mask to reveal himself. Then... the stupid ****s kill his love-puppy.That sad detail is not graphic, thankfully. It probably says something terrible that I've never enjoyed watching dozens of well-dressed thugs get super-slaughtered more than I did in `John Wick'. I don't know if there's any cosmic system of weights and measures that could balance the life of one sweet little beagle with a hundred dead a*******. And I'm quite sure no judicial system would accept a dead dog and a stolen car for a triple-digit massacre. But in Hollywood, you never, EVER, mess with another man's family, his car, OR his puppy.Keanu is back in Matrix mode, staying away from the things he does poorly - emoting, for one - and playing the kind of character he does well - blank-faced, mostly silent killing machines with an enigmatic charm that can almost be confused for intelligence. Reeves isn't smart. I've seen enough footage of him screwing up references to everything from Greek Myth to physics, with hilarious results, to accept him as a genius. He has matured, though, and he can become an inscrutable-but-likable killer as convincingly as anyone... except Ryan Gosling, in `Drive', and Terence Stamp, in `The Limey', and Mel Gibson in `Payback', and Chow Yun Fat in `The Killer', and Denzel Washington in `Man on Fire', and Clint Eastwood in `Unforgiven' (my personal favorite) AND `Gran Torino' (another example of how stealing the wrong man's car can be hazardous to your health) AND... well, Eastwood is undeniably the master when it comes to inscrutable killers out for vengeance.`John Wick' isn't doing anything that hasn't been done countless times before, but it does it well; it gets the hook set early, and it never lets the line go slack. And of course, the `Gun Fu' choreography is fast and slick, without glossing over the violent impact of bullets striking bone. If anyone in Hollywood qualifies as a 'Gun Fu' black belt, it's Keanu Reeves; regardless what your opinion of 'The Matrix' is, few films have revolutionized the mechanics of the action genre so profoundly. The supporting cast is solid as well; Willem Dafoe is a welcome addition as one of Wick's peers, looking to collect on the open 2 million dollar contract. For action fans, this is highly recommended; if you're not, stay away, because this is all about the chrome-plated carnage.P.S.: *For 'Leave the Puppy Alone, Part 1', check it out by it's Muslim name, 'The Drop', which it acquired after a prison-yard conversion. Happens all the time in Hollywood.P.S.2: **In case you were wondering, it's a line from the interrogation scene in 'Menace II Society'.P.S.3: ***Thanks Amazon!

"This double-volume hardcover set, collecting 'The Complete Etchings' of the 18th century artist Giovanni Battista Piranesi, is another beautiful, remarkably affordable release from Taschen. Piranesi is one of the most renowned artists to make engraving/etching his chosen medium, and this comprehensive slip-cased set shows off both the genius of Piranesi and the stunning possibilities of a now dying, if not dead, art-form. Speaking personally, between the late Baroque and painters like Salvator Rosa (to whom Piranesi was compared to), and the Neo-classicism and Romanticism of the early 19th century, not much worth mentioning was being created in Europe. Except for some masterful vedute by Venetian artists like Canalletto and Tiepolo, the Rococo period was dominated by the decadent, soulless style for which it's named. The Renaissance and Baroque masters were gone, and Italy would never again be the center of European Art.He is likely most famous for his 'Carceri d'invenzione', a sixteen print group depicting imaginary, sometimes slightly fantastic prisons. Justice and Law were still firmly anchored to Catholic dogma in the 1700's, and the penitentiaries were not concerned with rehabilitating criminals; instead they smaller versions of purgatory and hell. The pain one suffered on the rack was nothing compared to Satan's infernal machinations; but for a man still capable of redemption, torture was a warning, a taste of the eternal pain to come. In that spirit, Piranesi's 'Imaginary Prisons' can be seen as dreamlike, proto-surrealist imagery that captures the black essence of the 18th century prisons and dungeons.Rome was his inspiration. It is his series of engravings on Roman architectural art, perfectly scaled and minutely detailed, that was perhaps his most important work, as well as his Roman vedute, or views. His drawings of temple ruins, sagging arches and broken edifices captured the sad, beautiful evidence of Rome's former glory to perfection in 'Le Antichità Romane de' tempo della prima Repubblica e dei primi imperatori' (""Roman Antiquities of the Time of the First Republic and the First Emperors"") -- which is reprinted in its entirety. Piranesi spent years documenting Rome as it was in his lifetime; crumbling, collapsed, half-shattered and grown-over. Thousand-year-old ghosts still seem to inhabit this dead and broken Rome.Beyond these unique projects, his gifts as an architectural designer are demonstrated in the hundreds of plates he executed of chimneypieces and vases, etc. If that doesn't sound too interesting, I have to concur. But when Piranesi was set loose on anything, it became a grand and daring experiment. Editor Luigi Ficacci provides an illuminating biography with historical context, and because this is Taschen, it's provided three times over... in different languages. I wish Taschen would just publish separate English, German, and French editions separately, but it's something they do to cut down on costs, and for the price, it's a decent compromise. Each volume is about 10.25""w x 12.25""h, and together are a total of 800 pages. Instead of the thick, glossy art-book pages everyone loves, the paper-stock is a medium matte-finish, light-weight but acid-free. It works quite well for this release, however, since it's reproducing monochromatic and black and white artwork. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P4IUGAZD687T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=3836531968#wasThisHelpful","R3P4IUGAZD687T","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's no doubt been said by many a dewy-eyed fanboy (or fangirl) -- the sort who gets future-nostalgic for an apocalypse less likely than The Rapture or Ragnarok -- but I'll join the zombie-chorus anyway -- man, I love this show. I remember when I first picked up the trade paperback of volume 1; I was amazed at how good it was, but still skeptical. It was Image comics, after all, and those who only know Image since Robert Kirkman became supreme overlord probably have no idea that Image used to suck with an absolute purity that makes diamonds look like horse-s***. It won me over after I mowed through the available material -- I think volume 5 was out at the time. One of the critical remarks that stood out then said something to the effect of ""'The Walking Dead' would make an incredible HBO series""; it may seem obvious now, but not long ago, that was a very unlikely prospect. Since one of my top 5 favorite shows had wrapped up around that time -- HBO's `Rome' -- I thought that sounded like the best idea I'd ever heard. As it turned out, HBO didn't agree. When I heard AMC had greenlit a six-episode run, I was excited, then uncertain, and then pessimistic. `No swearing, no sex, the violence will be toned down, the fact they only committed to 6 episodes means they're not really behind it'. All of those things were true -- except the violence -- but in the end, none of it mattered. Like Breaking Bad, they managed realistic dialogue without using 'f**k' or 's**t', which was quite impressive. Like the comics, there was virtually no sex... and was much better because of it. I don't want to see sex and dead, rotting corpses in the same scene. Everything in 'The Walking Dead' looks like its been covered in liquefied cadaver; you can almost smell the putrefaction. Regardless how hot the actresses may be, I actually prefer that they skip the no-nudity AMC PG-13 sex scenes. Just carry on with the horrifying horror, thanks.Well into season 3, I still felt nervous about the series... in a weird, geeky, proprietary way. Watching that first, two-hour pilot, I was anxious, and ready to denounce the show loudly and obnoxiously if it offended my smug sensibilities as one of the glorious few who had been a Walking Dead fan from the beginning (even though I actually hadn't... I think issue 34 was the first 'new' single issue I bought after the trades, but close enough). One of my favorite comics - although I have way too many favorites for that expression to mean much - was (and is) `The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill. If you're familiar with both the original story and the celluloid atrocity that bears the same title, you know just how flawlessly Hollywood can f*** things up. They can take one of the smartest, most exciting stories ever written, illustrated with exacting detail far superior to storyboards, and then proceed to do every wrong thing imaginable. If I made it my life's mission to create the worst film adaptation of LOEG possible, I could not have done a better job of sucking. Hence my unease. I started feeling sick as I listened to the terrible, silly exchange between Rick and Shane, just before the pivotal shootout. 'This is gonna suck', I thought. As Rick woke from his coma, left to rot in a hospital full of zombies, I was pissed off by his beard, which was definitely NOT the wild three or four days growth he should have had; instead, it was neatly trimmed to follow his jawline, his throat freshly shaved. Zombie barber? Was it nibbled away? Do zombies nibble? By the end, however, I was almost moved to tears as Rick followed the ravaged, near-skeletal remains of 'Bicycle Girl', as she dragged her legless half-body away from the road. 'I'm sorry this happened to you,' he said, in a choked, emotionally-weighted whisper, placing the barrel against her skull.Season 1 was far more popular than anyone dreamed it might be. While it wasn't perfect, I was one of the comicbook fans who gave it the imperial thumbs up and pretended the rest of the world should give a f***. Then HBO partially redeemed themselves for passing on The Walking Dead with Game of Thrones, which stole some of TWD's thunder. It also gave me a chance to handle the crappy end of the stick as a GRRM noob; I remedied that embarrassing fact by blasting through ASOIAF and everything else he wrote, buying a T-shirt, getting a cool GoT tattoo, and pretending I'd been down since '95. Meanwhile, news was ominous on the season 2 of TWD front. The power struggle between Frank Darabont and Robert Kirkman sucked on every level. Darabont was a great director, and his involvement as executive producer was a big deal; he certainly played a major role in the show's success. 'The Mist' is one of the best horror movies of the past decade, and watching it, you'll recognize a lot of actors who would go on to be cast in TWD, no doubt on Darabont's recommendations. But TWD is Kirkman's creation, and if Darabont was trying to wrest control from the creator's hands, I've got little sympathy. That kind of thing has happened too many times in the comic industry to count. Siegel and Shuster may have created 'Superman', but 15 years later DC wouldn't even let them do an issue for chump change. So the two parted ways, Kirkman firmly in control.Season 2 suffered because of it. After an excellent premiere, the series seemed to be moving underwater at times. Some of the behind the scenes footage for production on season 2 captures the cast treating Kirkman like a f***ing leper... it's clear that some were backing Darabont, and the rest weren't backing anyone, just letting things play out. While the series has always deviated at important junctures from the comic, it's interesting that all the characters portrayed by actors from Darabont's film 'The Mist' were conveniently killed off or exiled by the mid-point of Season 4. Herschel replaced Dale -- whose death was bumped way up in the rotation; Andrea was killed -- a huge shock for the comic fans; and Carol was exiled. All the Darabont faithful have been weeded out. Maybe Lori was on the wrong side. I was very happy to see her killed off, but it was a strange, anti-climactic death that seemed influenced by behind the scenes variables more than compelling narrative choices. But man, I was happy to see her go. I didn't just hate her, I hated anyone she shared the screen with. Every time she opened her mouth, I prayed for zombies. I don't care if she's hiding her pregnancy from Rick... just STFU and die, already...Season 3 saw the show turn a corner, in terms of quality, popularity, and creative direction. The prison, the war with Woodbury, the appearance of Tyreese (Hey, it's Cutty from the Wire! Awesome casting), and of course, Michonne -- everything was moving with Swiss tolerances, cogs pushing cogs, and the mechanism of story-telling smoothly working without obvious strains or conflicts. About three episodes from the finale, I realized that I cared more about the show than I did the comic. That was a hard thing to admit, but it was clear that the series hit me harder than the comics had since issue 48 or so... although issue 100 is a hard one to forget, especially as a Glenn fan.Monsters have always been stand-ins for deeply-rooted anxieties afflicting various social demographics. The thinly-veiled sexual aspects of blood-drinking vampires, could also be interpreted as a metaphor for class inequality -- Dracula as the rich, decadent aristocrat, feeding on the 'vitality' of the English working class; the aristocracy did feed on the lower classes, living on the time, energy and skills of the plebs while they enjoyed luxury and idle pursuits. Labor = time/energy = life = blood. The immortality of the vampire may have spoke to the rigid permanence of class. The aristocracy was always on top, generation after generation. The plebs had no hope that a better life might await their children. Immortality stems from procreation, and for the blue-bloods, aristocratic privilege was eternal.Werewolves, in their Victorian incarnation, spoke clearly to the fears of the English Bourgeoisie. In a society where all traces of base animal instinct were denied or alleged to not exist, and any hint of crude desire could become a minor scandal, or even threaten to destroy a person's life. The idea of being the werewolf, completely losing control of one's animal instincts, was more frightening than the creature itself. Zombies can represent the fears of the young, born into a self-destructive civilization, where the choices of previous generations threaten to destroy the not-so distant future. The way that humanity sacrifices its young in times of war could be compared to cannibalism. They can also represent a consumer culture in which buying - or feeding - is more important than producing. Whatever.The most important thing about The Walking Dead is the story-telling, and how f***ing good the show has become. Season 4 was like an entire season of 4-and-5 star horror films. Every episode felt like an event, and the tension kept building. After the mid-season apocalypse-within-an-apocalypse, the comics and the show had converged in the same sublime manner they had in the beginning; things were changed, things stayed the same. Comic fans could smile as both small episodes and notorious moments suddenly emerged in unexpected ways, and they could be just as horrified when the Governor held the samurai sword. Even though I had guessed that Tyreese would escape the chopping block, and who would take his place, it still played out with a familiar, tragic intensity. When you compare season 1 or 2 to season 4, they don't even come close. The writers, directors and cast are getting better with every episode, becoming more confident, unafraid to push it into new territory. I still felt anxious watching season 4, but it had nothing to do with fears that the series wouldn't live up to the comic (if anything, it's now the other way around). I felt the same anxiety I did watching Breaking Bad, The Wire, Rome, and Game of Thrones, a nervousness that comes from the very best storytelling, when you're so emotionally invested in the characters and the plot, the danger feels almost real. The Walking Dead is no longer one of the best shows airing on basic cable, or one of the best horror series on television; it's one of the best TV shows ever, period.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XDY33OUVYHMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NI1VFYI#wasThisHelpful","R1XDY33OUVYHMP","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's no doubt been said by many a dewy-eyed fanboy (or fangirl) -- the sort who gets future-nostalgic for an apocalypse less likely than Ragnarok or Rapture -- but I'll join the zombie-chorus anyway: 'The Walking Dead' is one of the best things on television; man, I love this show. I remember when I first picked up the trade paperback of volume 1; I was amazed at how good it was, but still skeptical. It was Image comics, after all, and those who only know Image since Robert Kirkman became supreme overlord probably have no idea that Image used to suck with an absolute purity that makes diamonds look like horse-s*** (those who have no clue WTF I'm babbling about can pretend the last couple sentences were in ancient Etruscan). It won me over after I mowed through the available material -- I think volume 5 was out at the time. One of the critical remarks that stood out then said something to the effect of ""'The Walking Dead' would make an incredible HBO series""; it may seem obvious now, but not long ago, that was a very unlikely prospect. Since one of my top 5 favorite shows had wrapped up around that time -- HBO's `Rome' -- I thought that sounded like the best idea I'd ever heard. As it turned out, HBO didn't agree. When I heard AMC had greenlit a six-episode run, I was excited, then uncertain, and then pessimistic. `No swearing, no sex, the violence will be toned down, the fact they only committed to 6 episodes means they're not really behind it'. All of those things were true -- except the violence -- but in the end, none of it mattered. Like Breaking Bad, they managed realistic dialogue without using 'f**k' or 's**t', which was quite impressive. Like the comics, there was virtually no sex... and was much better because of it. I don't want to see sex and dead, rotting corpses in the same scene. Everything in 'The Walking Dead' looks like its been covered in liquefied cadaver; you can almost smell the putrefaction. Regardless how hot the actresses may be, I actually prefer that they skip the no-nudity AMC PG-13 sex scenes. Just carry on with the horrifying horror, thanks.Well into season 3, I still felt nervous about the series... in a weird, geeky, proprietary way. Watching that first, two-hour pilot, I was anxious, and ready to denounce the show loudly and obnoxiously if it offended my smug sensibilities as one of the glorious few who had been a Walking Dead fan from the beginning (even though I actually hadn't... I think issue 34 was the first 'new' single issue I bought after the trades, but close enough). One of my favorite comics - although I have way too many favorites for that expression to mean much - was (and is) `The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill. If you're familiar with both the original story and the celluloid atrocity that bears the same title, you know just how flawlessly Hollywood can f*** things up. They can take one of the smartest, most exciting stories ever written, illustrated with exacting detail far superior to storyboards, and then proceed to do every wrong thing imaginable. If I made it my life's mission to create the worst film adaptation of LOEG possible, I could not have done a better job of sucking. Hence my unease. I started feeling sick as I listened to the terrible, silly exchange between Rick and Shane, just before the pivotal shootout. 'This is gonna suck', I thought. As Rick woke from his coma, left to rot in a hospital full of zombies, I was pissed off by his beard, which was definitely NOT the wild three or four days growth he should have had; instead, it was neatly trimmed to follow his jawline, his throat freshly shaved. Zombie barber? Was it nibbled away? Do zombies nibble? By the end, however, I was almost moved to tears as Rick followed the ravaged, near-skeletal remains of 'Bicycle Girl', as she dragged her legless half-body away from the road. 'I'm sorry this happened to you,' he said, in a choked, emotionally-weighted whisper, placing the barrel against her skull.Season 1 was far more popular than anyone dreamed it might be. While it wasn't perfect, I was one of the comicbook fans who gave it the imperial thumbs up and pretended the rest of the world should give a f***. Then HBO partially redeemed themselves for passing on The Walking Dead with Game of Thrones, which stole some of TWD's thunder. It also gave me a chance to handle the crappy end of the stick as a GRRM noob; I remedied that embarrassing fact by blasting through ASOIAF and everything else he wrote, buying a T-shirt, getting a cool GoT tattoo, and pretending I'd been down since '95. Meanwhile, news was ominous on the season 2 of TWD front. The power struggle between Frank Darabont and Robert Kirkman sucked on every level. Darabont was a great director, and his involvement as executive producer was a big deal; he certainly played a major role in the show's success. 'The Mist' is one of the best horror movies of the past decade, and watching it, you'll recognize a lot of actors who would go on to be cast in TWD, no doubt on Darabont's recommendations.

"[REC] was one of the most important films in establishing the 'Found Footage' premise as a popular sub-genre in horror. The raw, unpolished camera work included long, continuous shots that convincingly emulated news and documentary video. The mind recognizes it as 'real' on a subconscious level, giving it a profound emotional impact, and CGI effects never look more stunning than they do in 'FF'. Despite the temptation to use the premise whenever a film-maker is working on a low budget, higher price found footage projects like 'Cloverfield' -- another classic -- have proven just how instinctively terrifying the combination of shaky, hand-held camera-work and realistic CGI can be. The finale of [REC] -- as the female journalist stumbles through the darkness, the cameraman using night-vision to direct her through the top-floor apartment, as a grotesquely distorted creature is hidden somewhere in the cramped space with them -- is amongst the most terrifying ever scenes ever made.The decision to abandon the confines of 'Found Footage' for the latest instalment -- [REC]4 -- is just as baffling as the decision to do a standard, formulaic sequel to 'The Blair Witch Project'. TBWP, Cloverfield, Paranormal Activity, and [REC], represent the four corners of the FF foundation; abandoning the format it pioneered might be a reaction to the current market over-saturation, but it was an ill-advised maneuver.Just as vampires and werewolves were dark reflections of the culture that produced them, and have been altered and updated repeatedly to better suit the times, the zombie has seen similar changes. The British zombie is the most scientifically viable species; it is the product of a viral epidemic -- like almost every post-Romero zombie; the virus can be government produced, extra-terrestrial, or supernatural -- turning the 'vector' into a rabid, ravenous monster. but a living, breathing monster. '28 Days Later' and the Garth Ennis' graphic novel 'Crossed' are excellent examples. The Spanish zombies in [REC] are the result of a 'demonic virus', combining 'The Exorcist' and 'The Walking Dead' for an unlikely, but undeniably creepy result. This time around, the intrepid journalist from the original film is back, rescued from the quarantined apartment building, and transferred to a naval vessel. Like 'The Last Ship', research is being conducted on board, as scientists race to develop a vaccine or treatment that will keep the 'disease' from spreading. Obviously, things go awry.[REC]4 has exciting moments, but without the documentary feel that made the first two films so compelling, it's unable to establish itself in any significant way. 'Found Footage' has lost much of its power to suspend the viewer's disbelief, thanks to repetition. But recent films like 'As Above, So Below' have proven that it still has possibilities. While I wouldn't want to suggest that a franchise should keep repeating itself, I think the writer and director should be careful to define the essence of a given film's appeal, and work within those parameters. 'Paranormal Activity 3' stayed true to the aspects of the original that made it so popular, ejecting all the things that the second film did wrong, and expanding on the 'PA' floor-plan to make a better, far more frightening film. It's easier to point at another film, of course, and say 'they should have done that', than to actually apply those seemingly obvious variables. I don't know if there will be another [REC], but if 'Paranormal Activity' could peak with its third film, there's no reason [REC] couldn't peak with its fifth.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM13EQY69BMN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R7FQRYE#wasThisHelpful","RM13EQY69BMN0","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This mega-fable by Haruki Murakami, while occasionally oblique, is a long, clear-voiced, and languidly paced story about conformity, and the ramifications of breaking free of the familial and social expectations that are placed upon us. There are legal, ethical and social expectations we are all subject to 'a priori' -- as both humans and citizens -- and there are the expectations custom-tailored for us by parents, siblings, friends and lovers -- as individuals. It imagines the 'multiverse' as something like an endless apartment complex made up of locked, sound-proofed and windowless suites. Every one of these earth-sized/universe-sized apartments have hidden passages linking them to an adjoining, otherwise hermetically-sealed unit, and rare individuals, prompted by extraordinary circumstances, can see and use these passages, stepping into a unit built just for them... perhaps by them.The story follows two main characters, with connections to one another that are only apparent well into the narrative. But they are each the center of their own personal solar system; the moons and planets and satellites in each respective orbit are often eccentric, and as celestial bodies orbiting different stars collide, the tale moves into the strange gravitational stability of a binary star... a cruel galactic romance that sloughs off all orbital relationships and responsibilities. Similarly, they both encounter a second moon that no one seems to notice.Both Aomame and Tengo were raised in difficult environments, albeit of very different kinds. Both characters make a choice that opens, for them alone, a door. Each of their respective doors will take them into an alternate universe, one with very slight narrative differences. Aomame labels this world '1Q84', as opposed to '1984', the world she came from -- the Orwellian connotations give further evidence of the 'individual vs, society' theme Murakami explores. At several points Orwell's novel is mentioned; instead of 'Big Brother', rewriting history and confusing the present, there are the 'little people'... instead of Big, little; instead of singular, plural; instead of a huge totalitarian machine that destroys and rewrites the past, tiny, mysterious people who remove certain individuals from their reality, to remake them in another.After getting caught in a traffic jam, a simfonietta by Janacek heralds Aomame's fateful decision, with a mysterious taxi-driver as harbinger. Rather than missing her very important 'appointment', she uses an emergency stair pointed out by the cabbie, which takes her off the elevated expressway, and down to a city street below. Not long after, she gets her first clue that things aren't quite right, when she notices a police officer carrying a semi-automatic pistol instead of a revolver. Later, she learns that this change happened years previous, following a gun-battle between police and a group of political and religious radicals, an event she has no memory of.For Tengo, a 'cram-school' math teacher and writer, his life suddenly leaves its well-established course when his associate and mentor Komatsu suggests a strange and risky idea. A teenaged girl named Fuka-Eri has submitted a story titled 'Air Chrysalis' for a high-profile new writer's competition. Tengo is impressed with the story, but both men agree that it can't win as it is, due to its rough, amateurish prose. Tengo finds his door, so to speak, when Komatsu suggests he rewrite Fuka-Eri's manuscript. Their plan is to combine Tengo's technical gifts as a writer with Fuka-Eri's imagination and raw talent as a story-teller, keeping his involvement a secret. Tengo is concerned about Komatsu's scheme, but feel's compelled to work on the manuscript. Fuka-Eri is one of the most important and enigmatic characters in Murakami's novel. When Tengo meets her he is struck by her beauty as well as her unusual personality. She speaks with a complete lack of emotion, and answers questions only when it suits her. He also learns that she is dyslexic, and it was actually her little 'sister' -- the daughter of Fuka-Eri's guardian Professor Ebisuno -- who recorded the tale as Fuka-Eri dictated. After meeting the Professor, and learning more of the mysterious girl's life -- Tengo steps through the door, and commits to revising 'Air Chrysalis', which turns out to be less fictional than anyone could believe such a fantastical tale to be. Secondary characters, like the Dowager, who conspires with Aomame to dispense vigilante justice, are just as intriguing, and new characters emerge as the story progresses, including a surprising figure from Fuka-Eri's past, and a repulsive private investigator.The many characters and storylines of 1Q84 converge, coalesce, and sometimes diverge again. The complexity of the tale is never confusing, and Murakami's writing style has been translated with impressive clarity. The prose has an earnest concision that can say many things at once, or one thing with absolute precision. It's quite a feat, really; I have no idea to what extent the translators deserve credit for 1Q84's brilliance as an English-language novel -- echoing Tengo's dilemma as he rewrote 'Air Chrysalis' -- but I do not doubt that Murakami has created a powerful, profound work of fiction. I haven't read any of Murakami's previous works, but there was something about this story that reminded me of Roberto Bolano's '2666' -- both the meandering, almost haphazard feel of the plot from the outset, slowly tightening midway through, and the language; again, I will always find translations frustrating, on some level, especially with novels like 1Q84 and 2666. They're both purposely ambiguous; I worry that the translator might be twisting and confusing the original intent for the sake of style, or misrepresenting stylistic power in their concern for retaining presumed intellectual intent. If you could quantify it, would 1Q84 be 99% Murakami? 85%? 50%? In the end, you have to take the story as you find it, and trust the translator -- a thankless job, really; translators are seen as technicians instead of artists, despite the aesthetic sensibilities required -- rather than second-guessing a strange word choice, or trying to dig much deeper. But I liked it. As I said, I think the translation is excellent, stylistically. Translating Japanese to English is a far more difficult task than translating Spanish to English. The way 1Q84 was released, in separate parts, echoes way 2666 was released, and the two books have many thematic and stylistic similarities... I'm curious whether Murakami intended it, or if I'm imagining things.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL9X16MYV58RK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307476464#wasThisHelpful","RL9X16MYV58RK","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Skip the Prozac, Vodka and Heroin, or quadruple-up on artificial joy! God it feels good to use exclamation marks! Yeah! Bring the kids, 'cause it's a guaranteed explosion of fun and happiness for the whole family! Yeah!!An introverted young woman named Esther, suffering from the purest case possible of Munchausen-by-Proxy, fires off a chain-reaction of suffering, vengeance and violence as shocking as it is completely ridiculous. After being artificially inseminated, she convinces her angry and unstable lesbian girlfriend Anika to 'surprise' her in an alley outside the obstetrician's office, knocking her unconscious and using a brick to brutally terminate the fetus after several months of pregnancy.Her extreme ploy for sympathy and human contact leads her to a support group for those who have lost loved ones. A kind and outgoing woman named Melanie reaches out, and Frau Munchausen quickly becomes obsessed with her. A drunk driver killed her husband and son, or so she says... When Esther sees Melanie in the park with her supposedly dead child, very much alive and well, she assumes that her lies at the support group meetings are expressions of an unfulfilled wish, and that Melanie is exactly like her. She finds her way to the family's home, and drowns the toddler in the bathtub. Esther is surprised when Melanie is emotionally devastated by the discovery of her dead son, and tries to explain instead of moving on to kill the husband. He returns with a shotgun (inexplicably), and kills Esther.The focus then shifts to Melanie, by necessity, and to the husband, Patrick, who takes a surprising left turn to insanity and overwhelming creepiness. He suspects that there was some kind of connection between Esther and Melanie, but she admits nothing. Anika, meanwhile, is determined to avenge her lover's death, and another violent collision is inevitable.Written and directed by Zach Parker, this film is unrelentingly grim and fairly brutal. The plot becomes less and less believable, but crazier stories than this end up as headlines on a regular basis. I don't know what to say about 'Proxy'; watching the misery unfold doesn't make me feel better about anything, which makes me wonder what it is that support group fakers like Melanie get from wallowing in the unfiltered suffering of others. I will admit, however, that most of my favorite works of art, literature and film are reliably dark and brutal; 'Blood Meridian' and 'The Road' are damn near nihilistic, and yet they're at the top of the list. There's just something lacking in 'Proxy'. Nothing redeems it. It reminds me, in some ineffable way, of a far less imaginative 'Irreversible', by Gaspar Noe; that film gave the viewer an entirely uncompromising tour of hell, but by tracking the horrific events backwards in time, they took on a strangely poignant significance. There is no alchemical process at work in 'Proxy', turning lead into gold. Base materials remain base. If you decide to watch it, have fun and hide the razor-blades.Damn it! Spoilers, SPOILERS! I forgot to add a spoiler alert. Well, there's nothing I can do about it now, it's carved in stone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EF2MHTPHPOEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KD64LVU#wasThisHelpful","R3EF2MHTPHPOEQ","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Arnold Bocklin is one of the most exciting painters out there, a name I constantly punch into crappy used book-seller search engines and hope for a miracle... but he's dead. So there's very little he can do to promote himself, and restart his century-and-a-half old career. As one of the key figures in the loosely defined movement known as 'Symbolism', his work deserves to be exhibited, collected and published, yet he remains largely overlooked. Far less important, far less talented painters are being 're-discovered' on a fairly regular basis, but some of the real giants of 'symbolism', like Gustave Moreau, Fernand Khnopff, and Arnold Bocklin have no significant monographs available.Prestel released a huge retrospective/catalogue raisonne on Bocklin in the seventies, but it sells for a few hundred dollars. The exhibition catalog that accompanied a 2001 show in France based on works inspired by Bocklin's famous work 'The Isle of the Dead' now goes for over 1000$. The book itself is a beautifully produced volume, published by Somogy, and is a testament to the profound inspiration Bocklin has had on artists like Max Klinger, Giorgio De Chirico, Fabricio Clerici, Ernst Fuchs and H.R. Giger. They all counted Bocklin as a primary influence, and each produced a homage to 'The Isle of the Dead', evidence enough that his art merits a new retrospective.This particular volume was released by Rizzoli, who are among my favorite art-book publishers. It dates back to the seventies, however, and is peculiar compared to their current output. Just 8"" square and under 100 pages, many of the paintings reproduced are black and white, and most do not depict the entire composition, opting instead for details. The text is limited to quotes by the artist, printed without any particular context save for the art itself. The quality of the color photographs aren't bad, but they're definitely not up to digital standards, and the entire book feels abbreviated in every sense; it's a frustrating and usually over-priced little book, for what you're getting. Even enthusiastic aficionados of Arnold Bocklin, like myself, will probably be disappointed.As another option, the English version of 'Myths and Mysteries: Swiss Artists and Symbolism', published by Somogy, prominently features Bocklin's art, as well as dozens of others. It's an excellent book, large format and comprehensive, with a rich selection of critical essays.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKF8PTL4H40ZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=3765416304#wasThisHelpful","RKF8PTL4H40ZF","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The dialogue is terrible, the ideas are all recycled Kirkman and Romero storylines, and the actors all seem embarrassed by the lame attempts at humor. The bad comedy and predictability are 'Z Nation's only distinguishing characteristics, but I still kind of liked this show. There were entire scenes I skipped, but still... if you're of that same rarefied breed who can watch 'Outpost', 'Dead Snow', and 'War of the Dead' -- without making judgements about originality (or even basic crappiness) -- enjoy.P.S.: Criticisms about SyFy's obvious attempts to cash in on The Walking Dead, and/or the 'zombie apocalypse', are a little confusing. Isn't this the network responsible for 'Sharknado'? If they can't cash in on crass pop-culture trends, who the f*** can? I'm sure they were spammed with several million pitches for a zombie series thirty minutes after The Walking Dead pilot aired. 'Z Nation' was the idea that triumphed over thousands of others, the end result of fierce creative competition that quickly separated the best and the brightest from the pretenders and opportunists. That is unquestionably the scariest thing about this show.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T7XKER467454/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N7998KY#wasThisHelpful","R1T7XKER467454","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't recall ever being so utterly baffled about where exactly a horror film was going. I'm sure there's a few people who will claim they knew what was up. I'm usually one of those people. But every once in a while I find a new blindspot. 'The Cabin in the Woods' surprised me at every turn, even though I was given plenty of clues -- as well as straight-up exposition from the 'office staff' -- before the chaotic finale, when the last piece of the puzzle was fit into place. 'Honeymoon' doesn't give you any warnings before the sudden jerk on the steering wheel that sends the story careening off the road. There are plenty of signs that things are very wrong, and the tension builds quite steadily until the final scene... but I was imagining something far less 'exotic'. The director deserves credit for her restraint, teasing out the suspense until it's almost unbearable.Toward the climax, I was cautiously sympathetic for the increasingly unhinged husband, backing him up as he was begging his wife to make sense of the increasingly surreal data:  ""You have to explain this to me, Bea; You have to tell me, what's going on? What's going on, Bea, TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?!"" I was almost as mystified, but I got a bit embarrassed about my support for Paul after he tied her up in a very un-fun way; but my imagination was over-clocking about scenarios including murderers, rapists, multiple personalities, amnesia, and a Norman Bates-like substitution to replace the original Bea. This is a spoiler-free review, so I'll clarify: one of the theories above may be right, or partly right, or completely off-world.After a sickeningly sweet beginning, the happy honeymoon goes really, really wrong; this particular cabin in the woods has no cellar full of evil objects, but when husband Paul awakens in the night to discover Bea is gone, and finds her in the forest, naked and disoriented, it's clear things won't end well. She has trouble remembering even the most basic things, from how to make French toast to the details of their first date. Then there's the not-so-strange bruising on her inner thighs, which is just the most obvious of several indications pointing to rape. His suspicions immediately fall on Bea's childhood boyfriend, which seems fair, considering he's the only other male and one of just four actors in this film. But Bea is maddeningly reluctant to explain anything... and I won't say any more, either, except that it's not that simple.The acting is excellent, and both leads are convincingly non-British... although, on a continent full of truly non-British people, why import Brits to pretend they're not Brits? Are British actors that much more awesome than American and Canadian actors? That's rhetorical, of course, since we all know they are. Rose Leslie has been in two of the most critically acclaimed series of all time -- Game of Thrones and Downton Abbey. Harry Treadaway stars in Penny Dreadful, which sounds far less impressive, but is actually another one of the best shows on television, even if not as many people realize it. Despite the reference to 'The Cabin in the Woods', and despite the fact that this film takes place in an actual Cabin in the Woods, the two have little else in common (except their previously mentioned unpredictability). 'Honeymoon' director and co-writer Leigh Janiak has made a fine debut film, especially with a four-person cast, and a budget not much higher than that of an off-Broadway play. I had to skip some of the excruciatingly sappy dialogue in the beginning, which was the most horrifying aspect of the film for me; but it does serve a narrative function, since they ARE honeymooners-in-love, and the passion the couple feel for one another makes the disturbing events that follow all the more strange, sad and sickening.

"I was able to find one of the incredibly popular Zero Tolerance 0562CF Hinderer Slicers a month or two back. Ever since the carbon fiber version of the 0562, which also has a beautiful, two-tone Bohler M390 blade, won the Blade Show 2014 Award for 'Best American-Made Knife of the Year', anticipation and demand have been very high. It's been selling out everywhere it turns up over-night, and the regular 0562 isn't much easier to find. This is the heavy-use edition, compared to the 0562CF. The G-10 is a tiny bit heavier - about 0.1 oz - than the carbon fiber, but it doesn't get scuffed up the same way. I prefer ZT's smoother, textured G-10 over the type Spyderco favors, which is like an emory-board. And the stone-washed blade hides scratches nicely, unless they're very long or deep.Elmax isn't as sought after as M390, but both are super-premium steels. I prefer Elmax to many of the Crucible steels, now that the heat treatment complaints that surfaced a couple years have been resolved. Similar accusations pop up all the time in the knife forums -- Chris Reeve, his CPM S35VN heat treats, and the Sebenza even took some flack. But Elmax is very close to it's big brother M390; both are extremely high carbon -- compared to a non-stainless high-carbon like 1095, which has 0.95%, Elmax has 1.80% and M390 has 2.00%; both are very high-chromium and corrosion resistant; Elmax has 18%, and M390 has 20%. Most stainless steels have between 13 and 15% chromium. The only reason I was determined to find the 0562CF, instead of the 0562, was because I already owned the 0561, which has G-10 and Elmax. The M390 and carbon fiber made it different enough to justify the purchase.Everything else is identical. This is a crazy smooth knife, thanks to the KVT ball bearing pivot system, with a perfect detent. It fires out like a rocket -- the best Hinderer flipper ever made, much better than the Hinderer XM-18 and XM-24 midtechs and customs, which still run on washers instead of bearings. They may cost two or three times as much, but they're no better than the ZT 0562/0562CF series (or the equally impressive, slightly larger ZT 0560 and 0561). The titanium is beautifully stonewashed, and the frame-lock has a lock-bar insert to prevent galling, as well as a 'lock-bar stabilizer'. The XM customs and midtechs are great knives, the real deal, even if they require a bit of wrist snap to flip open. But if you don't want to spend 600$, the ZT 0562 and 0562CF are two of the best folders on the market.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W0FO6W1PZGFN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ILFL758#wasThisHelpful","R3W0FO6W1PZGFN","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'The Burrowers' is a narrative collision of Larry McMurtry's uncompromising, entertaining tales of the American Frontier, and the inventive, troglodytic monstrosities of Neil Marshall's film, 'The Descent'. This is high-caliber historical horror, a sub-genre with very few notable examples; but Dan Simmons has mastered the material in literary form with novels like 'The Terror' and 'Drood'. This relatively unknown 2008 release written and directed by J.T. Petty is one of the most original, exciting, and terrifying horror films of the last few years, despite being largely ignored.'The Burrowers' takes place in the Dakota Territory in 1879. When a caravan of Irish Immigrants is attacked and the survivors are believed taken by Native Americans, a search party sets out after them. Clancy Brown and William Mapother play hardened Indian fighters, and David Busse plays the young Irishman with personal reasons for finding the missing settlers.They soon learn that the killers they're tracking aren't Native American, and in fact, aren't even human. Nightmarish creatures the Ute call 'Burrowers' once fed on the great herds of Buffalo that traversed the plains. Now that the Buffalo have been wiped out by white hunters, they have adapted to feed on the ever-increasing numbers of European settlers moving westward. Petty has envisioned horrific creatures that are fast and silent and rarely seen, nocturnal 'burrowers' who move under the cover of the grass and hunt in packs. They immobilize their prey with a toxin and bury them alive, allowing the poison to partially liquefy tissues without killing them. When they can finally eat their half-digested meal, the person is paralyzed but conscious, aware of every hellish, excruciating moment.The brutality of the film is both shocking and historically appropriate, and the plot moves with a harsh, natural momentum that is very unpredictable. The characters have all the inconsistencies and contradictions of the real world, and the absolute hopelessness and mercilessness that afflicts the plains is as much a creation of man as it is these terrifying monstrosities. I think the bleak authenticity of the film turned off some viewers, as much as the violence. It's not perfect, by any means, but the iMDB rating of 5.8/10 is far too low, making 'The Burrowers' one of the most underappreciated horror films of the decade.

"[One particular bababook, anyway...]This clever little Australian film never threatens to fall into the pit of mediocrity where all Hollywood formula-horror rots away, deftly catching itself after every minor misstep. The powerful visuals of the titular bababook, by Alex Juhasz, are recreated convincingly -- but sparingly, evidence of directorial maturity and restraint -- with CGI. The design and macabre tone of the story within the story feels remarkably familiar, like you've read it before; 'The Babadook' is equal parts Edward Gorey, Dr. Seuss, Tim Burton and Neil Gaiman, with a bit of Maurice Sendak. I was almost certain I'd confronted the book myself, albeit with less traumatic results.Writer-director Jennifer Kent leaves the Babadook where it's power is always in the ascendant: the shadows. Top hats and black raven wing-tips hint at horrors within horrors, and the nightmares she unveils just point you toward something so much worse. At its core, this is an allegorical tale about loss, guilt, blame, and suffering. It's about the nasty thoughts that fester and swell in the cellar of the mind, the thoughts that can become dangerous if we let them.The two actors who made this film work so well were Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman. Wiseman, a boy of 8 or so, is incredible. Kent knew what she was getting herself into with this film, giving 40 minutes of screen-time to an 8-year-old. She obviously had faith in her own ability to work with kids, and to find the right boy for the job. I don't think it's a 'Sixth Sense'-level performance, but it's pretty impressive. Davis deserves even higher praise, putting her heart and soul into a small production that might have languished in obscurity. She's a very talented actress... and if this were an American film, she wouldn't have been given an audition. It would have been Kiera Knightley, or Jessica Chastain, both great actresses, but... it wouldn't have been the same.. Again, great story and performances, highly recommended.P.S.: 'If it's in a word/Or it's in a look/You can't get rid/Of the Babadook' -- in a slightly amazing convergence of creepy Australian death-book films and sub-par computing technology, after posting this review, I moved on to the many wondrous online-carnivals-of-the-mind that sparkle like diamonds in the cyber-desert. I noticed through my Quaalude-fog that a few bits and bytes were ghosting through on every page, and I kid you not, it was just two words: 'the Babadook'. It wasn't just bleeding through my internet browser, it was on my desktop. And no matter what I tried, I couldn't 'get rid of the Babadook'. Scary. Or at least annoying, since a restart worked. I wish I wasn't an atheist... then I could have taken it as proof of life beyond... well, something vaguely spiritual, I guess; instead, it's just a sign that my glitchy laptop is getting glitchier. Damn that Babadook. And darn his evil, gangly dog-minion, the Marmadook.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VW1ZBPJT3ROY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P596I8Y#wasThisHelpful","R1VW1ZBPJT3ROY","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With his most recent project, an art installation for Mass MoCA titled 'Filthy Lucre', Waterston takes his artistic genius in new directions, creating a dark psychic mirror of the infamous Peacock Room created by James McNeill Whistler. A very close approximation of the original, this Peacock Room imagines the context that's missing from the Leyland project as a corrosive radiation. The bitterness and anger that Whistler made so public, enraged that Leyland wouldn't pay any more than half the sum he demanded after completing the Peacock Room without getting the owners assent, has ravaged the decadent Victorian beauty.Waterston's gifts have never been clearer than they are in this excellent monograph, published by Charta. His work prior to 'Representing the Invisible', collected in his self-titled monograph from St. Ann's press, shows the artist at the edge of a breakthrough. Still relying on figurative elements, the nascent strains of pure abstraction are not embraced with the same confidence he demonstrates. It may represent a stage of transition, but the results are beautiful, nonetheless.'Representing the Invisible' is Waterston after the revelation. Although it's typically listed as a softcover, the edition I own is a hardcover. At around 140 or 150 pages, it's not impressive in terms of dimensions or page-count, but it uses thick, high-quality paper-stock, is sturdily bound and well-designed. Out of 350+ monographs, however, it's one of my favorites, one I come back to time and again. Waterston's excitement and inspiration is evident on every mysterious canvas; revelatory images of things we've never seen, could never name; 11 dimensional reality, translated in 4, represented in 2.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DQUFDRV98SGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=888158624X#wasThisHelpful","R3DQUFDRV98SGH","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Peacock Room was a decorative art project that a very wealthy patron named Leyland commissioned James McNeill Whistler to create while the owner was going to be away for a few months. Meant to serve as a place to house his collection of Chinese porcelain and paintings by Whistler himself, Leyland was surprised to learn that the modest assignment he had envisioned, a few days work at best, had suddenly become a massive reworking of the entire room. Expensive leather wall-coverings and mahogany shelves had been painted over in blue, with gilt illustrative flourishes everywhere. Whistler then proceeded to give Leyland a very large bill, far more than had been agreed upon, for unsolicited work. Leyland was not happy about the liberties the artist had taken, but agreed to pay half.What followed was a bitter campaign of slurs and insults, most of them originating from Whistler. He had been in financial trouble, and obviously saw 'The Peacock Room' as a way to alleviate those troubles. The room is still a popular exhibit today, and is every bit as beautiful, lavish and decadent as it was a century ago. If you didn't know the ugliness that surrounded its creation, the room itself certainly offers no clues.Darren Waterston decided to create the Peacock Room's dark, psychic twin -- an experiment in homage, fused with an interpretation of historical and psychological context. He reimagines it as a place where all the anger, jealously and bitterness manifests as a corrosive radiation, eating away at the decadent beauty of the work. Leyland's porcelain lies in pieces, and the shelves are broken and twisted, wounds afflict the painted and gilded surfaces like leprosy. The title, 'Filthy Lucre', is taken from one of Whistler's vitriolic screeds.This exhibition catalog (also entitled 'Filthy Lucre'), published by frequent collaborators Skira and Rizzoli, is 9.75"" x 11.75"" and 130 pages long. Using a thick, glossy stock, sturdily bound, and attractively designed and laid out, this is a handsome hardcover, and one worthy of Waterston's vision. I've followed his career as a painter for the last few years, and his brilliantly executed abstract compositions are incredibly unique. Only Ali Banisadr produces a similar blend of abstraction and vague figuration that possesses his level of intelligence and technical skill. For a more comprehensive examination of Waterston's art, I recommend the hardcover monograph released by Charta a few years ago, 'Darren Waterston: Representing the Invisible'; it collects many of his most beautiful and moving works, large-scale oils that suggest the birth of the universe, hydrogen nebulas, the spaces between atoms, a sunset glimpsed through the waning storms of sulfuric acid on Venus. For fans of Waterston and Whistler, this is absolutely fascinating work. Art that ties itself contextually to the history, style, subject matter, and methods of the past is always what draws me in, and this is a prime example.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SF4HPO4BMM2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0847844137#wasThisHelpful","R3SF4HPO4BMM2D","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has worked for hundreds of film-makers! The Latest Hits: Sinister! Insidious! Annabelle! The Possession! Ouija! Finders Keepers! The Classics: Poltergeist! Child's Play! The Ring!You will need:- 1 troubled and/or recently separated couple with at least 1 son/daughter between 5 and 8 years old.- A move into a new house. The parent should say something to the effect of: ""Things are going to be better here, I promise. Just give it a chance okay?""- At least 3 violently murdered prior owners, which, for some reason, the new owners know nothing about.How to proceed:- 'The Imaginary Friend': A ghost/demon/Lovecraftian death-god/dead telepathic girl w/cursed videotape/Leprechaun/dybbuk box/possessed doll should immediately make friends with the child, who -- instead of being appropriately terrified, like any normal kid -- will calmly report the creepy s**t her 'imaginary friend' says to her. The course events take will depend on the supernatural threat in question.- 'We Need To Talk About Your Daughter...': Trouble at school is a must. Either the child is teased, and ends up screaming, or the child is preternaturally quiet. The teacher will calmly and earnestly express worry, and then tell a disturbing story about the child's behavior, or present drawings. The drawings are always of dead people, or predict the future, or depict a menacing figure identified as the 'imaginary friend'.- 'The Expert': Regardless what manner of threat is looming, one parent will then seek out the 'expert' (expert number 1... a second expert is often necessary): a priest, a psychic, a paranormal investigator, or a child psychiatrist; the course events take will depend on which expert is brought in. Proceed to the appropriate chapter, as determined by specific 'threat' and 'expert'. NOTE: There is an inversely proportionate relationship between the expert's level of scientific certainty and his/her likelihood of surviving to see the end credits. A scientist can only cheat death by overcoming his/her quaint, old-fashioned insistence on evidence, and embracing the superstitious yokel within.- 'The Forrest Gump': Usually this ties in to the 'Microfiche Montage', or it replaces it. Examination of photographs from various unconnected crimes scenes, etc., reveals a really old person/entity, or an object, or a symbol (in 'Sinister' the monstrous demon-thing made a pointless super-secret cameo in each of the Super-8 film-reels it left behind, detectable only by freeze-frame; as was the case in 'The Ring', where a fly from the paused videotape suddenly becomes real, the demon whose image is frozen on the makeshift projection screen turns to meet the protagonist's gaze... scary).Of Evil Dolls & Child Psychiatrists:- 'The Evil Doll': is usually inhabited by the soul of a killer; in 'Child's Play' it was a run-of-the-mill armed robber killed in a toy store; in 'Annabelle' it was a Manson family-type Satanist killed in the family home. It could also be home to a demon, or have a curse attached to it.- 'The Bad Penny': Only one parent suspects the truth (in the beginning), and should throw the doll away or destroy it; their suspicions are confirmed when the doll reappears in the child's bed, unharmed (works just as well with books, i.e. 'The Babadook'; or evil puzzle-boxes; etc.)- 'The Hand-shaped Bruise': The child psychiatrist should discover mysterious bruises, and accuse the parent(s) of abusing their child. The expert should end up dead (especially if the parent has tried to confide with them about their fears, only to have them dismissed in a condescending way), either in their office, or more typically, after arriving unannounced at the family home to further investigate.- 'The Haunted Headspace': The child will become creepier and emotionally distant.- 'The Microfiche Montage': The 'research scene' comes before the climax, sometimes followed by a 'secondary expert' (If expert number 1 had a scientific background, expert number 2 will be a 'believer'). The parent should do an internet search, if the film has a contemporary setting. It can be supplemented by a trip to the library (or a hall of records, or police case files, or psychiatric records -- which might include a suspenseful break-in or impersonation); the newspaper archives, micro-film and micro-fiche will reveal the buried secrets, and provide the details necessary to defeating the evil doll.

"[NOTE: We all loved 'The Big Lebowski'. I'm not positive, but I think this is a different movie. It's got a different title, different actors, and they seem to be saying different things. Most of them aren't as funny. Even if you can get past a disappointment like that, you still might hate this movie.]For a Thomas Pynchon fan like myself, 'Inherent Vice' was shocking. The rich intellectual payoffs, cleverly cryptic humor and subtle satire was amazingly accessible. I didn't have to wade through super-dense prose of the kind that dances around the accretion disk and balances precariously above the event horizon, stretching space-time thin as one approaches the singularity generating Gravity's Rainbow -- escape velocity is frighteningly close to the speed of light, and transitioning from the spatial coordinates of Pynchon's story relative to Earth normal is like travelling into the future, breaking free of Gravity's pull to find that 25 hours have passed between paragraphs... plotlines traverse narrative wormholes to seemingly random points in time and space. Compared to his 1974 National Book Award-winning classic, 'Inherent Vice' almost qualified as a... 'page-turner'. Like Norman Mailer's 'Tough Guys Don't Dance', Denis Johnson's 'Angels', 'Jesus Son' and 'Already Dead', and Cormac McCarthy's 'No Country For Old Men', Pynchon was testing his literary prowess against some tough hombres -- Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and Jim Thompson, the unholy trinity of crime fiction and Noir-Lit; and in particular, L.A. Noir.The adaptation of 'No Country for Old Men' was an anomaly, a rare celestial phenomenon. America's greatest living writer, Cormac McCarthy, provided a transcendent novel of Borderland-Noir that was seemingly made to be adapted by Joel and Ethan Coen, America's greatest living film-makers.'Inherent Vice' is another rare example of perfect stellar and planetary alignment. Paul Thomas Anderson created a late millennial classic with 'Boogie Nights'; but his 2007 adaptation of the Upton Sinclair novel 'There Will be Blood', was a masterpiece... in the spirit of strange coincidences, 'There Will Be Blood' lost the Best Picture Oscar to 'No Country For Old Men', and Anderson lost out to the Coen's for Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. His previous film, 'The Master' was another huge cinematic achievement, a very subtle satire and character study that examined a Scientology-like belief system, and the Hubbard-clone guru behind it all.So now, with `Inherent Vice', America's second best writer-director-auteur has adapted a work of crime-fiction by America's second best novelist. Not that numbers like that ever mean or say anything beyond the person handing them out. This film has the feel of 'The Big Sleep' if Chandler had been a hippie, a joyously, purposely convoluted tale of strange literal and philosophical bedfellows. While I read 'Inherent Vice', I had a problem that comes up very rarely, in that I was unable to cast Doc Sportello from my database. In another strange symmetry, the same rare problem came up as I read McCarthy's sparse descriptions of Anton Chigurh. Neither Joaquin Phoenix nor Javier Bardem seemed like good casting choices when I learned of them; but by the time the credits rolled, both men had become those characters forever more. Phoenix is brilliant as Sportello, resisting the urge to channel the literally undead soul of Jeff 'Lebowski' Bridges. And Llewelyn Moss himself, Josh Brolin, is the hilariously ambitious `Renaissance Cop', Bigfoot Bjornsen.`Inherent Vice' is comic Noir, played straight for the most part, but with an ingeniously serpentine, Chandleresque plot.Doc's former love, Shasta, turns up after a long silence and ask him for a favor. She wants Doc to use his DA's office connection -- his part-time girlfriend, Penny -- to make sure her new man, a rich, Jewish real-estate developer called Mickey Wolfman -- who surrounds himself with Nazi bikers -- doesn't get ripped off by his wife and HER lover. Doc reluctantly but professionally agrees. Business gets busier when an OG Crip hires him to seek out a prison pal named Glen from the Aryan Brotherhood, to collect money owed him from their joint-business in Chino. It seems like another unlikely alliance, AND it just so happens that Glen is one of the Nazi bikers working for Shasta's beau, Mickey Wolfman.First though, Doc visits the Wolfman estate, undercover, to meet the imposing Mrs. Wolfman, and her big, blond, Teutonic gigolo. Posing as a bank official trying to return money (when does that ever happen?), Mrs. Wolfman takes the bait, and hands over the `necessary documents' he requests. Doc now has a place to start on this scam investigation. Wandering through the Wolfman estate, the sexy Mexican maid shows him Mickey's tie collection, all embroidered with detailed nude likenesses of his many lovers. The maid points herself out... and helpfully points out Shasta too.When his search for this biker named Glenn leads him to a brothel, Doc gets beaver-sapped. He wakes up somewhere else, surrounded by cops, lying next to a murdered corpse - as it turns out, it's Glen, the Nazi biker he was hired to find. It looks bad, but Bigfoot is playing it cute, and kicks him loose for suspicious reasons. Bigfoot has connections no detective should have with Wolfman, even donning an afro to star in the TV spots about the latest condo development project. Another client is waiting when he gets back, a toothless but attractive twenty-something former-junkie-turned-mom, played by Jena Malone. She sends him off to find a supposedly dead Junkie jazz-man played by Owen Wilson... Doc is warned by the friendly girl from the brothel (where he was knocked out and framed for the death of Mickey Wolfman's Nazi biker pal) that the jazz junkie is connected to a cryptic threat she calls `The Golden Fang'... An ominous sobriquet for someone who may be choreographing all these unlikely confluences.That may have sounded like it contained many spoilers, but it did not; that craziness is just the beginning of Paul Thomas Anderson's latest masterpiece. The director and author recreate the disjointed atmosphere that may or may not have pervaded 1970 Los Angeles. Pynchon takes the free love philosophy and LSD paranoia to the absurdities of its logical conclusion. A Jewish landbaron makes himself a Nazi king-pin; Black Panthers plot with the Aryan Brotherhood. Cops cavort with gangsters, and beat up Hippies for a couple joints. A burnt-out hippie P.I. named Doc sleeps with an assistant D.A. named Penny. Everyone f**ks everyone, except the person they're married to.This is film perfection, of a kind that drives some people from the theater in disgust. If you ask them about it, they never admit that it was the perfection that triggered their fight or flight reflex, but it was. You might have to spend a few minutes getting to the bottom of the complex psychological factors at work, but the truth is its own reward. In my own personal experience, some unenlightened movie-goers take it as a personal insult when you explain to them that they actually liked a film they insist they hated, and that they're only lying to hide their sexual attraction to butterflies. It's crazy to think that in 2015, people still take offence when you address them as lying butterfly molesters. Caterpillars, that's a different matter entirely. Running after people who flee cinematic perfection might seem like a strange pursuit, but when its all done, if my jaw hasn't been broken by a vicious beating, it makes me smile. Anyway...This is also the best book-to-big screen adaptation I've seen since `No Country For Old Men'. Speaking of which, Josh Brolin is great as Bigfoot, capturing his sly intelligence and over-confidence. But Joaquin Phoenix once again proves he's on another level, acting the hell out of this beast. It's only January, but this will definitely be near the top of my 10 best films of 2015.P.S.: It'll be interesting to see if anyone picks up the proverbial gauntlet Anderson's thrown down. While he definitely cherry-picked the Pynchon novel best suited for film, it wasn't easy to translate some of the novel's subtlest humor and satire, but he did it, and he did it well. Maybe Tyrone Slothrop, 'sexual V-2 rocket anticipator' -- and very bad one-night-stand -- will make it to the big screen. Or maybe not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33GT7ECRRK823/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXIIZ3W#wasThisHelpful","R33GT7ECRRK823","A3DN9249F3X716","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DN9249F3X716?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This denim jacket is awesome. It has weight to it, but it's not bulky like a man's denim jacket. There always seems to be a problem in this arena - it's always too thick or too thin - but Wrangler has this in the Goldilocks zone - it's just right. I wear an XL in most items, but I cannot get this buttoned together - it runs just a wee bit small. Despite this, it looks great on. No one would know I couldn't button it unless they saw me attempting to do so. The material is both denim and stretchy - so it moves with you when you're putting on your seat belt or doing just about anything else.

"Ok - I am officially impressed by this handheld mic. It has a standard XLR input at the bottom of the mic to make it compatible with any professional equipment. The included adapter allows you easily plug the mic into your iPhone, iPad or other smart device with a 3.5mm input jack. I tested the microphone at distances of 1"", 2"", 4"", 6"" and 12"" from my mouth as I spoke on video. The quality is amazing - especially for a modestly priced unit. I had another similarly priced microphone at work that was abysmal. This mic does not have noise canceling - so if you use it out in the field, you will pick up ambient sound and noises - even conversations in the background... but the person holding the mic will be the prominent, bold sound/voice on your recording.  This is not a directional shotgun mic, so you will definitely need a fairly quiet environment if you want to conduct an interview or even just pontificate on our own without distracting background noise, but that is to be expected with this type of mic. No app needed. No batteries. It just works. The unit comes with a faux leather zip bag for carrying and a mic holder that can mount on a mic stand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R361WO6TVWIA6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IBPOBW4#wasThisHelpful","R361WO6TVWIA6Q","A2B7BUH8834Y6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B7BUH8834Y6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the October weather brings interesting barometric changes in our part of Texas, so come the joint pains. As I get older, these pains get more gnawing and while I get significant relief from Aleve, it's not something I want to take every day due to the way it taxes liver function. I have been seeking out natural remedies for my minor maladies and my doctor mentioned Turmeric as an anti-inflammatory. I was delighted to read that Ubervita's version of turmeric is GMO-free. After days of waking up, feeling like my hands had been run over with steam-rollers, the tumeric has been a source of relief for my aching joints. I've only taken it for a couple of days and am enjoying the relief and that it's natural. Ubervita packs the turmeric with fruit of black pepper, which boosts the way turmeric is absorbed into the body. This trumps just using turmeric as a seasoning.

"I have never been diagnosed with celiac disease, but as I've gotten older, I have had a far more delicate tummy than I've ever had. The simplest, 'harmless' foods will sometimes tear me up. A coworker of mine, who has been told she definitely does not have celiac disease, started a gluten-free lifestyle and she swears it has changed her life. She says her gastric upset is down to nearly zero. Her gluten-free lifestyle is pretty expensive, though - and right now, completely impractical for me... so I decided to try these enzymes by Jarrow before each meal. What a difference. I cannot tell you how many times I've had to excuse myself from a staff meeting at work because my innards felt like they were going to unfold right there - and for now, those emergency exits are far less frequent thanks to these enzymes. So - am I gluten intolerant? I don't think so, necessarily, but I've definitely become more sensitive the past few years. I'd like to blame GMO foods, but since such foods are never labeled, it's hard to know that that is indeed the culprit. Either way, these Jarro-Zymes sure do seem to help. I was scared to try something new that could negatively affect the work day, so I experimented during the weekend and saw good results and am now starting to take the enzymes before lunch at work.

"These easy-to-swallow capsules (three cheers for not being horse pills!!) work great in knocking out a UTI. The past few years, it seems all I have to do is be awake, or not drink enough water and I turn into my mom's cat - boom - a urinary tract infection - or at least discomfort leading up to one. As I had the hints of another UTI, I took just one of these as directed on the label (once, 3 times a day) and by the time my 2nd dose was due, I had already felt almost complete relief. I took a second and third dose that day just to make sure I knocked that sucker out completely - but I was very impressed with the speed at which I felt relief. Granted, I took my first dose at the first inkling of an issue - but these supplements by Ubervita are not *just* cranberry fruit extract. They have other extracts - of dandelion root, bromelain and others known for their ability to increase bladder and urinary tract health.

"In a word: WOW. I have never been disappointed in a Bose product and this is no exception. We had a very satisfactory sound system with our JBL subwoofer and other speakers, but in comparison, it was like we were listening to 2 cans and some string when compared to the Bose.Set up did take a couple of hours. We have a 10-year-old HDTV. It is HD, but it's also a CRT - and we have a mix of older and some newer equipment that took some fiddling to make everything jibe.The unit has no physical buttons on it - so this is not a remote you want to let get lost in your cushions or be a chew toy for your dog. The remote is required to use the soundbar.We tried piping in some music via Pandora and the quality was excellent, across several different genres/styles of music. No rattle or hum - just beautiful, crisp, yummy sound.We saw the season intro to ""The Walking Dead"" with the Soundbar and enjoyed a whole new level of sound thanks to Bose technology. From gunshots, explosions, honking horns to gurgling zombies, the sound was all around us. A horn honking in the distance sounded like a horn honking in distance - not just a faint horn on a speaker. This is not a true surround sound system, but the experience is in no way diminished when watching a movie. The soundbar has a very small footprint. It's mounted on our wall and looks beautiful, like part of the design of the room.The whole system is both beautiful to look at as well as to listen to. The free SoundTouch app allows you to stream music from your favorite iDevice via Bluetooth, so you're not just stuck with the ports on the back as far as input is concerned.This is definitely the best sound system we have ever owned and we also love the minimalistic, unobtrusive design.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IUC55ZYUOYRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IH6MPU#wasThisHelpful","R2IUC55ZYUOYRK","A2B7BUH8834Y6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B7BUH8834Y6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Artichoke leaf extract is good for bile production to help detox the body, which is why I got these supplements. Like most heavy people, I have an enlarged liver. I know this from the doctor's observations when I had my gastric sleeve procedure. These supplements worked a little too well for me, ironically, so I have had to stop taking them. I am apparently very sensitive to artichoke and I suffered with increased acid reflux at night for the week I was taking these and intense headaches and eventually overwhelming sadness for no reason. These are all byproducts of the liver going into overdrive. I think if I kept taking them, things would improve, but I am just too much of a wimp to continue. The headaches were crippling and the sense of malaise I had last night was overwhelming and came out of nowhere. The only thing in my life that has changed was these supplements, so after hours of online research, I have figured out that these supplements are indeed working, but I am too sensitive to the ingredients to continue taking them. I first had the epiphany this morning as I reached for this bottle to take my daily dose and I skipped taking the pills to do the aforementioned online research instead.These puppies definitely work. I think it's like getting rid of candida - you can suffer as the candida dies, but the suffering is worth it once you kill off the yeast overgrowth... so if you're having issues with your liver and gall bladder, these supplements are definitely worth a try... I just had to tap out early. I'd love to hear from other people who have tried these to see how long the symptoms might last - I'd love to try them again if I knew the side effects were fairly short term.

I am a poor judge of performance, since I am so new at this, but my father-in-law made a lot of comments regarding the use and performance of these clubs.My father-in-law has been using the same set of clubs for about 8 years and was happy with them until he tried these irons. He said that he was getting another 10 yards out of the same swing nearly every time. They're a little lighter than his clubs, but in no way are they 'too' light. He said the clubs were more forgiving because there was more area on the business end of the club to hit the ball with.

"I'm pretty impressed with how soft this has made my hair. My hair is naturally curly and dry and even when I put Moroccan oil on it and flat ironing my hair, it only lasts for a few hours before the electrified frizzies start showing up at the top of my head. So far, even hours after using it, my hair is soft to the touch and not one stray frizzy hair. This is without using oil or a flat iron, too. Just the TRESemme shampoo and nothing else. I can tell you, the label is true to its name - it is moisture rich. I cannot stop touching my hair!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAKB0UICAJQM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TBJSRLA#wasThisHelpful","RAKB0UICAJQM6","A2B7BUH8834Y6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B7BUH8834Y6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am very impressed with this beautiful, sturdy gear closet / cabinet. It's versatile so that it can meet your needs and is beautiful enough to be in your home, not just your garage. The hanging rod height is adjustable, as is shelf placement, so whether you're hanging a winter coat or a shop light, you can adjust to the right height for your needs.The tread plate design is very stylish. The black trim with the fire engine type tread plate design will work with almost any decor - whether it goes in your man/lady cave or garage or barn, it will fit in nicely with such neutral black and silver colors. I like that it's easy to add casters, making rearrangement of this and future Gladiator cabinets all the more easy to accomplish.The shipping weight is just under 150 lbs, so you may need assistance getting it into your house or garage. Assembly, however, is an easy feat for just about anyone. The ingenious 'tab and loop' design allows for very quick assembly - so you will go from delivery to use in about 20 minutes.I really dig this gear closet cabinet!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H8TKZDTG2MIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NSWC7NU#wasThisHelpful","R2H8TKZDTG2MIC","A2B7BUH8834Y6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B7BUH8834Y6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the perfect cable to carry in my laptop bag so I can charge my phone. It takes up very little room, doesn't tangle, and is the exact length I need to have my iPhone right next to my laptop as it's charging. Too much cable means I can accidentally get snagged on it, sending the laptop or iPhone (or both!) flying. Belkin makes really nice gizmos and this cable is no exception. I really like the metallic ends. Unlike Apple's white cables, these don't get dingy right away, and the cable is stiff - it is designed not to tangle or fray, which is the number one problem w/ iPhone cables today. As long as the cable is powered before plugging into the phone or iPad, there is no annoying pop-up saying the cord/accessory is not certified. Personally, I think Apple should remove these annoying pop-ups. Instead, there should possibly be a symbol over the battery w/ a question mark so that you don't have to dismiss a dialog because you got a 3rd party cable. It's just not consumer friendly, and not Belkin's fault. Their cable works just fine... works great, actually. Zero complaints.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X4I0VVIDGXXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LTXV3ZS#wasThisHelpful","R2X4I0VVIDGXXG","A2B7BUH8834Y6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B7BUH8834Y6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful piece of equipment. Sounds cheesy, but the case itself is beautifully textured in design and the unit is remarkably light weight - doesn't even seem like it could be a real piece of electronics. As a Blu-Ray player, this thing is awesome. The menu is very easy to use and the playback is great. If it were solely a Blu-Ray device, it would get 5 stars for playability and user interface. Win-win. It fails in the Netflix department, however. We are heavy Netflix users. We get Blu-Ray discs in the mail and frequently binge-watch shows, especially when we're between seasons. This LG unit freezes up a lot during Netflix playback. At first, we thought maybe it was buffering - but no - it completely freezes and becomes unresponsive to the point we have to unplug it and plug it back in. This happened on several occasions. We had hoped this would be the replacement for the Sanyo unit we have in our living room due to the line of sight remote being very finicky... but this thing is unusable for us due to the problems it has with Netflix, so we gave it to the kids so they could watch Blu-Ray discs and DVDs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK08TTZWPCRXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TIAXSDY#wasThisHelpful","RK08TTZWPCRXN","A2B7BUH8834Y6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B7BUH8834Y6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for my friend who lives in Oceanside, California. She loves water sports, including snorkeling. It's still a little cold out on the water, but she gave it a go as soon as this kit from Phantom Aquatics arrived. She went to La Jolla to try out the snorkel and fins and had a great time.The mask fit her face very well and snugly and the fins gave her great propulsion and ease of movement in the water. She said it was the best snorkeling equipment she's ever used and is impressed with the solid construction of all the materials. She said putting on the mask and adjusting it was a breeze.The snorkel is the dry type and it can clip to the mask.The mesh bag is a nice addition and easy way to carry the gear from the beach back to the car.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V1QQOXMUQ8V1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YLHWVDC#wasThisHelpful","R3V1QQOXMUQ8V1","A2B7BUH8834Y6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B7BUH8834Y6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these for my aunt and she is very impressed with them. She rarely has leaks, but she will sometimes get the sudden urge to go and it will be sudden and without warning and she simply cannot make it to the restroom in time. This started about a year ago and it started turning her into a bit of a shut-in, because she was terrified of having an accident in public.She had tried adult diapers before, but wasn't comfortable wearing them - she said they made her hot and uncomfortable - and there's  a whole psychological element to wearing diapers as an adult, anyway.Now that she's used these for a few days, she's far more confident and is making extended outings. She had to take a medication that kinda knocked her out and she was wearing one of these bladder control pads when she fell asleep. When she woke up a few hours later, she realized she had completely emptied her bladder while she was asleep. She was dry, rash free, and nothing got on her pajama bottoms or the bed.She was floored that a small, discreet pad like this could absorb that much - and since that incident was a one time extreme event, she's very confident that the Prevail pads will be more than sufficient for her as she runs errands, goes shopping, etc. She keeps a couple of spare pads in her purse, just in case. She likes the small size and can confidently wear pants without anything bulging anywhere.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12BFIO0MNADD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NNCQ3S#wasThisHelpful","R12BFIO0MNADD1","A2B7BUH8834Y6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B7BUH8834Y6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My nephew owns a number of instruments, including a 3 5-string electric basses and he was anxious to try out the strings. He likes a variety of strings for each instrument as some performances call for different effects.After he strung his bass with these light/medium strings and played a bit, he had this feedback:1. The strings were well wound within in the package - they did not fling out or flail around.2. He noted that there was no fraying on either end.3. The sound is rich and full. He said that some lesser brands, you can tell by ear which are the heavier gauge strings and which ones aren't.4. He usually uses a string lubricant on his strings, but says he doesn't need the string lube on these strings due to the nano-web coating.5. He said the lighter strings gave enough play to lessen fatigue. He has some need for some pieces to have even lighter strings, but said that these definitely have their place in selection of instruments and stringing options.6. He noted the strings were simply shinier than what he was used to - really radiant, 'new' look to them he doesn't see in most brands.He was pleased with the action, sound and even the appearance of the strings.He is very pleased with the strings and said he will be using this brand from now on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35SCI1OVJO0L8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VUU6JD6#wasThisHelpful","R35SCI1OVJO0L8","A2B7BUH8834Y6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B7BUH8834Y6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"2.7 oz is a large size bottle. This is a spray Parfum.  La Perla is a beautiful fragrance. It has a scent all it's own. Unique, It  doesn't smell like any other fragrance out there.. It's a sexy rich scent that is just very slightly fruity. It's not really sweet though.  It subtle but packs a senory punch. I've gotten these comment: ""what is your perfume? . "" what are you wearing?"". ""Oh, you smell good"" . I first discovered this parfum while working at Neiman's. I was given samples for selling the La Perla lingerie. It's French and it smells so good....delicious. Another good thing. you won't smell yourself coming and going..  La Perla is more widely known for it's expensive lingerie, The asking price for this large size bottle is outstanding. A real deal.If wanting a unique signature fragrance, I highly recommend La Perla. They make another fragrance, but this one is the Original. . The other one is powdery with citrus undertones.

"I purchsed the brown color. It is really a tan/caramel color. It matches the signature Dooney and Bourke leather trim on that is on so many of their handbags.  This wallet is nice quality leather, but not quite as substantial as it appears in photo.  The leather has a glaze.  The wallet is nicely stitched, has a flap closure that snaps together and a small embossing of the designer name(notice photo). The color in  the wallet is not blotchy as photographed. It's a even saturation of color.  It's close to 8"" in length.The zipper is goldtone with an attached metal tab for easy zipping and unzipping. Zippers work smoothly and with ease. Inside.the front of portion of this wallet are 14 slots for credit cards, one slot for a photo ID, and a couple of sections for a few bills. This area is done in the glazed leather. The zippered portion of this wallet has another  zippered area to hold coins. Nice touch; that zipper also a little tab for ease of use. This area of the wallet is lined with a heavier weight satin fabric in a beautiful cocoa brown (in the brown color).  I believe the satin is dyed to coordinate with the wallet's color, whatever it may be. Beside the coin compartment, there are 2 areas to hold many dollar bills. This part of the wallet can easily hold a 6"" smart phone.The only thing I would have preferred is.... when opening, the area was the glazed leather, instead it's sueded. Also, the opening flap is is sueded on it's reverse side; however,  this is a excellent wallet at a great price point.  I have a few Dooney and Bourke handbags and this wallet works with all of them. Again it is the perfect match for their standard leather trim. If you own Dooneys, there's no need to buy a lot of different wallets. The brown color is perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U6XTKPXYXXW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2WIL8A#wasThisHelpful","R3U6XTKPXYXXW0","AWBGHDHH7E51F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWBGHDHH7E51F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This bra fits true to size. The straps are comfortable enough for me, but they are not padded; however, they are made of a thicker material.  The mesh panel does not come up near the clavicles, but it does cover any cleavage. It's important to note, the cups have no stretch in them,,,none. It is important to get the proper cup size. I find the band fits true to size.  The over the shoulder strap will show in the front when wearing  some sleeveless tops, but the front has the appearance of a camisole, so it doesn't look like the bra strap is showing. It looks like you have a cami underneath your top.  In the back, the bra hooks lower and the straps are narrower.  So,  it looks like a cami in the front and sort of a racerback style from the back. While wearing, I feel very supported and ""held together"". My breast don't bounce around in this bra. This is a supportive and comfortable bra towear.

"This cardigan is overpriced. The quality is just average. The button holes will fray. They're not stitched nicely.  It is 100 percent cotton, lightweight for a summer cardigan. I'm 5""5. This cardigan fall to my lover hip. It has a little banding around the sleeves and hemline.  I'm keeping it. This will suit my purpose, but it's not worth more than 20 bucks. Woman Within is slowing inching up to Land's End prices, but too many of their items are lacking good quality. For instance some of their cotton tees are almost 3 times as much as they were a couple of years ago, but the quality of the cotton has decreased. I bought some beautiful quality  V neck cotton tees from Land's End. I got 3 for a litte over 30.00 and the quality of cotton is fantastic...nice weight, shaped,  no shrinkage, etc...","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S67Z8IAPXAVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OSJWMA#wasThisHelpful","R2S67Z8IAPXAVK","AWBGHDHH7E51F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWBGHDHH7E51F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One of the most beautiful quality cz engagement rings I've seen. Nothing chintzy looking about the setting. The stone is beautiful It's a round solitaire set in 4 prongs that are substantial  giving the stone a squared appearance. With the way it's set, this looks to be about 1/3cttw. even though this is actually 20 points. If wanting a slightly larger stone, they do carry a 25 point solitaire in this same style for 13 bucks..

No one but you would know it isn't diamond and a 10. ring at that.I recommend to anyone who has limited funds or doesn't wear diamond, and likes smaller stones.

"These are great looking nails. They look just as good as Salon nails. The tab attached to the nails makes them easy to apply.

I find they last about 10 days and I wash dishes, use bleach and mop without using gloves.I wear them regularly. I'm a Clinical Massage Therapist and we can't have any ""white"" of the nail showing...so we don't scratch our patients while massaging.

"These actually look like one very glittery diamond in each earring, instead of clusters. The setting is done much better that other cluster earrings I've seen. I bought a pair from QVC, more expensive than these,that clearly looked like a cluster of stones.  It is very difficult to distinguish the individual stones. The diamonds are very well set on a 10k metal plate and then the plate is set into a prong setting. The shape is more princess cut than round, but the diamonds are more glittery than a typical princess cut stone. The color is clear, without yellow or dark tinged stones.  The clarity is as stated, but in such small stones the overall appearance is brilliant, glittery and sparkling.I got at a 30 percent discount, which was great for me, but even at the regular price these are a good deal.

"This bra runs small.  In most other bras, I wear a 40DD. The 42DDD is the size for me in this bra.  While the fabric gives and is not stiff, there is no stretch in the cups. The cups are not lined but the nipples don't show through this fabric. While there is no ""padding"", the fabric is not that thin stretchy type.  This bra delivers on it's ""back and side smoothing"" claims. It does a great job of smoothing those areas. This bra offers great support, and uplift. No underwire needed. No uniboobs. It gives a really nice shaping to the breast.  The smooth and seamless cups are my favorite type of bra to wear. It gives a smooth look under clothing. The straps are wider, but not really padded; however, I find this bra comfortable  to wear all day,The DDD""s have 4 hooks in the back and,  4 areas, instead of the typical 3 ...to adjust the band. This is one of those bras that gives a very secure feel when wearing.  The best way to describe; you'll feel ""all in"", secure and supported.  I feel supported all the way around; cups, sides, back and shoulders. No falling straps, riding up in the back and no tugging the bra back into to place during the day. Once on, nothing is falling, riding up or jiggling. The bra is set into place and stays that way until taken off.  Can certainly be used as workout  bra, but unlike typical sports bras, the  ""V"" is deep enough to wear lower cut tops and show our cleavage when desired.  It doesn't look like a harness.  It is a great fitting bra.

The  zipper is nicely sized and it zips and unzips smoothly.  This is not a ""wallet"" that can take overstuffing.  It won't hold up to being overstuffed.This is made of nice quality material.

The price is about 20 bucks.This is a great wallet for those that don't carry a lot, like that artisan look,  enjoy rich intense colors, and that pebble leather look and feel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ7HI1CHJ8ZRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPM8AV8#wasThisHelpful","RZ7HI1CHJ8ZRA","AWBGHDHH7E51F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWBGHDHH7E51F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This dress is designed into a textured weave knit. It is heavier weight, This polyester/spandex fabric is too hot for summer weather. The cutouts are on both sides of the waist.  The skirty flounce of this dress has elastic all around the waistline to create the shirring. The dress runs small.  I purchased the XL. It's equivalent to a size 12.  For an average height woman this is knee length.There are a few things I don't like about this dress,  The material looks and feels too heavy for the sex appeal of the cutouts.  It looks like the type of dress that could use a belt and blazer....and be worn to work in the Fall and Winter. I don't like the look of all that elastic shirring at the waist. The  dress looks better with a belt, but the belt covers some of the cutout area.  Instead of this heavy fabric, a nice smooth cotton knit would've been a better choice for this style. Lastly, the bottom of the bra shows through the cutouts. I don't recommend. It's not balanced. The cutouts have sex appeal, but the fabric is matronly and staid.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KAA50YJR67B8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FY7OVJU#wasThisHelpful","R1KAA50YJR67B8","AWBGHDHH7E51F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWBGHDHH7E51F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the Blue Floral. It's a nice sized wallet that measures about 7"" in the width and 5"" in the length. It has 9 slots for credit cards, Two  clear plastic covered slots for drivers license or photo ID's.  Four clear plastic covered slots for pictures.  There's an area for the checkbook, 4 areas to place dollar bills and 2 zippered compartment for coins...one is conveniently located on the outside of this wallet.  The zippers have tabs attached, so no matter how long your fingernails, you'll have no problems unzipping this wallet's compartments. Differing from the solid colors, the  Blue Floral doesn't look like leather.  It's a glazed fabric....similar to the fabric of the traditional Gucci  handbags. The glaze has a sheen to it. The inside of this wallet has nice fabric lining, not that cheap plastic.  The top flap has a choice of 2 snaps to choose from for closure.  This is a nice added feature. Even a  ""packed"" wallet will easily snap close.  The wallet is stitched together nicely. This is very good quality at a great price.I purchased this wallet to go with my turquoise handbag and even though the color is not as photographed,  I am still very pleased with this wallet. The Blue Floral is a deeper blue than photographed. In the photo it appears to have a turquoise background. The background is actually marine blue or a light navy color.  The flowers are turquoise, with a hint of white. The leaves of the flowers are an attractive green and the leaves are detailed.  The color of the lining is marine blue","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XOYTEQJ8MC61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IYSC03K#wasThisHelpful","R1XOYTEQJ8MC61","AWBGHDHH7E51F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWBGHDHH7E51F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These earrings are small, approximately 1/4"" or 6mm.  They don't appear to be 8mm as stated.  The length and the width are the same dimension.  The flower design is attractive. The silver is excellent quality. Highly polished, smooth, and unplated. The stones are inlaid into the metal. Skill was required to inlay the stones into the metal, without the use of prongs. The little chips have very good clarity, very good cut, and very good color, but I don't believe they're diamond. A diamond of this size (a pin head), with this cut and clarity, certainly won't have wow factor, but  will shoot out fire when the light hits them. If diamond's clarity is of just average quality, with a good cut, it is going to interact with light; bend the light and disperse ""fire"".  It will disperse fire even if the diamond has a yellow tinge, as long as the clarity is decent and the cut of the stone is good. There is no fire coming from these stones.  Still, these stones are pretty and do add  hints of sparkle, and have color that matches the sparkling, icy luster of the silver very well. Whether they're diamond or not, the stones are an excellent compliment to these earrings.The earrings are made sturdy, with sturdy posts located at top of earrings.  The backs are securely fitting. The quality of workmanship is good. These smooth textured earrings are good for children and anyone that enjoys wearing small earrings.  They  look nice in second piercings, too. They lie flush to the ears. Even though they are small, they look very distinctive and attractive on the ears; the silver really sparkles.

"They give a strong diamond presence for little money. I've been on fence about these earrings for a year. I thought the settings would be flat, with easily identifiable diamond chips.  I was wrong.  Photo can't do them justice.They have sparkle and have plenty of fire.  Unexpected at this price point. These appear to be about 1 cttw. I am not exaggerating. They're 1/2"" in length. Very attractive on the ears. The diamonds cascade just below the earlobes.\ The small diamonds are each set in a ""miracle"" plate. but distinguishing the stones from it's silver plate is impossible with the naked eye. The eyes only see what appears to be decent size diamonds set in a grape-like 3D cluster, not really a zigzag. They have depth. I have never seen a  better setting to maximize the stones. Each diamond is inlaid into the center of a diamond cut plate.  Then each plate is prong set into the finding. The diamond cutting causes the plates to really sparkle and each of the 14 diamonds shoot out fire. Further, the little diamonds have good clarity, good cut, and decent color.  The results is the ""miracle"" illusion. The mix of the diamond and the metal gives the an ice cube color that has that slightly grey undertone....but definitely not grey tinged. These are beautiful diamond earrings that sparkle under most lighting..sun, office, store, restaurant, low lights, etc... They sparkle so much, it's as if they're dancing with the lights. They arrive in Amazon's generic gift box....a navy velvet pouch contained within a navy board box.The posts are sturdy and backings fit securely and the earrings are well made.  The sterling is well plated and appears like white gold.  I'm  glad I finally purchased these. The best way to clean is with a drop of dish liquid in hot water and a soft bristle toothbrush; and periodically polishing the stones with Element's Sunshine polish cloth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/REGBR2UZMEXAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S0KT7W#wasThisHelpful","REGBR2UZMEXAW","AWBGHDHH7E51F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWBGHDHH7E51F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These do a decent job of cleaning, but they are not authentic Sunshine Polishing Cloths. If you want a superior cloth that will thoroughly clean tiny crevices and really ""dirty"" metals in short order...this isn't it.  Try ""Elements Sunshine Polishing Cloths"". Those are the real deal. Authentic Sunshine cloths are denser, have more cleaning product contained within the cloth and turn absolutely black after using. Unlike these, they continue to still clean well, after they have blackened. They remove tarnish so well, you actually need to use gloves. If not, your hands will become very dirty.I've been buying Sunshine cloths for a few years, since I wear a lot of unplated silver jewelry. When I saw this trio at their asking price, I immediately purchased thinking I was getting a great deal. I got what I paid for.

"The brown is color of champagne. The cut on the stones is beautiful. The stones have lots of sparkle. The half bezel design really looks attractive on the ears. The silver is highly polished.

The backs are larger and fit very snugly. I don't think they're plated, but if they are, it a lite plating.Don't let the price fool you. These are well made, attractive, solid silver earrings, with beautifully cut and sparkling stones. They are small. The size is more consistent with 4mm, instead of 6mm.

"The quality of the diamonds looks surprisingly good. I purchased these earrings based on the reviews. Thank you. These are beautiful. All the diamonds are clear and sparkling. No hint of yellow or dark carbon color in the stones. 1/10cttw is not a large diamond weight, but these diamonds, set in the highly polished silver, gives a lot of sparkle and shine to the earrings. This silver appears not to have plating. They have some weight to them. The backs are larger and fit securely. In diameter, the earrings are about the size of a dime. The knot isn't a pronounced 3D ball shape. They look more flatter shaped than rounded, like braided bread ....if that analogy makes sense. These studs don't protrude away or hang down from the ear lobes. The sit upright on the ears very nicely.  The post is located in the center.The earrings arrive in a black suede lined jewelry box that is contained within a black heavyweight board box that's lined in turquoise blue.

"This does an excellent job of defining curls. The most effective ""buttery type"" product I've used for ""tight"" curl definition in my wash and go style. The following day, the curls were still defined and tight, but that's is something I only want ocassionally. The pudding is rich, dense, very creamy, lilac colored and has the smell of fresh grapes.  After using,  my hair was left soft, shiny and loaded with curls. I didn't experience harden hair or flaking. Neither did I pile in on.  I also use ""ORS Curls Unleashed Creme"". The Curls Unleashed leaves hair defined, but with looser, stretched out, curls.  I prefer the looser curl definition. I tested this product out on it's own...without any additions, but when using creamy curl defining products, I transfer to a larger container and add castor oil, olive oil, and aloe vera juice. The combinaton really does my hair good.  It seals the cuticles and leaves hair curly, soft, shiny, moisturized, able to absorb better into hair, and dry quicker than just using the puddings/creams alone. I like Miss Jessie's pudding, especially the scent, but I do feel it's overpriced and  wouldn't buy  again, until I start doing a lot of twistout styles.  I get excellent result using the aloe/oils mixture with the ""ORS"" and ""Shea Moisture"" curling cremes. I've tried many different brands of curling creme/butters/pudding, etc..I find most work basically the same on my hair. The main difference with Miss Jessie's is a tighter curl pattern, which I don't necessarily want, but this may be a great product for a twistout, bantu knot, braid out and a tightly curled wash and go.  I definitely believe this product will help those styles  hold longer. Miss Jessie's did really coat my hair. I couldn't cowash it out. I had to shampoo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35NQM2PJCLMJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001KYLENC#wasThisHelpful","R35NQM2PJCLMJF","AWBGHDHH7E51F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWBGHDHH7E51F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Simply designed. This necklace is approximately 1"" in length.  On the front, the metal doesn't really show. It's all about the stones.

The stones aren't that nice. The cut on the stones is average. They look cloudy and darker than typical good quality CZ. They still sparkle somewhat, but there's no fire in the stones. She's only had this pendant 2 weeks and doesn't wear while showering. I expected stones to maintain their beauty longer. I wish these were Swarovski crystals, instead of the CZ.

The fabric is soft and cool. The collar is understated and comfortable around the neck. The sleeves are slightly fuller with a slightly, longer length, short sleeve. The colors are very soft. It doesn't wrinkle excessively. Nice quality. It looks cool and crisp.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17JEFVXCWD18J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007S9U9SE#wasThisHelpful","R17JEFVXCWD18J","AWBGHDHH7E51F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWBGHDHH7E51F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent quality silver; smooth, highly polished, and reflective. They are unplated. That means the inside isn't plated either. The inside is ""raw"" silver. The suface of these earrings have an exceptionally beautiful polish. They are so smooth and pristine.  No porosity, no scratches either. Not even under the loupe. The silver looks like satin. It has a luster.  I haven't seen silver quality this nice in a long while. They look artisan crafted or handmade.  These are some beautiful silver earrings.Approximately 3/4"" in length, 1/2"" in width, They're elegant, chic, and comfortable on the ears. These are bolder huggie hoops, but by it's name,  ""huggie hoops"" are smaller earrings.  They can be worn for any ocassion.  These are go anywhere in style earrings. Attractive V shape is so flattering. The snap bar closure functions properly. Closes securely with a distinct snap,  and the hinge opens easily to allow for ease of putting on.Since purchasing a few pieces of their jewelry, I'm so pleased with Sabrina""s silver quality and workmanship. I wouldn't buy silver jewelry anywhere else. Silver prices are rapidly climbing; and in reflections of that, a lot of the silver jewelry has beocme ""lite"" on the metal. Sabrina Silver still has that good, solid, substantial silver jewelry that I like.Smooth transaction and fast delivery. This is an excellent seller here.

"5+ stars and all the way gorgeous.  Excellent quality earrings!  Highly polished, solid silver, beautiful platinum finish, brilliantly sparkling  princess cut stones, in a channel setting.  They're 1"" hoops. The thickness of metal is almost 2/8"". The stones covers the front half of the earrings. Just as shown, they do extend past the under curve of the circle. The entire front of earrings are covered with sparkling beauties. The back has the highly polished platinum finish. The closure snaps snugly and securely shut.  These are substantial and comfortable to wear.  These feel and ""look"" like quality. Great pair of earrings. My expectations are exceeded. With earrings like these, who needs diamond hoops?

"I am very pleased with this eye anti-wrinkle moisturizer. I have only been using it for about a week and a half, but I have seen significant results since using it. After using this moisturizer, I have noticed the eye ""areas"" to feel smoother and look rejuvenated. The last anti-wrinkle moisturizer I tried did not show me similar results, and I used the expensive product for 2 months. The moisturizer is lightweight, non-greasy, and absorbs into my skin immediately after application. This eye moisturizer is better priced than other moisturizers because it shows satisfying results without breaking the bank. I recommend anyone in search of a new anti-wrinkle eye moisturizer to give this one a shot.  In just the short time that I have been using it, I feel better about the appearance of my eyes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UMLP26FCWJ5O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0038CS02W#wasThisHelpful","R3UMLP26FCWJ5O","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the keyboard that I had always wanted, but I was not able to find one because no company made a bluetooth keyboard that supported multiple devices. Because, often times, I multitask with my computer, tablet, and phone at the same time and having multiple keyboard on the desktop is messy and it takes up too much space. So I always wanted a bluetooth keyboard that I could connect several devices at once. Well, that keyboard is finally here.The overall design is pleasing. The rounded keys are nice and new to me (honestly, I’ve never seen one before) and the board is shaped like the new apple bluetooth keyboard. The keyboard is heavy and requires two AAA batteries, but I actually prefer the heavier weighted keyboard.Upon receiving, I connected my Ubuntu laptop, ipad, and Macbook to this keyboard easily without an issue. The keyboard also paired with my other devices (Chromebox, appleTV, and Android tablet) flawlessly without complications on a separate pairing trials. Only three devices can be pre-paired at once, but it was easy enough to override the pre-paired setting to do a new pairing for a different device as well as needed.Using this keyboard is wonderfully comfortable and convenient. The keyboard remembers the last paired device and wakes the device up by pressing any keys. Then it connects within 2 seconds to the device and works as expected as a bluetooth keyboard. There are also many function keys that work well with my iPad, and mac, such as home button and multi window button (F5). The media control keys (play, ff, pre, and volume keys) are also worked well across the different OS platforms. However, the only device I had trouble reconnecting was my Chromebox. Pairing was successful, but once the chrome OS falls asleep, the keyboard doesn’t make reconnection. I assume this are more on the chrome OS issues rather than the keyboard itself because I don’t have the same issue on any other devices.Overall, this is the ultimate bluetooth keyboard for all the devices I use everyday. Switching between the devices is easy as pressing a button and works well as expected, (except Chromebox.) Special function keys feature that work with different devices is useful. I found, however, the most beneficial feature of this keyboard is the easy three device BT connection support. Ultimately, it saves money and space.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K6G7MD4UAN9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0148NPH9I#wasThisHelpful","R3K6G7MD4UAN9W","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These chocolates are absolutely exquisite and decadent! First, the packing is lovely, so if one decides to select this set as a gift (for whatever reason—birthday, anniversary, valentine’s, or just because), the receiver will certainly be impressed. As a warning, opening the box itself takes time, as it is carefully wrapped. Be prepared to take a minute or two before you open of the trove of delightful chocolates. This selection of chocolates includes 25 pieces of dedicated crafted chocolates, 11 pairs (corner chocolates are two pairs) plus one solo chocolate. Read full description to see all varieties, which include nuts, caramel filling, and swiss creme. As for the taste, each piece of chocolate offers a unique taste to one’s palate. I am not a chocolate connoisseur, but I am frank when I say these chocolates are fine and exceptionally delicious. Oftentimes when one purchases a box of chocolates including so much variety, each piece of candy is far too sweet, but these are not. The quality of these chocolates is high, but I likely rate the quality as high because I simply love good chocolate.  I am not about to compare this set to any other because I am confident that whoever purchases this satisfying box of chocolates will not be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OWRKOPDFP93O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UAGGI0#wasThisHelpful","R2OWRKOPDFP93O","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Where do I begin with this box of assorted candy? First, this set includes mini Hershey’s chocolate, Kit-Kat, Almond Joy, and Reese’s—a fine variety for those with preferences, if you ask me. To open the box, one simply pulls out cardboard from the perforated section, and what pops out is like a tray, which gives the box and appearance of a cardboard dispenser, which is convenient (and genius!).Now imagine all of its uses: 1) you will not be home on Halloween night, so you place a sign on the box and trick or treaters take one (or two, or three) of their choice. 2) you are hosting an event at home and your guests can choose a candy (or two, or three) of their choice as often as they want. 3) you can take the box to your office and offer to patrons, patients, students, co-workers, etc. 4) you can have it at home for personal use (yum!), 5) the possibilities are endless.The price for this box and all its contents is a good deal. For the amount of candy and hassle free selecting, this is a great buy for any occasion you choose. Since I have typed this review, I have consumed four Reese’s, and I am not sure I can stop anytime soon.

"This Jack Links jerky pack was OK. I have tried other flavors from JL, and I prefer other flavors over this one. For one, I like “beef” jerky more than pork. In my opinion, this pork jerky was too chewy and needed more flavor. Although this jerky is Korean BBQ flavored, I thought the seasoning could have been stronger, and I was somewhat disappointed. If you are interested in simply trying out a new flavor of jerky, this pack will do, but if you are a hard core jerky consumer, you can at least give this jerky a try and decide on your own. If you are familiar with Korean cuisine, do not expect to taste authentic Korean BBQ flavor, because you will be disappointed. Overall, this jerky is not bad to try, but this pack is not my top choice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3POEGJ5JAA7NH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0129RS95O#wasThisHelpful","R3POEGJ5JAA7NH","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased several Chromebooks and Chromeboxes last year for my family members and parents. I was happy with those Asus, HP, and Acer branded Chrome OS computers. This is my first Toshiba Chromebook, and I am undoubtably impressed: wow!This Chromebook came with the battery 20% full, and it took about 1.5 hour to fully recharge. The build quality is superb. The screen quality is just the best I’ve seen among Chromebooks. The screen is the part that every owner will look at all the times when computing, and I think, it is one of the most important pieces of hardware. This Chromebook features IPS full HD (1080p) screen unlike some other low priced Chromebooks. It is super bright (at 100% brightness level) and crystal clear and sharp. Colors looked very accurate; it didn’t need any calibration. The hinges are sturdy and tight, it held the screen very well at any angle, and wasn’t shaky at all. Keyboard (backlit) is also one of the best I’ve tried; it was very comfortable even for long document typing. Also, the quick and accurate responsiveness of the trackpad is just wonderful.The built in webcam and speaker works seamlessly and both video and sound quality is far better than any other Chromebooks I’ve tried. If Google Hangout is not you like me, then Skype is your phone. Overall, this is the best Chrombook I’ve ever tried. It almost feels like a one thousand dollar Macbook Air in many ways. The Chrome OS runs super light and fast, and it even comes with some nice perks such as two years of 100GB cloud storage (which is essential) and two month free streaming music service. As you may know by now, the Chrome OS has its limits and might not suit everyone, yet, I think it’s fantastic move from Windows and Mac (unless Windows/Mac apps necessary). A not-too-expensive wifi printer will serve well for the printing needs, and the common tasks such as word processing and photo organizing/editing can be done with many web based services. Over $300 for a Chromebook might sound expensive compared to others, but for the hardware quality, speed, and integration is well worth, in my opinion. I will choose this again over some similarly priced clunky 2 in 1 windows laptop/tablet or low end windows laptop. In the end, I will appreciate the simplicity and the lightness of both hardware and software without the worries of malwares and viruses.  ","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P6WVWTYITG6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015806LMM#wasThisHelpful","R1P6WVWTYITG6L","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve been using Manfrotto tripods and monopods for various shooting occasions for over ten years, and through experience with those tripods, I know I can trust this new one as well.The construction is still very nice and solid. All the locks and legs are flawless and function well as expected. However, the best feature of this tripod is the orientation adjustable center column. The center column is not just height adjustable but also horizontally adjustable. This sliding center column is especially useful when shooting something overhead or when the camera is needed to be offset from the legs' position. I actually saw someone by chance using this feature at a state park last weekend (see attached photo) and thought that's another good use of this kit. However, the center column is not the only flexible one. The legs are also flexible in terms of angle settings, and combined with the 90 degree center column and the ball head, this kit can offer almost limitless possible angles if one needed.I personally prefer ball heads over 3 ways, and the one in this kit is the perfect option. It locks and hold the loads well, but at the same time, it's easy and simple to change angles when necessary. Also, the mounting plate is more convenient to attach and detach compare to other brands' system.The overall size and weight of this kit is medium. It is not too big and not too small, and not too heavy and not so light. It's good enough size to carry around and to use outdoors and indoors setting on the fly. On some extreme angles and occasions, I would just put some sand bags over the legs if necessary. However, I think the tripod and the ball head together are still not that light (5 lbs) to carry over my shoulder on a long distance trip or hike. It is still lighter than my camera setting though. If the light weight is your absolute criteria, then much more expensive carbon fiber legs will do.Overall, this is one those a must-have as a photographer regardless of level of skills. Rock solid structure, yet flexible angle setting, and the cobination with the famous ball head make this kit  just wonderful. I know there are rather affordable options for both tripod and ball head in similar size, but I honestly think this is the better value in the long run.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F3N3B5I5JIR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JS86CI#wasThisHelpful","R1F3N3B5I5JIR9","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I prefer not to use any chemicals when I clean, but when I do, I dare not use my bare hands; therefore, these gloves have been a lifesaver. First, these gloves protect your hands regardless of the task. I only use these gloves for cleaning, so I cannot evaluate these gloves for any other use, and I won’t pretend to do so. Second, these gloves are snug. Some people prefer loose-fitting gloves; if you are one of those people, there are not for you. Third, these gloves do rip, but they do not rip immediately. I work with liquid and sponges, but I would imagine if I were use these gloves while scrubbing pots and a Brillo stainless steel sponge, these gloves would likely break within minutes, depending on the offense of the grime stuck to a pot. So far, I am happy with these gloves. I do not have issues with allergies or rashes, but I do urge those with sensitive skin to “test” these gloves prior to using them. Overall, I am content with these gloves for personal use, but I would imagine dentists, doctors, nurses, and other trades which require employees to use gloves would be satisfied with the quality.

"In the past, remote controlled car toys faced the same problem during the race or play: the car got out of control. The car got out of control not because the toys were defective of anything, but because it was just hard to control to get it to stay on the track. When this annoyance occurs, kids get frustrated and quit playing. Well, the Real FX Racing set solved that problem by making the car unit senses the track so it can stay on the track. It is like playing the video racing game with real life toy set.There are two sets of cars and remote controllers and tracks in the box. No batteries were included, so you would have to prepare 6 AA and 6 AAA batteries. I already had many of rechargeable AA and AAA batteries at home, and I would recommend to get the rechargeable ones ( http://amzn.com/B007B9NXAC ). Except the fact that I had to supply my own batteries, using these common AA and AAA sized batteries is nice because they last longer and are easy to get. Unlike some li-ion built in R/C toys I have (lasts merely 10 min.), this is way more practical. Once the batteries were in, the cars and the controllers were paired easily and quickly.Next comes building the track. Tracks are thin plastic material with some special coating on so the cars can sense to stay on the track. It was easy to build, but it took longer than 2 minutes at first hand. The tracks seemed durable and worked well on the uneven floors as well. After some trials, my son and I figured out many different track models we could build. Although the set came with 20 pieces of track sections, and we could build many different shapes and sizes of tracks, we realized that we wanted and needed more track sections in order to build the tracks we wanted. Currently, it doesn’t seem as if they are selling the track sections separately, but in the future, I hope they do.Lastly, playing with the toy was fun. It’s absolutely fun doing racing. My son loves how his car can stay on the track. Also, there are sound effects and virtual effects (oil spills, tire blow..etc.) that enhance the racing game more like a real video game. The system tracks lab time and keeps the record automatically; we didn’t have to follow who is winning or not, we just had to focus on the race. However, the cars wouldn’t stay on the track 100% of the time. If the speed is too high at the corners, it would go out of the track by the centrifugal force. I don’t know if the company made the system that way intentionally, so we know reducing the speed at the corners is necessary, but full speed on the corners pushes the car out of the track. Now my son knows that he has to reduce the speed to make a nice cornering. Overall, this is a real fun racing game system that is not frustrating. Building our own tracks is engaging and fun. The battery lasts long, and we could play hour long races. And the cars that stay on the track is smart. The virtual effects and many sound effects are well integrated with the game; it makes the racing even more fun. Ultimately, this is a great alternative to the dominant screen time kids spend these days (mostly doing video games) and a nice way to get kids stimulated and  involved while playing something fun. I like the set as a parent, and my son loves it as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G6I24MGLXDEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IGNT3KQ#wasThisHelpful","R2G6I24MGLXDEF","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:40 Mins This is a basic action cam with the standard functions and features. The pros I found from this action cam are the light weight, night vision recording capability, and the waterproofing without housing. The design is uniquely different from others; the cam can be mounted on easily or not so easily using the included tripod adapter or wrist band adapter. Whether to mount it on the helmet or wrist, the biggest benefit of this cam is the light weight. Sometimes action cams with the case and mount adapters weigh more than the camera, and wearing around 200g of gear on the head could be uncomfortable during activities. This action cam, for example, only weighs 45g, and it feels uber light. Sony's AS100 action cam weighs 90g, and its waterproof housing is 70g. If my activity matters with the total weight of the cam, this is the way to go. Also, this action cam has another unique feature that others don't offer: Night Mode. This action cam can shoot at night (0 lux) with the included IR lens although I have to supply IR light ( http://amzn.com/B00T43DJUM ). I am sure this might be a really useful feature for evening/night activities.The cons I found during my testing were grainy video quality, occasional crash, and the short battery life. When I compared side by side with the GoPro footage (3+S @1080p30), the footage from A1 was slightly brighter but with some grainy-ness. The overall image quality was not any better or worse than GoPro's except the graininess. However, several times, the cam crashed while using and became unresponsive. I could not turn off and restart so I let the battery get exhausted. Later, I found I could use the tiny reset button that could restart the cam when crashed. To be precise, the cam crashed twice (separate shooting events) when connected to my phone's app via wifi and once connected to my Mac as web cam. I tried to see if there's a way to update the firmware via app, but I have had no luck yet. I think it's just a software issue, and Panasonic can fix it easily with the firmware update in the future. One last thing is the short battery life. This cam can record for about 20 minutes continuously and that's quite short in my opinion. Considering the size and the design of the cam, I understand the limitations, but I really wish the recording time is little longer than 20 minutes. Luckily, an external battery pack can be used to extend the battery life on the go.Overall, I would recommend this action cam to those who care about a camera's  ""light"" weight most. The small form factor and the design is quite nice and easy to be mounted on the body parts and objects. Also the case-less waterproof body is great feature to get some fun shots during the water activity.  Yet, no action cams are perfect, and this one is not an exception. It lacks some features such as GPS, non removable battery, stabilization, and interval (time lapse) mode. It would be nice if this cam had all these features built in, but without all those, it might do well, if you just want really lightweight basic action cam.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8F9XML6JS3X5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAIKFXS#wasThisHelpful","R8F9XML6JS3X5","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Nuyu fitness tracker is a less expensive, less stylish than others. Since I have never owned a fitness tracker (except Garmin 220), I am reviewing this product based on my experience only with this tracker. If you are looking to find a review which specifically details the similarities and differences between this tracker and another, say the FitBit, you may want to read someone else's review.As the product description states, the Nuyu tracks time, steps, calories burned, distance, percent to goal, and sleep. Before using this tracker, I downloaded the App to begin using it. Installing and setting up my information took less than five minutes. Each day I sync my daily activity to view my results, which display steps, distance, sleep, and weight. I can view the records monthly, weekly, and daily and it shows bar graph for a quick visual comparison.I have to say the accuracy of this unit is roughly 85%. There's no way for me to scientifically track if this device is really accurate, but I know my routines and I have some idea how much I step and sleep everyday. And for me, 85% accuracy is good enough because there's no device that can do 100% rate everyday. ( Nike recently is getting sued (class action) for their Fuelband not being as accurate as they advertised.) With that in mind, I am satisfied with this tracker. The design might not be so edgy, but it does its job and it's affordable compared to others. Also, I like the fact it uses tiny lithium battery instead of rechargeable one. I don't have to take it off every so often to recharge and that is one less thing I have to take care of.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN0V950ORYS8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XRPT6Z0#wasThisHelpful","RN0V950ORYS8A","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Using my existing dead bolt (or should I say turning my existing dead bolt into smart lock) as a smart lock is a great idea, but there’s an issue. The compatibility. Unfortunately, it was not easy for me to install this smart lock although it appears to be compatible according to the instruction page(on the app). The issue I encountered was the size (length of the pin) of the existing spindle and the adapter that came in the box. Basically, my spindle part was not long enough to reach the adapter (or the adapter was not long enough to reach the spindle part), so I had to DIY a piece of metal that’s long enough to reach the short adapter. Also, I noticed that the head of the two main bolts from the existing deadbolt was not wide enough to hold the main unit (the holes on the main unit is wider than the size of the head of the bolts), so I had to supply appropriate washers. Finding the right size of washers was cumbersome because the bolt holes are too close to the spindle hole. I eventually cut the tip of the metal washers. Eventually I installed the lock successfully after one long cumbersome hour.The next step was to download the app, create account, and sync the lock and the app. This process was easy and quick. The lock was working fine with the app and I was able to lock / unlock from my phone as advertised, and I could also assign my spouse's phone to work with the lock.My favorite feature from this smart lock is the ‘hands free’ function. Enabling this function allows the app to track my location (phone) and it unlocks the lock when I come back home from outside. I don’t have to take out my phone and open the app to unlock the lock. It is very convenient feature when my hands are full. However, I found that if the activation range was too small, it did not work accordingly. Also, if the activation range is too big, it might drain the battery on my phone. I found that for the 'hands free' function to work properly, the app needs to track my location all the times, and once I went out of the range I set, the function didn't work even if I came back within the tracking range.Overall, this smart lock is ok. I think it was good idea to use existing deadbolt, but the compatibility can be an issue for some. This smart lock works fines as intended, and I liked the options I can add on to this unit. It could have been great if the Smart-Reader was included in the set though (sold separately). While physical unit works ok, however, the app needs to be redesigned or needs much more improvement.

"This light works ok. It's affordable and it does its job for both photo and video when the lighting is needed. However, the built quality is somewhat poor as many other reviewers pointed out. The mounting part is not strong enough to support the panel + battery 's weight, it can break really easily. Also, the ball joint can not be tightened securely to hold its position. No matter how tight I lock the joint, it still moves around. It was around $20 when I bought this, and for the money, it's ok. It's been useful for me for various tasks (not just photo and video), yet I wish this came with a better hot shoe mounting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SC13JSI8OSZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009HU6RI8#wasThisHelpful","R3SC13JSI8OSZ6","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since our Nest thermostat installation last year, I wanted to replace our old smoke detector as well. However, I found that many reviews weren’t that good on the 1st generation Nest Protect. So I waited for the 2nd generation to come out and see how much improvement developers put on the hardware. And the wait was worth it.The installation took under 10 minutes. I scanned the bar code on the Nest Protect from the Nest app. It went through initializing, connecting to local WIFI, and testing process, and then it was quickly ready to go on the wall. My old smoke detector had a bigger backplate on the wall, but it was just easy to remove the old one and put the Nest backplate on the same spot.The problem with my decade old smoke detector was that is was too sensitive and often caused false alarms when we cooked (or maybe the position of the smoke detector was too close to the kitchen; regardless, my old smoke detector had to go). The most annoying part was that there was no way to control the alarm once it went off. Well, now, with the Protect 2.0, I get no more false alarm, period! I enjoy cooking and often times I make ""smoky"" dishes, which makes my kitchen smoky. However, this hasn’t been triggered full alarm. I got a yellow ring pulse, sort of like pre warning prior to setting the full alarm, and it worked well for me. I could control (hush) the warning / alarm on my phone. I didn’t have to climb on the chair to get the batteries out or try to fan the unit with newspapers.This 2nd generation Protect is, I found, very stable and reliable in terms of network-ability and steam/smoke/CO detecting. It does its core function well, but what it can do when connected to the network and internet is just amazing. My place is relatively small, so I won’t need more than one Protect, but if more than one is connected, the units can communicate and alert each other in case of an emergency. I even thought that having this installed at my elderly parents home would be a great idea. The ability of remote access / control is opening many possibility of using the Protect.The app is also reliable. The Nest updated (major) its app some time ago, and it’s only getting better monitoring and controlling the Thermostat and Protect. I think the app is as important as the physical devices among the internet of things. Many different smart devices these days have poor app implementation regardless how brilliant their physical devices are, such as smart lock, light bulb, sensor, and etc. The Nest app has been 100% functional and reliable for me. The app and the units are always stable together. It’s easy and simple and user friendly.Overall, this 2nd generation Protect is way to go. I’ve never had 1st generation so I never experienced the drawbacks of the product, but this newer one has been just perfect for me. The built quality and the level of material quality are high. The integration of the app and the device is one of the top amongst others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9AUA0WVZ0JNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XV1RCRY#wasThisHelpful","R9AUA0WVZ0JNE","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I already have a bigger sized SSD as a main drive in my MBP, so I tried to put this one as a second SSD into the superdrive slot. I used this caddy ( http://amzn.com/B0058AH2US ), and the fitting was fine. However, the SSD wasn’t writable. I suspect it was the EFI firmware that’s not compatible or not supporting the SSD through the Superdrive slot. The system link speed was 6 gigabit, according to the system report, but I could not get the SSD to work properly.The SSD is fine. It has no issues or errors at all when connected through thunderbolt adapter or USB 3 adapter; it was my computer not supporting the SSD in the Superdrive slot. When I tested with a regular mechanical hard drive with the caddy, it worked fine. (So it wasn’t the caddy that has an issue.)So I decided to use this SSD as a portable external SSD. I had a 2.5” Seagate case that can be used with either thunderbolt or USB adapter. The SSD seems solid, and it worked well with the adapters I have. However, the speed was somewhat disappointing. The Blackmagic speed test showed this one was about half the speed of my main SSD. It is still faster than a regular mechanical hard drive, but the speed I get from this one is rather slow compared to today's standard. Luckily, the price is affordable and PNY memories and drives are not too bad these days. I have been using PNY memories(CF, SD, microSD) and never had issues. Yet, instead of using this one as a main boot drive, it is good enough for me to use as a second or external, in my opinion. It is light to carry and quiet to leave on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R188TICNQFXSDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010DOD0UE#wasThisHelpful","R188TICNQFXSDR","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This toy is an excellent toy for babies between the ages of 12 through 36months. First, the theme of this toy is adorable. Babies learn about music,dialogue, shapes, letters, colors, and fruits. Children not only sharpentheir fine motor skills but also have an early exposure to role playing(eating and preparing food). This toy is not necessarily unusual compared toother Little Tikes toys available on the market. However, the theme alone isunique, and the toy is smaller than many or the larger play sets parentspurchase for their children. This set, also, is an easier option tobring along on a road trip compared to other bigger toys which serve asimilar purpose: spark creativity and offer a good amount of playtime.

"This ball is perfect for little ones and older ones.Upon inflating this ball (according to the instructions), my eight year-old son was excited because he was familiar with the ball, as he had used the same brand/ball in his P.E. at school. Therefore, his transition to using this ball was smooth, and he put it to use immediately. The ball stays firm for a long time and it bounces high with a lightweight child on it. In addition to all the fun exercises my son enjoys on this ball, I have utilized it for my own yoga exercises as well. Mostly, I lie on my back on the ball and do crunches, but I am careful when using it because I know it was designed for children. Since I inflated it about three weeks ago, I have not needed to replenish the air. I cannot recall how many exercise balls I have owned in the past that require refilling a few weeks after intense use, but this ball is still going strong, especially after my son has been using it for nonstop bouncing. Overall, this ball is great and ideal for active children. If an adult is lightweight enough, she may be able to enjoy it as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TNR1AVDMRU5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQIV96S#wasThisHelpful","R1TNR1AVDMRU5M","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Nerf gun is great for a number of reasons. First, this Nerf gun is girl-themed and its darts are neatly designed. Although girls can still enjoy any Nerf gun, this gun is even better. Also, although the Rebelle line is very cool too, this gun is a great starter gun before moving on the the other guns in the Rebelle line. The gun is light, shoots far, and allows for many hours of shooting fun. My 7 year old niece loves the “message” feature, which even attracted my almost 9-year old son. Overall, this is a stylish, neat Nerf gun, and I am certain girls and boys alike will enjoy playing with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34GRJ8GWFG72I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NCZZJ6U#wasThisHelpful","R34GRJ8GWFG72I","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These capsule worked fine with my Pixie, but I did not like how the cremas formed, and I did not like the taste. There's some fruity (maybe berry) aroma and taste in the first couple of sips, but after that, it just tastes somewhat flat, just like regular coffee. Personally, I like bold and reach flavor, and this one tasted more like a medium roast Dunkin Donuts for me. Tasting food and drink relies on personal preference, and I don't want to judge only based on my taste, but,  also,bmy wife did not like the taste as well.Overall, the capsules work with my Pixie, but there are plenty of options in the original Nespresso capsule line. For 20~30 cents or so more per capsule, I rather get the original aluminum capsules from Nespresso. By the way, these capsules came individually wrapped in a plastic like a expensive chocolate, and there are 10 capsules in a big box. The capsules are plastic and there are pre punctured holes on the bottom. I did not taste any plastic, but I still didn't like the idea of hot water passing thru the plastic casing. These capsules are certainly economical and worth trying a box for some, nonetheless.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZKMARJFHTHBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOHLQLE#wasThisHelpful","R2ZKMARJFHTHBU","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We played with the balls in our backyard without knowing if the balls would work well on the lawn, and they did. The eight bocce balls and a pallino ball rolled well on the grass, and we had a fun time. I realized I did not have to have a bocce court to play. This set can be played on any surface and these resin balls seem very durable for any ground surfaces.The built quality of the balls and the wooden case is excellent. There's a premium feel to it, and it doesn't look cheap. The wooden case is especially well made, and it seems really heavy duty for carrying the heavy bocce balls. I also liked the bottle opener on the side.Overall, this is a nice bocce set for families, friends, and kids playing casually. My kid and the neighborhood kids also had fun playing this set in the back yard and the kids were also impressed with the quality of the balls. They especially liked the variety of colors. It was easy for them to identify theirs and others during the game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J4U1N8EYRN90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBIY3CK#wasThisHelpful","R2J4U1N8EYRN90","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, price.This phone was on pre-release sale ($100) for about a week before its official sales launch day. A couple of weeks before this pre sale, ZenFone 2 was released for $200. I thought that was a good price for what was offered. I don’t think so anymore. It’s just amazing how they can make a smartphone with this specs and sell it for $100. I wonder what it costs to manufacture a smartphone these days and how much markups some companies put when they release their flagship phones like G4, S6, 6Plus, Nexus6. It would be nonsensical to compare this phone to those flagship phones, but it is not a secret that much of the retail price is covering the marketing cost. So I assume BLU’s crazy priced phones are possible due to the reduced marketing or lack of marketing.Second, hardware.So how does the $100 phone function? As described, this phone has very capable hardware specs for today’s standard: 5” IPS screen with Corning Gorilla Glass3, Snapdragon410 @ 1.2 GHz with 1GB ram. 4GLTE, and 13MP rear camera. The overall build quality is surprisingly excellent. It’s thinner and lighter than iPhone 5S yet has a larger 5” screen. The back cover comes off for accessing sim and microSD card slots, but the battery is not removable. Who carries extra battery these days anyway? The edges are seamless and the buttons are not wobbly. The design is very sleek. It doesn’t look or feel like a cheap phone at all. In fact, it feels really solid and comfortable in my hand. The speaker is on the lower portion of the back cover, and to my surprise, it is loud and clear. Call quality is also good; I didn’t notice any issues with the voice call quality on both ends. How about battery? Again, I was surprised to see the battery lasted all day long without recharging. I consider myself an average smartphone user: taking snapshots, videos, Instagramming, watching youtube videos here and there, mostly web browsing, texting, driving with Waze while listening to Spotify streaming, and tracking my running with Nike+ app. And after all this smartphone usage, the battery still had about 30% of power left. That was after 14h 22m usage after! While I was watching video for 15+ minutes, I felt the phone got warm just slightly, but I do not think that this observation is abnormal for smartphones.The camera is one of the most considering factor in smartphone shopping these days, and this phone has a good one. I don’t count the number of pixels, but the picture quality tells itself, and it is pretty good. What’s most impressive to me is the video quality. The capability of shooting a full 1080P video in low light situation was just amazing. It was crystal clear and sharp. And the result was just wow. The onboard storage is only 8GB, but I supplied with 64GB microSD (http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Memory-Adapter--SDSDQUAN-064G-G4A-Version/dp/B00M55C1I2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1435074772&sr=8-1&keywords=microsd+64), I could shoot almost 10 hours of video without worrying about the space running out. (Video recording is limited to 10 minutes long (continuous) and it takes 0.98GB of space, fyi)Third, software.Currently the phone has Android 4.4 Kitkat, but I believe sometime in July, update to 5.0 Lollipop will be available. Is having the Kitkat a drawback? Absolutely not. I’ve read many complaints about ZenFone2 having too many bloatware. This one kept the preinstalled apps to a minimum.  It came with Google apps package installed along with the essential apps such as Sim toolkit, media apps, opera browser, and what not. I was glad this phone came light and clean (app wise) from the factory.I’ve been using and testing this phone for several days now, and most of the time, the phone runs well and acts accordingly. The 1.2 GHz might feel little slow at times, but I didn’t have any issues with the apps I use everyday. I found it was helpful to control the number of apps running in the background. Touch screen is always responsive as it should be.Lastly, the downside.This is a dual sim phone, a great feature for people who want two numbers in one device (or to have separate data and voice service). However, due to the internal design flaw, I could only use either nanoSim or microSD card. I couldn’t put both cards at the same time because that’s how the slot is designed. I had to sacrifice nanoSim slot for microSD card. For me having a 64GB extra storage space is better than having a dual sim. I also had to use nanoSim adapter (http://www.amazon.com/iCoolkit-Micro-Standard-Adapter-iPhone/dp/B009AB557I/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&qid=1435077206&sr=8-12&keywords=nano+sim+adapter ) because the other sim slot is for micro Sim, and I only had a nanoSim card. I really wished all three slots were independent so I could use two different sim cards and microSD card as well. But oh well, I can’t have it all.Another thing I’d like to mention is the screen auto brightness feature. I am not sure if this caused by the ambient light sensor (hardware) or software issue, but I noticed the brightness level fluctuated up and down irregularly under the same constant lighting condition. This happened only a couple of times so far, maybe once a day, but I couldn’t figure out what is causing this. I suspect my LED bulbs in the room for now. And most of the time, the auto brightness works well. I will update this review if the issue persists.Overall, this is probably the best smart phone under $150 you can find as of 2015 June. There are several Chinese brands that offer similar specs around same price range, but none of them support 4G LTE connection. I get around 5 Mbps down and 6 Mbps up with only 2~3 bars on Cricket (LTE) network where I am now. This might not be the fastest and snappiest phone in 2015’s standard, but I am happy with the phone speed and network speed I get for $35/mon (unlimited voice/text, 2.5GB LTE data). In the long run, this phone is a mighty money saver for the non-contract plans!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LM5J15PVOSDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YR23W1G#wasThisHelpful","R3LM5J15PVOSDS","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve been using inexpensive Skilsaw 5480 model from time to time for projects, and it’s been working well. Now with this newer model Skilsaw, I am improving my skills, specifically my time working on a project, accuracy,and cleanness from its 15 Amp motor. The overall built quality is nice and sturdy. The size is slightly bigger than my older model, but this new one actually lighter in weight. I liked the shoe, which is also slightly longer and wider than my other one. As described in the product detail page, this model has magnesium guards (both upper and lower and the shoe) and that’s what makes this one a little lighter than others.I’ve cut some 2x12s to make a simple table with this saw, and it was quick, easy, and clean. It cut very clean with minimum muscular effort. Also, it was more comfortable than the other one because they changed the position of the left hand grip. The grip itself is also wider than the other one. Markings for depth and bevel angle are big and bold.Overall, this is a nice upgrade from the economy model. This is lighter yet sturdier and more comfortable.

" 0:47 Mins This charge/sync cable works well as expected with all the iDevices that have lightning port in my house. I haven't experienced a single issue with Belkin cables and chargers over many years of usage, and this cable is no exception. I really like the `gold' color although my iPhone is not gold; the gold cable seems distinguished among the usual and mundane white charge/sync cables laying around the house. The overall built quality is excellent like any other Belkin accessory. The braided cord and the aluminum casing on both ends give me less tangling experience and the premium feel.One last thing I like about this one over regular Apple cable (3.3 ft), is this one is almost a foot longer. There were many times I wished that the charge cable was slightly longer so it could reach the outlet. This slightly extended length gives me a little more flexibility in the situation where 3 feet is not enough. Overall, Belkin cables has been reliable choice for me and always worked well as expected.

"This Nerf water gun is our second, and we love it far more than my son’s first generation water gun. My son loves this gun for a few reasons. First, he can attach it directly to a water hose. What child would not be thrilled with this feature? He can also disconnect the hose when the gun is full, which is convenient when running around and playing. Secondly, since the gun can hold a lot of water, a child does not have to fill the gun as consistently (even if from a child’s perspective, the gun is empty quickly because he/she will not stop shooting)! Unfilled, the gun is light, but once filled, the gun feels rather heavy after a few fillings. My son does not seem to mind the weight too much. As other Nerf products, the plastic is durable. On day two of playing with the gun, he accidentally dropped it on the driveway a few feet from the ground, but fortunately, the gun did not break or chip. I am not sure how many more drops the gun can take, but he is not eager to demonstrate its durability quite yet. I will update if breaking/chipping occurs if/when necessary to do so. The gun squirts a large amount of water and will do some serious soaking to those who accidentally get in the way of a fun-filled water gun challenge. This toy is perfect to play anywhere outdoors and in the backyard. My 8 year old has yet to complain about this water gun. Overall, this is a perfect toy to use anytime, especially right now that the temperature ate extremely high.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUCLCQXC2B96M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXT4T94#wasThisHelpful","RUCLCQXC2B96M","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The box came clean and the packaging had all the parts packed meticulously. Setting this dual mount up was really easy and simple; I followed the enclosed instructions and took only about ten minutes. The bottom mounting part (foot?) was well designed to support various desk thickness and heavy weight support, and I think that is the most important point of monitor mounting. Often times, whether it’s a monitor mount or tablet mount, I saw a poorly designed mounting foot which resulted in damaging the desk or monitor (or tablet), in addition to continuously falling/sliding from where it was mounted. As for this dual mount system, I tried it with my two 23” monitors, and I found the purpose was very well served. Having this ‘branching out’ type design saves space on the desk and makes everything neat and clean. The cables and wires could be hidden under the arms and that makes the whole desk look much simple. Another purpose is having freely adjustable viewing angles. This dual mounting system lets me adjust the height I want, angle I want, and the portrait/landscape mode I want without any hassle. I often switch between landscape mode and portrait mode, and I love how I can just rotate the screen without unscrewing any bolts in the back of the screen.Lastly, the sturdiness and strong built quality is just super. This dual mount is not cheaply designed and the quality seems solid. Also, the price is reasonable and competitive compare to others, in my opinion. AmazonBasics products are known for ‘quality products at reasonable prices’ and my past experience with other AmazonBasics items were always within or over my expectations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EM06S5HGSG6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MIBN71I#wasThisHelpful","R1EM06S5HGSG6O","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Nerf gun is quite compact and light compare to the usual Nerf guns. For the kids, the size and the weight of the gun is a big deal because, if it’s too big and heavy, kids’ hands and arms get tired quickly. This gun is more like a pistol (without the extra attachment) and shoots one bullet at a time, but my son preferred this one actually against the others which load many  bullets at once. Cocking might be a bit too stiff for little kids, but as the product is recommended for 8+ yr, my son didn’t have a problem cocking by himself.Overall, this is another well functioning Nerf gun.

"The packaging and the product inside, at first glance, were pretty nice. Every piece inside was wrapped and packed neatly and accordingly.Installing took 70 minutes for me without any help from cutting the dry wall out to finish hanging the 55” TV. I did not like the idea that I had to cut out the dry wall because I minded exposing insulating materials(fiber glass) inside the wall. And during the cutting process, that is what happened exactly. I ended up putting some tape over the insulating material for now, but I hope I don’t lose any heat in the winter through the cut. If you put this mount on the hollow wall, this won’t be an issue at all, but even with the insulation inside the wall, I had no problem putting in the mount. I watched the installation video first, then followed instruction that came in the box. Putting all the pieces together and screwing bolts and nuts was an easy process. I had to use the extension brackets because my 55” TV has VESA 600x600, and the brackets and the main back metal piece fit very well. One thing I noticed was all the bolts and nuts and the metal pieces were not cheap. They seemed high-quality bolts and nuts. Metal pieces are really heavy and seemed solid and not easily bendable. I worried a bit before to hanging my heavy TV with any mounts, because the TV is unusually heavier than other 55” class LED TVs. But the moment I hung the TV, it was just solid and nothing felt lose or wobbly.The finished result was, “Wow, That’s nice~!” according to my son. That was pleasing comment to hear from my son.Overall, I am really satisfied with this mount. This is not the usual cheap mount. This is high quality, heavy duty with visually pleasing result. My really heavy 55” TV is now beautifully mounted on the wall, and it looks and feels very secure. The mount itself is slightly pricey in my opinion, but considering the quality and durability, I think it’s worth it, especially if you want to mount expensive larger screen TV. The only hard part during the installation was cleaning all the palm and finger prints on the TV screen, fyi.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R42WTNXFYEUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VNO57KA#wasThisHelpful","R1R42WTNXFYEUX","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, this set of jerky is awesome—tasty, tender, and throng-pleasing. Each pack is a different type of meat and flavor—Real Turkey Jerky: Original Recipe, Real Chicken Jerky: Honey Barbecue, and Real Steak Jerky: Original and Chipotle Cracked Pepper (my favorite). If one is a fan of jerky, depending on how much you spend on a package, one knows often times the texture is chewy and sometimes even difficult to break down in his/her mouth—some brands require some serious masticating patience. However, the texture of any of these jerky (regardless of flavor) is succulent and flavorful. If one is sensitive to spice, the only flavor I do caution one to try is the steak jerky chipotle cracked pepper, which does have a kick of heat and will mildly provoke one’s sensitive palate.  Otherwise, the flavoring for the other jerkies are pleasing and delicious! I cannot imagine any jerky enthusiast disliking any of the options available in this set. Overall, this set is worth your money and attention! This assortment of jerkies will not disappoint any buyer or his/her guests, and it would make a great any-occasions snack or housewarming gift!

"The delivered box (from UPS) was somewhat beat up and heavy (over 70 pounds), but luckily all the materials inside were not damaged except the assembly instruction paper being torn. However, the assembly proccess was easy, straight forward, and did not take long at all. All I needed was a screw driver (drill driver made the job so much easier) and a small wrench from start to finish. It took little over 30 minutes for me, and the result looked great.The fabric cover that came with the frame fit well; it just needed some stretches with muscle to reach the velcro strips inside the frame. With the stainless steal legs and the clean while cover, the frame looked really nice, classic, and clean. However, the real benefit of this frame is the weight and the sturdiness. This frame is not like the cheap frames that can be bent and broken easily. It feels very solid, and it supports good weight on top.Overall, considering the factors such as; easy of assembly, classic design, and the sturdiness, this bed frame is satisfactory. I think the price could be more competitive, but since it includes free shipping on this 78 lbs heavy box, I guess it’s not too bad.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11XFOXURYPOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UA62WVO#wasThisHelpful","R11XFOXURYPOA","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These curtains were undoubtedly made for my living room. First, I want to make the point that I am not an expert of fabrics or curtain styles. I needed a set of curtains to match the earth tones of my living room—oak wood furniture pieces, dark chocolate upholstery, and creme-toned wall. Green was the ideal color for my curtains, and although I was hesitant that the green tea would be far too bright for my taste, I was relieved to be wrong upon sporting them on my window. Also, I was not necessarily looking for curtains to block light from my living room, but it did not hurt that these curtains did just that. ((I would like to admit, however, that although these curtains do block light, they do not necessarily block in great depth.)) Mostly, I was interested in having a nice, simple set of curtains to complement my living room, and these are perfect! The design is unique, nothing fancy, and the weight, considering the length of each curtain, is rather light. I did not have to alter these curtains whatsoever. I simply slid the grommets into curtain rod on each side, and my living room was complete! Please receive this review from someone who was looking for an easy solution to decorate her living room. These curtains worked for me, but they may not necessarily make everyone happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SHZDL2Y0K2K2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N133HTY#wasThisHelpful","R2SHZDL2Y0K2K2","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a variety of Special K cereal: Original, Fruit & Yogurt, and Red Berries. I was excited to have these individual cups because my family and I are always ""on the go,"" and these cereals come in handy, especially when we can simply buy a pint of milk for all three of us when we travel and fill these babies up and eat ""stress free."" My family is familiar with all three cereal favors, as we often purchase Special K, so I have no complaints about the taste of any of these. Of the three, Original is the plainest and least sweet, so if one prefers a sweeter option, one might prefer choosing the other two over Original. The contents per cup is mostly satisfying, but I have found that for me, there is too much cereal to finish. If one is a “light"" eater or likes to have something to eat in addition to cereal (fresh fruit, yogurt, etc.), one might find him/herself stuffed rather quickly. If one has just finished an intense morning workout or is very hungry, one will not mind the amount to finish. Overall, this pack is convenient, tasty, and well priced. My only gripe, however, is that the carb content for Original versus the flavored options is significantly different. Since I am a health nut I tend to resort to Original as the carb count is 26g versus 65 for the other two (ouch!). I wish you a happy breakfast, whether you prefer the plainest or sweetest taste. ","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R230T1UN9NJW18/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PHYE802#wasThisHelpful","R230T1UN9NJW18","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The recliner box was huge and delivered by a local freight service, but the box made it through my front door, which I imagined wouldn't, as the box was quite wide. After unboxing, all I had to do was putt the back support of the recliner, and that was it. I thought it might require some bolts screwing and what not, but there was really nothing to assemble but putt the back part. It only took a minute to put together with a help of one pair of extra hands.The design is, I have to say, very classic. The earthy tone can go with almost any interior tone,  and it blends well especially with my sandy colored wall and darker floor. The upholstering seemed meticulously well done with the distinguishing big stitches. There is no uneven stitches or loose threads. The cushions are big and fluffy all the way from the sitting part to the top head rest part. Arm resting is also big, comfortable, and cushiony. The cushions are rather soft, and it is perfect for the ones with the soft cushion preference. The leathery fabric is just like faux leather. It feels and looks like real leather, but I was surprised it's not real leather. I don't know if this is some kind of new material, but I like that there's no dust or lint coming out from the chair and still feels soft and leathery.The most important aspect of choosing a recliner is probably the comfortableness. The first night on this recliner, I fell asleep within an hour. The next day, my wife fell asleep sooner than I had the day before. We nicknamed this recliner 'sleepingchair.' I would not recommend this for reading as one can fall asleep easily. I might not be crazy about the rocking function, but it's included and very functional. For about a month long usage of this recliner, the reclining frame construction seems robust and durable. I did not notice any unevenness or malfunctioning during reclining back and forth and folding back and forth.Overall, this highly comfortable recliner is highly recommended. The level of comfortableness of this recliner is over 90% in my opinion, and it's highly functional as a rocking recliner as well. When reclined, it is not too stiff, not too soft, I felt really comfortable whether watching a movie, reading a book (beware of falling asleep if you are extra tired), or just having a conversation. Lastly, this recliner will accommodate anyone who wishes to give it a try; the chair is certainly not small.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBEU9OE5GZXAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QM2L2H0#wasThisHelpful","RBEU9OE5GZXAE","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I see more and more accessory makers are adapting magnetic solution for the mounting, and Lifeproof is not an exception. The difference is that along with the magnetic part, this adapter is designed for use with other LifeActiv accessories such as bike mount and belt clip. And to be able to do that  Lifeproof came up with a well-designed adapter that is not too thick and still has strong plate/magnet for magnetic support. This adapter is designed to use with the Lifeproof case, I think, but it still works well with other cases or the phone surface itself. Also, the adapter works pretty well with the original mountek holder and Techmatte holder. It would probably work with any other holder that is magnetic. What I found on this adapter is that its holding power is stronger than others and it gave a very sturdy grip on the mount.Overall, this adapter is strong and well made. What I am most benefiting from this is the convenience of how quickly I can attach and detach my phone with only one hand effortlessly. I have been using other magnetic mounts at home, office, and in the car, and I would not probably go back to any other type of mounts and holsters until I find it fantastically innovative. The product photos and descriptions on the Amazon page is slightly confusing (I could not tell whether the adapter comes with the case or not), but this item is the adapter only, fyi.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MLSMAFW5GSUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UIF3MA2#wasThisHelpful","R2MLSMAFW5GSUT","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought several of these bulbs with the Hub 5 months ago, and I can say it’s been working great without any major issues. I scheduled two bulbs to turn on overnight outside during the winter months and other bulbs for indoor use. The bulbs worked great as scheduled even in the coldest northeast winter nights. Turning on and off and dimming the bulbs from my phone and tablet worked seamlessly and never malfunctioned except the times the Hub went offline.This bulb is rated 800 lumen and consumes around 12 Watts/hour. That’s 2 Watts more than 600 lumen philips Hue bulb and 800 lumen philips slim style led bulb.This bulb is not supported by the Robot (from the Wink App) or IFTTT features yet, but I wish I could do some fun and automatic things in the future, including voice command control.

"I bought this monitor at a local store for a project. I took the plastic casing apart to get the panel out, and was surprised that it was LG panel inside. The monitor has been on for about two weeks now continuously, and I found no issues such as light bleeding, dead pixels, or smudges.Colors and default color temperature are very good, I did not have to adjust anything. Images and texts are sharp and crispy, and the brightness is excellent as well. I decreased the brightness to about 40% to conserve energy usage, and it consumes only 14.8 Watts/hour. That's equivalent to one CFL bulb (60W) turned on (or less) and I calculated it would only cost me $3/year for 8 hours of usage a day.This is very very energy efficient led monitor with LG panel inside.

"This is simply the most beautiful iphone case I’ve ever seen. It fits perfectly, not so loose, not so tight; it’s just a perfect fit. The built quality is excellent. It looks as if the leather skin was glued on the plastic casing meticulously and seamlessly, especially on the corners. I could not find out whether this is real leather either on the product box or description page, but by the smell of it, I am pretty sure it’s real leather. (It smells just like my real leather wallet and belt). So how do I like it on my phone? I love the feel and look. I always wished Apple made leather surfaced iPhone or iPad or even a Macbook cases, like Samsung did on their Chromebook. It just feels better, different, and luxurious when leather is applied on things. Maybe I can DIY on my MBP.Overall, this is the most simple, functional, and beautiful leather case I could find. It is rather pricy, yet it is better than any other overpriced plastic cases by other brands. Fyi, this case comes with a screen protector film and a screen cleaning cloth which come in handy from time to time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHRVPOIW4T49W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SUYVOYY#wasThisHelpful","RHRVPOIW4T49W","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This replacement head fitted on my old delta faucet. I had to put one of the adapters that came together, and installing was easy and quick. Both spray and stream mode worked well as designed, and the button to switch the modes was easy to press every time. It did not require too much pressure to press the button, and I liked that kind of smooth and easy button.The built quality is OK. I received the plastic (chrome) version, but it looks nice. The product is well designed, and the size is not too small not too big; it goes well with our existing faucet. It is comfortable to pull out and hold the head.It only feels slightly cheap when I grab and use the head, but it functions well as designed.Fyi, there is a warning label that came in the package, saying ""This product contains a chemical know to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm"" for this plastic / chrome version head. I don't know if the other version has the same warning label, but I wonder what kind of chemical that is and also what it means by 'contains'. I don't know if that means the water coming out of this head will be affected, or simply just saying this head is made of the materials that contain a harmful chemical. Whether I like it or not, almost all plastic products have some degree of harmful chemicals, in my non scientific opinion, and nothing is chemical free.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTE664LLWJTTE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T8KXQSG#wasThisHelpful","RTE664LLWJTTE","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this TV (2015 model) at Target recently, and it has been working well. It only weighs about 20 pounds, so it was easy to carry and to assemble (two legs). The TV was all set after connecting some media boxes and cable and took only about 10 minute. This is a 2015 model, and the design has not changed much from last year’s model, but I really like the design. The thin and metallic look bezel (still plastic) is trendy and simple; all thick black bezel looks like a thing of the past. The 2.2 inches of thiness is about half of the thickness from my 55"" sammy LED TV, and it makes easy and elegant to hang on the wall. FYI, if one wanted to wall mount, this TV has vesa 400 x 400 mm and comes with a pair of wall mount space for the upper holes.The factory default color setting was quite good; I did not have to adjust anything to calibrate the colors and what not. This is my third LED TV from LG (various sizes and models I’ve purchased in the past several years), and I always found that the color setting was very natural and accurate. In contrast, other brands’ LED TVs I’ve owned needed some color adjustment to make it look more natural. However, if one prefers different color presets (vivid, APS, cinema, game, expert1 and 2) are available in the menu.) I just prefer the standard color setting. On this TV, movies and TV shows look very nice. The picture quality is super clear and sharp; it's pleasuring to watch things in good HD quality. And of course, a nice set of extra speakers would help gaining more pleasure since the built in speakers are 'built in' speakers.One thing I'd like to mention in this review is the yellowish tint on the right hand side of the screen. It is very subtle and minimal, and I don't think it's noticeable for a normal consumer, but because I am sensitive to color accuracy, I picked out on a white background. However, during daily TV watching, this was not be noticeable at all, and mine did not show any light bleeding or dead pixels.Overall, I like this very basic LED TV. It's not a 'smart' model, but a Roku, Fire TV, Chromecast, or Apple TV are always better than 'smart' TV, in my opinion. Picture quality is what’s impressive, and it clearly stood out among other LED TVs when I looked side by side at the store. However, the biggest pro for me on this one is the low energy consumption. I set the Energy Saving mode at medium and my P3 meter measured 29 Watts/hour. That’s probably 10 times less than what Plasma TVs used to consumed in the past. Less than 30 watts/hour is pretty impressive, and the screen is still not too dim. Now I don’t feel too guilty watching a TV too long.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REUA7TMN0ZP9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TRQPVKM#wasThisHelpful","REUA7TMN0ZP9G","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This patriotic throw blanket is warm and a perfect size for all members of the family. The design is meaningful and makes one 'cover' with pride. The bottom of the blanket is faux wool while the flag is polyester but with a silky, plushy feel. This throw blanket is not only ideal for keeping warm but also fitting for decorative purposes on a piece of furniture, wall, or window. Also, I would imagine this piece to be an excellent prop for photographers, especially shooting subjects and families (imagine a sleeping baby on it!).The bottom line is that this blanket is very warm regardless of preferred use. I live in the Northeast, and winter is still harassing spring temperatures, so having an extra blanket is necessary at our household. While I use this blanket, I do not need an additional blanket, as I normally do. This blanket alone warms up quickly, and its soft and cozy texture makes it difficult for one to part from it.I would caution for those considering using this blanket for outdoor decorative purposes to take precaution with the all-white bottom of the blanket. Mine is in a spotless environment, but I would imagine washing out dark stains would not be easy if it got dirty. The flag is also susceptible to getting dirty, as the stars and stripes are also white.Overall, this blanket is beautiful and useful for all reasons I mentioned and beyond!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OSUEVC6V8YIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGG8UMW#wasThisHelpful","R2OSUEVC6V8YIP","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I like how it is so quite and simple to operate. The power control knob worked as expected and the fan speed varied by the control. The overall size is rather big being a USB powered fan, but compared to the ones that have small blades, this one feels like a real fan.

"I have many different brands of colognes, and among them, white musk scent was always my favorite. Like any other human sense related products, colognes are very personal because of one’s preferences, but I found new favorite. I am not a big fan of strong scent or cologne and this one is not punchy. This white polo scent is very familiar and famous, yet not too strong at first, but it lasts longer than others I have tried. The scent is somewhat gentle for me, and I like it that way with longer lasting endurance. Imitations often have similar scent at a low price, but only last an hour or so.

"Recently, I had a chance to film kids' musical recitals. With this 22WL model, I couldn't have it done any more perfectly. I was maybe more than 80 feet away at the back of the hall with my cameras, and I could not afford to go back and forth to the stage to control/monitor audio recording. This new WIFi model was just perfect for my need. I preset the recorder close to the stage, and then I was able to monitor and control the recordings in the back on my iPhone. Using the WIFI connection drained the battery little faster than I expected, but a small smartphone battery pack also could have been used if wanted, for peace in mind. There was a slight lag, maybe 0.3~0.5 second between the unit and the app, but it was perfectly doable for me. I mainly used instrument (accoustic) recording preset and some interview so far, and of course, the recording quality is very satisfactory. My camera with a shotgun on top recorded some good audios in the past, but that is not as good as this one anymore, unless it’s for ambient sound. It’s always better to get closer to the source for both images and sounds.Prior to the recent event filming, I found Tascam had an firmware updates ready for this unit and I went ahead and downloaded and updated. Updating the firmware was easy and took only a couple of minutes. With the original firmware that came with the unit, I had some issues controlling via app. When I tested the unit before the firmware update, streaming wasn’t reliable and the app acted out. However, firmware update solved the streaming issue, and the app now communicates better with the recorder.Overall, I found this model is perfect for a remote setup as well as portable recording. The unit is rather big in size for my small hands, but if I setup on a gorilla pod, size doesn’t really matter. Preset scenes and functionality is one of the best along with its recoding quality in the class and this new model now supports wifi connectivity for more controllability. The recently updated app works reliably and responsively well on my iPhone for now, and the WIFI range is also good in open space. I think, however, the app (iOS version) still needs more polishing and enhancing with some additional features such as maintaining cellular data connection while the app is connected via WIFI. I also wish it supported realtime streaming for monitoring and checking the sound. There are some small things like 'streaming' option being 'off' by default (every time I restart the recorder,) but I am sure this can be updated easily in the future for more user friendly ways. At the end of day, what matters is the great sound quality this recorder can record.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DUIROKW6OU6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MIXFBKG#wasThisHelpful","R3DUIROKW6OU6P","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hesitated on this piece because I thought it was a huge pumpkin colored pendant that my grandma could have owned in the past, but I was completely wrong. This necklace is very subtle and beautiful. It is small in size and elegant in color. This is not my grandma’s necklace anymore, but rather it is pettish and classy piece. The style is somewhat classic, yet I still think there’s a bit of modern simplicity as a whole piece. The lace (or chain) is thin and light; it almost feels like silk lace. And the pendant is solid and secure.Overall, I love this piece. Once worn, it looks much different from the image on the product page. It look much more beautiful on the actual human skin, and the subtle color changing on the one’s skin tone is just simply gorgeous. Fortunately, we have an almost matching earring set that can go beautifully with this piece, so I am very happy.

"This keyboard and touchpad combo is perfect for HTPC in my living room. The distance between the dongle and the keyboard is around 10 feet and it works flawlessly. However, if there's an object or obstacle in between, I noticed the connection got interrupted. All the keys and the touchpad functioned well with my windows 8.1 setup. Also, the keyboard works well with my Macbook. I had no problem waking up the mac from sleep or putting it back to sleep. The keys are soft and typing is easy on my hands with this, but I found the size of touchpad is somewhat small.I am happy with this keyboard and touchpad combo overall. The price was great when on sale and the reliability is greater than some off brand bluetooth keyboards. I paired this keyboard to my htpc and it works very well, but I also found that this could be a regular wired keyboard or BT keyboard alternative.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R88IQ2NOUU3DX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DKZTMG#wasThisHelpful","R88IQ2NOUU3DX","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to make two things clear before I begin my review: I am not a professional stylist (nor pretend to be), and this styler is the second I have owned; therefore, I am merely reviewing this amazing product based on a perspective that may be limited to those who need a full comparison between this styler and other competitive brands.I have wild, uncontrollable wavy hair. In fact, I cannot JUST wear my hair down without any styling, so I need some sort of straightener or styler to help control my long hair when I do not have it up in a bun or ponytail. For this reason, I had to buy a straightener several years ago when I decided to let my hair grow. Until I received this ghd styler, I had no idea what I was missing. The previousstraightener I owned I bought at Target; I just needed the thing to make my hair straight. Although the device took a long time to do its job, I was satisfied with the mediocre results because I could let my hair down. However, when my ghd periwinkle beauty arrived in the mail, and I utilized it for the first time, I finally understood why price and brand are important when making such investments for hair devices.First, upon using this device, I was impressed with its packaging. If you are giving this styler as a gift to someone, the box itself is lovely. The styler comes with a nice storage case. Your styler is definitely pampered when you are not operating it. The styler comes with very basic instructions, and it offers no styling tips. The cord is 9FT long, which is convenient for those who have some distance between plug and mirror, and the “neck” (where the cord connects to the styler) moves (swivels) freely along with your hand. Before use, one simply plugs the device into the outlet, and the styler will prompt the user when it is hot enough to begin styling; I wait for about 15~20 seconds. After, the styler flattens hair in no time! I am used to taking 2-3 minutes per section of my head to straighten my hair; this styler takes between 30-45 seconds per section, with much better results. Since I am only interested in making my hair straight, I am extraordinary pleased with this beautiful styler. I have not stopped using this styler since I received it.Whether there are other brands that are better, I cannot know. I am sure this is a great tool for styling creatively as well as straightening. Yet, once you own it, you will want to look up styling tutorials on YouTube to make better use of it, as I began to do after using it.  If I were a professional stylist, I am certain I would love this styler. Price and brand do matter, and now I understand why ghd has such a good reputation. ","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9JQNF7020549/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EQB0WVQ#wasThisHelpful","R9JQNF7020549","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The pillow arrived in a nice vinyl case that can be used for traveling if one wanted. Upon opening the case, some smell (brand new memory form smell, I suppose) dispersed, and it wasn't pleasant. I inspected the pillow quickly, and I found the quality of this pillow was visually excellent though. After covering the pillow with a freshly washed pillowcase, the original form smell was almost undetectable.Now I have slept on this pillow several nights, and I am very satisfied with the quality of the pillow and the comfort I got. This is my first memory form pillow and never had one in the past; now I am thinking of replacing all of my pillows to memory form. Although I like firmer and harder pillows, at first, I thought this pillow was a little too firm and boxy. But then my initial impression diminished after the second night. The pillow is rather firm, yet it is providing me the comfort I need over night, and it stays cool. The pillow is somewhat boxy, yet it is soft and comfortable. Whether I toss it around or not, it fully supports my head position firmly, and it is very comfortable. My worry about this pillow being a boxy disappeared once I rested my head and tried to feel the comfort level. Also, once the pillowcase is on, I couldn't really tell the difference by looking at it next to a regular cotton pillow with the same pillowcase. However, the big difference between the two is the supported firmness and coolness through the night.Overall, I found this memory form pillow is more comfortable for me than my cotton pillows. This pillow is firm, and at the same time it is soft. It's not that high, not that low, not too soft, not too hard. The price isn't too bad compared to some name brands' cotton pillows (that will shrink its thickness by half in a couple of months sometimes). I haven't had this memory form pillow to see if it loses its thickness eventually or stains itself with my sweat, but for now, this is the most satisfying initial impression for me so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15LC50Y16VL0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PLM47AG#wasThisHelpful","R15LC50Y16VL0M","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The sim card did not work initially, so I just had to call the Red Pocket CS and it worked immediately.Since the one 5 minute phone call, this sim card has been working well with my ATT version iPad Air. The mobile data ($5 for 512MB and $10 for 1GB for 30 days) is not too bad and I only need to pay when I need mobile data (no contract). The description shows 4G, but I get LTE signal on my iPad most of the times (depends on the location), and the speed is satisfactory where I use the device.

"This eye shadow compact is colorful and long-lasting. Although the compact includes specific instructions to wear each color at once, one can wear each color solo with lovely results. I received classic nude (#60), and I could not have asked for a more appropriate set, since nudes complement my olive complexion. These colors do not wear off easily. I applied the eye shadow at 7:15 A.M., and it was still going strong at 5:00. Lastly, this product is kind to my eye needs. My eyes are very sensitive, which has prevented me from purchasing just any brand. I have always trusted Neutrogena for this reason, because the brand offers quality products for every person. Lastly, although I do believe the item is somewhat pricy, I undoubtedly know the set is worth it. Another bonus, since my using this set, nobody had ever noticed my eyeshadow at work (not that I expect anyone to do so), but it was nice receiving compliments not only for the shades but also for the subtle presentation on my eyes. I definitely recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R6YIV7XAM44G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLP9RSG#wasThisHelpful","R1R6YIV7XAM44G","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I like about this shower caddy is the material. It’s clean, light, but solid. It’s been hanging for about a month now, and I haven’t noticed any rust on any parts. As the name of this caddy claims, it doesn’t seem it will rust anytime soon. In the past, no matter how expensive stainless steal shower caddies I hung, they all ended up rusting. I have not tried an aluminium shower caddy before, but this one seems decent.What I don’t like about this caddy is the shortness of the ‘hanging’ part. The ‘neck’ is too short, and the shampoo and body wash bottles I placed are too high. For a tall person or low shower head, this might work well, but for those who are not tall with the high shower head, this could be inconvenient to reach the bottles.Overall, this shower caddy is a decent product. Since everybody’s height and the position of the shower head are different, this caddy won’t satisfy all, but for some, it can be a very nice shower caddy. If you have a shower head that’s not too high might work best to hang this nice shower caddy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC703OGV4MDD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWQ80JS#wasThisHelpful","RC703OGV4MDD7","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:25 Mins I already had the Wink HUB and some Link bulbs installed at home, and this was my new addition to the Wink HUB. Installing these sensors was easy and simple. I pulled the battery sticker, attached, and then activated the Tripper on the app. It took less than 5 minutes, and everything worked perfectly as expected. The size of the main sensor is somewhat wide and big, so I found it was not easy to attach to the door with moldings. An additional (thicker) adhesive pad might solve the issue though.From what I learned, the Wink HUB and the app might not be perfect, but it seems the Wink team is constantly trying to improve their product and software to make work better with many other products. For now, this Tripper sensors are working very well with the both Wink HUB and the app, and I am happy that I got this budget home security done D.I.Y. so easily. I might get a couple more for the windows.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14M7ZA9DYVU4D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P7RURIG#wasThisHelpful","R14M7ZA9DYVU4D","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two rooms that are far away from the router thus get barely minimum wifi signal. The weak signal in those two rooms mean slow speed. From time to time, watching a video clip from youtube or netflix means suffering in buffering. This powerline kit, however, solved the issue painlessly. I’ve never had powerline network extender devices, so I read the installation guide prior to connecting the kit to my home network. But, there was nothing that had to be done but plug into the power outlet and connect the ethernet cables. The internet connection worked immediately on my computer, and it was pleasantly fast. I checked the link speed, and it was showing 100 Mbp/s with the ‘Pick A Plug’ LED light showing between amber and green.Overall, I am very satisfied with this Powerline Network Extender Set. This is a true ‘plug and play’ type of network extender that simply works without any issues or complicated installation. Also, the built in extra outlet is very useful on both adapters, and I found these are very energy efficient (consumes only 1.7 Watts/h).

"I want to preface this review by saying that I have owned many choppers and slicers since I find these items essential to my kitchen. I have owned brands from KitchenAid to Sunbeam, and I know which brands work best for me. With that in mind, I also give gadgets and applicanes a chance regardless of brand, because I have learned that sometimes a less expensive item might work well whereas a more expensive item may not, as the brand is what costs people money and not so much the product. Therefore, I am reviewing this Freshwater product with an open mind, as I have not owned any other product by this brand.First off, the quality of this product is OK. The plastic pieces do not seem very study, and upon use, one might likely believe that the plastic parts will not last long, unless one is careful at each use. I can easily foresee an accidental drop cracking one or more of the pieces of this set. However, with regular care, this product will work just fine! On the plus side, which is important to me: this product is BPA free!!As for the use of this slicer, it really works as it should. I have used the slicer for onions, zucchini, apples, etc., and I have not had any issues. I love the storage container, which makes storing and cleaning up easy. The same goes for the chopper, which works well. The blades are solid and easy to replace.For washing, I recommend simply using warm water and a dab of soap. Although the product page states that the items are dishwasher top rack safe, I recommend hand washing the items, which is painless. (Some blades are very sharp, so be careful)Overall, I recommend this product, and I have had no issues with any of the pieces. This kit has many different parts for different functionalities, so I had to spend some time to get used to this kit. Once I got comfortable, I spent less time slicing and chopping in my kitchen. So for me, this kit is a timesaver. I cannot predict each piece lasting years, but it is a nice, convenient starter set for anyone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K83FATYBPM5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPXKQQQ#wasThisHelpful","R3K83FATYBPM5R","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This light is a bright yet dimmable and energy-efficient LED flood light. I personally have never heard of the brand 'Muller Licht', but I assume it's a German brand manufacturing in China. The product description claims that this bulb is engineered in Germany, but according to the product packaging, the bulb is made in China (just like any other bulbs).The bulb is very big and very bright. Due to the size of the bulb, this light is perfect for outdoor flood lighting, yet I happened to have a huge light stand (dimmable) for my living room, so I decided to put the bulb in there. The light stand I have with the bulb paired well with the full dimming capability. I also noticed that there is no buzzing noise, unlike my other bulb that made noise when dimmed. This bulb consumed only 1 watts/h at the lowest dimming and 15.3 watts/h at full brightness. I like how this bulb uses so little energy  (when in use) and its dimming capability, but there's one thing I want to mention as well. I don't know if I simply received a refurbished bulb or not, but the bulb did not look like it was brand new when I opened the sealed package. (The completely sealed, hard plastic packaging was brand new.) There are many visible scratches, black smudges, uneven / rough edges where 2 plastic casings glued together, and some fingerprints. The product works fantastic, but the overall finish of the bulb looks like very much 'used' in a rough environment. If the bulb I received was 'refurbished' or 'remanufactured' then all the scuff and smudges I mentioned is understandable; if this is the standard when they manufacture a brand new bulb, then I am disappointed with their QC process. Overall, I would give 5 stars, minus one because of the bad QC.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DQW51RBWYOJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KLJ71W0#wasThisHelpful","R3DQW51RBWYOJ1","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There must be a reason why Google bought Nest Labs for 3.2 Billion. My opinion on why Google bought Nest Labs (in cash) is because they foresee the household smart devices market as blue ocean, and it was sparked by this thermostat and led by Nest Labs. I am slowly and carefully adapting these household smart devices, and this time, followed by my Philips Hue set up in my home, this thermostat is the second device I am adopting.Installation took about 15 minutes, and it was just simple and easy. I watched the installation video on the web and followed the guide. Basically, all I needed to install this was my hand and a included screwdriver. Then, set up also was breezy and done on the device within 10 minutes. During the setup, I had no issue or problem connecting to my secured home wifi, and from testing to first usage went smooth as expected.So this is just a WIFI connected thermostat and what’s the big deal? I don’t have to crawl out of my warm and cozy bed in the middle night. I can monitor home temperature and control the thermostat wherever and whenever I want. It learns our temp setting pattern after a month or so, so I don’t have to do it myself. And it generally helps me save the energy, and it’s just so easy and convenient.My nest thermostat is still learning our heating behavior, yet everything so far has been just working great. Connection to my WIFI is stable, the app on my phone and my iPad are responsive. Updates are all done and all the sensors are pretty accurate.Overall, I am really happy with this thermostat. It made my life easier and helps me monitor home energy consumption. The product’s hardware quality and design is just exquisite and elegant considering being a household thermostat. Everything just works as expected in a beautiful way.

"This is a newly introduced learning tool from Leapfrog that’s compatible with its new LeapTV system. This Dance and Learn is one of the few cartridges currently available for LeapTV system, and I and my kid found this one to be great fun. He first just thought this was just another game, but without knowing, he got involved in learning vocabularies, alphabets, phonics, and compound words easily and quickly. He was just busy having fun dancing, wiggling, shaking arms, and bouncing, yet all these physical activities programed to work with teaching the basic reading skills. There are basically 9 different dance games that also involve learning in 3 different modes (+ Free Play mode). Up to four kids can play together, and the controller is not needed to play this Dance and Learn title (one controller is still needed to navigate and execute the game). Parent guidance and supervision was somewhat necessary at the beginning, but once my kid played a couple of times, he figured out how to navigate and play by himself without me.Overall, this is a really fun game and learning tool for kids under 7. The title description suggests kids age between 4-7, but I think 3 year old will and can have fun as well if played.The LeapTV and this game title works somewhat like the Wii system, but the fundamental difference is that, with this one, kids can see themselves on the TV screen as they play and dance. The key to having fun with this title is to have a well lit room and have a right distance from the camera, I found. After putting an extra light next to the tv set, it worked much better because the camera could see my kid better in better lighting. The space doesn’t have to be huge; actually, a small space with the camera and the child’s distance around 5 feet worked best for us.Overall, this is a wonderful game that enhances kids’ physical and learning skills. I found the title and the leapTV system are very much kid appropriate/friendly, and I do recommend this system for parents  looking to introduce children to educational gaming.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A9SHOXEYI78Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNT6NGS#wasThisHelpful","R3A9SHOXEYI78Y","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cable syncs and charges my iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 plus, and iPad Air without any issues. It worked well with all of my usb chargers, usb ports on my computer, and including the car charger. This charge and sync cable is made for idevices and is almost identical to Apple’s, except this one being 1 foot longer. A longer cable might not be necessary for in car use, but almost always useful for me at home and in the office. Apple’s original 3 ft cable is always seemed too short, and I wished many time it being longer in the past.There are many cheap lightning cables available, but I would recommend getting something better like this one. Knockoffs can damage the device, and I wouldn’t bet my expensive devices paired with the cheap cables. This cable comes with a 2 year limited warranty, fyi. I don’t know if that covers the device as well, but at least, if anything happens to the cable, it’s covered for 2 years.

It seems as if this case made only for Air 2 and Belkin made a mistake advertising it can fit both models. I tried hard to fit my Air, and it was just impossible to put the Air inside. Besides the misleading compatibility issue, this would work well with the newest iPad Air 2. The case is not too heavy considering being a folio case, and it only weighs 0.78 lbs. The quality is durable and well made; this kind of case is one that can last many years. Overall, I like Belkin cases for my tablets and phones. They make quality cases that can protect my devices.

"Even though this colander is HUGE, and I have a small kitchen, I still love it!!! Since this colander has a 5 quart capacity and offers extendable legs, which are the products two best features, I can do everything I want with it. I am a baker and pickler over the weekends; therefore, washing and ensuring my fruits and vegetables easily drain after washing, is one of the biggest advantages two owning this amazing colander. This colander is also a lifesaver for draining large amounts of pasta/noodles, which is my second need for it. Although this colander is dishwasher safe, I recommend hand washing it, as it does not take much labor to clean it after each use. This colander also serves for an easy way to dry plastic/wooden utensils after washing dishes if you have the space for it. The quality of the product is super: the plastic is strong, sturdy, and offers slip-free moments in the sink. Before one decides that the product is too bulky or big for his/her small kitchen, think twice, as this colander has many uses and will tailor to his/her needs.

"The initial pairing of this bluetooth keyboard case to my iPad air was successful, and the connection remained paired unless I tried to pair with different device. One attempt to a different device messed the whole BT pairing; I had a hard time re-pairing to any of my devices. After many failed attempts to pair, I was able to pair again to my iPad. Once it's paired, it works the way a BT keyboard works. When the keyboard is idle, it disconnects, and waking up the keyboard by pressing any keys reconnects to my iPad within a second or two.The overall quality and material choice is great, but the design is not. This case is heavy (1.35 lbs) and bulky; it is in fact, heavier than my iPad Air (1.05 lbs). Belkin has made better BT keyboard cases for iPads in the past, and it seems as if they rushed to put this one on the market for the iPad Air 2 model.Overall, this is my least favorite bluetooth keyboard from Belkin. I prefer Belkin Thin Type to this one for my iPad Air. If you have an iPad air 2 and are looking for a bluetooth keyboard case, I don't think I can recommend this one. The description says this case would fit iPad air and air 2 models, but I could not even fit my Air into this case. The keyboard functions well once paired to only one device, but my overall opinion is that the keyboard is poorly designed and priced somewhat high.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DSL5FP2DEZWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0M4YCO#wasThisHelpful","R2DSL5FP2DEZWM","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have loyally used Juice Beauty since 2008. Every product—moisturizer, cleanser, toner, mask, serum, lip moisturizer, etc.—has left my skin feeling and looking exceptional. Their SPF 30 Sport Moisturizer is no different. After applying the moisturizer, my skin feels smooth and protected. Many of the JB moisturizers I have used in the past, especially those with sun protection, including this sport moisturizer, are thick in texture and leave almost a white finish on my face, which is not a product everyone person can wear, as everyone has a different tone of skin. However, with some gentle reinforcement onto your face, the white tint will minimize. (I understand some individuals do not favor the thick, white finish, but I have made it work for me). I also appreciate that once applied to my skin, I feel satisfied that is does not easily rub off onto clothes (through changing sessions). Lastly, when I simply do not feel like wearing makeup, I use moisturizer solo, which always blends nicely onto my skin. I spend a lot of time outside, and thus far, I have not suffered from extreme sun damage thanks to this and other SPF Juice Beauty products. Compared to other Juice Beauty products, $16 is not a bad price at all. Knowing that my skin is protected makes this product valuable to me.

"Installing this router did not take long, and there was nothing complicated. Since my computers (laptops) don't take the mini CD that came in the box for installation, I just followed `method #2' on the `Quick Installation Guide' which was web based.First, connect this router to the cable modem, then power cycle the modem. And then connect to C2's WIFI on the computer (either 2.4 or 5 GHz) using the password that's on the bottom of the router. Then, finally, finish the setting up process by opening the web based setup page at tplinklogin.net. From the setup page, I could change the settings I wanted to have for the router.Once connected and finished setting up, I tested speed and range of 5 GHz band non-scientifically. With the Airport Extreme (AC version, and I know these two are not in the same class, but I am just comparing for reference purpose only), I was getting the link speed at 450 Mbit/s on my Mac and 234 on my PC at the same location and distance from the router. And with this C2 model, I was getting 150 Mbit/s on my mac and 58 on the PC. While the link speed was ok on my Mac and had no issues watching videos and doing normal web surfing, it was suffering to load some video clips on the pc side( btw, my pc supports AC band.)Overall, this is pretty basic router that offers mediocre AC connection range and speed at a reasonable price. If this used in a small space, it would do its job well and efficiently. However, if you're looking for a better wireless range and speed, C7 would be a great option for just $30 more, in my opinion. The C7 model is ranked at #1 in AC1750 class where same class Apple Airport Extreme is ranked at #6 for twice the cost of C7 according to the smallnetbuilder rankers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSCYIP9DC0INX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KATWRIY#wasThisHelpful","RSCYIP9DC0INX","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I attached this led strip under my kid's bunkbed and I have to say it's fun to have this. My kid loved that fact he could change colors and do a little party lighting as well. The strip was long enough to go around (almost) the twin sized bed, but the double sided tape simply did not work after a couple of days. I then used some zip ties and the problem solved.The light strip has been working great without any issue for over two months now and I am thinking adding extra strips to the existing one.

"I love this awesome Metrokane Houdini wine tool kit! I have to admit that I have never owned a chilling carafe, and after having a blast with this kit, I do not know why I never thought about having one. Since I cannot compare to other brands, I will solely focus on my experience thus far. First of all, the kit includes a corkscrew, carafe, aerator, and preserver with two stoppers, which come in handy! Based on a few (responsible) evenings of wine “testing,” my wine remains chilled for at least a couple of hours. It took about half an hour to get the wine kindly chilled with the stainless steel rod filled with ice cubes. It was nicely chilled in my opinion. It wasn’t abrupt and shockingly chilling, but naturally and satisfyingly chilled. The vacuum pump and the stoppers worked ok, but, unlike the quality of the crystal carafe, the vacuum pump and the stoppers seemed a little bit cheap and the built quality seemed generic. The corkscrew did its job well, except the hinge that holds the blade was wobbly. Lastly, the aerator is my favorite from this set; it worked really well;  I could tell the slight difference in tasting with and without the aerator. I also liked how it just flows and pours nicely and leaves no spillage on the bottle. Attaching and detaching the aerator was easy and simple, but it was tight enough to stay attached and make no mess.The overall design of the set appears nice and classy, but the stopper is my only criticism, which just does not seem to fit the rest of the presentation. Despite this small undesirable feature, the product is great and does its job. Considering all the one gets upon purchase, I believe the price is beyond “right,” and I think the whole set would be a great choice as a gift item as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23X5JURQ3ZF0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NXJI54S#wasThisHelpful","R23X5JURQ3ZF0I","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have owned Thomas Train wooden railway sets, this set will not disappoint your child. If you are unfamiliar with these beautiful trains and wooden accessories and are considering purchasing your first set for a child, this is a perfect starter set. The set comes with Percy, reg vehicle, cargo car and cargo, and if you have other Thomas Train accessories, such as trains and tracks, your child can easily add more fun to this set. Setting up this toy takes seconds, and your little one can assemble the set one his/her own, without a grownup’s assistance.  All pieces save for the trains themselves, are wooden but do not feel cheap. Two perks about this set: promotes fine motor skills development and allows children to explore magnetic properties. Although the price for this set is somewhat high, the quality of the toy and the amount of time children spend playing with this toy justifies the price. Overall, a wonderful set for any child!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34SI52FVSCO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWPK91U#wasThisHelpful","R34SI52FVSCO","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very sleek, but expensive, set of bluetooth stylus and ruler for iPad and Adobe apps. The design of this set is very stylish and goes well with the iPad’s design formula. The built quality is also above the standard with a minimal inconvenience.First, I charged the stylus for several hours, and it was ready to use on Adobe’s Line and Sketch app. Paring the stylus and switching between the two apps was easy and smooth. Both the stylus and the ruler worked well most of the time as they intended to. However, I quickly realized that these products were somewhat disappointing. The apps were fantastic, and I love both of them. They are wonderful sketching apps, and it works well most of the times, except one thing: The palm rejection. That’s one of the key feature from this stylus, yet it just doesn’t work well. Especially with the ipad’s multitasking gestures turned on normally, my palm and the stylus drove the Line app crazy. Simply to say, palm rejection feature is not working and not useful and the Multitasking Gestures should be off when using these tools and Adobe apps. This happened to other sketching apps and stylus I have, but this time seemed slightly more frustrating.On the other hand, pressure sensing worked well, and it was useful for me compare to other non pressure sensitive ones. The shortcut button was also helpful when needed to access some features quickly without looking for the buttons on the screen.The slide is something new, and I found it was quite useful to my surprise. It is somewhat limited what the slide can do at this time, but I see more features and options can be added easily in the future by Adobe (if they want to). I found that iPad’s 9.7” screen size is yet too small for both tools to be used in drawing. If I have an iPad that has 15” screen size, then the slide tool could be used much more freely than on the tiny 9.7” space. Hopefully, in the near future, Apple would make something bigger than the current size iPad. In the mean time, for the 9.7” iPad screen, the slide is somewhat big and wide.Overall, I think the idea was good and the set have some potential in the future. However, I don’t think it was easy to make the stylus that recognizes and rejects the palm perfectly yet because of the nature of touch screen. I do think the set still need some improvement and rethinking about pricing. In my opinion, if this set sold with some kind of free subscription of Creative Cloud, the current price might be justified. But for now, for the price, I would recommend other alternatives such as Jot Touch or investing in Wacom tablet.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3172U5FY8D9BW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LNECVN6#wasThisHelpful","R3172U5FY8D9BW","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What’s inside the boxThis phone reminds me of Google’s Nexus 4 in many ways. Here’s another very affordable and capable smartphone from BLU. Design and package is well made with recyclable materials. Inside the box, a charger, usb cable, earphone, manuals, plastic case, battery, and a screen protector are included. On the Amazon product Details page, it says 2 Lithium ion batteries required (included), but only one battery is required just like any other smart phone, and only one battery is in the box (extra battery could have been nice, however.) And of course, before the initial use, the battery needs to be fully charged.First, my favorite feature from this phone was unlocked dual sim slot. It doesn’t just have two sim slot, but I could actually activate two sim cards simultaneously. Then I could assign data service to sim1 and voice service to sim 2 or vice versa. This is the feature I always wanted since cellphone carriers keep raising the fee. Now I can finally have voice and data separately from two different carriers. I tried Cricket sim and T-mobile sim together and all worked great without an issue. I noticed, however, when both sim cards are active, battery seemed to run quicker. The sim slot #1 is micro-sim and slot #2 standard sized. Both of my Cricket and T-mobile sims are nano sized, so I just used a couple of adapters. http://amzn.com/B009GB6DBOScreen is the part that I look at all the time, so I think having a good (color, brightness, touch sensitivity) screen is critical when choosing a smartphone. And to my surprise, the screen on this phone looked no different from most of the recent smartphones. I checked again the resolution and it stated 540x960. Because my eyes are used to high resolution display devices these days, I was able to tell the resolution difference between this phone and my iPhone 6; however, I just couldn’t complain that this is lower resolution phone because it just looked perfectly good. Reading a news article, watching a HD video, and playing with the photos I took with this phone, all these screen intensified activities looked perfectly fine. If you’re worried this has lower resolution than other recently launched phones, please worry not. I’ve seen some worse screens on the phone, and this one has a very nice one, unlike other budget phones. Other than the lower number of pixels, the screen itself is very bright, clear, and sharp. The factory default color temperature runs slightly cooler than my iPhone, but I prefer to have cooler screen than a warmer one. Touch sensitivity was also very responsive and prompt; I didn’t feel or see anything lagging or delaying on the screen.Processing speed is one thing I noticed that lacks from my expectation. I felt it was little slow,  but it was nothing like buggy or laggy. Because I had a faster phone before, I felt this one was slightly slow. When web browsing in chrome, pages open little slow, but once loaded, it browses normally. Other apps such as Google maps, Camera, Skype, etc..work really well and fine including receiving the GPS signals. This phone might not offer fastest processing speed, but considering the cost of this device, this would beat any competitors’. Also, using google maps’ navigation worked really well and faster than others.Internal onboard storage is 8GB, but I had no problem adding a 32GB microSD card with full of media files. Different video files,such as .mkv, avi, mp4, all worked fine, and I was surprised actually the phone didn’t even get hot when watching a movie. With my 32GB microSD card added, I have more than enough storage to shoot HD videos with this phone (approximately, 22 hours of shooting time).Most frequently used hardwares parts, such as front/back camera, battery, led flash, speaker, headphone port, and all the buttons work well as they expected. I especially like the massive 8 megapixel camera in the back. Photos look wonderful and sharp, and video recording did a good job as well. Since this is a budget phone, there’s no image stabilization or slow motion video recording, but it does perfectly well on the fundamental features of smartphone. Speaker volume is loud enough if turned all the way up, led flash is bright enough to find key holes at night. Everything worked so well and smooth, I am really satisfied with this low cost, but very capable, phone.Overall, this is a excellent smart phone with the android 4.4 kitkat at a greatly reasonable price ($145). The price might give you an impression of low specs budget phone, but don’t get fooled by that. This phone is very capable running all the apps I need and does the job well. The build quality is excellent, and again, the phone doesn’t feel cheap at all (it feels like Nexus 4 for me) and weighs (5 oz) slightly more than iPhone 5S (4 oz). 4.7” screen size is very nice and big. I can still operate using only one hand and anything bigger than 4.7” needs both hands. I’ve never heard of this BLU brand and their phones, but after trying this phone for a week and looking at their smartphone lines, I am very satisfied with the phone. Along with other Chinese underdog brands such as Huawei, Oppo, ZTE, Xioami, and etc, BLU’s Life 2 is surely another good competitor to those major brands’ smartphones, and we, the consumers, are getting much wider pricing and device options. Competition is good and major brands will eventually compete against these off brands in current and somewhat inflated retail pricing.If you want little more speed, Studio 5.0 LTE version might work well for only $20 more. I am seriously considering getting the Studio 5.0 LTE version, and combined with the prepaid unlimited plans such as Cricket, $45/mon/line, I could ultimately save lots of money in the long run. Fyi, at my location, I get around 4 Mbps down and 2 Mbps up at 4~5 bars of HSPA+ on Cricket network (AT&T).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMNIQM4OU91CI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MAHW5WC#wasThisHelpful","RMNIQM4OU91CI","AR3EVUQF0AC7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR3EVUQF0AC7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This body wash has minimum to medium strength scent and left my skin feeling a little less moisturized than other moisturizing body washes. I like the fact that the scent is not too strong, but when I finished drying myself, I could barely smell the scent. This scent is semi-similar to Old Spice's men's body wash, but it is slightly soft. It also worked well on my short hair as a shampoo and a conditioner. Basically it is very convenient to use one body wash from top to bottom to clean everything.

"I bike commute a couple of days each week for 6-7 months a year. I have been using a combination of Topeak bags including the Topeak MTX Trunk Bag EXP Bicycle Trunk Bag with Rigid Molded Panels, the MTX Trunk Bag EX with rigid molded panels as well as some inexpensive Bontrager panniers. The Topeak MTX has been by standard commuter bag/pannier combo as I can roll up the panniers when they are not needed. It has been very durable and impossible to lose while riding on even the most pothole cratered roads that New York can offer up.I was pumped to try out these Thule panniers. I have been a big fan of Thule, having used many of their accessories including a bike roof rack. A few things of note about these bags:1 - Construction: These things are built to take all sorts of abuse. You can probably use them on your next dog sled trip through Alaska if you can figure out a way to attach them to your sled.2 - Reflective: I have the black bags and they are amazingly reflective. I used a bright headlamp that puts out a significantly less amount of light than a car headlight and the panniers pretty much lit up like a reflective highway sign.3 - Waterproof - there are by far and away the most watertight panniers I have seen. To me they seem to be almost at the point where they could be considered for use as a dry bag. I don't ride often in the rain, and therefore I have always found my Topeak bags to be sufficient but I would definitely prefer to use the Thule bags when waterproofing matters.4 - Attachment - Thule advertises these panniers as being usable on most commercial bike racks. This may be true but it took me some trial and error to get them to work with my Topeak rack and a couple of others that I had around. I ended up borrowing a Thule rack from a co-worker and found that the Thule bags worked flawlessly with that. If there is one complaint I have it is that the bag tended to bounce around a bit more than the Topeak MX. A couple of times there were some fairly jarring bumps that make me wonder if it's a good idea to put a laptop in the pannier. On this one point I think that Topeak's system is better.5 - Aesthetics - these bags look good. The carry straps allow you to sling it over your shoulder or across your chest with no problem. If style is your thing, these are probably the best looking waterproof panniers in this price range you will find.Overall this is a superior product that is priced a bit above other brands/models. I like them and will probably use them in wet weather or when I need to take a run to the grocery store. I will keep using my Topeak MX for normal riding as I like the flexibility to use the trunk and/or panniers as needed, and because I trust Topeak's stability to better protect my electronics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYGFD6EGIJ2N3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R7BDRHS#wasThisHelpful","RYGFD6EGIJ2N3","A4IL0CLL27Q33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IL0CLL27Q33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A product like this has to grow on you over time so I am giving it a 4-star rating after having used it for the past week. I'll update my review as I get more experience with it.I have tried a bunch of products that help you with self-quantification. For the most part I use them for a few weeks to a couple of months and then give up on them because of their inevitable shortcomings. Each device I have tried has had problems with comfort, limited functionality, unreliable readings, limited battery life, lack of integration with other tools, durability, waterproofing or style. Over time though the devices have become better, with progressively better ways of ingratiating themselves into your life.I have been using two types of devices consistently - my Polar watch and bike computer for several years and my Apple Watch for the past 6 weeks. I find them both to be exceptional at what they do, though they too have limitations. I have been wearing the UP3 by Jawbone daily alongside my Apple Watch and base my review on their competing approaches.Price - UP3 wins, as it is half the price of the cheapest Apple Watch.Compatibility - UP3 wins again - it will sync with both Apple and Android devicesStyle - This goes to the Apple watch. The UP3 is okay - it's not going to detract from and add to your outfit. It comes in a few colors but that's the limit of its options. The Apple Watch can be customized in far more ways than it makes sense to discuss. Plus the overall design of the Apple Watch is more appealing in general.Comfort - this one surprised me a bit. I find the UP3 to be less comfortable than the Apple Watch in two ways. First the narrow band means that more pressure is applied to any given area when you rest your wrist/arm on a surface. Since the Apple Watch band is more than twice as wide, the weight of your arm is almost completely unnoticeable while with the UP3 I was constantly aware of the pressure. Also, and again this was a surprise, I found that the narrower UP3 band actually trapped more moisture underneath than the Apple sports band. I am left to assume this is due to the material.Battery life - no competition here. The UP3 will go for 7 days with a full charge. At the end of the day I have perhaps 35% battery left on my Apple Watch if I have worked out for an hour. At most I can go 36 hours with my Apple Watch, assuming no workouts.Sleep tracking - This too goes to the UP3. The Apple Watch cannot effectively be used to track sleep as you are going to be charging it over night. The UP3 has provided me with great feedback on sleep and has native tools in its app to give you reports every morning.Alerts - The Apple Watch wins. Without a screen the UP3 can only alert you that you have a message. You have to open the app on your phone to see what it's alerting you about. Alerts are limited to internal app notices - drink water, stand up, etc. The Apple Watch offers a huge assortment of alert options that you can read right on the watch itself.Standing alerts - UP3 wins - you can customize the frequency of your alerts. The Apple Watch offers two choices currently - hourly alerts or no alerts. The UP3 can be customized in 5 minute intervals.Exercise tracking - neither device is perfect in this category though I'll give the nod to the Apple Watch. I don't appreciate the fact that the Apple Watch doesn't have options for weightlifting, kickboxing, and many other popular forms of exercise. That said, the UP3 only has a stopwatch function that is activated from your phone. Furthermore the UP3 requires integration with a third party app to report most data while the Apple Watch uses the Apple Watch and Health apps built right into your iPhone. The Apple Watch has room for improvement but it seems far ahead of the UP3 at this point.Syncing - Apple Watch wins though battery life is part of the tradeoff. My Watch syncs constantly with the phone. With the UP3 you have to open the app to manually sync data. That is more energy efficient but means more manual intervention.Other functionality - It's perhaps not a fair comparison - the UP3 is a purpose driven device while the Apple Watch has the benefits of being a platform upon which designers can layer their own apps.Charging - no advantage to either. I will point out though that the UP3 is a significant upgrade over previous generations of UP products. No more annoying caps to lose. It does require a custom charger, but so does the Apple Watch and many other wearables.Integration - both integrate with a wide range of cloud-based apps. Most of the apps are available across Apple and Android phones and across a wide variety of wearables. It's interesting though that the UP3 DOES NOT INTEGRATE with Apple Health. I'm sure this is a conscious choice on the part of one of the vendors. It's a shame though because the Apple Health app is really, really, good and I'm not in the mood to start using multiple apps.So on balance I will probably end up using both my Apple Watch and the UP3 for the next several weeks. In one sense the outcome is partially decided already - I'm not going to be giving up my Apple Watch. It's a key part of my daily activities and is very good at a wide range of functions. The question though is whether I will continue to use the UP3 for anything other than sleep tracking.I'll update my review over time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VG8FRDVPOTDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9E6DUK#wasThisHelpful","R3VG8FRDVPOTDY","A4IL0CLL27Q33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IL0CLL27Q33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It seems to me that this product was rushed to market without taking the time to take care of the details. For example it appears that the pieces have been stamped or plasma cut and that no effort was made to chamfer the edges, leading some edges sharp enough to scratch your iPhone or watch, and in one or two places, sharp enough to scratch deeply into your skin.I would have also appreciated something to keep the cords in place - an oversight that left me to have to improvise a solution.As far as fit, I have the Apple Watch (steel) with the sport band. The watch and band fit nicely in place for overnight charging. The overall look is very nice and it doesn't take all that much space on my nightstand.I have a feeling that future versions of this product will be better as they fulfill their backorder and have a chance to focus more on product quality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X8EKWC6FYWG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9VR830#wasThisHelpful","R2X8EKWC6FYWG1","A4IL0CLL27Q33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IL0CLL27Q33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I travel 2-3 weeks out of every month and therefore wear out travel gear on a frequent basis. Well-made carry-on spinner suitcases tend to last me 3 years or so before some part fails, which means that I have gone through probably 3 of them and another 2-3 older-type roller carry-ons. When I say that I know carry-on bags, believe me - I know them probably too well for my own good.Up until this product from Hartmann I have not tried small hard cases. I have a couple of bigger ones that my wife and I sometimes take on multi-week trips as they are useful for bringing home souvenirs that aren't allowed in carry-on bags such as bottles of oil, vinegar, etc. The hard cases have protected all of this stuff very well over the years and I have not yet lost a bottle of scotch or locally made Italian oil to the hazards of checked luggage.I just took this Hartmann bag on two round trips to Houston, with connections in Atlanta. It performed admirably. Here are my thoughts as they relate to specific aspects:-Storage: The internal compartments kept my luggage well sorted. There is more than enough room for 4 days worth of clothing and toiletries.-Spinner wheels: These are the smoothest spinner wheels I have ever used and were a pleasure on both tiled and carpeted airport surfaces. The wheels are VERY quiet - a big plus.-Weight: I'm not sure how they did it but this suitcase is significantly lighter than the Samsonite carry-on suitcase that I usually take with me.-Durability: It's a bit early to reliably predict how long this suitcase will last, but all signs are positive so far. There aren't any of the usual telltale signs of problems to come - loose screws, sticky zippers or poorly designed wheels. I'll update this post at a later date to note any changes.-Overhead fit: This bag easily fits inside regional jet overhead bins. In the unfortunate event that I had to check it, the blue color and distinctive design would make it easy to pick out among the piles of black roll aboard suitcases everybody uses.-Integrated locks - I don't usually lock my carry-on but will lock suitcases that I check. With integrated TSA-approved locks, there is one less thing that you have to worry about.Unfortunately I am resigned to the fact that my wife is going to end up claiming this suitcase as her own. She has been asking me about it each time I have come back from recent trips and we have an upcoming trip to San Francisco in a few weeks. I'll most likely be using my Samsonite for that one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J7WSJ8EX3D5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JU927I0#wasThisHelpful","R2J7WSJ8EX3D5S","A4IL0CLL27Q33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IL0CLL27Q33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start by saying that I have not eaten much popcorn over the past 10-15 years because I HATE the way that the husks end up stuck in my teeth. I even ended up going to the dentist a couple of years back after making an exception to my general rule and had popcorn husks do deeply embedded in my gums that it took a professional to dig it out.This popcorn varietal was of obvious interest to me.In fact, the description of it being almost hull-less is absolutely true. After sharing the first packet with my wife we were both sold. That leads to the next big plus.My wife was a huge fan of the ingredient list. Until this product she had given up on microwave popcorn due to artificial ingredients. She was VERY excited to give this a try.Fast forward a week and all of our first order of this popcorn is gone. Considering the fact that we haven't had microwave popcorn in the house for a decade and that should earn this product five stars.I am going to withhold one star though because I hope they can improve on one issue. At a movie theater, or with other brands of microwave popcorn, every bit of popcorn is going to taste pretty much like the last one. With this heirloom product, there is a larger range of difference in taste from one kernel to the next. Sometimes you get a standard tasting handful. With the next it is more earthy - almost mushroom like.To be clear - some folks may consider this a big plus. I found it a bit distracting during a movie when I didn't want to be thinking about the taste of the popcorn. On the other hand, I ordered another batch of this popcorn and, after some more hands on tasting, I may end up deciding that that variety in in fact a good thing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WJWNOCAGP1TN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TUTAJ08#wasThisHelpful","R1WJWNOCAGP1TN","A4IL0CLL27Q33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IL0CLL27Q33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one heckuva debut novel for Scott Hawkins. Set in a modern day America, The Library will keep you guessing and turning pages long after your clock says that you should be heading off to bed.The three primary POV characters are about as different as can be - a demigod, a reluctantly-famous Medal of Honor awardee turned Homeland Security special investigator, and a only slightly reformed burglar. They all have their roles to play in a plot of multi-dimensional ramifications. I have seen novels with similarly grandiose ambitions go seriously off the track but, with a sense of humor, often witty dialogue and characters that take their share of abuse and keep coming back for more, Hawkins keeps this story moving forward and keeps the story mostly free of patently ridiculous plot twists and decisions by characters that are clearly not in keeping with their dispositions.There is a healthy amount of hand-to-hand violence dished out by a tutu-wearing fellow demigod to special forces units, some nukes, a walking glacier and a bunch of unique elements to this story that keep things fresh and compelling. I'm looking forward to reading more books from Scott Hawkins and hope that he can keep up the good work after such an impressive initial effort.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVNYHGE3Z29MF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553418602#wasThisHelpful","RVNYHGE3Z29MF","A4IL0CLL27Q33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IL0CLL27Q33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This air filter gets full points for effectiveness, usability, ease of operation and noise. It's not as pretty as some other filters on the market but it's advanced user-centric design makes up for that.I have written a number of reviews for small to mid-sized room air filters from Honeywell, Delonghi (DeLonghi AC230 Energy Star Air Purifier with Ionizer, 220 Square Feet), Winix (Winix U300 Signature Large Room Air Cleaner with True HEPA 5-Stage Filtration, PlasmaWave Technology and AOC Carbon and Winix U450 Signature Large Room Air Cleaner with True HEPA 5-Stage Filtration, PlasmaWave Technology and AOC Carbon) and Coway (Coway AP-1012GH Smart Air Purifier with HEPA Filter). Generally speaking the Coway was the most attractive, the Winix the best at cleaning the air and the Winix my least favorite.This Honeywell HPA250B is equally good at air filtering and minimizing noise as any of the other brands (most HEPA filters do a great job right out of the box as filtering the air, and home users would be hard pressed to notice differences without resorting to highly accurate lab tests of air quality). What I really liked though about this Honeywell is the cool usability options that bluetooth connectivity provides. For example you can set the device to turn on when you arrive home - it picks up the presence of your phone and turns on. That sort of energy efficiency would be a great addition to inexpensive window-mounted air conditioners and hope to see it soon.You can also turn it on and off manually via bluetooth, tweak speed settings, etc. The iPhone app was as simple an install as any other app, and pairing via bluetooth was bulletproof.If you are in the market for a small room air filter that will offer you great user-centered controls, this is the right one for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EUF7ZNIR8UBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LG8BQAI#wasThisHelpful","R2EUF7ZNIR8UBG","A4IL0CLL27Q33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IL0CLL27Q33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use this fan at work in a large room - 14' x 21' - and it is ok at moving air through the space buy really shines as a personal fan for those folks who run hotter than average. This is an upgrade from a different Vornado fan - a larger, gray, plastic fan - and I have been very happy with the changeover for the following reasons:1 - Aesthetics - this fan looks great. The fire engine red is a nice accent color for the room. It's a good looking, retro, design that will make a great addition to any room where you need a splash of good design.2 - It's solid: The metal construction is sturdy but still light weight.

"I have previously purchased other balance pads to both help with rehab after a bad ankle injury last year, and for use with my standing desk. In reviewing this pad I will compare it to the Airex Balance Pad Blue and Yes4All Balance Pad.First, there are two price points, with the Yes4All pad being about half the price of the Airex and SPRI pads. Is there a difference between them? Yes - the Yes4All feels different. It provides less instability, compresses a bit more and seems to be standing up less well to wear and tear, though by no means is it bad. It is simply designed as a more budget conscious alternative and will work well for most people.Comparing the SPRI to the Airex there are a couple of differences. First, the SPRI is a little but smaller (15.75"" L x 13"" W x 2.5"" Thick) than the Airex (19.5"" L x 16"" W x 2.5"" Thick). For physical therapy purposes this is not an issue. I do notice however that the larger size of the Airex makes it a bit better when I am using it with my standing desk. The Yes4All is closer in size to the Airex, coming in at 19"" x 15"" x 2.5"".These is also a slight difference in compression, with the Airex compressing slightly more. This wouldn't be noticeable unless you are comparing them side by side. One doesn't seem meaningfully different than the other.Where the SPRI seems to excel is in the printed instructions that ship with it, as well as with some of the online information they provide. The Yes4All provides practically no info, and the Airex has limited info in the box.Overall I would probably recommend the Airex because it is a little larger and performs essentially at the same level as the SPRI. That is not to say though that the SPRI is an inferior product. In fact, if you are purchasing a pad to help with physical therapy and haven't had sessions with a physical therapist where you learned how to use it, I would probably recommend the SPRI.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19SNWUD21P3ED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LY9L3Q6#wasThisHelpful","R19SNWUD21P3ED","A4IL0CLL27Q33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IL0CLL27Q33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

These will go best with clothes that have their own straight lines and edges.Overall they are much nicer than many of the standard Turquoise jewelry that you will find at low end jewelry shops.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J6N4AKKQO9YR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S4HBM4E#wasThisHelpful","R2J6N4AKKQO9YR","A4IL0CLL27Q33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IL0CLL27Q33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great preparation for my pilgrimage next year. It is the English translation of the famous travel guide written by Miyazaki Tateki. It is divided into two sections. The first deals with the practicalities of the trip:Chapter 1: TimeChapter 2: Number Of Days RequiredChapter 3: Preparing For The TripChapter 4: How much will this cost?Chapter 5: How To PlanChapter 6: Pilgrimage Goods and Things To Pay Attention ToChapter 7: Recommended equipmentChapter 8: The Weight Of The Gear (light is good, waterproof is good)Chapter 9: Pre-Departure Preparations (lose weight, practice walking and get yourself ready to go)Chapter 10: Money (finding ATM's isn't always as easy in rural Japan as you might think)Chapter 11: Making ReservationsChapter 12: Manners/Customs At The Sacred SitesChapter 13: Do's and Don'ts Of A PilgrimChapter 14: How To Walk The Pilgrim PathChapter 15: Sleeping Outside (I don't plan on doing it)Chapter 16: About TakuhatsuChapter 17: Waterfall Training (fun read)Chapter 18: Going Home — The End Of The TrainingAppendix 1: Chart Of Time/Distance Between TemplesAppendix 2: Weight Of Gear - note that this is an estimate only and your options will vary. Light is expensive...The second section contains information about the 238 sacred sites along the way. You are not going to get tons of detail on each site but you will get enough to tell you what you are looking at, basic history and the deities who the temples are dedicated to.My plan is to carry this book on the trip in Kindle form on my Iphone so that I have easy reference to the charts and temple info.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L8J5A08C6ZAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LIVUOXI#wasThisHelpful","R2L8J5A08C6ZAR","A4IL0CLL27Q33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IL0CLL27Q33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been drinking Nespresso for more than 10 years and I am a hard core user. I have tried all sorts of Nespresso machines and capsules and have indoctrinated others into the clan. While I don't dislike the taste of these capsules from Puroast I have three problems with them:1 - At $1.29 per capsule they cost much more than capsules purchased through Nespresso or for other brands sold through Amazon. Examples include Aldecoa Nespresso Coffee Capsules, Intense, 10 Count (Pack of 4) which I found to be VERY tasty at half the price of these capsules.2 - Unlike standard Nespresso capsules these pods must be kept in an airtight pouch in order to stay fresh. If you drink espresso on a daily basis this will probably not be a big deal. Just keep in mind that there is a shelf life once you open the foil bag.3 - If you are going to pay double the price of other brands of pods, you would expect a significantly better taste or other benefit. The taste is no better than competitors, and a bit on the weak side for me. To be fair Puroast does indicate that they have less acid than ""other leading coffees"" but I don't notice any difference between it and pods from Nespresso or Aldecoa. Perhaps they are comparing it to Maxwell House or other commercial brand - they don't specify which brands they are comparing themselves to and I don't feel obliged to make their argument for them.The bottom line is that these pods make perfectly acceptable, though weak, espresso in your Nespresso machines but they charge twice the price of other, equally good or better pods from Nespresso and other companies.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RELSJJYQLP9SM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5M2PEY#wasThisHelpful","RELSJJYQLP9SM","A4IL0CLL27Q33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IL0CLL27Q33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know what you're thinking - it's a french press with most of the plunger's shaft removed. That's not an incorrect description BUT this small change makes for a pitcher that is very good for infusing water, iced tea and other drinks. A couple of characteristics that merit your attention:1 - This pitcher looks VERY nice on a table. The ratio of height to width makes is aesthetically pleasing and the pitcher shows off your creations.2 - The plunger does a very good job of filtering out most solids that you are using to infuse in to the water. We tried herbs, thinly sliced fruit and vegetables as well as toasted rice and none of those solids made it through and into the cups.It's a single-purpose item and I usually am not a fan of that sort of thing.

"The photos of the Lenox Winter Greetings Plaid 5 Piece Place Setting do not do the set justice.  In order to appreciate the subtle beauty of this product one must be able to touch and admire each piece.  The glint of gold trim picks up the light and is certainly not reflected in the photographs on the item page.  The trim seems larger on the photo when in reality it is sophisticated and more intense, the tones darker rather than the orang-y red that is depicted here and of course, references the holiday season.  This set is so lovely that it can be used throughout the winter season as the name suggests and not only as a Christmas novelty.  Even more importantly, for those of an Outlander persuasion, these dishes have a distinctly Scottish plaid design which just might be the thing to serve your personal Jamie Fraser! Check out the photo with Blackjack Randall served up for dessert!The set consists of a cup and saucer, a butter plate, a salad plate and a dinner plate.  All are of the legendary Lenox quality that brides and anyone setting up a new house always coveted and touted as ""the good china.""  One look at this set will tell you why Lenox has been the standard for so many generations.Bottom line?  Recommended.

"Fodor's Paris 2016 Full-Color Travel Guide doesn't recommend activities that aren't worth doing; everything in this 400+ page book is geared towards the Parisian enthusiast.  It accommodates both first time visitors to the City of Lights and the frequent traveler.Like many travel guides, the Fodor's breaks its book down by devoting chapters to individual locales in the city.  But this guide includes several pages on the places themselves as well as the area's top attractions.  For example: In ""The Islands"" segment, we are treated to a detailed map and the top reasons to go to the area at-a-glance--in this case, Notre Dame, Sainte-Chappelle and the ability to stroll along the oldest portion of the city.  The best cafes are noted: La Charlotte de l'isle and Le Saint Regis.  A discourse on ice cream versus gelato is offered as famous shoppes, Amorino (gelato) and Berthillon (Ice Cream) are both located on the Ile Saint Louis.  The rest of the sections pages are devoted to fleshing out the at-a-glance features, stipulating family oriented activities and pointing out less obscure curiosities. Notre-Dame has its own section, complete with photos and times where the spectacular windows are shown in their best light.Each attraction is afforded the same thoughtful treatment which will allow travelers to create an itinerary that brings the Paris to them from the best perspective--almost like a personal guide. The rest of the book has indexed portions that detail places to eat, places to stay, places to shop, places to enjoy the nightlife, places to enjoy performing arts and includes side trips from Paris to Versailles, Chartres and Disneyland.  There are a few pages dedicated to the language and traveling smart which are quite good as they include local taboos and cultural no-nos.  Best of all is a fabulous fold out map that details main tourist attractions.  Well thought out!Bottom Line?  The Fodor's Paris 2016 Travel Guide provides an updated summary of attractions and suggested itineraries for anyone interested in journeying to Paris.  Detailed and thoughtful, it is almost as good as having a personal guide.

"""Bitter Greens"" by Kate Forsyth details the story of Charlotte-Rose de Caumont de la Force, the French storyteller who is best known for her story Perinette--or Little Parsley which became widespread under the more familiar title, Rapunzel.  Forsyth does a fine job of crafting a woman of great emotions and passions who must tread softly as a Huguenot in the Roman Catholic court of the Sun King, Louis XIV.  Her story begins rather depressingly as the heroine is remanded to a convent by order of the king and must sacrifice her lovely clothes, her freedom and all her other privileges due to her scandalous behavior.  Forsyth's depiction of the convent, its cruelties and hypocritical women is balanced only by Charlotte-Rose's narrative of her former life and her dreams for her future.Some readers may become lost as Charlotte-Rose flips from one part of her life to another in an order not always chronological.  Nevertheless Forsyth's magnificent handling of her character proves her mettle as a writer who can not only depict the times and circumstances of 17th century France but can build a character of great nuance and power.As with all good stories, there is a lesson to be learned.  While in the convent, Charlotte-Rose learns a bit about humility when she comes in contact with an older sister who entertains her with a version of the Rapunzel story that reveals a great truth.  This fairy tale is encrusted with pain, vanity and passion like the original version of Rapunzel that was included in the original collection of the Brothers Grimm and criticized for its inappropriateness for children. The nun's tale is woven within Charlotte-Rose's own story which makes for an entertaining and suspenseful break from the dreary life at the convent.Forsyth's language and narrative is extremely well-done.  I listened to the unabridged audio version of this novel and was pleased by the performance by Kate Reading.  If you are a fan of Forsyth's you might recognize some of her descriptions and scenarios from other novels, but even if this can become repetitious, it does not detract from the overall enjoyment of the tale.Bottom line?  Kate Forsyth's ""Bitter Greens"" is recommended to all those who enjoy a detailed adult version of a popular fairy tale--in this case the beloved story of ""Rapunzel.""  For those who are gentle readers, Forsyth does not pull any punches--her tortures, punishments and sorrows are very much on point.

"As a big fan of the original Millennium trilogy starring Lisbeth Salander, I was thrilled to discover that David Lagercrantz had picked up the torch and renewed the spirit of this great character originally created by Stieg Larsson in a new fourth novel entitled ""The Girl in the Spider's Web.""  Now Lagercrantz did have big shoes to fill and it is a tribute to his self-confidence that he even picked up this endeavor in view of what fans around the world would inevitably have to say.  Let's face it, no one is going to be absolutely thrilled with another author's perception of this character.  Only Larsson with his ins and outs, side stories and secondary characters knew where he wanted all these players to end up.  I, for one, am pleased to hear Lisbeth's thoughts again; I was doubly pleased to have her interact with such sensitivity to an autistic boy who has been misread and misdiagnosed in the pages of Lagercrantz's first offering.  I was equally thrilled that her relationship with Blomkvist continues from a problem-solving vantage point but also from a personal perspective where she not only gets to show her technical savvy but a sensitivity that hasn't been dulled by life's harsh treatment of her.  Lagercrantz writes in the same circuitous style as Larsson--perhaps the translation from Swedish to English helps truncate thoughts without much literary styling--but somehow that works to create the quirky dark world of these characters and to underscore the terrors that lie in wait in Larsson/Lagercrantz's depiction of progressive Sweden.Bottom line?  I liked it!  I look forward to another episode where Blomkvist and Salander continue their relationship and uncover more secrets.  Hopefully this series will continue to explore Lisbeth's psyche as she tries to put her rugged past behind her.  Recommended for all Salander fans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3998L6E14FSAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TCI0P3I#wasThisHelpful","R3998L6E14FSAX","A1JV4QKTEB7QBL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JV4QKTEB7QBL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I recently hurt my knee, the Fitoby Knee Support Sleeve came in very handy.  I must admit that it helped me to ease back onto the road to recovery.  Having never used any type of support during my training, I was extremely surprised at how efficiently this extremely easy to wear sleeve worked to help soothe my hurt muscles.  While wearing this compression sleeve, I was able to work out hurt muscles that otherwise cramped and hurt me to the point of sleepless nights.  After wearing this sleeve one afternoon in conjunction with some magnesium lotion, I was happy to sleep the night and felt good enough the next day to press onward towards recovery with more exercises that stretched out my tight muscles.  Knee pain is awful; avoiding using muscles that are conditioned to be used only tightens the pain into a coil of hurt.  I alternated this heavier sleeve with a less expensive and thinner Copper Fit Sleeve.  (http://www.amazon.com/Copper-Fit-Original-Recovery-Sleeve/dp/B00PNY3DS4/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1445132654&sr=8-4&keywords=copper+sleeve+for+knee.)  I live in Louisiana where the Fitoby gets a little sticky to wear all the time.  Both sleeves acted as miracle cures for me, turning the tide from pain to wellbeing.  Recommended but watch your fit on this--where the Copper Fit is more elastic you may be able to gamble between small and medium.

"The Yellow Plated Sterling Silver Multi Gem Necklace looks pretty much like the photo except for one extremely important difference:  the gem studded portion of the necklace only extends to about 1.5 inches on either side of the dropped portion.  The drop is about the same length as the two sides.  The rest of the necklace consists of a fairly thin chain that could very well break easily if care is not given--no yanking or rough handling as this piece will definitely end up in the trash as unwearable.  Instead of the thin link chain, this necklace would have been better serviced with an anchor, Byzantine or wheat chain that would have added some heft to the part of the necklace that is most apt to snap!  The clasp and links are so fragile, I hesitate to wear it!  The stones are as specified: Amethyst, Citrine, Garnet, Peridot, Topaz.  The gold setting offsets the color of the gemstones, dulling them against the gold plating.  Perhaps these would have looked more vibrant in a strictly silver setting.  The original pricing on this is absolutely ridiculous--in fact even at the current price, this necklace is a bit pricey mostly because of the weak chain and fastening.  Nevertheless, it is pretty and looks especially nice when showcased within  additional graduated chains without pendants.

"The Carhartt Women's 1889 Slim Fit Denim Dungaree fit as one would expect from a slim type jean.  Luckily, I am not exactly tall, so after I cut the length the tighter portion of the leg did allow me to fit these over boots--however, I would think that for those who do not need length alteration, these may be a little snug around the ankles and may not accommodate the added bulk of higher shoes or work boots.  The material is stretchy--hooray--the cut higher on the waist--double hooray--I am so tired of zippers that are only three inches long on below the waistline hip-hugging jeans!  The color is superb--there is a slight whiskering on the crotch area which I prefer.  The pockets are not exactly functional--the two top ones are shallow and the long fronts are not pockets at all but a decorative double fabric that I suppose would work to one's advantage if actually using these jeans as functional workhorses.  As to whether or not these will work as farm jeans, I cannot say; I liked the style, will not be mucking about in them and because of this, I do expect them to last a while without a show of wear.

"SoTru Fermented Medicinal Mushrooms is a powdered product that combines the properties of six types of medicinally used mushrooms with a citrus taste to produce a reasonably palatable drink that takes second to make.Eight ounces of water plus a level scoop of the product (the scoop is provided) into my Nutribullet and seconds later, the drink is emulsified and ready to drink.  Don't be dissuaded by the color of the product--its a pale brown so the mixture looks a bit silty.  If you are expecting an earthy mushroom-y flavor, you will be in for a surprise.  The main taste note one detects is a citrus lemon. although the supplement does include acerola cherry, green tea leaf and ginger root.I took this supplement after exercise and was pleased that it refreshed me and did not cause bloating or any other adverse effect. I have not experienced any digestive disturbance with it, but I have noticed a bit of an energy increase and hunger decrease.  I am not a coffee drinker and limit my green tea intake to morning hours only, so this brings with it a nice boost of energy in the early afternoon.The container contains about a month's worth of daily servings.  Considering how much specialty mushrooms cost, the price is understandable at just below $40.  I cannot attribute to its immunity-building power as of yet; but it seems a good idea to counteract the effects of back-to-school germs and transitioning weather.

" 0:12 Mins The Iron Stop KWS100 Butterfly Kinetic Wind Spinner is a little pricey--but it is absolutely delightful.  It is a snap to set up: simply screw in the middle tube to the Spinner portion and then open the screw all the way on the portion designed to anchor into the ground, slide the tube in and secure by replacing the screw,  I used my foot and weight to step the bar into the ground and my hands to tilt it in a pleasing direction.The butterflies can be angled to catch the wind and create a more three-dimensional piece.  However for those who like the cylindrical look that comes straight out of the box. this works, too and is just as pretty.  In fact, my original idea was to put this in my front yard, but it is so strikingly pretty, I think it will tempt many to transgression!  In the back yard it went, making a very appealing focal point.Bottom line? This Wind Spinner will definitely appeal to all ages; the painted butterflies shimmer with dimension, giving it a one-of-a-kind appearance rather than a mass produced item.  Colorful and appealing!  Check out the video to see it in action--and this without bending the butterfly wings to better catch the wind!Diana Faillace Von Behren""Buzzard's Eye View""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E0D6BLLRF2TK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CUOKNS#wasThisHelpful","R2E0D6BLLRF2TK","A1JV4QKTEB7QBL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JV4QKTEB7QBL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Paula Brackston's ""Lamp Black, Wolf Grey"" starts out with promise and then dissolves into the mists of the Welsh countryside that stands as a backdrop to this tale of Merlin and the lasting power of storytelling. Brackston, an author popular for her novels revolving around magic and witches, tries to underscore the importance of keeping legends alive while writing an under-whelming plot that fails to be memorable.Laura, a modern day artist, moves from London with her husband Dan to the rural Welsh countryside where she intends to indulge in her artwork while fulfilling the couple's dream to conceive a child. Instead she meets up with the reclusive Rhys--a passionate soul who immediately mesmerizes her into infidelity.In a parallel story, Megan from the time of King Arthur, meets Merlin the Magician--Brackston's Merlin is of the Pierce Brosnan variety--dark haired and blue-eyed--no long white beards or sorcerer's apprentice robes for him--and falls in love awhile acting as a nanny of the lord of the manor's two children.  Politics abound and sadly, roadblocks are put in the way of Megan and Merlin's love.Brackston pulls the reader into the story initially but fails to develop any of her characters--all are stereotypical at best.  Where she succeeds is creating the Welsh landscape--a place of dreamy unreality where magical things can happen.  Brackston wields her magic, but this, too, is ineffective; the story flails.plunging into trope as both Megan and Laura's hearts move in directions that lead then to their eventual and very predictable fates.Appearing in both story lines is Merlin--Brackston's portrait seems off as one would think the clever magician would employ more wily devices to charm and control his hosts and enemies. Instead, Brackston depicts the wizard as a man with a not-so-clever tongue, defying the local nobility in alliances that do not make much sense and are never fully explained.Laura in particular seems a babe in the woods--her ability to step into dangerously foolish situations is part of her characterization, but Brackston's unraveling of the mysteries in her plot line render her unsatisfying at the very least.  On the other hand, Megan is a fairy tale heroine who gives her all with maidenly virtue even in the darkest moments.  This too is not fulfilling in terms of the story.The story ends with an lengthy epilogue that summarizes the characters outcomes.  There is little emotion or reaction, just relief when the last page is finally reached.Bottom line?  I recommend Lamp Black, Wolf Grey only for its atmosphere.  The story line while initially compelling fades into stereotypes and contrivances that quickly become boring and disappointing especially for those who want to see Merlin in a more faceted light.Diana Faillace Von Behren""Buzzard's Eye View""B","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39QZO3QBWTKSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1906727481#wasThisHelpful","R39QZO3QBWTKSF","A1JV4QKTEB7QBL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JV4QKTEB7QBL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agreed to review the South Shore Callesto 4-drawer Chest because of a conversation I had with my cousin who is in the process of setting up her new condo after living in a five-bedroom house for most of her life.  My cousin has a knack for fastidiousness; there is nary a paper or pen floating around her abode without a proper place.  With this in mind, I viewed the haphazard stack of mail that usurps nearly a quarter of my kitchen countertop and decided that this white chest of drawers would be just the thing to hide the mess while providing extra storage.The chest is IKEA quality, although, I must admit, that when the product was delivered to my door, I was not expecting such a heavy item and would have insisted that the carrier at least pop it through my door.  It took me several minutes to figure out a way to get that box into my house--so those who live alone: take heed--this item is extremely heavy.  It took me several hours to assemble this--the weight alone daunting to negotiate and the instructions . . . .well after carrying the box into the house, I suggest several minutes of recuperation time to at least regain some semblance of patience to be at a point where interpreting them was doable.  My main problem with the assembly was alignment: the holes did not always match--definitely presenting a strain on my desire to just get the job done.  Most definitely two people are required for assembly--especially for those like myself who do not attempt such endeavors more than once a year.The result is a satisfying chest of drawers that fits nicely in its designated niche.  It is constructed of particle board--so I would not expect this to function in anyway other than storage.  I would not place heavy items on its surface as there will definitely be a limit to its holding capacity.  It would work nicely as clothes storage and for my purpose of paper filing, it does an adequate job of hiding a daily mess.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VC8VN22BW1BX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZBA3UI8#wasThisHelpful","R2VC8VN22BW1BX","A1JV4QKTEB7QBL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JV4QKTEB7QBL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Zwilling J. A Henckels Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer makes a bit of an odd impression at first glance.  Packaged within a small plastic box, the device resembles something that an Inquisitor may have used to force confessions from penitents.  However, the mechanism works, requiring the user to merely press the head of the device into the nostril and press the levers to create a rotating scissoring effect.  An accompanying brush helps to clean lodged hairs.I had no problem using the trimmer and was pleased with the results.  Some reviewers claim that the trim isn't close enough; I do not adhere to this opinion.  The Zwilling trimmer is compact and travels well; it provides a quick, painless groom.  For those a bit more fastidious in nature or those who have become reliant upon battery-operated trimmers, I recommend the Zwilling nose and ear hair scissors: Zwilling J.A.

"Valerio Massimo Manfredi's ""Odysseus: The Oath"" means well.  Trying to emulate the work of Mary Renault, it starts out with a bang, depicting the life of the young Odysseus in a compelling first person voice that allows the reader into his mindset as he combats obstacles of his heritage and his obligation.  Unfortunately, once Odysseus ships off with the other Achaeans on their mission to claim runaway Helen of Troy. Manfredi's narrative becomes almost boring despite his retelling of the Trojan war from the perspective of the wily hero who designed the first Trojan Horse.Manfredi's novel ends as Troy is razed to the ground.  Part Two covers Odysseus's long journey home.  I doubt I will read this second installment as the recount of the Illiad was not all that exciting.  Manfredi would have been better off concentrating on his character's ties to Ithaca--his grandfather, the wolf man, his mother's cryptic role as well as his relationship with his father Laertes and his wondrous alliance with the goddess Athena.  The retelling of the Trojan war, sadly does him in; it fails to include the depth of characterization at which the earlier part of the novel hints.Bottom line?  ""Odysseus: The Oath"" is a retelling of the Greek hero's earlier life up until the point in time when the city of Troy tumbles at the hands of the Achaeans.  Manfredi gives the impression of wily older Odysseus but does not succeed in convincing the reader in a way that engages him/her in the day to day trial of sustaining a war involving a thousand ships and a beautiful trophy wife.

The Oxidized look gives the piece a darker appearance which emphasizes the intricate design of the Celtic knot.

"Melanie Benjamin's ""The Swans of Fifth Avenue"" depicts an era in New York City history when Truman Capote was the darling of the social set and chose the women that hung around him for their beauty and status.  Benjamin bases her story on truth, but elaborates certain instances for the purpose of further dramatization; her portrait of the quirky self-indulgent flawed Truman Capote seems to be spot on--his tragedy perfectly spins out to its rather desultory ending.  Whether or not Benjamin is crafting a moral fable as to the repercussions of egoism or warning future writers to honor the confidentiality of their friends' stories or simply recreating an era that obviously fascinated a Mid-Western girl in love with the idea of New York and all things ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" must be taken into account during this fascinating read.The author spotlights each of Capote's 'swans' with stories most likely garnered from Capote's stories or items collected from the gossip columns; she underlines the 'trophy wife' concept so prevalent in the mindset of these women and almost plagues the reader with the sadness of such beauties getting old and falling out of popularity.  She focuses on Capote's relationship with Babe Paley--depicting this society grand dame as a sad woman desperate for love.  Benjamin's  Capote is the Capote of the film staring Phillip Seymour Hoffman--a man obsessed with telling a story to gain celebrity and falling into the trap of becoming the ultimate user--where the story means more than the people--and the negative reactions mean more publicity.  As in the film, underneath it all is the failure to be accepted; the desire to be loved and admired.  Ultimately, the single-minded excuses result in self-destruction, especially after Capote reaches his pinnacle after the publishing of ""In Cold Blood.""While all that is entertaining, the overall tone of the novel is bleak and may not appeal to readers who may want something more uplifting.  Its written well, and Benjamin does a fine job with her portrayals but ultimately when she urges the reader to find out more about this era in celebrity history, I must ask, 'What for?""  The entire novel is populated with superficial people who care more about facade than life itself.  Ugh.Bottom line?  ""The Swans of Fifth Avenue"" is well-written and well-researched.

"It takes a while for the reader to get passed the fact that none of the narrators in Paula Hawkins, ""The Girl on the Train"" are likeable reliable narrators.  All three of them have problems, their commonality a residential street of houses that backs the train going in and out of London each day.  As all three narrators get their turn to tell their story, the reader pieces together that they are connected in even more intricate ways.

Her mystery revolves around need.  I listened to the unabridged audio presentation of this book; the performance gets high marks for theatricality and poignancy.  The narrators all have their flaws--there are no super human stereotypes here; together their voices pull together to find a light at the end of a dark tunnel at their own expense.Bottom line?

"I only read the first book in the Fifty Shades Trilogy; perhaps, because of this fact, I can afford to be a little less critical about ""Grey,"" E.L. James fourth Fifty Shades offering--which as a retelling of the first of the Fifty Shades books from the perspective of Christian Grey, can be redundant for readers who have overindulged in the series or the film.  I have not seen the film, but I found the compelling image of Jamie Dornan as the lead feeding into my thoughts as I read ""Grey.""  Getting into the mindset of James' character has its perks and if the reader can get over the character's muttering to himself, describing Miss Steele's anatomy as if she is the first woman he ever saw, and some details to his business life that have little relevance to the story other than the fact that it fuels his large bank account, it could work from an amusement standpoint.  That's not to say that there is some poignancy to James' work, but let's face it, the fact that her books have garnered millions for her, gives her more than one capitalistic option to wallow amongst the greenbacks she continues to accrue within this franchise.  (She should come out with a Fifty Shades Braided flogger . . . )  If people will buy another trilogy from Grey's perspective, why not?  Why wouldn't she write it? And there is something fascinating about already knowing where such a character is going even before he does.  Listening to his voice and hearing his expectations and first hand reactions regarding scenes and events of which the reader is already aware adds anticipation to the story and more nuance to the Grey character.  Perhaps, James started her series off on the wrong foot; Anastasia Steele, all innocence and burgeoning kink, is not all that exciting; however, Grey is a memorable character--he's flawed and readers want to know what he thinks and what he's going to come up with next.  I don't know if he is ever ""tamed,"" if that's the case, James makes a mistake in throwing cold water over a hot blanket.Bottom line: If you liked Christian Grey as a character, you might find ""Grey"" a fun read.

The long adjustable arm where the light sits is easy to swing over my computer screen, so that when a lamp is necessary, one poke on the pyramid shape provides me with just the lighting that I need.  The light is bright and clean and will last for years, but I doubt that when it burns out, it can be replaced.

"Ben McPherson's ""A Line of Blood"" is a thriller that those who enjoyed the Australian television series ""Secrets and Lies"" will find of interest.  The theme of secrets within the bonds of family motivates protective overlooking as each member of the Mercer family--Alex, his wife, Millicent and his son, Max try to come to terms with the gruesome death of the neighbor next door.  Concerned at first by the trauma young Max (eleven-years-old) has sustained at the sight of the neighbor dead in his bath tub during a routine search for the Mercer family cat, Alex must deal with the police investigations as well as some hard-to-face feelings of alienation regarding his wife and feelings that he has a difficult time suppressing that go back to a dark youth with a suspect father.  McPherson works hard to sustain a twist and turn narrative; he succeeds at times, but then fails in instances where Alex's narrative becomes murky or segues into new information too quickly to be absorbed smoothly by the reader.  All in all, the novel entertains in a painful cynical manner that eventually reveals the truth before the author's reveal.Alex's first person voice is tentative and emotionally stifled by his negative view of the world.  He is a man at odds with himself and what he looks at as convention.  Does he believe in love? Does he believe in family? Or is he just someone with selfish motives?  Someone who has never grown up?  This sense of angst prevails through Alex's story--throughout his puzzling out of events that will forever change his life.  He's a confused protagonist that signifies the edgy mistrusting persona of our modern world.  From a reader's perspective,  he comes across as befuddled and off-center.  Unlikeable but capable of eliciting compassion.Bottom line?

"Tess Gerritsen's novel, ""Playing with Fire,"" starts out like a typical thriller.  Second violinist and first person narrator, Julia, discovers a piece of music in an old book in an antiquarian shop in Rome; intrigued she purchases the book and returns to her Boston home.  She can hear the music in her head, but when she actually attempts to play the piece on her instrument, its frantic crescendo has a violent effect on her three-year-old daughter.  Julia is convinced that the music is diabolical in some way and she catapults into a frenzied investigation to find out why and how.  As in all such stories, Gerritsen relies upon another voice explaining the history of the artifact from the perspective of an earlier time; she journeys the reader to the Venice of the 1930s where a young violinist dreams of winning a competition with his partner, a beautiful young cellist.  Lorenzo's POV is presented as a third person voice; his love of music, his family and of his home evident in his fervor.  Inevitably, the two stories coincide to offer the reader an entertaining, albeit mournful story of love, music and loss.Gerriitsen, of Rizzoli and Isles fame writes in voices that are easily followed and leave little speculation.  Her storyline is straightforward and quickly gets to the point, leading the reader into the horrors of the second World War.  While her ending seems a bit abrupt--there are so many things going on that are rectified in a few short chapters, the overall impact of the story becomes less about the paranormal aspect of the music as originally intended and more about the infinite horrors perpetrated on humanity.  Gerritsen quickly weaves a tale of hope that is smashed by the thriving of power.  Some readers expecting more supernatural effects will most likely be disappointed no matter how poignant Gerritsen's outcome.  In particular her segment about secondary character Laura seems contrived and ill-developed. In fact, instead of focusing on Lorenzo, the historical voice should have been Laura's--the impact of her discovery would have been far more illuminating, adding to rather than truncating the drama.Bottom line?  Tess Gerritsen's ""Playing with Fire"" will provide a good day's read; her prose flows as does the story.  However, for those intrigued by the cover blurb promising paranormal effects and long ago mysteries, be prepared--all will be resolved but not to your liking.

"The historical story of Cleopatra and her vying for power has graced the pages of literature for centuries.  The life of this last of the Pharaohs is wrought with so much drama--and this without the inclusion of Julius Caesar or Mark Antony.  Cleopatra's play for power and the skirmish between all the Ptolemy siblings is hinted in Emily Holleman's novel, ""Cleopatra's Shadows""--a prequel to Ptolemaic struggles to come as Rome intercedes.  Unfortunately, the two first person voices of lesser sisters Berenice (77-55 BC) and Arsinoe (65 or 58-41 BC) in this pre-history lack a vivaciousness that flattens the reader's interest rather than entices it.  At times  the Wikipedia articles about the sisters and other relevant reports regarding Arsinoe's bones are far more exciting.Machinations abound once sister Cleopatra leaves Alexandria; eight-year-old Arsinoe finds herself a virtual prisoner of her older sister Berenice who has crowned herself the new Pharaoh queen. Defying her angry and vengeful mother Trypgaena (the sister of Ptolemy her father), Berenice allows Arsinoe to live; Holleman's depiction of Berenice has her thirsting for autonomy in a world of distrust but doesn't provide enough examples of her fear to allow the reader to commiserate emotionally.Likewise, sister Arsinoe lives with the threat of death over her head yet her technique for survival is less obvious; she uses her mind to craft a subtle and brutal game of chess which serves her well.  Ultimately, one of the sisters will conquer the other and then?  A force from Rome will appear to reclaim power--but that is for a later novel.""Cleopatra's Shadows"" takes the reader up to the point in this last Egyptian dynasty's history where one of the sisters is executed which leads this reviewer to speculate as to whether or not Holleman will craft another novel or perhaps complete a trilogy that will finally end in Ephesus.As compelling as the history of Cleopatra and her siblings is, Holleman's novel lacks a personal touch that most great historical novels must include.  As I read Arsinoe and Berenice's thoughts, I sadly did not connect with either of them, rendering their machinations a drudgery and their  futures insignificant to me.  While Holleman succeeds in crafting a feel for a reader's ancient Egypt, her inability to capture the souls of the two girls catalogs this novel as ineffective; sadly her usage of modern expletives doesn't quite fit with the time or locale.Bottom line?  ""Cleopatra's Shadows"" by Emily Holleman tries to be a good first historical novel--perhaps the first in a trilogy of Ptolemaic intrigues.  Unfortunately, the author fails to create characters that are vital enough for the reader to follow faithfully into the her next offerings.  Key features of likeability and empathy are sadly missing.

"Having read Beatriz Williams' novel ""The Secret Life of Violet Grant"" and liking only the historical portion of the story, I was prepared to have a similar reaction to ""Along the Infinite Sea""--another novel in Williams' Schuyler sisters trilogy.  I did; Williams' insistence to frame her historical story from the perspective of one of her aristocratic 1960s sisters detracts rather than enhances the beauty of her main plot.Pepper Schuyler, like her sibling, Vivian, is vain, spoiled and promiscuous.  After an affair with an unknown Washington senator from a prominent Democratic family--any guesses as to the identity of this political tribe are deliberately left unconfirmed by the author--Pepper finds herself pregnant and forlorn.  In a whirlwind of serendipity she finds herself practically kidnapped by a woman of her mother's era, a famous cellist, Annabelle Dommerich.  It is Annabelle's story, told in the first person, in alternate chapters, that holds the reader's attention--it sparks with love, romance, intrigue, duty, and adventure.  Pepper serves as a foil to a newer age, where women are not quite as cataloged in their roles as adjuncts to their men.Annabelle, with her innocent optimism, details her story with precision, rattling off the names of luxurious places and providing views of lifestyles most readers would deem aristocratic to lend a fairy tale quality to the tale. The reader likes her instantly--wanting her to get her happy ending, rooting for her as the story moves from Monte Carlo to Paris to Berlin and finally to America during the days before the second World War.  Caught between two men, Annabelle must make difficult decisions; she does so with great bravery and always with a gracious panache worthy of a Grace Kelly or Audrey Hepburn.  At times the scenario depicted lacks credibility--but as the plot winds and turns and as Williams' story is a fiction, must be accepted with a few grains of salt that would make a wonderfully exciting film.The ending of Annabelle's story immensely satisfies enough to rate five stars; Pepper's not so much--detracting the overall review by one star.Bottom line?  ""Along the Infinite Sea"" with the subtraction of the Pepper Schuyler frame is a wonderful story of love and bravery during the years just prior to WW2.  Anyone who enjoys reading a historical novel driven by the love of two--no, three people will surely find this entertaining.

"At first, Helen Phillips' novel, ""The Beautiful Bureaucrat"" has the feel of the 2002 Steven Shainberg film ""Secretary"" starring James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal where the sterile backdrop of the office space creates the perfect foil for the two lead film characters', ahem, antics.  Relax. ""Bureaucrat"" is not that kind of story; it borders on another type of universe--a dystopia where paperwork is paramount and drone-like workers juice their bloodshot eyes in order to insure that their rate of processing meets the office standard.  A la Margaret Atwood, Phillips successfully creates a world of drudgery where life is black and white rather than fleshed out in full color. Yet she hints that as in reality, the drones carry out their work, but do not really understand their purpose--they are paid and understanding, ""isn't [their] job.""In prose that emulates the different people we become during the day depending on the circumstance, alternating from stark to colloquial, befitting our roles,  Phillips thrusts her character Josephine into the Office World where her shuffling of paper couldn't be more boring, her interviewer doesn't even have a face and her boss definitely has bad breath. Yikes--the familiar industrialism of what Phillips creates washes over the reader like a coat of that sour pea soup green paint used in every school cafeteria at one time in every lower school in the country. Other characters, in particular, an odd fortune telling waitress and another bubble gum pink clad office drone with a uber-contrived name--Trishiffany--LOL--populate the rest of the novel's pages giving the reader a sense of god-awful reality that as in real life borders on the ludicrous crafting a sad contradiction.  Yet, horror of horrors!  It's real.Slyly, Phillips couches the reader in little word games and manipulates language--snidely suggesting how thoroughly serious we all take ourselves to be the more we become immersed within a contrived arena--devoting our precious lives to becoming building blocks of what? Terror? Our ultimate demise?  More housing? Soylent Green? She comments about the modern world--her ultimate coup de grace reveals sinister machinations of governments and corporations, that who knows?  may not be too far off the mark.Bottom line?  This slim novel by Helen Phillips reads in only a few hours; Phillips conversational tone helps humanize her character and keeps the pages flying.  Short chapters help with this, too--keeping the feel of the novel short and truncated as mechanical as data entry.  She plays with words in the same way that large powerful entities twist and turn humanitarian themes into profits--all is not what it seems--behind the mundane lies the awful truth . . . ""The Beautiful Bureaucrat"" would make a chilling dystopian film along the lines of ""The Handmaiden's Tale.""

"After reading author Lauren Willig's ""That Summer,"" and enjoying the pace of alternating past and present story lines, I quickly pre-ordered ""The Other Daughter"" for another good reading experience.  I was not disappointed.  Although Willig's newest offering isn't as scintillating as ""Summer,"" ""Daughter"" proves to be an adequate summer read.  Utilizing a familiar formula, she includes impersonation, romance and an aristocratic Downton Abbey type family to engender a post-WW1 era tale of a young woman discovering that her middle class family background is nothing but a sham.Lead character and narrator, Rachel represents the typical Willig heroine.  Taking a page out of Victoria Holt's vast body of work, Willig crafts her main girl as a bit prissy, with high expectations and moral guidelines that at times are as tight as a too small girdle. She creates a rift--the wild modern lack of care versus the goody-two-shoes. Like Imogen in ""Summer"" and Addie in ""The Ashford Affair,"" Rachel, a well-brought up woman with armchair spunk, cannot imagine doing anything vaguely outrageous; her spine is too straight.  And yet, like the others, she unbends; finding herself in a situation where she must improvise in order to get what she wants, Rachel conjures up the imaginary personage of Vera Merton with her co-conspirator Simon, cuts her old-fashioned waist-length hair--shades of ""Sabrina"" and barges into the high society with a borrowed wardrobe and a dangling cigarette holder.  Her goal? To meet her father, the Earl of Ardmore, whom she thought dead.Like all novels that are fun, the premise immediately engages the reader.  Who can resist a masquerade?  Will she pull it off?  Will her efforts afford her her heart's desire?  Or will that desire change along with the game?Don't get me wrong--""The Other Daughter"" most definitely is formulaic.  Nonetheless, it entertains even if from the get-go the reader understands the exact structure along with the function and role of each player.  As in such novels, the ending is predictable and because of this fizzles into anonymity.For those expecting a great mystery--the hidden diary read by two present day sleuths a la ""Possession"" by A. S. Byatt, look further.  This is a straight storyline told in the flapper era.  The tension is provided through revelation of self-identity rather than from some quirk of history.  Where ""That Summer"" provided information regarding the Pre-Raphaelite artists which played heavily in the plot outcome, ""Daughter"" relies only on the ""hang-it-all"" mentality of the post WW1 generation, tired of war and the death of so many young men--both from a physical and mental standpoint.Like many writers of this genre, the lead characters have no real differences from one book to the next.  The heroines are all feisty and independent even if they are not independent financially.  The love interests are damaged--in need of saving--and the women are willing to give it a try whether or not they succeed. The only difference is the time period--the players play according to the rules of the time but, in essence--they dance to the same tune and all end up with a perfunctory bow and curtsey under the arch of a rainbow.  Those readers in the mood for this, will find Willig an entertaining albeit trite read.Bottom line?  If you are in the mood for romance from a historical perspective, give Lauren Willig's ""The Other Daughter"" a chance.  The pages will turn even if the ending and the premise is familiar and predictable.

"In her first novel, ""The Book of Speculation,"" Erika Swyla pushes the reader into the deep water off the north coast of Long Island and asks how long he/she can hold his/her breath.  While in that state, time stands still and the utter loneliness of waiting underwater takes effect.  Soundless and weightless and yes, somewhat helpless: this exemplifies the mindset of most of Swyla's major characters as they try to make sense of the life fate has dealt them. Like a tidal wave, Swyla presses the reader into a cold world where the undertow dominates with the determination to conquer.  Swyla's strong theme of family underscores the need for love, understanding and connectivity in order to float through it all.Tragedy lingers in the north shore air on eastern Long Island and is embodied by the 18th century house that erosion and disrepair will eventually decimate.  The remaining Watson family--as represented by first person voice Simon--still reverberates with too much loss; he is powerless in terms of money, influence or even willpower to stop the inevitable in its tracks.  But does he really want to be a savior--or is it all too overwhelming for someone as bitter and entrenched in melancholy as he is?When an antiquarian bookseller sends him a tome dating back to the 1700s--a traveling circus journal kept by a man named Peabody--Simon finds hope and inspiration in the information he gleans from within its pages.  He also discovers something sinister about his family--a odd and dire phenomenon that curses its women to die young--drowned in the sea despite their extraordinary ability to stay underwater for ten minutes. His thoughts turn to his sister, a tarot card reader in another traveling circus--and he knows that he must save her from this fate.  In an alternate storyline, the reader becomes privy to Simon's information source as he learns the history of his family and realizes along with him just what he must do to protect his future.Elements of the paranormal abound and for those readers who enjoy divination with tarot cards, the dueling plot lines will definitely intrigue.  However, this reviewer speculates as to whether or not lead character Simon merely needed a jolt to press him into action.  While I do believe that intentions can become reality, I prefer to look at Simon's findings and solution as figurative--real or unreal, they motivate him to change and get out of his funk.  As the title suggests, they are merely speculations that initiate change.Because of this, I found the ending of this novel convenient and not all that fulfilling. Simon manages to subvert disaster while neutralizing malignancy with a fizzle in spite of the climactic natural events.Swyla writes a good first person narrative from the POV of an upset male character.  Her use of language works well; her passages written in the past have a modern feel yet convey another era.Bottom line?  ""The Book of Speculation"" will entertain on a literary level even if some of the chapters written from the perspective of the past in the third person come across as too convoluted and too divorced from the actual present day story line.  Author Swyla's paranormal elements and quirky sideshow carnival details layer the plot with details that the reader will find amusing to piece together.  After the crescendo of revelation and natural disasters, the ending seems trivial and uninspired even though it most likely is the only logical solution. Keep in mind the title and read with a large grain of salt from the sea.

"""We Never Asked for Wings,"" the new offering by Vanessa Diffenbaugh of ""The Language of Flowers"" successfully and enjoyably depicts a coming-of-age story for troubled Letty Espinosa, a 33-year-old single mother living in California with her two children, 15-year-old Alex and his  younger sister Luna.  Letty's mother and father have always acted as surrogate parents for her two children, allowing her the luxury of more mistakes, but when they decide to return to their Mexican homeland, Letty is left with the hazardous responsibility of Alex and Luna.  Barely capable of taking care of herself, she juggles a job as a bartender at the airport with  an errant motherhood that often results in catastrophe.  Along the way, she discovers a new maturity that fits in with her new identity while her son Alex finds love for the first time and breaks some rules and hearts as he desperately tries to hold onto it.As in ""Language of Flowers,"" Diffenbaugh's prose is interesting; she plays with words with a poetic minimalism that works to move the story along while getting her point across. Her dual theme of a mother and son both facing coming of age simultaneously is an interesting take on single, early and unplanned motherhood.  Her depiction of illegal immigrants reaches out to the heart of the matter: men and women trying their darnedest to inject their families with new life and sustenance. Particularly compelling along this line is her portrayal of Carmen, Yesenia's mother--whose love transcends her tiredness on an extremely sympathetic level.Perhaps the last portion of ""Wings"" glides by like a shanghaied rocket--ricocheting out of control within the realm of the third person narration.  As soon as this reviewer became involved in the everyday lives of these characters, the story catapulted into its crescendo--a little too fast for my liking.  The fact that Letty is caught between two men who have obtained a certain status of identity also does not ring true.  Her character, flawed and selfish, seems an unlikely magnet.Bottom line?  ""We Never Asked for Wings"" by Vanessa Diffenbaugh is a good second novel for those who enjoyed this author's style in ""The Language of Flowers.""  Her plot and narrative immerse the reader into the unfamiliar world of the illegal immigrant; I, for one, would have liked more of a segue into the rushed ending.

"In this second Maisie Dobbs mystery, author Jacqueline Winspear sends her protagonist, the intrepid Maisie Dobbs, investigator and psychologist, into a world where she has little personal experience--that of a coterie of rich finishing school students.  The daughter of a grocery store magnate has gone missing and Maisie is set on the girl's trail, investigating her family background and affiliations to determine the girl's mindset and to discover her probably whereabouts.  What she discovers creates a nuanced backdrop of London after WW1 where the population still mourns an entire generation of men lost on the battlefields of France.The episodic story enables Winspear to expand her character's development and to facilitate healing from the perspective of understanding her own loss during the war and the impact that it has on her current life. Secondary characters Billy Beal, Frankie Dobbs, Inspector Stratton, Maurice Blanchard, Lady Rohan and a new character, Andrew Deen impress the reader with their quirky personalities and the balance they add to the mix.  Maisie's meditative technique helps her to fit into the shoes of her clients; her persistence and earnestness earns her likeability.  As Maisie moves out of the fog of WW1, she gains insight into herself that the reader understands will eventually  help her love anew and find added purpose with each new adventure.Winspear has a wonderful way of allowing the reader a glimpse into a different time period; she details dress with fine precision and spends much time describing the cars, accents and entertainments that filled 1920s life, rendering a three-dimensional portrait of the era.Bottom line?  This second installment in the Maisie Dobbs series is just the thing for any one-time reader of Nancy Drew, Trixie Belden or any of the serial detectives so popular with aspiring detectives during youth.  The character of Maisie Dobbs is all of these intrepid girl sleuths grown into maturity with the added benefit of immersing the reader into the lend of the Roaring 20s.

"""Thirteen Chairs"" by Dave Shelton, written for the 12 and up age bracket, might have some trouble keeping its intended audience properly spooked. With the influx of film and, in particular, television shows, the impact of ""Thirteen Chairs"" in terms of an actual quantifiable  horror or fright fright factor will most likely wane in the light of these other more visual mediums.Shelton's premise is reminiscent of an old 60's horror film, where thirteen people sit around in the shadows of an old haunted house and spout out their stories--one more gruesomely horrible than the next--a sort of Addams Family camp out indoors, definitely without the marshmallows and the fire.  The vantage point is Jack's--described as a curious boy--he is the last of the party to be seated.  The pale Mr. Osterley acts as the leader of the group, selecting participants in an order all his own to relate their particular ghost story.  Jack listens to each of the tales and awaits his own turn, which, of course, occurs last, as the thirteenth.Each participant has their own voice--there are adults and children who weave their stories and after each are finished with the telling, they seemingly disappear into the shadows.Each story stands on its own as a representation of the horror genre; they all are framed by the interchange of Mr. Osterley and the other guests, along with Jack's overall impressions.  As the time draw near for Jack to recant his tale, the reader begins to realize that some sort of reveal will occur. Unfortunately, the impact of this reveal is dulled by the reader's immunity to an overplayed genre.None of the stories are particularly memorable--in fact, this reviewer can't really remember one of them that stands out or is worthy of retelling.  Sadly, Shelton doesn't (excuse the pun) flesh out his characters enough to make them tantalizing--Mr Osterley is no Vincent Price and Jack is no Cole Sear  (The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)). The creepy factor that crawls the skin is missing.Technically, the tales are all well-written with the younger audience in mind, but they lack the allure and fascination of horror icon Edgar Allen Poe--young readers can't do better than that as an introduction into the genre--the incessant pounding emotion of The Black Cat cannot be replicated.Bottom line?  ""Thirteen Chairs"" by Dave Shelton isn't that scary; young readers wanting to chill their blood best read old Edgar The Terrifying Tales by Edgar Allan Poe: Tell Tale Heart; The Cask of the Amontillado; The Masque of the Red Death; The Fall of the House of Usher; The ...

"The mere fact that ""Just Go Girl Athletic Leak Pads' exist make me feel better.  I guess that's a bit silly, but at times I feel as if I am the only human being on the planet experiencing this extremely uncomfortable phenomenon when I exercise.Be aware as one reviewer has pointed out that these pads are made in China and this may be of concern to some potential users.  As far as I am concerned, I feel that removing the pad once your exercise is done is the ticket to good hygiene.  Sweaty plus leakage is not a good thing to have near your body whether its contained on a pad or not.  After two hours of exercise, this pad (any pad) has to go.Just Go Girl Athletic Leak (cool name) pads have a thong-like shape that keeps the bulk factor down.  If you are wearing leotards, running shorts or bicycle shorts, no one wants to see your personal business and with this pad, they will not.  Once the pad is in place, the user feels comfortable without getting that diaper feeling.  (Ugh!)For a ten-count package, however, at approximately $9, these are a little steep, price-wise.Thankfully, these pads are unscented.

"In the wake of the hundred year anniversary of the Great War, author Jennifer Robson delivers a novel whose tone and style depicts the era and the sensibilities.Main character Lily is the daughter of an earl; her love interest is her brother's best friend from university, the Scots surgeon Robbie Frasier.  She remembers him from her childhood as being kind; his memory depicts her in pigtails.  When they meet up again, Lily is twenty, a sparkling pretty woman that strives to have more of a purpose in a world about to become unhinged by war.  Impressed, Robbie encourages her.Opposition comes from parents anchored by tradition and the time's prejudices.  Nonetheless, Lily plugs on, intent on being useful in the war she knows will come.Robson's voice befits a young woman of aristocratic breeding; her dealings with the WAC places her in situations with others not of her class, yet she does so with great patience and a dogged perseverance.  As the romance between Robbie and Lily develops, the author does resort to a describing their encounter in all its quivering awakening.  If there is one complaint this reviewer has it would be the almost too gentle and too complacent character of Lily--her desire to help puts her in the ranks of a Mother Theresa from the very start.  Yes, Robson does describe her sickening at some of the things she sees, but the fact that she remains so levelheaded and sweetly cheerful after such a drastic change of life seems a bit A Little Princess to me--some complaining and gnashing of teeth would have made this character a bit more realistic.Nonetheless the story is sweet and has a pleasant if not overly done ending.  I listened to the audiobook performance of this novel from iTunes(at $5.99 unabridged, I could not resist)--the reader has a cultured voice that befits the character--her Scots burr gives Robbie some needed nuance.Bottom line? ""Somewhere in France"" is a tribute to the men and women who worked frustratingly against horrendous circumstances during WWI.  The story of Lily and her Robbie a bit pedestrian other than in its ability to reflect the feel of the time.  I doubt I will be exploring this author's sequel After the War Is Over: A Novel that concentrates on this novel's secondary characters.

"Judith Fertig's ""The Cake Therapist"" presents a feisty heroine with a penchant for baking and the paranormal talent to sense just what flavors her clients need to round out their lives (a la The Mistress of Spices: A Novel). Fertig uses her real time experience in the culinary world to enhance her enticing descriptions of flavor combinations and baking tricks of the trade while allowing the reader a glimpse into the mindset of a woman who employs flavor  as paints on her personal palette to describe, color and interpret her day.Although the story moves along quite nicely, this reviewer would have liked a bit more play with the main character and her ability with the flavors rather than the in depth history behind a mystery involving some of the Rainbow Bakery's neighbors.  The premise of a flavor detective wielding her talent to ferret out otherwise deeply hidden secrets like a psychic helping the police find missing children hints that perhaps Fertig is crafting a series where her baker heroine will solve other neighborhood cases while piecing together her own future in a larger story that will span the length of the series--the usual episodic puzzles interspersed with the main character's slow growth over a larger arc of time.Unfortunately, in this offering, Fertig interrupts the intimacy of her main characters first person voice to shift in time (and a third person voice) where she jumps from 1908 to 1932 etc to depict a bit of Queen City history that took place in the area where the Rainbow Bakery currently stands. This back story hits the reader with a question mark until he/she becomes accustomed to the fact that it will continue at the end of each chapter, even though it is not nearly as interesting as the larger present day story of the bakery, its owner and employees--even if there is a tie-in to an engagement ring that one of the client brides is wearing.Instead of immediately backtracking into old stories and hidden mysteries, Fertig would have been better off allowing her main character to introduce herself more thoroughly.  As a runaway from a marriage gone awry, Neeley O'Neil returns home to Queen City, Ohio to sort out her life amidst the chaos of butter, sugar, flour and the beat of power mixers to open up her dream bakery, specializing in special event cakes to compliment the town's bridal district.Fertig begins with luscious chapter headings like January ""Dark Chocolate. Rich Coffee""and then explains that it suggests the idea of ""starting over"" with a ""take-charge"" air.  She instills an instant pique of interest.  When February comes along, the flavor changes and somewhere in the chapter we understand why this flavor and its connotation (Fertig employs the Chinese medicine ideas of sweet, bitter, salty, pungent and sour to express emotions) are relevant to the storyline.  In March the flavor changes again, but somehow the mystery has taken center stage while Neeley and her problems have become less stressed--almost resolved and just begging for the simple closure of the spoken word or a letter. The flavors fade into an overly sweet Hallmark Channel-type mystery show. Disappointing.Along that line, Fertig abandons characters that she introduces early on:  what happens to Gavin? Will he reappear in the next Cake Therapist novel? The mystery revolving around the past starring Shemeul, Olive and Edie becomes overpowering, pushing aside the quirky fun of the bakery with its fun mix of personalities.  Instead the reader is forced to focus on Mrs. Amici and her nutty daughter--both of whom are almost schtick-y, straight out of an episode of ""Murder, She Wrote."" Fertig is presumptuous in her assumption that she will be popular enough to write an arc large enough to fit in all the characters she has introduced and give them all a main story line in a separate novel--shades of Cedar Cove.Bottom line?  ""The Cake Therapist"" will appeal to all those readers who love to read culinary fix-it novels like The Mistress of Spices: A Novel or How to Eat a Cupcake: A Novel.  However, be prepared for author Fertig's inclusion of a mystery that makes this novel seem episodic, as if there will be more to come featuring other neighborhood mysteries that need solving all centering around her fictive ""Rainbow Bakery"" and her detective's interesting talent.  The main character seems to solve her own problems too quickly in this introductory offering.  I would have rather delved into the Cake Therapist herself, rather than have her introduce her first solved mystery.

"Don't get me wrong, ""Letters from Skye"" by Jessica Brockmole is a charming novel of love and loss during the two World Wars. However, as I've been planning--at least in my mind--a visit to the Highlands, I expected ""Skye"" as in the Isle of Skye to be more present in this offering.  Some rudimentary descriptions tell us of fog and fishermen, but I anticipated feeling the lengthy walks over hilly terrain in all of my muscles; I wanted to feel the chill, smell the peat, see spectacular lights in the sky as well as languish over sunrises and sunsets.  I wanted to meet the characters who live around the main character, Elspeth; I wanted to revel in their lifestyles and their eccentricities. Perhaps the blame lies in Brockmole's choice to write her story in an epistolary format. I imagine it to be more difficult for a writer to attach a strong sense of place without adding a lot of redundant descriptions--comments about the sea and sky that to the letter writer and reader who have already shared a referenced event would come across as false or overblown--within the medium of only letters. In this regard, Brockmole should have either named her novel something else--something more generic--like ""Letters from the Great War"" or ""Letters from a Poet in Love""--or told a straightforward story in a third or first person voice.  In The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, Barrows has little trouble crafting her Guernsey residents through the medium of letters and she writes a love story that manages to break through the reserve of a reader, reading another person's private correspondence.  ""Skye"" gives me no sense of place or time--her characters could live anywhere at any time; there is little difference between the American, David and Elspeth's mother--a woman of an older generation who has lived on Skye for her entire life--where is her burr, her Scots expressions?  Perhaps, I have been overindulging on Outlander: Season One - Volume One, but I expect to feel transported to another place when the name of a beautiful location is in the title.That's the trouble with expectations--disappointment is sure to follow. Brockmole's premise is sure and sweet:  two people meet through letters.  David writes to Elspeth initially through her publisher; he is a fan of her poetry which has been published.  Elspeth, a young married woman, writes back and their letters span the Great War.  In alternate chapters, Elspeth's daughter Margaret writes to her love interest, Paul, from the perspective of their romance and separation during the second World War.  Between the two voices, the reader understands that that war is a dank grey umbrella that severs and destroys dreams with its uncertainty.  Immediately, the reader knows that Elspeth and David did not have their happy ending and now Margaret is on the trail to find out why.Yet even more is missing--the letters span the period between 1912 to 1917.  Where is the sense and language of that time?  If Elspeth speaks Gaelic, then by all means, allow her voice to come through. Brockmore's sensibilities are too contemporary and they are telltale in her letters.  (There is a glaring out-of-time error in the novel and darn, if I can't remember it!)Sounds like the premise itself would make a lovely Hallmark movie--the mists rolling off hills as Elspeth walks to the post would delight and provide atmospheric tension.  Fast-forward to London during WW2 with the Blitzkrieg on at full blast . . . dark scenes in trenches with ambulance drivers rushing along France . . . lyrical music playing an emotional theme song.  Now that wouldn't that work better?The last two pages drew a tear--Brockmole did not write that part as a letter and immediately, the reader is drawn in--in a far better more intimate manner that such a dramatic story of loss and love deserves.Bottom line?  ""Letters from Skye"" is a generic story that would work better as either a screenplay or a third-person or first-person POV, rather than an epistolary novel.  Author Jessica Brockmole's idea is lovely, but it needs the oomph of characterization, scenery, and tone to drive its drama to the point of melodrama.  Brockmole's letters do not nearly convey the emotion and depth of such events.  And Skye?  Its sadly missing. For an emotional read, try Letters to the Lost--there are letters there that will reach across the boundary of time.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R351G36JB35A3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345542622#wasThisHelpful","R351G36JB35A3P","A1JV4QKTEB7QBL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JV4QKTEB7QBL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wllen Marie Wiseman's ""What She Left Behind"" features a parallel story of two young women facing loss.  For Clara in the late 1920s, loss is bound to betrayal--the betrayal of her parents who incarcerate her in a mental asylum merely because she falls in love with an Italian immigrant and refuses to marry the man her mother and father chose for her.  For Izzy, in 1990-something, loss means being put in the foster system after her mother kills her father in cold blood with a revolver, cutting herself to anesthetize the emotional pain and dealing with being the new kid in her senior high school.  Wiseman succeeds in creating a story of alternate chapters that eventually bring these two characters together in a cathartic moment of healing that is life-changing for them both.This reviewer enjoyed Izzy's portion of the novel much more so than Clara's.  The sorrow of Clara's life as a prisoner, thought to be insane and treated as such is palpable; Wiseman's descriptions of patients, treatments, doctors and nurses chill the blood with the lack of compassion and misunderstanding prevalent for that time period in dealing with the mentally ill.  Although emotionally most of this is redeemed in the novel's last few chapters with a happy ending, I found myself skipping over many of the gruesome details.  Wiseman's victim Clara is too sad to be enjoyable.As a seventeen year old, Izzy technically is a young adult and while some reviewers may find her story more acceptable as a YA offering, I enjoyed Wiseman's perspective, even if the intensity in some of the scenarios could be defined as unrealistic.  The bullying she describes puts the reader into Izzy's shoes and allows him/her to feel her insecurity.  Her teenaged characters are much better shaped then the character of foster parent Peg and her husband--although I might attribute my inability to engage with these two due to the voice given to them by the performer of the audio book version of the novel.  Realistic or not, the scenes starring Izzy are fraught with emotion and drama that eventually brings her to a good place, allowing the reader a long exhalation of breath after so much angst.The audio book's reader does an good job of performing both Clara and Izzy's roles.Bottom line?  ""What She Left Behind"" will not appeal to all readers.  Half the book is set inside an insane asylum during the 30s and 40s.  The other half relates to the strength a young teenager builds within herself as she researches the sad life of the asylum inmate and struggles to understand the tragedy of her own family.  A pleasant ending makes all the suffering worthwhile for the most part.  Some contrived circumstances may have some readers rolling their eyes. This book was recommended to me after having read three novels with a ghost theme--this book is definitely not in that genre, so keep that in mind if a similar recommendation is made . . .Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NF9SOJCOOR5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L1JLI3W#wasThisHelpful","R3NF9SOJCOOR5M","A1JV4QKTEB7QBL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JV4QKTEB7QBL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Idea of Love"" by Patti Callahan Henry delivers exactly what one would imagine from such a title: a love story that plays with what love means to different people.  Henry explores her ""idea of love"" with a simple, sincere story line set in a quintessential town in the lowlands of South Carolina.  You know the place:  lace curtains stirring in breezes from off the coast, wooden rocking chairs still in motion on the porch of a clapboard house painted in a Charleston pastel and cicadas chirping in a never-ending background symphony.  While Henry does rely on the backdrop to allow her characters to dream away with much romantic license, the story works--it draws you into the scene, allows you to anticipate what you know will happen and enjoy the moments that get you there.Nonetheless, ""Idea"" does have some faults.  Henry does a better job of fleshing out main character Blake Hunter as a man on a mission to save his reputation and remain in an industry that he loves with full marks. However, even with Blake, Henry waxes a bit too lyrical about him and his uncontrollable feelings, reminding us that, indeed, this is a novel constructed of fictional people--even though I wanted to fully immerse myself and believe, at least for a while, that they were real.While she does manage to recreate the confusion obviously surging within Ella Flynn's soul, she fails to fully craft a character that is all that likeable. She elicits only sympathy.  Poor Ella; she doesn't deserve that--but then after getting into Ella's mindset, the reader begins to understand why she is in the pickle she is in.  As she gathers strength, pity turns to semi-interest, but somehow this isn't quite enough.  Ella does transform as any good character should, but this reviewer only got a hazy view of her.That being said, ""Idea"" hits the bull's eye when it comes to the category, ""Novels that Should be Turned into RomComs.""  Blake Hunter, as a screenwriter sees Reese Witherspoon as the lead of his fictive account of his days in South Carolina.  Hands down, a good choice!  Witherspoon has just the spunk needed to inject Ella with a more winsome exterior--not all that reliant on soft looks.  And maybe a Hugh Jackman-type as Blake and Bradley Cooper as Sims . . . what fun!  I leave the choice of the secondary characters to other readers who see this book as potentially a box-office hit as a screenplay!  Maybe Sandrine Holt from the A&E remake of ""The Returned"" as Betsy . . . sorry. couldn't help myself! . . . Margaret Colin as Margo?There are moments in the novel that are just too ridiculously convenient--the Margo and the dress scenario?  The Vogue challenge? Trite. Not enough of a lead-in--Margo should be struggling with that from Day One.  Reese, oops, I mean, Ella should be scratching away on her sketches because of the challenge . . .Rent-A-Runway?  I don't think so . . . Ella should have her own style that she sews up and embellishes herself.Some deeply psychological issues are handled in moments where suddenly the characters take a deep breath and ahhhh!  All is better.  Perhaps there is something in this simplicity--the journey starts with a single footstep and all that. Such poster messages are appealing in such a book.  Nevertheless, Henry has a predilection to overdo this.For those who do not like name-dropping, there is a bit of this in ""Idea.""  ET is given a plug as well as the Kardashians and few other current headliners.  Unfortunately, this appeals to those who need such associations; for those who don't the novel becomes sillier rather than more realistic--I prefer a more classic take where there is a modern setting without all the references that pinpoint the year. With that said, I could have done without the last chapter.Bottom line? ""The Idea of Love"" is a fun novel that draws you into the sad situation of main character Ella Flynn--a woman with dreams but no anchor.  Enter the anchor: failing screenwriter, Blake Hunter.  Lies abound in a typical but enjoyable romantic comedy romp with great secondary characters.

"Lincoln Child's enigmalogist, Jeremy Logan, stars in this chilling compact offering ""The Forgotten Room"" by returning to a think tank called ""Lux"" off the coast of Newport, Rhode Island where he attempted once to promote his paranormal brand of science.  Requested by the director of the prestigious organization, Logan must manage difficult personalities of some of America's premier scientists while discovering the reasons behind a mild-mannered colleague committed a horrendously brutal act of suicide.Child's style is quick-paced; his chapters barely contain five or six pages each.  He employs a straight-forward third person voice that at times varies to allow the reader a glimpse at some of the secondary players.  Nonetheless, the focus is Logan and his find of a ""forgotten room"" in the old multi-winged building that houses the organization and just may be the cause of some of its members unexplained psychotic episodes.  In his usual manner, Child marries the paranormal to science in an exciting page-turner that will entertain the reader for about 24 hours.Logan is an interesting character that deserves more of a back story as well as a new adventures. Most of Child's readers who follow the author's Pendergast series written with co-author Preston will just expect some retrospective in the future.  The plot of ""The Forgotten Room""is a lot more entertaining than the rather dismal The Third Gate, featuring the same character in a forgettable adventure that tries too hard to be Stargate.TFR is made smaller and more intense by the limited venue--the action barely leaves the Lux headquarters.  The ploy of a hurricane at the end of the novel is used to up the dramatic effect of the climax with the usual lack of electricity and wailing winds.  The science behind the adventure makes up for some of this.Bottom line?  ""The Forgotten Room"" is a quick read with more appeal than Child's other Jeremy Logan novel, ""The Third Gate.""

"Sorrow and disappointment pulse through all of M. J. Rose's heroines; in ""The Witch of Painted Sorrows,"" the first installment in Rose's  ""Daughters of La Lune"" series, first person narrator Sandrine Verlaine is no exception.  Grieving for the death of her father and receiving no sympathy from her brute of a husband, Sandrine flees from her home in New York to the Paris of the Belle Epoque.  Her grandmother, the fiery red-headed courtesan of the demimonde, embraces her with open arms, providing a sanctuary where Sandrine can recover and pull the pieces of her life back together.  With almost no experience in the art of love, Sandrine finds little to relate her life of strangled pleasures to that of her grandmother's lusty experiences--that is until she becomes fascinated with the Maison de la Lune, a house wreathed in the history of her family and recently closed for some unknown reason by her taciturn grandmother.Rose explores Sandrine's hungry desire for identity in the same way that she depicts the angst of her character Jac L'Etoile in The Book of Lost Fragrances: A Novel of Suspense, Seduction: A Novel of Suspense and The Collector of Dying Breaths: A Novel of Suspense who is plagued by dreams and images of reincarnation until she finds her ultimate happiness.  Perhaps, Rose's theory consists of a simple premise:  humans are tortured by thoughts of the unknowable until they find an all-consuming purpose.  With such purpose, the need to squelch melancholy and thoughts of death and sadness are forgotten--an immunity is created.  The darkness, the sadness as represented and evoked by La Lune cannot take hold.  Like Jac L'Etoile, Sandrine becomes prey to the sad strength of La Lune, an ancestor of the Verlaine family who suffered greatly.With that in mind, the tone of ""Witch"" replicates the tone of Rose's other novels--the sadness permeates the reader with its sense of loss and its desperate need for vanquishing in a way that may not be appealing to many readers.  Those expecting a joyful, triumphant resolution, realize beforehand that as the first in a new series, this novel acts as an introduction to installments of cautionary tales. After the novel's conclusion, Rose provides an excerpt to ""The Jeweler of Stolen Dreams"" which, although not labeled as the second book in the series, most likely is, as it begins in Paris in 1918.Rose's first person voice is fraught with the same mixture of innocence and pressing motivation as her characters from her other novels.  She relies upon the intimacy of this voice to compensate for a lack of excessive detail that would bring the Belle Epoque to life from the perspective of a historical novel.  Instead she envelopes the reader in the events of the narrator's life as they occur, describing events and places as Sandrine experiences them rather than constantly remind the reader that the novel takes place in another era where sensibilities, styles and protocols were much different.  It works.Nevertheless, there is a deadness to the character that fails to make her likeable; as I tumbled towards the last page of ""Witch,"" I wasn't necessarily rooting for Sandrine.  Perhaps, I had already realized that she was the introductory vessel for an entity that would make its appearance known in the other La Lune novels.  Even Sandrine's engagement in lustful acts with the lover of her dreams does not succeed on the level that one would expect; something is missing but, these only detract a little juice to the story which is, otherwise, an entertaining albeit melancholy read.Bottom line?  In ""The Witch of Painted Sorrows,"" M. J. Rose returns to what she is best known for--a novel of human longing, disappointment and a turning to the occult to find answers to staunch the pain.

"Hermoine Eyre's ""Viper Wine"" engenders two diametrically opposed reactions from me.  On one level, it depicts its heroine, the 17th century beauty Venetia Stanley from the perspective of the aging beauty whose worst fear has been realized--her diminishing looks have resulted in a disintegrating power that causes her to be the butt of sarcastic jokes; it disallows  her the ability to garner attention with the same  cuteness quota that worked so well when she was much younger than her 30-something years.  In this regard Eyre succeeds, illustrating the lengths one woman is willing to take in order to ""restore"" her youthful beauty; she cleverly parallels Venetia's slights, doubts and resolutions to modern day models, actresses and celebrities that will and do resort to treatments that allow them to still participate in all the activities that keep them in the spotlight and while claiming the title ""beauty."" Eyre proves that despite an egalitarian revolution of the genders, good looks still count--so nothing has changed very much no matter how far things seem to have progressed.However, where Eyre more than emphasizes her point about beauty and its superficiality, she struggles somewhat with her other main character's perspective--Kenelm Digby, Venetia's husband, wants nothing more than for his wife to realize that at any age, she is beautiful in his eyes.  As an apothecary and dabbler in the hermetic arts, Kenelm could, if he so wishes, concoct a bit of ""viper wine"" that would ease away his wife's wrinkles with the 17th century effectiveness of Botox, but he stands firm in his opinion that aging is inevitable even for the era's great beauties.  Besides, his mind is filled with his inventiveness--he freely floats through time whenever the notion takes him to explore such modern concepts as quantum particles and nanobiotechnology--when he isn't encumbered by the fact that his father was tried and hung as a traitor to the Crown.  For the reader, it is this paranormal ability of Kenelm's that muddles the plot--creating a labyrinth of ideas and thinking that stall the story instead of endowing it with the intended added dimension.As Eyre's story progresses and Venetia resorts to the most dire beauty aids, her ability to think rationally deteriorates as her reliance on the witch doctor who assembles her potions becomes more addictive.  Eyre's comments on the pursuit of beauty at all costs transcends the 17th century in the same way that her character Kenelm avoids the limitations of the science of his time.  Nonetheless, as interesting as her thoughts are on the subject of beauty, vanity and other absolutes, the overall presentation detracts from the strength of the premise; the reader gets lost within the labyrinth of too much cleverness, opting to get more rapidly and straightforwardly to the point.Bottom line?  Hermoine Eyre's ""Viper Wine"" points out that beauty treatments in the form of Botox or surgery may result in a younger version of a generic human being, but don't necessarily ever replicate the youth an individual once had; it may erase the etched lines and expressions of experience time and age have rendered, leaving that face devoid of character and life. The result is always disappointing--a pathetic substitution for health and well-being--and in the case of Venetia Stanley hastens her demise after destroying her mental state.  Eyre gathers her 17th century characters to deliver this message with great success, but muddles the effect with too much paranormal activity and time leaping to keep the reader within a range of reason that doesn't compete with the story's main thrust.

"With all the speculation and frightening happenstances at fictional Lyle College, the reader of ""The Sixes"" by Kate White cannot help but eventually ask why the protagonist, Phoebe Hall, continues on with her snooping when her background includes a harrowing experience with bullies and her life is jeopardized by similar oppressors of a newer fiercer generation privy to tools more technically competent in ruining lives.The premise, that a non-fiction writer specializing in celebrity dirt who has been accused of plagiarism is hiding away in a north-east college as a substitute writing instructor until she rethinks her career, starts the ball rolling immediately for the reader to trust in the author's ability to suspend disbelief.  Of course, she is ""connected;"" her best friend from boarding school--the scene of her personal bullying experience--as dean of students gets her the job and acts as not only her confidante throughout the tale, but the person who assigns her the muck-racking task of looking into the disappearance of a young co-ed who might be on the roster of a secret girls' society bent on ensuring that their members take their female empowerment seriously.As a character, Phoebe is dogged and relentless, not at all cowed by a miserable experience from school that threatened her life and sourced all sorts of unimaginable nightmares.  That in itself seems incredible.  Of course, as readers, we are not privy to the specifics of her experience until much later on in the telling of the story.  By that time, the amount of frightening adventures that revolve off of her investigation of the sixes churn her stomach, cause waves of terror to climb up her spine, punch her in the gut, make her nauseous and all manner of other cliche phrases to get across the idea that she is indeed in dire jeopardy.  The adrenaline rush this woman gets on a daily basis is enough to leave her muscles wobbly--and yet she persists . . .The story itself is interesting and as I listened to this in an unabridged audio format for a number of hours, it did entertain with its conspiracy theory ideas and  sinister people lurking in the dark at every turn in Phoebe's investigation. The insult to the reader, if one can call it that, is the expectation that the reader will buy into several premises that in a more realistic world would never make sense.  But, then again, this is fiction that reads like a beach thriller, so what can one expect?Bottom line?  ""The Sixes"" by Kate White is a suspense thriller that will engage the reader who does not expect too much realism.  The action takes place on a small college campus; the focus on over-amped feminism and the collateral damage of bullying and peer pressure.  Implausible at times, it drags on to reveal the brains behind the operation that the reader guessed from the start.  Recommended as a good audio book that entertains during exercise.

"Scott Mariani's Ben Hope series has been likened to ""Dan Brown on steroids.""  I, for one, am not sure about that comparison.  The connection between letters and secrets from history's past and running around Europe trying to discover answers to modern terrorist activity--killings, kidnappings etc. may remind the reader of the Dan Brown school of fast-reading travelogue literature, but that is where the parallel ends.  Not that Professor Robert Langdon (The Da Vinci Code, Inferno (Robert Langdon) and Angels & Demons: A Novel (Robert Langdon)) is a more finely drawn character than ""The Mozart Conspiracy's"" main character, Major Ben Hope--he's not--but the storyline and its conspiracies and establishments are better rectified.  Mariani writes of a troubled hero with a past who fights as a professional avenging angel to protect innocents who get caught in the crossfire of powerful men who crave influence.  The so-called conspiracy of the title of this offering, the second in the Ben Hope series, revolves around Mozart's death, a letter written by the composer before he dies and the lengths present day fanatics go to maintain the status quo of their clandestine organizations.I listened to the audio presentation of this book--performed adequately by Steven Crossley. I believe that listening to this type of story makes the narrative more believable as I don't have the option of skipping over chase or fight scenes that become predictable.  Listening forces me to hear the entire novel.  Upon purchasing this audio book, I did not realize that ""The Mozart Conspiracy"" was part of a series.  However, when the plot line went into overdrive after the climatic scene where a helicopter explodes and Hope saves the day within an inch of his life, I found it difficult to understand why I still had another hour of the book left before it concluded.  ""Mozart"" would have been a more likeable story if that last hour of the presentation was eliminated--its overdone, unnecessary and would have made a better beginning for the next novel than the superfluous conclusion of this one. I say let the poor hero have at least a hiatus between books where he and his beloved can enjoy one another without the inquisitive eye of the reader trained upon them. As I listened, I realized that this extra ending was an annoying set up where an episodic series starring the woebegone main character and his primary motivation for his vendetta lifestyle was being baptized and launched into the arena of conspiracy theory criminals. Come, come, Mr. Mariani even that does not make that extra hour palatable. Give your hero his due.I imagine that the author intends to develop Ben Hope over time--feed him different tidbits of women--maybe Eve will continually crop up like 007's favorite Bond girl-- and keep the adventures somewhat historical in nature to appeal to that Dan Brown audience that he is targeting.  Seems to have worked for him so far as there are already nine Ben Hope thrillers on the market! I don't think I will be reading another, unless it is offered as this one was on iTunes for $5.99 in an unabridged format:)Bottom line? Undeveloped characters and a choppy conspiracy theory backbones this thriller that really should end about an hour before its conclusion.

"When I opened the box of the Instyler Tulip Auto Curler, I must admit that I was skeptical--especially after I saw the cardboard Tulip device that is meant to act as a guide for the maximum hair thickness to be curled at one time.  My hair is thick and its layered--so I figured that coaxing my wavy hair into curls with this device was going to take a longgggg while.I was wrong. Make sure you take out some time to learn how to operate the machine.  My learning time was kicked off with Bunny's review on YouTube--she tests out the Curler in front of her mirror and her comments will help guide you when you try out the Curler for the first time. Its a little awkward at first, the biggest challenge for me was dividing my very layered hair into individual strands of one length that would fit into the machine.  I made sure, after reading some of the disaster tangles on this site, that I used the cardboard thickness measure.  The next challenge was getting the device in the correct position to insure that my hair went in it in the proper way.  Doing this in front of a mirror, is not easy.  I find that once I oriented the machine to face me in the mirror, if I separate the hair and pull it down, sliding it into the slot in the device is easier to accomplish.  A press of the button winds the hair into the heating section and a series of slow beeps tells you that the hair is being curled.  A faster succession of beeps indicates that its time to slide the curler down--and out the comes the curl.Because my hair is layered, I do not think I will try this on the top part of my head--its just too short--but, I will use this to touch up the bottom and sides of my hair--the results were a far neater hair style, which I liked.  Using the curler was successful; I experienced no tangles and no burning--just uniform curls.  Nice.Bottom line:  The Instyle Tulip Auto Curler worked well on my layered hair.  I can only think that it would work very well on hair of one length.  If you take some time to figure the machine out, watch a few Youtube videos, you will quickly catch on to the operation of it while looking in a mirror to style.  Great for a finishing touch for me--like all curling devices using heat, I would not use everyday as it will probably dry out the hair.

"Starting a novel series from the last book in the sequence may seem like an odd beginning.  Nonetheless, Jacqueline Windspear's ""A Dangerous Place,"" the eleventh in the Maisie Dobbs series stands on its own as a woman-in-crisis novel--where the crisis is one of the heart--a very dangerous place, indeed.Main character Maisie's whole world is upended.  Personal tragedy has struck her deeply--so deeply she needs a hiatus to make sense of the world again.  Instead of returning to the UK as her loving family wishes, Maisie detours to Gibraltar where almost instantly she finds herself embroiled in a mystery surrounding the death of a photographer.Windspear tells her tail of pre-WW2 Europe with a subtle style.  Employing a third person perspective, she manages to allow the reader to see inside Maisie's soul as she slowly heals without tiresome hysterics.  Maisie, as a character, possesses great strength and Windspear tells her true, allowing a hairline crack in her public facade to widen slowly to reveal the underlying emotions with sympathetic understanding.As Maisie undertakes the solving of the photographer's death, her calculus of thought provides a gradual solution to her own funk and by the end of the novel, the reader and Maisie both have subtly changed through the experience.  Windspear deserves praise for her intricate weaving of the actual mystery adventure with the mystery of Maisie's heart.She also does a fine job of creating 1930s Gibraltar where planes of many nations fly overhead and boats travel under the cover of night to the troubled landscape of Spain.  The reader feels the threat with the same impact as the characters.Bottom line?  This eleventh novel in the Maisie Dobbs series allows the reader to stand vigil with the main character as she emerges from personal tragedy.  Having never read the other novels in the series, I was impressed with the author's ability to create a stalwart woman who handles herself very well in the face of danger.

"Pick up Jane Heller's ""An Ex to Grind"" when you are in the mood for a fun, predictable story along the lines of a made-for-TV movie on Lifetime. As soon as the first person voice of main character Melanie Banks begins her diatribe about women in the workplace and their effect on the aims of men, I could actually hear this as a voice-over opening scene--where investor Melanie struts through her office in a chic business suit wearing a livid expression on her face because she has just witnessed yet another of her ex-husband's extravagant purchases using her hard-earned alimony allowance.Melanie's character is frank, bordering on a little too much self-deprecation that doesn't seem to jive with her chosen career.  In fact, for a woman so driven that her husband accuses her of work-a-holism, her mind can't seem to get off the track of having to fork over half of her salary.  For me, that made the premise a little unrealistic.However, that is exactly the reason I purchased the audio recording of this novel--Melanie's voice is reminiscent of a friend unloading her deepest secrets and her less than stellar moments infused with probably more humor than actuality as in any good retelling of a story beginning with ""You'll never guess what happened to me. . . ""The first half of the novel entertains a lot more than its second half.  Unfortunately, this is when the author must tie up all the loose ends and actually keep the story real without being too predictable.  Does it work?  That depends.  Melanie is a madcap heroine--cut from the clothe of Katherine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby--or Rosalind Russell in ""His Girl Friday.""  Those characters do some crazy things to get what they want with the old adage, ""All's Fair in Love and War"" at the top of their list of Words-to-Live-By.  In this same respect, Melanie, does some despicable things--but that doesn't take away from the fun of the book.  So what if she doesn't have the moral compass of a Girl Scout or missionary? Once you dedicate yourself to such a book, or the viewing of that Lifetime movie, you already know the outcome as soon as you see the titles--you are expecting to be outraged.  What fun would it be if the main character never did anything unsavory?  The predictability of the story should factor into the the comedy as in the classic films mentioned above.  In ""An Ex to Grind,"" Melanie works towards what she wants, gets what she wants, realizes she doesn't really want what she thought and must go through the fire of disappointment to become a newly baptized Melanie--one that views things in a different way because of her experience.  This does happen in this novel, however, the outcome is not all that satisfying--its too saccharine-y sweet.  I may expect that from a classic film, but not from a novel published in 2006.Reader Caroline Schaffer does a great job of acting out each characters voice while still keeping the timing of a comedienne, making the audio presentation of this novel a worthwhile listen.Bottom line? Having not read any of Jane Heller's other novels, I found ""An Ex to Grind"" predictable fun with a madcap heroine.

"The Solo Executive Backpack in Khaki features a multitude of padded stash space--there are two large zippered compartments that open the case fully and will accommodate a Macbook Pro safely and bundle the associated wires and charges accordingly in separate slots designed for that function.The color is more brown than khaki as is depicted in the images.  The front sports a snap closure that opens to split pockets--the snap device on this feature is a little difficult to open--perhaps some lubricant will help to ensure faster access and closure.The zippered pocket beneath the decorative vinyl opens to a slotted organization area for pens, cell phone etc.This backpack is meant to be worn on the back--it does not have a luggage sleeve that would ease it onto the telescopic handle of rolling luggage. Compare it to the  Zuca Business Backpack that is almost double the cost--the Solo is specifically built for laptop and office carry whereas the Zuca could double as an overnight bag.  Like a standard school carry, the Solo has no wiggle room or ability to expand like a piece of luggage.The padding is substantial enough for everyday--although I would not check this if using for airplane travel.Bottom line?

"Environment is crucial to tea drinking.  A beautiful place, a wondrous brew calms and nurtures the spirit.When I lived in Tucson Arizona, I had the good luck to be able to drink wonderful tea in a Chinese Tea Shop called Seven Cups on 6th Avenue.  During my short time in the city, I was happy to experience Cloud-fog tea--an everyday Chinese tea that was so popular in its native country it rarely made it out of China.The area where it is grown is the Lushan Mountain area in the Jiangxi Province where a perpetual cloud hangs over the landscape--this misty climate slow-grows and hydrates the tea bushes resulting in leaves that are filled with abundant plant chlorophyll and sweet/unusual flavor development.The Cloud-fog tea has a buttery flavor that may be reminiscent of asparagus sprouts--however, do not over kill this tea with too hot water--it will become bitter.  Rich with tannins and Vitamin C, it requires delicate handling--water temp around 140 degrees--abbreviated seep time. Sip and savor.Happily, this interesting tea is now available through Amazon!

"While Amy Schiebe's newest novel ""A Fireproof Home for the Bride"" is set in 1950s Minnesota, the plight of her heroine Emmy Nelson remains relevant almost seventy years later despite the novel's ability to gather its reader in a tornado of descriptions and mindsets that seem only fitting for that earlier age.  Disguised as a coming-of-age novel, Fireproof's theme of tolerance presses through as the main character struggles to craft a universe where what she feels in her heart becomes at least an esoteric if not actual reality.Main character Emmy whose voice is expressed within a third person limited perspective possesses strength of body and will due to the hard life provided for her by her farming/factory-working family.  Strict Lutherans, Christian and Karin Nelson abide strictly by the tenets of the Bible where mother Karin especially lives within a stingy emotional climate where bare-knuckle duty and faith sadly drain the joy out companionable living and shame and fear guide all behaviors.From the novel's beginning, the reader is made aware that Emmy will marry Ambrose Brann, the college grad son of a wealthier neighbor and embark upon a life similar to that of her mother's.  Although Emmy, at times, sparks with a coming-of-age need for exploration--she cannot help be attracted to the glittering adult sexual portal that a relationship with Ambrose opens to her--she cringes at the thought of subjecting herself to the lack of freedom that she knows a life with the Brann clan will bring her.Her natural curiosity spurs her forward past her mother's vision of her as the wife of an influential Brann and when the opportunity arises, she breaks free of this control and attempts to discover a more fulfilling life on her own.Unfortunately, Emmy's small world is defined by other darker threats where the perhaps comfortable idea of community where everyone knows everybody else leads to a lack of privacy that work to thwart her attempts.  The reader is led through the labyrinth of cousins and other distant relations that either help or hinder Emmy's progress and suggest just how claustrophobic Emmy's universe actually is.Although the tone of the novel marvelously reflects the dour backdrop of Emmy's upbringing and what she views as the limited options and sour histories of her environment's inhabitants, at times the reader feels as if he/she is wading through heavy water--so dense are Schiebe's reflective descriptions that instead of drowning in her interesting metaphors and preponderances of emotion (or lack thereof) the tendency is to want to move along and get past the tedium to a place of action.  While this fog of emotional quandary and growth is necessary to the definition of Schiebe's main character, it still evokes a dreariness and muffled uncertainty that might have been easier to navigate without all the superfluous characters--relations and what not. Although Emmy is marked with the determination to persevere, the tone remains controlled, retrained and devoid of the excitement of forging a new world.Schiebe's depiction of the Doyle family--the large stereotypical Irish American Catholic family works up until she flounders with secondary player Bobby's (Emmy's love interest) indecision regarding himself.  This reviewer finds that her dismissal of him and the hint of his potential proclivities weakens the story line rendering it with a triteness that while convenient for the main character is unnecessary.  On the other hand, Emmy's feelings for Bobby and her view of his family and the life they can make together helps make her ultimate decision more authentic.  (Note:  Schiebe's research on the procedure of the Catholic Mass needs editing. Keep in mind that my version of ""Fireproof"" was an ARC. Although the addition of ""The Kiss of Peace"" was reincorporated into the service after Vatican II, it certainly did not occur until way after the Latin Mass was substituted for the vernacular celebration.  This did not become a part of the Mass in the 1950s--it most likely became an addition to the New Mass in the 1970s!)From the start of the novel, the reader is aware that there is more to Emmy's family than just straight-laced religion.  The overtones of hatred and bigotry voiced by the Branns' and the snaky character of Curtus Davidson and Emmy's innate dislike of their ability to cow her parents and their adjuncts fuels the latter portion of the novel where Emmy's true calling is nurtured by her interest in finding out not only the truth of her background, but the universal truth of real fellowship.  It is in this portion of the story that Schiebe abandons her denser prose and the reader, aware of this push forward rushes along with her gratefully.  Unlike other reviewers of this novel, this reviewer enjoyed the darker mysteries that Schiebe outlines as intrinsic to her main characters growth spurt.  Rather than get lost within a miasma of too much contemplation and woebegone recriminations as reflections of the past, Emmy's involvement with something larger, lightens her as a character, making her more understandable and likeable. Otherwise, ""A Fireproof Home for the Bride"" just follows another struggle-to-undo-the-chains-that-bind scenario.Bottom line?  ""A Fireproof Home for the Bride"" disguises itself as a gentle read of a young woman's coming-of-age.  While part of the story does indeed address an escape from the convention of 1950s' expectations for women, ""Fireproof"" describes a a darker maze of incensed power taken by supposedly upstanding people who do not understand the true meaning of the American melting pot. As author Schiebe's main character constructs her own truth, her new understanding of her past and the horror of the present help her to grow in a way she never thought possible.

"The title of Kate Alcott's novel ""A Touch of Stardust"" will appeal to a certain type of reader: one looking for a bit of fun about the glamour days of 1930s Hollywood during one of the town's most significant events in cinema history--the filming of Gone with the Wind.Even though Alcott interjects her story of an ambitious Smith graduate from Fort Wayne Indiana looking to make it as a screenwriter with political inferences from the time--Julie eventually must learn to stifle the power of an ingrained anti-Semitic background, view skeptically the less-than-hopeful statistics of success for women screenwriters and voice outrage against the racism and censorship of the Hollywood machine as it struggles to depict Margaret Mitchell's novel as a true adaptation--she makes such issues seem almost anecdotal, thrown in to create a genuine atmosphere rather than concentrate on what really shines within her pages.  The relationship Alcott depicts between actress Carole Lombard and the film's Rhett Butler, Clark Gable redeems the novel from a triteness that would otherwise render the novel quickly forgettable.  When viewed as a romp, despite the attempted pull of weightier subjects, ""A Touch of Stardust"" becomes a quick, fun read.Its not that Julie's story isn't memorable--something tells me that Alcott might further explore the girl, her assured success and her romance with the zealous Andy Weinstein in a sequel--she's predictable, roughly drawn and as the author puts it in her Afterward an ""Everywoman"" that strives for some individual success. Unfortunately, in this case, ""Everywoman"" equals been-there-done-it-before.I, for one, enjoyed the ""Ma"" and ""Pa"" relationship between Lombard and Gable and would have liked more of that repartee in addition to more insights into the making of the great film. Alcott weaves in many bits of Hollywood gossip and other incidental tidbits that reflect her research, but these manage to come off as cutesy expositions rather than necessary character depictions.  Nonetheless, viewing the book as a ""feisty Midwestern girl makes good on man-eating unknown turf despite the odds"" kind of novel will ensure a pleasurable read.Bottom line? Kate Alcott's novel ""A Touch of Stardust"" depicts the Hollywood before WW2 where profit-making is king and the huge endeavor of filming ""Gone with the Wind"" is a huge gamble.  While main character Julie Crawford drives the story with her confused ambition--straddling her desire for career rather than the safety of marriage and eventual motherhood--the more colorful fleshed out personality of Carole Lombard keeps the reader entertained and somewhat forgiving of Julie's bumpy ride. Recommended as a fast read to while away the winter hours.  After reading, indulge in a movie night starring Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara and marvel at its staying power.  For those enamored by Mitchell's Gone with the Wind, 75th Anniversary Edition try the sequel by Alexandra Ripley Scarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's ""Gone With the Wind"" or indulge in a viewing of the mini-series Scarlett.

"I ordered 180s Women's Tahoe Ear Warmers in White--I had been using Chatties Ladies Printed Patterned Headphone Earmuffs with built in Speakers and unfortunately the connection became loose and the muffs became useless.

The ear bud portion of this idea works, however the adjustable feature of these muffs simply does not work.  Pulling the muffs supposedly adjusts the size, but the adjustment does not stay fixed--once the muffs are placed around the neck, they slip off the ears, rendering them useless.

"I wore this pair of tattoo ""sleeves"" as part of a Halloween rocker costume. The quality is good, but the nylon construction is inherently fragile.The design looks good even stretched to the sleeves' max fit. It's one of the better designs of similar listings I looked at. Those other designs are garish or look particularly fake (comparatively, people seemed to find these sleeves looked real at a dimly-lit glance). The ""skin color"" (of the base nylon material) is on the light side, so if you're particularly dark (or absolutely pale) they might not work. They worked okay on my tanned / light brown skin.These are much like old-school women's ""nylons"", complete with the same fragility (runs, tears possible) and needing to smooth or hitch the sleeves into place. But I found they generally stayed in place on my arms, needing only periodic smoothing.The fit is on the tight side, the upper part is almost too tight on my medium male build. Larger folks should look elsewhere. There's a seam down the underside (it doesn't show too much), there's a fabric-care tag you'll want to remove, and there's a seam where the sleeves end that you'll want to cover with a wristband or gloves.I found the wrist-seam tore a little getting after getting pulled over my hand several times, and that made it curl up, but I was still able to cover it up with a broad wristband.5 stars since they are superior in quality (to other sleeves I've tried), the design is one of the best ones I've seen, and the price is good for the pair of sleeves.

"Small speakers serve up big Bose sound, but this package comes with an exorbitantly high price tag, and some surprising limitations.Summary: This package produces substantial sound from compact gear, while drawing only miserly amounts of power. Easy setup, and everything in one box, including cabling. But the featureset is lacking basics like an on-screen display, the lovely compact speakers have long proprietary cables, and Soundtouch seems like an unnecessary complication for simple audio streaming usage. Several aspects feel ""dated"". For the price-tag, I expected better. Details follow:* Sound: Classic Bose sound. Crisp, clear, distinct. The ""ADAPTiQ"" headset is used to let the system figure out the acoustic properties of the room (and adjust its sound accordingly). Presumably the headset is more accurate than the small mic other receivers use for this purpose.* Receiver: A/V receiver functions are split into 2 pieces, the ""console"" and the ""SoundTouch wireless adapter"" (which end up cabled together), making for a clunky layout. All the more so since the remote works with the console, but the app works with the Soundtouch adapter. This layout feels like the recycle of an old hardware design that should be rebuilt as one unit. Combined with the lack of an On-Screen Display, that means both pieces have to be ""out"". On power-cycle, the console doesn't seem to remember what HDMI input was set last.* Display/controls: Unlike modern AV receivers, the console doesn't output control overlays to the current video output. That means you'll be squinting to see the tiny display on the console, or using the soundtouch app (yes that means a remote AND a mobile device), or they simply didn't provide the receiver feature you were looking for anyway.* Wireless speakers: The Sub unit (""Acoustimass"") is wireless (since it plugs into power anyway). The other speakers are all cabled. Unfortunately, the cables provided are very long (and proprietary). So to get the nice clean (no cables) setup in the promo pic? You're going to need to do both drywall work and cable management.* Power: Electrical draw (measured at the wall) is impressively low. For modest volume, the Acoustimass and console together drew well under 50W.* Cabling: One of my biggest hits on Bose is the completely unnecessary proprietariness of what should be commodity parts. That includes the speaker wires. Long cables are provided, which will be much too long for the fronts (to get the setup pictured in Bose promo shot), and possibly too short for the rears. And they're black. (how many of you have black walls?)  The power cables also lack ""normal"" ends.* Remote: Nice to have a universal remote, but the layout is amateurish. What do you use most on an A/V remote? Power, perhaps? It's not in the top row (it's in the top middle). What else, volume? A smallish rocker crowded by other buttons. Mute? (which I use most) That's a tiny button below the volume rocker. They should have repackaged one of Logitech's brilliant universal remotes, instead of this cluttered 1990s throwback.* Connectivity: I only experimented a little. Despite the dedicated add-on hardware for this purpose, Soundtouch seems primitive. The app is required. It's far more steps than it should be to do something simple like ""stream from my device"" (no simple pair-and-go).  It seems like you lose the ability to switch to somebody else's accounts or devices, since things are pre-configured through your Soundtouch account. The happy couple is going to have to decide who runs the AV system. There's nothing like the Logitech Squeezebox where you can play music from an arbitrary source such as your PC.* Unpack: One big box with multiple smaller boxes inside it. All cabling (including one HDMI) and batteries for the remote are included.* Other: Front and rear speakers seem to be identical. There's no subwoofer threshold to select what frequencies are sent to the Acoustimass.I wanted to rate this 3.5 stars, but considering the price and the fact the speakers can't be used with other receivers, I rounded down.The solid Bose-tuned audio will appeal to anybody who likes the way Bose sounds, the easy setup will appeal to those who don't want unnecessary features and configuration, the compact size works well for smaller spaces (or larger minimalist spaces), and the Soundtouch adapter ties in modern audio sources. But the clunky proprietary-ness of the design and cabling, the afterthought of a remote, the lack of an on-screen display, and the limited tunability are galling at this price.If you're invested in the Bose ecosystem, or are particularly fond of the Bose sound, this system is a good choice. If you simply want a compact, easy-setup AV system, you can likely find a cheaper, more modern system that does more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KDYQCRVC26UI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IH6N22#wasThisHelpful","R1KDYQCRVC26UI","A3Q4TYJVAM4IRM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q4TYJVAM4IRM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The light distribution is even, from the sides of the light. This is meant to light up the wall it's attached to. The resulting illumination is pretty bright compared to most small LED nightlights.

Sometimes the light stays on the 20 seconds the manual describes. Other times it stays lit for longer, as much as 2-3 minutes, even when I move the light to a bright room.

"Pur's newest pitcher. A little bigger (by 1 cup) than the Brita competition, but also a little less functional. The expensive Pur filters are superior to Brita's, but work much more slowly. You likely want the Pur if you're more skeptical about your water, and the Brita if you're just moderately skeptical, or on a tighter budget, or drink a lot of water.The details:* Size: This slim design is higher-capacity (11 cup) than either Brita's slim pitcher (5 cup) or their larger pitchers (10 cup). Pur wins if you keep the pitcher in the fridge, otherwise 1 cup isn't decisive.* Filtering: The Pur filters are much bigger than the Brita's, and are rated more specifically for more contaminants. Some big differences: the Pur is rated for removing cysts, has been rated for removing pesticide traces, and for removing various metals that the Brita does not mention. The Pur also has a rating for reducing pharmaceutical traces (for which there's no established threshold, but I'd like as little of them in my water as possible). Pur wins hands down on producing cleaner, safer water.* Filters: Unlike the new Brita design, the Purs still need to be pre-soaked before rinsing and installation (similar to the old Brita design). The Pur filter doesn't have an easy-grasp top like the Brita, I've sometimes had to use tools to get a decent grip on the old filter I'm removing.* Design: This Pur has a small fill opening designed to minimize the chance of contamination, similar to the nicer Britas. But unlike the Britas, the lid isn't fitted, so a casual upward motion will cause the lid to bounce up or even pop off. The handle is less comfortable than the Brita Monterey (see my pics), but better than the Brita Everyday. Brita wins slightly on better lid and handle design.* Speed of filtering: The Pur is distinctly slower than the Brita for the same water / same age of filter. Brita wins on speed.* Pouring: The Pur's spout is shaped for faster pouring, and no glugging. There's a small flap that keeps the opening covered normally. The Brita 10-cups don't have that flap, and pour more slowly. Pur wins on pouring.* Pouring while filtering: Pouring from the Pur while the top chamber is full causes the unfiltered water to mix with filtered in the pitcher, as well as to pour from the spout. This is a bad design (especially considering the slow filtering). The Brita Monterey has the same issue, but less so-- if its top chamber is less than 1/3 full, you can pour normally, and there's much less of the accidental intermingling in the pitcher even when more full. The Brita Everyday barely has the issue (only if the top chamber is full). Brita wins on pouring while the top filtering chamber is filled.* Plastic: Like all such water pitchers these days, the plastic is labeled as BPA-free. Both pitchers feel sturdy and I've never had a Pur or Brita crack from normal usage. Only once when a cat knocked a filled pitcher off a counter.* Filters: Only one filter is included with the Pur. The Pur filters are historically more expensive than Brita's, including here on Amazon.Pictured: This Pur pitcher alongside the the similarly-sized Brita Monterey 10 Cup. I use both of these at home.Pur filters work well, the water tastes great even if you had decent tap water already, so I won't reiterate the ""yay for filtered water!"" that many reviews already express. Especially for drinking plain (or for making coffee), it's always well worth using filtered water. And it's much cheaper than bottled water!This is a nice-looking pitcher, and Pur filters are particularly effective (if a bit slow).

"A party light with low-power LEDs that create alternating, spinning colored patterns.It's intended to be sound activated, but in practice I found the pattern varied regardless of ambient noise (ie, it changed on its own in a quiet room).

"This medium-sized version of the GRDE flashlight has a metal barrel with a camouflage pattern, and takes an 18650 battery (rather than an AA like the smaller version of the flashlight uses).The camo pattern I could do without, but the cool part of this flashlight is the zoomable head. That allows the beam to go from ""wide"" where it can evenly illuminate a large area (eg: most of 12 foot bedroom wall from about 10 feet away), all the way down to a focused, bright-white square at the ""narrow"" end.The even illumination is a pleasant surprise, most likely the outcome of the curved glass lens. It's unlike most LED flashlights, which have uneven light distribution with a bright center, and a dimly lit outer circle surrounding the bright spot. The ""square"" beam at the zoomed end of this flashlight's range looks a little unusual, but doesn't pose any problem (it so happens the LED itself is squarish). That zoomed beam has a decent range.Lightly pressing the power button switches between bright, dim, strobe, and SOS modes. I usually only bother with ""bright"".The medium-small barrel is a good size to hold, but the clip gets in the way (and doesn't seem very useful). I removed the clip by loosening the hex screws with a pair of pliers.The small version of the flashlight is very similar and uses a single common AA cell, but has a lot less light output, and is more awkward to hold. For the minor price difference, I like the medium-size a lot better.[ A free sample was provided to me in exchange for an honest review. ]Some people might find the unusual battery size off-putting, but its greater power output and capacity make for a brighter flashlight with staying power.

"Despite what you might expect from my title, and from its very thick manual, this rice cooker is exceedingly easy to use. That manual turns out to be mostly translations.To get the sort of fluffy, lightweight, unseasoned steamed rice that accompanies most East Asian cuisines (and some SE Asian as well), this is literally all you have to do:* Remove bowl from rice cooker* Use (included) measuring cup to measure rice* Add water and swish / drain a couple of times* Add water to the marking on the bowl.* Put bowl back, select ""plain"" (the original/default setting) and hit start.And done. It runs, and changes over to ""keep warm"" mode once the cycle is finished (30 minutes for plain white rice).Unlike the rice I've always made on the stovetop, the rice cooker method doesn't require any fat at all, making for an exceptionally light, fluffy rice that can then pick up the sauce and seasonings of whatever dish or condiment you prefer. You can also add seasonings, herbs, etc, to the bowl before cooking.There's a steaming tray (which can be used while making rice, or separately). It works reasonably well, but the capacity is low for an American appetite. For veggies, it holds enough for a side-dish for one, or rice addition for two, and definitely not enough for a main course.Cleanup is easy although hand-wash only (there's 3 parts that come out, and a steam outlet that may need cleaning periodically). There are a lot of warnings to be careful to not damage the non-stick finish of the main bowl's interior. There's a short spatula and short spoon included for loosening the rice.The warming mode is a major plus-- you don't have to time the rice to other dishes you might be making, and don't have to worry about the rice made in advance getting soggy, or cold and clumpy (though the instructions suggest loosening the rice as soon as it finishes cooking in the rice cooker, for optimal texture). And an even bigger plus, is not tying up a stovetop burner!My only quibbles are minor:* Small steaming tray* Some dripping from the lid, so you have to keep a towel handyThe unit draws a little more than 600W while running (measured at the wall), and periodically uses less than 100W during ""keep warm"" usage. Build seems solid, and the design is pleasing to the eye. The power-cord is a little longer than typical counter-top appliances.While I prefer the flavor and intensity of South Asian rice dishes (cooked with generous amounts of fat and spice), this Japanese-origin steamer is perfect for making lightweight steamed rice, without using much power. And more importantly, without needing attention.

"A USB battery with a sleek, clean design, and a lot of capacity.The hefty battery is contained in modern-looking white casing, with light-grey sides. There's the usual 2 outputs (1A and 2.1A), one input, 4 LEDs, and a power button (which doesn't affect charging the battery, but does affect charging any loads).It takes a while to charge-up a powerbank this size, but a power meter showed the battery drawing the full capacity from the 1.2A wall charger I was using. Similarly, my LG Nexus 5, which has a native 1.2A charger, charged as fast from this URPOWER's 2.1A outlet, as it would from the wall charger. At 12,000mAh, even with the expected 15-20% efficiency loss inherent in this battery technology, I should be able to recharge my Nexus5's 2300mAh battery about 4-5 times over.Quibbles:* A short USB-to-MicroUSB cable is included, but nothing for newer Lightning or USB-C connectors. Those cables aren't in the majority yet, but all of the variety has led some vendors to provide ""octopus"" multi-end cables with their USB products.* Only one USB output on this battery is 2.1A (the other is 1A). Since most newer devices accept charging rates over 1A (even my almost-2-year old LG Nexus 5 has a native 1.2A charger), it would be nice to have both outputs be 2A or greater.* I'd like more than 4 LEDs for a more granular display of capacity.But, my quibbles are true of most USB products I've seen recently, so I don't mark this URPOWER down for such minor nits.[ A free sample was provided to me in exchange for an honest review. ]I keep a decent USB battery in all of my bags (laptop, travel, camera, etc) and at all of my workspaces, and this one fits the ""decent"" billing for both design and capacity.

"Appreciation of or attraction to a certain scent is a subjective and relative experience. But there are certain scents that seem to have a near universal appeal.  Those include vanilla, citrus. cinnamon and musk.  But perhaps the most universally agreed upon agreeable scent is the floral group.  The delivery of a gift bouquet of flowers will always create the desired swoon to the recipient both for the delicate natural shapes and colors of nature, but also for the delicious scents they emanate.  The perfumers at Burberry have engineered a scent in this Brit Rhythm Floral that captures the subtle and sensuous tones of nature in just the right blend and strength to produce a near intoxicating effect.  Subtle but confident it conveys the same satisfying and pleasurable emotional response of inhaling a bouquet of roses and lavender. Light, pure, sensual, clean and natural are some adjectives that come to mind. Pretty and feminine are the next words that come to mind.  This is a scent that isn't reserved for a special niche as in a young business woman, or an evening scent or a mature scent.  It has a universal appeal that any age can wear in any circumstance.  It's neither sweet nor heavy but light and playful. It could easily become a woman's signature scent that a woman could appreciate on herself and her partner would immediately relate to and react to from walks past  gardens and ornate displays in high end hotel lobbies.  The scent is packaged in a bottle with an equally subtle design; a simple rectangular glass with a cut glass textured pattern on the surface and a background pink tint.  Like the scent itself, the bottle isn't overpowering or pretentiously trying to make a loud statement. It perfectly compliments this soft sensuous feminine scent.  Hopefully my description hasn't itself been too flowery, but as a male, I really like this scent and would notice and positively react to any woman that passed wearing it.  Honestly my favorite scent I've encountered in a long time. Again, scent and reactions are relative and subjective, but this is definitely a scent to get you subtly noticed and seen as a feminine, soft and positive female.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27E900F90JKU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q8HMWD2#wasThisHelpful","R27E900F90JKU2","A1VS1LL905P5L5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VS1LL905P5L5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Nuyu Sleep System is based on a simple idea and simple principles brought together to create a product that's completely new and innovative. Sleep isn't just a state of passive, unconscious inactivity. The body undergoes alternate states including fluctuating temperatures. Complicating that is the design of many modern mattresses made of dense foam that is comfortable and conforms to the body but often traps the body's heat, causing a sleeper to wake up to throw off sheets or even contributes to dehydration.  This NuYu System consists of a relatively small tank unit that's filled with water which is pumped through connecting tubing which is woven into a fabric pad. The fabric pad is to be placed under the bed sheets where your body rests.  The design principle is that your body heat is absorbed into the circulating water, the heat is carried away to the boxed tank under the bed where a fan cools the water before it is returned to the pad.  Theoretically, you control the unit via an app you download to your smartphone and instructions are exchanged via bluetooth.  I was impressed with everything from the packaging, the presentation during unboxing, the quality of the materials, and the simple directions.  The problem, at least with the unit I was shipped, is that the unit refused to pair with my Android phone. It wasn't a defect with my phone because bluetooth recognized the unit and identified it, it just said the unit would not communicate with it. I deleted the app and reloaded it several times. Before you actually are even allowed to attempt the pairing you are asked a number of questions to create a profile, gender, height, weight, age as well as email address and password, so it takes a bit of time. I wound up inputting this information dozens of time and it consumed several hours over the course of 3 days of attempts, hoping something had changed, to no avail.  I went to the product website and wrote of my difficulty asking for some direction.  The instructions promised that there would be a response within 3 business days. Those days came and went with no response which was surprising especially when I conveyed and that I had been sent this unit for evaluation purposes and was impressed with the initial materials, design and concept.  Perhaps they will still contact me, in which case I will update these comments. But for a product that is not inexpensive, to not be ready for prime time at least on the software and connectivity side, and then to not have a timely response with technical help, does not bode well for potential customers. I give it only one star at this point, although it's total lack of function really gives it zero functionality and value.  Perhaps I was sent a defective unit, but until there is some resolution I would warn potential purchasers from committing their money.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23MIB85WRGF47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X1INP3C#wasThisHelpful","R23MIB85WRGF47","A1VS1LL905P5L5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VS1LL905P5L5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The extensive role and importance of bacteria and microbia living in and on our bodies is just beginning to be understood. One science writer suggested that rather than the monolithic block of body cells that we identify as ""ourself"", we seem to more closely resemble a coral reef with symbiotic relationships existing throughout our systems. Bacteria help digest foods, manufacture vitamins used internally and even help produce neurotransmitters  like serotonin, so if they're absent or don't exist in an optimal balance it could result in a host of wellness issues including depression.  There are thousands of strains of bacteria that exist just in our gut, but evidently the role of a few are understood best and exist in greatest proportions. This product offers several of the most important strains and in great abundance. As in most things, it's better to receive living cultures in food products, but supplementation, at least short term, seems to be a good idea.  I have tried and used Probiotics from several companies in the past and it is, of course nearly impossible to verify their efficacy.  It makes sense that this product has a shielding mechanism to get the capsule past the stomach and it's powerful acids that effectively kills bacteria introduced.  Most people fail to realize that stomach acid plays a key roll in our immune defense system because it kills invasive bacteria hitchhiking on our food. Another reason why taking antacids is usually a bad idea. Neutralizing the acid allows harmful bacteria to get past the defense mechanism. I plan to test the product the only way I know how; to open a capsule and use it as a seed culture to make fresh yogurt. I used a different brand in the past in home made yogurt and it was hit or miss. Sometimes yogurt was produced and other times the milk never changed indicating the cultures in that pill were not alive.  I'll report the results after I perform that test, but this brand seems to offer more value than some competitors if it really does have so many live cultures in each capsule and the mechanism to deliver them into your gut where they can help set up an optimal balance again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCSQAC2HFXMX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFQS19K#wasThisHelpful","RCSQAC2HFXMX","A1VS1LL905P5L5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VS1LL905P5L5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've always balked at ""fake"" anything, but after a recent neighbor had their door kicked in and were robbed, I wanted something asap to make a potential thief at lest think twice about an unexpected visit. I didn't have the time to research, no less install a real security system, so looked for something as a quick stopgap security measure.  This plastic unit looked promising from all the positive reviews, but the price seemed to guarantee disappointment. It arrived a few days later and lo-and-behold it's design and build are pretty convincing. It's all assembled, just open the small ""door"" on top and insert the 9v battery. The red LED immediately begins it's regular pulsing and behind the smoked glass it really is tough to detect if that's a real camera inside or not. It comes with two plastic anchors that you push into the ceiling after drilling the two mounting holes. Insert the two supplied screws leaving a few millimeters raised above level. Then put the housing onto the screw heads and give a slight turn to mount in place. Total installation took just a few minutes. That's all there is to it. If I had just one suggestion for the manufacturer it would be to include a mounting paper template showing the location of the screws. Since one is not included just put the dome on top of a piece of paper and draw a circle around the perimeter. Flip the paper over and locate the hole openings and make a mark or just punch your pencil through. Now hold the template you just made against the ceiling and mark the hole locations to assure correct spacing.  To make things more convincing I also ordered Security Decal - 4 Pack #204 here on Amazon. Also looks menacing and serious. I've since ordered a real wireless camera system which will take the place of this fake one, but to be honest, I think just the fear of being observed and taped would have been enough to stick with the fake only.  If the real camera system that cost hundreds proves disappointing and needs to be returned, I'll keep this dome at the ready.

"The past few years I've pared back taking supplements preferring to work harder at eating a healthy balanced diet. But when a product seems to ""make sense"" I opt to give it a try and see if any difference is detectible in my wellbeing. Vitamin D is a great example since medical authorities all seem to agree most of us are woefully deficient. I imagined I was fairly well informed about health issues but magnesium was never even remotely on my radar screen, being a trace mineral. I also was aware that minerals often have an issue being bioavailable, as is most notably the case with calcium supplements. Anyway, after learning that magnesium is deficient in many of our diets and what functions it plays a roll in, (for me as an insomniac, sleep regulation was key) I decided to give this product a try especially since it's chelated and claims to be more bioavailable.  The results of use can be a tricky thing to quantify since there are so many variables in our diet, stress levels and day to day activities, plus there's the placebo effect to skew actual results.  All that being said, I seemed to notice a difference especially in my sleep immediately. My sleep seemed natural and even and I woke up refreshed. Perhaps it's coincidence, but I tried to see results in a somewhat scientific way by not altering any other variables or introducing any new lifestyle changes. As of now, I feel enthusiastic about the product from what seems to be noticeable results. the only factor worth mentioning si that the pills are very large, in fact the largest of any I've ever taken except perhaps for fish oil capsules. If you have trouble swallowing larger pills, this will be something to consider. At the moment, I'm rating this with five stars.

"Every dermatologist I've ever talked to agrees that the starting point of maintaining more youthful skin is protecting it from sun damage. Broad spectrum SPF of at least 30 is recommended, which this happily contains. It spread over my skin very easily without any uneven chalkiness and was absorbed remarkably quickly without leaving any greasy residue. But many other products do the same thing. What attracted me to this cream was the claim of helping to erase dark spot discolorations. Looking over the ingredient list as a nonscientist, I still noticed there were no ingredients specifically designed to dye or lighten the skin. That's a good thing as I've read cautionary warnings about those chemicals.  What's the science behind this product then? From my unprofessional eye, it seems to lie in a twofold approach. First I noticed two types of mild acid, especially salicylic . These help loosen upper layer dead skin sells for exfoliation.  The other most notable ingredient being niacinamide, (vitamin B3). Past reading of scientific research on B3 supports the claim of it's ability to rejuvenate skin to a more healthy youthful appearance.  On the minus side, the second ingredient listed is alcohol, which universally is considered a drying agent for skin that can cause irritation and flaking. All that being said, did I find any difference after a few weeks of daily use. Though a few weeks is a brief time, I can report seeing a subtle difference in my skin and perhaps the beginnings of sun spot lightening. From my brief usage, can I recommend this cream/ serum? Despite the alcohol I would say yes, due to it's protective SPF, ease of absorption and noticeable results. Why just 4 start and not 5? The price is a bit high, and I believe the main results are attributable to the Niacinamide. Do a search on Niacinamide creams on Amazon and you will find several offerings that come in higher concentrations in larger quantities at a fraction of the price. I won't recommend any in particular though I have tried several and found the results they produced remarkable. Of course, if you choose to buy one of those instead, you still need to purchase a high quality broad spectrum SPF of 30 or more for protection. Everyone's skin and sensitivity is different, of course, so the results of any product vary widely. As an all in one solution, albeit a bit expensive it's worth purchasing to see your particular results. For those who want to experiment, I would also encourage trying other Niacinamide creams to see how they react with your skin. Additionally, I personally have found remarkable results with night creams containing glycolic acid, my present favorite being Glycolix 20% facial cream, which has been very effective in encouraging exfoliation, though, always start with a milder percentage and work higher to build a tolerance and note your individual reaction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34YE05X50MAYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M0V083Q#wasThisHelpful","R34YE05X50MAYS","A1VS1LL905P5L5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VS1LL905P5L5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes it's just impossible to put the controller down and I've found myself pulling all nighter gaming sessions. Unless your system is setup in some isolated setting, you're going to disturb sleeping family members and neighbors, if you're a compulsive gamer, so thank goodness for wireless headsets. Previously I've had to settle for using a headset with a ridiculously long cable connection, so the Afterglow AG9 really is an incredible increase in freedom for me. Setup is really a no brainer. While the headset had a partial charge out of the box I preferred to charge it overnight before I set anything up. The Mic is detachable so can be left uninstalled when playing solo. Simply plug in the USB connector into the PS4. A small led will blink and then turn solid when it is paired with the headset. It's pre-paired out of the box, though you can re-pair it with the simple push of a button on the side of the USB connector. That's really all there is to it!  You can go into settings on your console to adjust the volume of the mic if you want and I did to experiment but it's preset to 3 out of 5 and is sufficient as is.  Range was more than adequate and it worked anywhere I moved in the area of my console. As to sound, it's crisp and clear without cutouts or static. You have the choice of the sound as is or if you press the mode button on the headset for a few seconds you'll hear an ascending tone indicating you've chosen the base enhanced mode. It doesn't make it overly boomy, just a variation according to your personal taste.  Battery life is reported to be 16 hours and from my use so far that seems like it should hold to be true.  The AG 9 is designed to work with your laptop as well so I plugged it into my Macbook Pro and again it worked lawlessly.  One caveat and disappointment is that I had hoped it would also work with my PS3 system as well. I searched all the documentation I could find and no mention was made of that compatibility. After frustrating try and system tweaks, I can report, no it is not compatible with PS3. If another reviewer or the manufacturer disagrees with this then I would love to learn how to make it function. But after endless tries, I could not get it to work and as the box says, it's for the PS4. I gave it 5 stars because for the price I think it's a good value and functions well.  As for comfort, it's not featherweight, but I adapted and didn't mind the feel. The ear cups are supple and are actually larger then the Bose Noise canceling headset I have so they fit over my hears without binding or pinching. So for the price point, ease of setup, sound quality and relative comfort, I believe it's a good buy and will help keep the peace on those late night gaming sessions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BKE3ISXHJG6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016K12406#wasThisHelpful","R1BKE3ISXHJG6S","A1VS1LL905P5L5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VS1LL905P5L5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The only thing worse than discovering that you left the house without your smartphone is to notice your battery is at 10% and you're about to be cut off from civilization! It's become a competitive segment with dozens of choices in all sides and shapes, so how does this HP stack up in it's utility? Size wise, it's optimal at about 4 1/4"" x 2 1/2"" x 1"" or so, slightly smaller than a playing card, so it fits comfortably in your bag or even your pocket. It's covered in a non slip vinyl jacket that's pleasant to touch  and is a neutral gray color. The end caps are flat on both ends which is nice because there are no complicated indentations that might trap dust or debris. The top end cap has two USB openings to charge up to two devices simultaneously. Between them is a micro usb port to plug in a charger, which is not included, but likely your phone charger will suffice to fill that roll. There's a hairline thin led light strip that indicates how much charge the pack has left, and illuminates when you push the single button on it's broad side. It's rated at 7600 mAH and the HP says that's enough power to recharge most any smart phone 3 times. I waited until my Note 4 battery was completely empty and charged it back up with this Pack and afterward the pack indicated it was still 3/4 full, so plenty of utility to get through the day.  At the price on Amazon it's very affordable especially considering the price of buying spare OE batteries for your phone, plus these packs aren't device specific so, of course you can charge your tablet or other device as well.  I've accumulated several of these packs and all have functioned well.  One other device worth considering that I like even better than this HP is the iFrogz Golite Traveler, 9000mAh Portable Charger and FlashlightI like the materials and construction a bit better, it has a higher capacity and it even includes a small LED flashlight bulb if you need some discrete illumination in a pinch. That model is however about a dozen dollars more.  The HP in conclusion is solidly built with a functional albeit plain design, has sufficient go power to recharge your phone 3-4 times and comes at an attractive price. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ESJSFWGUN3KJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X8JGTOG#wasThisHelpful","R3ESJSFWGUN3KJ","A1VS1LL905P5L5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VS1LL905P5L5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"No mater how many pairs of reading glasses I own, I never seem to have any close at hand when I need them. The very small footprint of these makes it more likely that I'll keep them in a pocket or throw them in my luggage when traveling. The glasses have hinges allowing the arms to fold in half as well as a hinge on the nose bridge. Construction isn't robust, so constantly folding and unfolding them, especially in a hurry worries me that I might break them, but keeping them light and portable is the whole point of their design so I can't deduct points for that. The lenses aren't as narrow as some compact models but you're still likely to wear them perched lower on your nose. The case is very sturdy  and should endure the abuse of being tossed in bags and entombed in pockets containing keys and change.  These aren't my go to glasses, but rather my second string choice when I cant locate the ones I really want to use. But for the few dollars they cost they have proved to be handy and lifesavers in a pinch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QB5Y6VUHP3C3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UI494B4#wasThisHelpful","R1QB5Y6VUHP3C3","A1VS1LL905P5L5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VS1LL905P5L5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a comprehensive program that provides a framework for establishing a fitness regimen, including both diet and exercise information and instruction. Kettle balls have been around for a long time but were largely neglected in favor or conventional barbells and dumbbells. Their resurgence is a owed to their ergonomic design and ease of use without causing undue stress especially on joints. The set includes dvd's for a variety of routines and fitness levels.  It's ideal for a busy person who doesn't have the time to drive to a gym or simply prefers to exercise in the privacy of their own home. The set also includes a strap for stretching muscles especially during warmup and warm down and a styrofoam roller to massage muscles and back. The strap is adequate as is the roller although I found the roller to be extremely rudimentary and would suggest purchasing one that is more sturdy. All in all, this is s good basic program that will work up a sweat and improve flexibility and muscle tone if followed over time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HNLH60FUBVMX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFP51PY#wasThisHelpful","R3HNLH60FUBVMX","A1VS1LL905P5L5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VS1LL905P5L5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've turned to Brother for most of my printing needs and have found their products rock solid, mostly intuitive and generally good values. So I had high expectations for this Wireless Label Maker. It's use was intended for home organizational applications and not an office environment, so mainly I was looking for convenience; keeping it plugged in and accessing my network for a quickly produced label without dragging out one of the label makers I have stored away.  The unit itself is solidly constructed and has a small footprint, roughly 3""  by 6"" by 5 1/2"" high. It can be used with 4 AA batteries or plugged in. Label tape cartridges can be inserted by a side door in the unit. Connecting it to my network actually went very smoothly. The problem, at least in my interaction, was using the software to print a label from my Macbook. Many reviewers made mention as to the learning curve, but my initial usage left me baffled. When connected via USB cable or wirelessly, and I select this as the printer to use, none of the settings seem to allow me to print from a tape cartridge and the size of the cartridge tape doesn't seem to be automatically recognized. On the plus column, once you download an app for, I'm my case, an Android device, the unit functioned very well, including automatically knowing what size tape cartridge was inserted. I hated to give such a lack luster rating of 3 stars, but used in conjunction with my laptop the results were abysmal and the software is extremely unintuitive. Used with my Android phone, it worked brilliantly and should be a 5 star device. For the average person looking for a label printer, I feel much more comfortable recommending the brilliant Brother PTD400AD. It's half the price, though not a wi-fi model. the interface and operation are extremely to use and the labels are great. If you insist you need something wireless and plan to use your portable device with an app, then you should be fairly happy purchasing this. If the wireless feature isn't imperative, why not save some money and look at the Brother PTD400AD.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FJ48Q7XIO1TC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JHME7W4#wasThisHelpful","R2FJ48Q7XIO1TC","A1VS1LL905P5L5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VS1LL905P5L5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember as a child, riding a broom stick with a horse head and imagining I was galloping in the old west. Toys have gotten light years more sophisticated as these Ironman gloves attest to. Very well made with a silicone-like material so should be durable. Turn on the slider switch on one glove, press the center button to activate and your little super hero is ready to go. It has some kind of motion detector inside so when he raises his arm and points his open hand, a charging sound begins. When it reaches it's peak. he can fire with hand thrusts and hear the laser pulses. Lowering his arm turns out the center light until his next encounter with a bad guy and need to defend the universe. Operates on just one battery that's included. Uncertain how long that lasts yet. But I do know, giving these to a five year old creates as much excitement as if someone handed me keys to a new car. Only one glove has the mechanism, but that seems to be enough to transport a child into his imaginary word and opens up countless adventures.

"This is a small, effective, basic fan. The term ""industrial"" is curious since the construction might better be described as petite, though durable if handled with care. The frame and base are a light gauge metal which make the unit light weight for transport and storage. The motor does seem solid, which is the heart of a fan and it seems balanced because there is no vibration and it's very quiet. The housing can be angled though there is no tightening mechanism to lock it in place though it seems to stay put. The 3 speed adjustment is on the back of the fan and is well made since that's the part you'll be twisting each time it's used. The fan does move an impressive amount of air for its small size.

"I was intrigued by this product because I had never heard of cleansing oil. I googled ""cleansing with oil"" and read some unbiased articles and opinions to get a sense of the logic involved here. Light oils applied to the face combine with the sebum naturally produced and maybe now hardened in your pores to help dilute and loosen them. When you then wipe or rinse all that off, dirt and impurities trapped there are removed but your skin, the largest organ in your body isn't left devoid of oil. If it detects oil is gone completely, as happens with severe scrubbing or using soaps or chemicals that dissolve oils, the skin sometimes overcompensates and exacerbates the problem. Leaving a layer of clean oil coating the skin eliminates that problem. So cleansing oil isn't the latest sales gimmick, but actually makes a lot of sense. Generations of cultures did this with especially olive oil for centuries. Getting back to this L'Occitan product, the label lists the first ingredient as sunflower oil. At first that seemed disappointing since the label emphasizes the word Shea. But sunflower oil is lighter with less fatty acids and so feels silkier and makes a better carrier oil to penetrate into the pores and dissolve/combine with the skin's sebum impacted there. Shea is listed lower in the ingredients but at just 5% is enough to offer it's lubricating and softening properties. As far as the mechanics, you're instructed to put perhaps a quarter's sized amount in your palms and rub your hands together, this warms the oil, and apply it to the face. Massage it into the skin. Add some water and the surface becomes a thin milky film. Massage a bit more then rinse off. My skin felt silky smooth and very clean without feeling oily at all. Some websites recommended using this cleansing method perhaps 3 times a week as opposed to every day. Cost and value wise, since you use such a small amount of product each use, it should last a very long time, several months, so while not cheap seems reasonable. Several oils are mentioned in the articles as good choices for oil cleansing with sunflower being recommended as the main ingredient and either castor oil or shea highly recommended at smaller proportions. You can buy those oils separately for about a dollar an ounce and experiment with your own concoctions at a considerable savings. But seeing how long lasting this product should be, I think I'll just leave the mixing to L'Occitane. I'm impressed with this new product and method that evidently is the new rage in facial cleansing based on the buzz I saw online.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I33G1MZVUKX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QTCRERK#wasThisHelpful","R1I33G1MZVUKX2","A1VS1LL905P5L5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VS1LL905P5L5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since I discovered Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps, it's become the only soap I imagine I'll ever use again! I appreciate the philosophy and business practices of the company. But the products themselves are wonderful. The pure castile soap is fairly long lasting, has a wonderful peppermint aroma that wakes me up in the morning and is also very stimulating to the skin. It rinses off seemingly without leaving any residue and my skin feels squeaky clean but without chemical harshness or stripping natural oils. If you've never tried these soaps, do yourself a favor and buy a bar.

"It seems that there are endless choices when you're looking for phone cover these days. My last Galaxy Note, I opted for the book style cover with the clear window that allows you to access certain features with the cover still closed. It was expensive and there were several things I didn't care for. Most of all, the window always seemed cloudy and so dirty. It offered some protection around the perimeter and I did have some small falls damage free, but it always seemed under protected. I didn't want some massive case like an Otterbox that offers great protection but makes phones seem massive. I love the Note because it is so elegant and slim and I didn't want to destroy that esthetic. This case is made by Samsung so I knew fitment would be perfect and it seemed to add very little bulk to the phone. I received it and have to say that I couldn't be happier with it. I love the design change of the phone having a metal edge now, but oddly, I found it uncomfortable to grip and was always afraid I might from it. This cover has a very grippy feel that gives me hugely greater confidence in holding it. The back has an understated pattern that likewise gives it some frictional holding power if you lay it on a hard surface, so there's less chance of it sliding off if the surface shifts. The fitment is indeed perfect and although the edges are much more protected now it isn't at the cost of making it appear bulky at all. I still can see and appreciate almost the entire face of the phone and it's esthetic. The side adjustment buttons are very flexible and don't impede the functions of those buttons. The cutouts around the openings are very generous so inserting the micro USB cable to charge is very accessible and never clumsy. Likewise, it's very easy to pull out the Note's pen and never a wrestling match.There are small details I appreciate, as in a tiny lip below the speaker opening in the back so if you lay the phone down the opening is slightly raised not to impede sound. The same with the opening around the camera lens, there's a raised ridge so you won't accidentally damage the lens or get it wet when you lay the phone down.  I bought a second, much more expensive leather, book style case which I love for it's style, frontal protection and luxurious leather smell.  But I find myself using this case maybe 90% of the time. If you're debating which case to get for your Note, features and taste are relative. But for me, at least, I can't recommend it highly enough. Extremely satisfied.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QB6XYE4607WH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NP3K8Y2#wasThisHelpful","R2QB6XYE4607WH","A1VS1LL905P5L5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VS1LL905P5L5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everyone has several Micro USB cables stashed around for charging and connecting their phones and devices and it's often a hated cable for several reasons. One of the complaints with this kind of cable is how fragile the small plug can be and is frequently damaged. Likewise, the wires themselves can be flimsy and prone to break internally since they're usually handled roughly, thrown into bags and pockets. I've often found Anker cables to be much higher quality than some other brands so sent for this 3 foot cable to use in conjunction with my Samsung Galaxy Note phone. I like the relatively short length to use when charging on a night stand and not having say, and extra few feet dangling, waiting to be snagged and knocked over. Also, those times I'm running low on power and want to charge the phone using an external battery, and likewise don't want a long cable. This cable is very heavy duty and I suspect will be much less prone to damage or breakage. It's .9mm diameter also makes it less prone to tangling into itself which is a huge plus. At only about $5, it's also cheaper than OEM cables, but offers the same or superior build quality. If you're shopping for a shorter Micro USB to USB cable, you can buy this one with confidence.

"I looked for a portable hanger to use in three places. First, to hang my jacket in my car while driving to work instead of just throwing it on a seat. Second, because I'm on airplanes weekly and likewise like to hang my jacket as well. For some reason, especially in winter months when everyone has protective clothing with them, airplanes seem to never have enough hangers. And third, most hotels have reverted to those weird antitheft hangers in their closets. If I want to have a suit wrinkle free by hanging it on a shower curtain rod to get steamed, those weird hangers in the closet just don't work. There really weren't many options out there but I saw this on on Amazon so decided to give it a try. When it arrived in the mail, I imagined they sent the wrong item since the package was so small. but there it was. It's amazingly compact, so that I can just leave it in my inside jacket pocket between uses and I hardly know it's there. It's well made and though folds instantly, it isn't flimsy or fragile so I expect to get years of service out of it. The one negative was that it was shipped from Japan and took something like a month to be delivered!  I suppose I just wasn't paying attention and ordered from the wrong vendor on Amazon, so take notice before ordering as to how long it says until delivery.  All in all, it's a terrific little innovation and I couldn't be happier with it's construction, tiny folded size, an utility.

"In October 2013, nine-year-old Amira Willighagen amazed and delighted classical music fans with her performance of “O mio babbino caro” in Holland’s Got Talent.  The video of her performance on Youtube received more than 35 million hits worldwide to-date.  Her first album Amira, published on March 2014, was a resounding success, reaching number 7 on the US Billboard Classical Chart.Her latest CD “Merry Christmas” is her second album, released on November 13 this year in the US just in time for the holiday season.  Besides the familiar Christmas carols, Amira sings several well-known arias and sacred hymns:Ave verum corpus (Hail True Body) (Mozart) –  an Eucharistic hymn in Latin to celebrate the feast of Corpus Christi (Body of Christ), set to music by Wolfgang Amadeus MozartBist du bei mir (If you are with me) – an aria attributed to Johann Sebastian Bach.  It is from Bach’s “Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach”, a manuscript of keyboard music and a few arias presented by the German composer to his second wife Anna MagdalenaNulla in mundo pax (In this world there is no honest peace) – a sacred motet (choral music) in Latin composed by Antonio VivaldiAve Maria (Hail Mary) (Vavilov/Caccini)– a Catholic prayer in Latin to the Virgin Mary, set to music by the Russian composer Vladimir Vavilov around 1970.  Some music historians attribute the music to the 17th century Italian composer Giulio CacciniPie Jesu (Pious Jesus) (Fauré) – a Latin hymn in Gabriel Fauré's Requiem (Mass for the Dead)Panis angelicus (Angelic Bread) (Franck) – a Latin hymn written by St. Thomus Aquinas for the feast of Corpus Christi, set to music by the Belgium composer César FranckSancta Maria (Holy Mary) (Mascagni) – a prayer to the Holy Mother, set to music by the Italian composer Pietro MascagniLittle Amira Willighagen has an amazing singing voice. Even more amazing is that she was singing opera arias by the age of nine without having any formal training. She is a natural, but she does need professional training for further development. As far as I know, Maike van de Wiel was her singing coach in 2014, in preparation of and during the production of her first CD Amira.  As gifted a singer as she is, Amira is still a child.  Her classical singing style places tremendous stress on her immature vocal cord and larynx. I surely hope that the adults around her have the wisdom to guide her on the proper technique so that she will grow up to be a successful classical singer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4XVM8F8P695D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014QHQSYE#wasThisHelpful","R4XVM8F8P695D","A1D9V11QUHXENQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D9V11QUHXENQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ave Maria by Anita Bryant is the English version of La Novia (The Bride), written in 1958 by the Chilean musician Joaquin Prieto with Spanish lyrics. The English lyrics were written by Fred Lay. Many recordings of La Novia were made, both in Spanish and English.  Among the English recordings, Ave Maria by Anita Bryant is one of the most successful ones, the most popular being The Wedding by Julie Rogers.  However, artistically, Anita Bryant's Ave Maria rivals Julie Rogers' The Wedding.  Anita Bryant is a powerful singer.  Her rendition of Ave Maria embodies the joy and elation of the bride whose dream of walking down the aisle with the man she loves finally comes true (See Note). See my comment below for the lyrics of this beautiful song.Note: The lyrics of the English version and the original Spanish version of this song are very different in content. In many articles, Fred Lay is listed as the translator of the lyrics, but the truth is that he re-wrote the lyrics, giving them entirely different meaning. While the English lyrics show the joy and elation of the bride in her wedding, the original Spanish lyrics express the sorrow and regret of a failed suitor of the bride in her wedding. It is terribly depressing.

Many recordings of La Novia were made, both in Spanish and English, but, in my opinion, this 1964 Julie Rogers version The Wedding is the definitive recording that put the song on the chart and in the consciousness of music lovers of the world. Julie Rogers' powerful rendition of the song embraces the joy and elation of the bride whose dream of walking down the aisle with the man she loves finally comes true (See Note). See my comment below for the lyrics of this beautiful song.Note: The lyrics of the English version and the original Spanish version of this song are very different in content. In many articles, Fred Lay is listed as the translator of the lyrics, but the truth is that he re-wrote the lyrics, giving them entirely different meaning.  While the English lyrics show the joy and elation of the bride in her wedding, the original Spanish lyrics express the sorrow and regret of a failed suitor of the bride in her wedding.  It is terribly depressing.  I like the English version better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HHF1MZPQH036/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007X3SCUW#wasThisHelpful","R2HHF1MZPQH036","A1D9V11QUHXENQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D9V11QUHXENQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Scotch 414/DC Extreme Mounting Tape works well outdoors.  More than a month ago, I used this tape to mount two 7 x 11-inch plastic signs on the exterior of my house, one on a block wall and one on a stucco wall.  I lined the entire perimeter of each sign with the tape to afford the signs plenty of holding power. The signs are holding fast so far. The tape stood up to the desert sun and a couple of monsoons with no problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VM0T6P8Y13LE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NP1JQC#wasThisHelpful","R3VM0T6P8Y13LE","A1D9V11QUHXENQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D9V11QUHXENQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BIG, HEAVY, AND LOADED WITH FEATURESThis Pioneer VSX-90 Receiver is big, measuring 17 inches long, 12-3/4 inches deep, and 6-1/2 inches high and takes up the lion's share of shelf space.  It is also heavy, weighing about 20 pounds. It takes a strong back to move it around.  It is loaded with features.  It will take some time for a new user to explore all of them and make all the necessary connections.  It can be intimating to an average user like myself.THE VIDEOI don't have a home theater.  I use the VSX-90 in my game room/home office to connect a Dell computer, a Samsung BD/DVD player, a PS3, a PS4, and a Xbox 360 game console to a Dell 24-inch 1920 X 1200 Ultra Sharp monitor.  The VSX 90 comes with 6 HDMI sockets on the back panel and a single HDMI socket in front, which are perfect for connecting my equipment, since they all came with HDMI connections.  HDMI carries not only video but audio as well, thus eliminating the need of audio input cables.  The VSX-90 supposedly supports 4K2K Ultra HD video, which translates into 4096 x 2160 pixels or 4 times the resolution of the 2048 x 1080 Full HD.  Ultra HD is necessary for monitors or HDTVs with screens larger than 55 inches.  In my case, Ultra HD is not going to make any difference on my 24-inch monitor.The VSX-90 is compatible with the newest HDCP 2.2 protocol, which stands for High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection. At the VSX-90 back panel, the HDMI sockets labeled BD, DVD, SAT/CBL and HDMI OUT are HDCP 2.2 compliant. HDCP compliance is necessary to play the newest Blu-Ray discs and other protected digital contents.For connecting a DVD player or other equipment with no HDMI outputs, there are RCA and component video inputs, RCA audio inputs, as well as optical and coaxial digital audio inputs at the VSX-90 back panel.THE AUDIOI am currently using a pair of inexpensive bookshelf speakers.  With the VSX-90, I might upgrade my sound equipment to a modest 5.1-channel home theater speaker system.  For the uninitiated, a 5.1-channel system consists of 5 speakers and 1 subwoofer.  The VSX-90 supports 5.1, 5.2, 7.1, and 7.2-channel systems with up to 7 speakers and 2 subwoofers.  The passive un-powered speakers are connected to the VSX-90 back panel via twisted speaker wires or banana plugs.  The powered subwoofers with their own built-in amplifiers are connected to the two subwoofer pre-outs with RCA connectors.  The VSX-90 supports 6 to 16-ohm passive speakers, with 100 watts per channel at 8 ohms or 165 watts at 6 ohms.  It will not support 4-ohm speakers.The VSX-90 comes with the newest Dolby ATMOS sound technology.  In a commercial setting, Dolby ATMOS accommodates up to 128 audio tracks and the associated pan metadata to simulate 3-dimensional static and dynamic sound.  In a commercial cinema equipped with Dolby ATMOS, the sound equipment sends audio signals to various pre-positioned speakers in rapid successions to simulate sound traveling across 3-D space, for example, the roar of a jet whizzing by.  To take advantage of the VSX-90 Dolby ATMOS technology in a home environment, the user must deploy Dolby ATMOS enabled speakers, which have the ability to project sound to the ceiling.  These speakers are way beyond my means.  They are for people in the top pay grades.iPOD, iPHONE, and HEADPHONEFor those users who own iPods or iPhones, there is an iPod/iPhone terminal at the front panel for audio playback.  I connected my iPod Classic G7 to the terminal via the iPod USB cable and it sounded great.  There is also a standard phone jack at the front panel for headphone connection.THE FRONT PANEL CONTROLS AND THE REMOTEThe front panel controls look simple enough.  There are two large knobs on the sides, with the left knob for input selection and the right knob for volume control.  At the upper center is a digital display.  Below are buttons for speaker selection, multi-zone control, tuner control etc.  An infrared line-of-sight remote comes with the purchase.  It duplicated front panel functions.OTHER FEATURESThere are other features of the VSX-90 I have yet to explore and am unlikely to use in the near future.  The more prominent ones are described below briefly:(1) Multi-zones--There is the multi-zone option, in which the VSX-90 sends video and audio signals via connecting cables to audio/video equipment in two other rooms. With the multi-zone option, the same source can be played simultaneously in the main zone and the subzones, with certain restrictions.  This can be done with different sources as well.(2) AM & FM antennae--There are connections for an external FM radio antenna and an AM radio loop antenna.(3) Networking--The VSX-90 can be connected to a home network via an Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi with dual antennae for extended range.(4) MCACC Technology--MCACC stands for Multi-Channel Acoustic Calibration System.  This technology is unique to Pioneer sound equipment.  A microphone monitors the sound environment of the user's room and an equalizer automatically adjusts the sound parameters.  The microphone comes with the purchase and plugs into a 3.5mm socket at the front panel.  The exact procedure is described in the manual.(5) MHL compatibility--MHL stands for Mobile High-Definition Link.  It is a industry standard that enable consumers to connect mobile phones, tablets, and other portable consumer electrons to HDTVs to display 3D/Full-HD videos, HD multi-channel audio and HD photos.  There is a HDMI socket at the back panel of the VSX-90 labeled 6 MHL for connection to a mobile device via a MHL cable.(6) HMDI ARC--ARC stands for Audio Return Channel.  Some TVs come with this feature.  When the TV is connected to the VSX-90 via a HDMI cable, the audio of the TV can be sent back to the receiver via the connecting HDMI cable through the VSX-90 HDMI OUT 1 terminal.  To activate this function, the user must set ARC to ON during HDMI setup at the VSX-90.(7)  Bluetooth and Airplay--These are handy functions for wireless connections to the VSX-90.(8)  Internet radio and music--The VSX-90 is vTune, Pandora, and Spotify ready.ONLINE MANUALA VSX-90 manual in pdf format is available for download.  Read it up before ordering:http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/StaticFiles/Manuals/Home/VSX-90_OperatingInstructions032715.pdfVIDEO AND AUDIO QUALITYThe video quality on my Dell 24-inch Ultra-sharp monitor is superb. The audio sounds good in my inexpensive bookshelf speakers.  I cannot say how good the video looks in a 75"" Ultra HD TV monitor or how good the audio sounds in a 7.2 channel home theater system.  Nor can I comment on the quality of the VSX-90 Dolby ATOMS technology.  I don't have the equipment to do so.  I have to leave them to other reviewers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q2AQG0OGSKVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V84S2AW#wasThisHelpful","R2Q2AQG0OGSKVE","A1D9V11QUHXENQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D9V11QUHXENQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Miele Complete C2 vacuum is small and light for a full function vacuum. It measures 19 inches long, 10 inches wide, and 8-1/2 inches tall, weighing about 11 pounds without any attachment.The purchase includes a metallic telescopic wand, a flexible air hose, and a curved plastic handle in between. The length of the telescopic wand can be adjusted by holding down the release button on the wand and pulling or retracting the extension. There is an air-vent on the wand to temporarily decrease the suction during vacuuming.The Miele Complete C2 also comes with two large floor brushes. One of them has a rotating brush and is powered by air, not an electric motor, thus making it light and maneuverable. There is an air vent on top of this powered brush, which can be open to improve airflow for deep pile carpet. The other brush is unpowered and has stiff bristles around the perimeter at the bottom. They can be retracted or lowered by a foot switch on top of the floor brush. Retract the bristles for carpets and rugs, and lower them for hard floors.The power cord assembly has a power-retract feature. The cord assembly automatically locks when the user pulls the cord out and retracts upon a push of the power-retract bar on top the vacuum. Opposite to the power-retract bar is the power ON-OFF bar. A dial switch regulates the speed of the motor, with various settings for curtains, upholstery, deep pile carpets, etc. as indicated by line symbols on top of the vacuum.The filter compartment can be accessed by lifting a release bar. Besides the usual filter bag, there is an exhaust air filter as well. The manual states that the bag and air filter should last for a year with normal use. On top of the filter compartment is the accessory compartment, with a crevice nozzle, an upholstery nozzle, and a dusting brush.When the job is done, the brush with the wand attached can be parked at the side of the canister.  There are two parking slots, one on each side, which the brush with the wand can latch onto.  It is a thoughtful design.The Miele Complete C2 is powerful at its maximum setting. I can hear the clicking of dirt particles hitting the inside of the metal wand as they are vacuumed up. It is small and light for what it can do. I was especially impressed by the air-powered brush. It is light and much more maneuverable than one powered by an electric motor. I am very pleased with the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LEUTVOX01V4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00US4DNMU#wasThisHelpful","R3LEUTVOX01V4O","A1D9V11QUHXENQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D9V11QUHXENQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Plus Guard Roller Stamp does the job of hiding your ID by camouflage.  The user rolls the stamp on the document, which prints small letters over the characters, thus making them unreadable.  The smaller the type the document is in, the more effective the stamp is.  For large types, repeated rolling is necessary to cover up the characters.This stamp works well on absorbent bond paper but fails when used on glossy or coated paper like the address labels on Amazon boxes, contrary to the product description on the web page.  The letters on the glossy address label stand out against the thin ink of the stamp.  Furthermore, the stamp is about ½ inch wide.  It may be too wide for documents with small types, if the user wants to leave the document readable except for an occasional word or sentence.  For glossy and coated paper and for the purpose of redacting, I recommend a redacting pen.

"From a distance, this UDC4 fake camera looks reasonably real, but upon close inspection, it is betrayed by its flimsy plastic construction.  Furthermore, the plastic integral mount has very limited movement, making the camera difficult to aim.  The title on the web page touts ""30 Illuminating LEDs"" and the picture shows a circle of red LEDs, but the camera I received on 4/25/15 has only one red blinking light, which makes it look fake.  A newer batch may have ""30 illuminating LEDs"" but I cannot confirm that.

"It is hard to tell that this Swann ADS-180 Camera is a fake without prior knowledge or the user connecting it to power and a TV. This is so for one simple reason: this camera is the actual body of a functional ADS-180 camera, minus a real lens and the electronic. Kids looking for trouble on their way home from school wouldn't be able to tell that it is fake.  An experienced prowler at night, on the other hand, may realize it because the fake infrared LEDs do not light up.This dummy ADS-180 camera is made of metal, measuring approximately 3-1/4 inches long and 2-3/8 inches across, excluding the mount. The wires and the two connectors are real. A metallic camera mount comes with the purchase, together with three screws, three plastic anchors, and four 2-1/2 x 2-1/2 inch decals.

"Unlike the nail clipper sets bought in discount stores, which are mostly made of chrome plated ferrous metal, this Zwilling J.A.

It comes with a plastic sleeve, which serves as a clipping holder.  The clipper slides in and out of the sleeve smoothly.  Personally, I prefer to use the clipper without the sleeve.

"Parallels is a 2015 digital film made by writer/director Christopher Leone for Fox Digital Studios.  It was first released through Netflix around March 2015.It is the story of a group of people traveling to alternate earths through a mysterious portal called “The Building”.  The idea is apparently based on the theory of Many Worlds Interpretation in quantum mechanics, which states that all possible timelines that can exist do, each representing a different world with its own history and future, and that all possible outcomes of an event are realized in these worlds.Unlike the big budget Hollywood sci-fi movies with eye-popping special effects, Parallels holds the viewers’ interest through its intriguing story.  The film has the look a television pilot, with many threads and few answers, which leaves the viewers wanting.  Some reviewers mistook the film as a “failed pilot” but it is not – Fox Digital is not a TV studio.  However, the filmmaker obviously is hoping that a TV studio may pick up the story of Parallels and turn it into a TV series.  I love to see that happen.

Unzip its mouth and there is a pocket about 3 inches deep.  The doll is smooth and soft.  Children love to cuddle with it.A Worry Easters doll is a good way to talk to a small child about his/her fears and worries.  If the child is old enough to write, have him/her write them down, unzip the doll, and stuff their fears and worries into the doll.  If the child is too young to write, the parent can write them down for him/her.  The symbolism is strong.  It is soothing to a child to see that their fears and worries are properly stored away.  Furthermore, parents will get a chance to do something to alleviate the child’s fears or worries.  For example, if the child says there is monster under his/her bed, put a night light on an extension cord under the bed and tell the child that monsters are afraid of light.

I clean the board occasionally with rubbing alcohol to restore the board to its original condition.A variety of mounting options is available. The board comes with mounting hardware for dry walls or the fabric walls of a typical office cubical. It can also be mounted with the included 3M foam tapes and magnetic strips on a metal surface. To avoid drilling holes, I mounted my board on dry wall with a Duck Brand Removable Mounting Poster Putty (See Note).  I applied the putty along the entire perimeter on all four sides.  It is holding fast so far.  The magnetic strips included may be too small to hold the heavy board on a vertical metallic surface.

"Most Americans are aware of the high cost of medical care in this country.  The most cited reasons are: (1) the high administrative cost of the health care system based on third party payers, namely the multitude of insurance companies, versus the single payer system of other countries, (2) the high cost of drugs due to the lack of leverage of U.S. consumers on the pharmaceutical industry, and (3) the large amount of medical care consumed by U.S. patients, some of which is probably unnecessary.In this book ""Less Medicine More Health"", the author Dr. H. Gilbert Welch explores the topic of excessive use of medical procedures in America.  He lists and describes in detail ""7 Assumptions That Drive Too much Medical Care"".  I find this book enlightening.  Furthermore, this book is written in a colloquial style, which makes it eminently readable, in addition to being informative.  The author is uniquely qualified on the topic of excessive medical care.  He is a primary care physician certified in internal medicine, a medical care epidemiologist, and a teacher.  I recommend this book to Amazon readers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBTGJ8Y87OV2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807071641#wasThisHelpful","RBTGJ8Y87OV2L","A1D9V11QUHXENQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D9V11QUHXENQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Nature program is a moving story of naturalist Joe Hutto who spent 6 years living intimately with a herd of mule deer at Deadman Gulch near his homestead in Wyoming and got to know many deer individually.  For the first two years, he was out every day with the herd and eventually gained the trust of a doe and leader of the herd, whom he called Raggedy Anne.  He was then able to move freely in the herd.  He discovered that his deer knew sorrow and love just like people. He saw how the family of Raggedy Anne stayed at her side as she lay dying, and a fawn he called Molly ran around in great distraught looking for her mother Red Tag who just died.In spite of what he would have hoped, Joe Hutto couldn't protect his deer from predators.  He expressed sorrow on the deer kills in the snow, on which he lamented, ""...they're quintessential death by a thousand cuts....They (the deer) don't cling less desperately to their lives than we do; they do not experience death with less fear than we do.  Their agony and their horror is absolutely real.  And this is an individual that you know.... you can't look at it and say, ""well, this is the natural order of things, this is the way it should be.....""  Joe Hutto was telling something most of us already know - that Nature is cruel and uncaring, and that she has no regard for individuals.""Animals are not the only predators that Molly will encounter..."" Joe Hutto commented, as he was petting the fawn he befriended.  He meant the ""orange vests"" who ""arrive at every direction"" when the hunting season began.  He witnessed the killing of Babe.  As he was helping the hunters lift the buck into their vehicle, one of them asked, ""Do you have any idea how old this deer might be?"" He answered with great sorrow, ""Yeah, I know exactly how old this deer is.  I've known him since he was a spotted fawn.  And I know, because I have all his other shed antlers in my house....""Befriending wildlife exacts a price, as Joe Hutto found out.  He said, ""They (the deer) are under assault from so many different directions, and I see it in their eyes. I have come to know the lives of these wild creatures, I've become a member of the herd, but I don't know how long I'll be able to continue, because the sorrow that I observe in these animals is just simply exhausting..."" I know what he was saying.After thought:  Mule deer as a species are not threatened currently, but their number has declined dramatically in recent years in the American West.  In the state of Wyoming, mule deer population had plummeted 36% from 578,000 in 1991 to 369,000 in late 2012.  Among other factors, the loss of habitat, oil and gas development, aggressive wild fire suppression, predation, harsh winters, and drought are responsible.  But this video is not about wildlife statistic; it is about one man's connection to wild animals.  Animals are not dumb.  They have feelings and emotions.  They have an inner life.  Any pet parent of cats and dogs can testify to that.  They feel love, joy, and sorrow.  They fear death as much as any human being.  The terror and agony of slaughter are as real and vivid to them as to people.  But in a world plagued with war, terrorism, disease, poverty, and assorted human miseries, animal right is probably the furthest thing from anybody's mind.  That much I know.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19NVJZANF9N4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K1WJ36Y#wasThisHelpful","R19NVJZANF9N4A","A1D9V11QUHXENQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D9V11QUHXENQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This SABRE Pepper Spray measures 3-3/4 inches high and 1-1/4 inches across at the widest points. It fits a small hand well. There is a flip-top to prevent accidental release. It is a good alternative to firearm for personal protection when firearm is undesirable due to philosophical and/or legal reasons, but be sure keep it away from children and pets.While it is indeed legal in all 50 states, the shopper should nevertheless check out the legality, restrictions, and liabilities of pepper spray at his/her location before purchase (See Note below).  In some states, e.g. California, pepper spray is legal for self-defense, but the use of it in anger or as a practical joke is a felony punishable by $1,000 fine and/or up to 3 years in state prison. Some states have registration or licensing requirements. Most states prohibit the sale of pepper spray to minors. In the city of Chicago, pepper spray is illegal. Furthermore, it is a federal crime to carry pepper spray in a commercial airliner where it is accessible to the person. Pepper spray is prohibited in most state and federal buildings.Note: Check out the legality, restrictions, and liabilities of pepper spray @http://www.cabelas.com/assets/product_files/pdf/pepperspray_lawsregulation.pdf","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SM38JFO68MXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HB0XDU6#wasThisHelpful","R3SM38JFO68MXY","A1D9V11QUHXENQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D9V11QUHXENQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This SABRE Motion Sensor Alarm works on three AAA batteries (not included). The user can mount the alarm permanently on a wall using the included wall-bracket with a swivel for flexible directional adjustment, or it can mounted on a single screw slot, which I prefer because the swivel is too loose to hold the alarm securely.  The alarm can be easily removed from the bracket or the wall screw and deployed freestanding. This means that this motion alarm is portable. It can be quickly set up in a hotel room for early warning of unexpected entry. I wish there is a back stand to secure it on tabletop but there isn't. The alarm is armed or disarmed with a 4-digit code of the user's choice. It can be set to chime or sound an ear-splitting alarm.

"The White Queen is a British 10-part television series based on the historical novel series The Cousin's War by the award winning British writer Philippa Gregory.  It is the story of the struggle for the throne of England between two rival royal factions, the house of Lancaster and the house of York, in the Wars of the Roses between 1455 and 1487, as seen through the eyes of the female characters Elizabeth Woodville, The White Queen (Rebecca Ferguson), Margaret Beaufort, The Red Queen (Amanda Hale), & Anne Neville, The Kingmaker's Daughter (Faye Marsay).The film is engrossing, with beautiful cinematography and excellent acting. The plot is fast moving, full of political intrigue and family feud with grave consequences.  There are some criticisms of historical inaccuracies of the scenery, stage sets, and the chronology of events.  To avoid confusing fictions with facts, the viewers should remember that the film is a historical novel, not a history documentary (See my comment below).  Two versions were made.  The BBC version, first aired on June 2013 in the UK, is more conservative, followed by the steamy Starz version, aired in the US on August 2013.  This Amazon Prime video is the Starz version, with male and female nudity, explicit sex acts, and graphic childbirth footage.  So parents beware.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWLWSUNT9QI8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HY7XSLA#wasThisHelpful","RWLWSUNT9QI8D","A1D9V11QUHXENQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D9V11QUHXENQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The SABRE Home Security Alarms system comes with one door unit and three window units. The product is labeled as ""Wireless Alarm Kit"" on the package, but the word ""Wireless"" can be misleading to some shoppers, who may think that the door and window units are interconnected or operated remotely by radio wave. This is not so. ""Wireless"" here means that the alarms are operated on batteries without the use of external wires.The door unit runs on three AAA batteries (not included). The user enters a 4-digit code of his choice by pressing the ""LEARN"" button in the battery compartment. This 4-digit code is used to arm or disarm the door alarm upon exit or entry. The user can choose a gentle door chime or a loud alarm by moving a switch in the battery compartment.The window units run on 4-button batteries (included) and operate independently of the door unit and each other. The user arms or disarms the alarm or a chime via a switch inside the battery compartment. The 4-digit code is not used here.Installation is simple: just mount the door or window unit on the door or window and the corresponding magnet on the door or window frame adjacent to each other.  Separation of the alarm unit from the magnet will sound the alarm.  Three sets of screw and drywall anchor are included for the installation of the door unit. The window units are installed with the use of two sided adhesive foam tapes (included).This SABRE home alarm system is suitable as an entry-level alarm for homeowners or apartment renters. It will not qualify the user for a discount in his homeowner or renter insurance, which requires central-monitored alarm system. But it does provide some rudimentary home protection and for the price of fifteen dollars, it is a great value. I highly recommend this product to shoppers who are looking for a low price but fairly effective home alarm system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKX2601XZCWDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M30SHFU#wasThisHelpful","RKX2601XZCWDN","A1D9V11QUHXENQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D9V11QUHXENQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Wicker Woven Utensil Caddy Picnic Basket measures approximately 10-7/8 inches long, 9 inches wide, and 6-1/2 inches high at the exterior. The web page states the size as 10 x 7 x 6. It is incorrect, either measured externally or internally. The single large wooden handle is about 5-5/8 inches tall. It is foldable and feels secured. The rim of the basket is reinforced with small strips of wood.The interior of the basket is divided into one large compartment and three small compartments with wood panels held down by small nails. The large compartment is about 10 x 3-3/8 inches and the small ones 3 x 3-7/8 inches. The small panels dividing the small compartments are not properly positioned at 90 degrees and are noticeably crooked. I bought two more of these baskets after the initial purchase. The crookedness of the small panels varies from basket to basket.  The bottom of the basket needs reinforcement. Pointed objects like metal knives and forks may penetrate the wicker material. I reinforced the bottom inside with corrugated cardboard and paper towels.In spite of the flaws, I find this wicker picnic basket practical and aesthetically pleasing. It is reasonably sturdy for a hand-made wicker basket.

"Among many uses in school or office, a label maker is good for organizing household items.  Aside from the usual stuff like jars and containers in the pantry, I used it to label the tangle of cables at the back of my computers and game consoles, so in the event that I have to disconnect something, I know where to plug the cables back in.I owned a Brother PT-300 for close to ten years until the cutter stopped cutting and the printout faded.  So I can say right off the bat that Brother did make durable label makers.  This Brother PTD400AD measures 7-3/8 x 7-3/8 x 3 inches high.  It runs on AC with an AC adapter (included) rated at 100-240V 50-60 Hz 0.6A input and 12V 2A output.  It will fit most electrical grids, foreign or domestic.  The PTD400AD also runs on 6 AA batteries so it can be used anywhere, although it may be a tad too big to go into a brief case.This Brother PTD400AD comes with many fonts, sizes, styles, frames, and symbols and prints up to 5 lines on one label.  It will take a long time for the user to learn to take advantage of the many features.  So keep the manual close by for quick reference.  The user can save up to 50 labels in the memory and recall them for later use.  This PTD400AD can even create bar codes like those found on supermarket items. To use them, one needs a bar code reader.  Bar codes are a wonderful way to organize and track large number of items, like in school or office, although I don't see much use in a household setting.Tapes of various widths from 6mm to 36mm are available.  In addition, there is a ""supper narrow"" non-laminated tape with 3.5mm width.  The tapes come in a variety of materials including fabric iron-on, extra-strength adhesive, acid-free adhesive, flexible I.D. laminate, and tamper evident laminate.  Many text and background colors in a variety of combinations are available: text in black, white, blue, red, and gold, and background in white, black, clear, yellow, orange, red, pink, blue, green, silver, and gold.

"This is my first Gran Turismo game, so I am not going to compare it with the previous games in the series.  Gran Turismo 6 is quite exciting by itself. The graphics is awesome and the racing mechanics is as close to fast driving as I can tell.  I was especially impressed by the playback after each race, which is presented as a well-edited video, with constant changing camera angles and cut-in/cut-out effect.The player is first given a Honda Fit at the beginning of the game.  He earns credits as he wins or completes races, which he can use to upgrade the various components of the car, or to purchase a more powerful car.Many types of races are offered: Online Mode in which players race each other, Arcade Mode in which the player races AI drivers or his buddy in the same room, and the single player Career Mode in which the player progresses from Novice through the Nationals and the Internationals to the Red Bull X Challenge, as he earns his racing licenses through a series of driving tests.  As the player becomes more experienced, special racing events are offered.To do the game justice, the player needs a decent racing wheel.  The standard PS3 controller simply doesn't cut it.  There is the Logitech G27.  It is an excellent wheel for the PS3.  Unfortunately, it is NOT compatible with the PS4, which offers exciting new racing games like DriveClub and Project CARS.  For wheels compatible with both PS3 and PS4, there are the entry-level Thrustmaster T80RS and the high-end T300RS (See Note).  Many players are disappointed with the T80RS because it doesn't have force feed-back, but the price is reasonable.One additional thing I like to mention is the background music of the game - I hate it.  But fortunately, the game offers the player option to replace it, which I did with the soundtrack of the 1966 film Grand Prix.  What is more fitting for an auto-racing game like Gran Turismo 6 than that?Note:  According to what I read, the T500RS, released for PS3 over three years ago, is supported in DriveClub and will be in Project CARS.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22VVKYE9Z9RNO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRL9TU2#wasThisHelpful","R22VVKYE9Z9RNO","A1D9V11QUHXENQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D9V11QUHXENQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Philips Sonicare Toothbrush is an entry-level electric brush. It is relatively short, measuring 8-5/8 inches long from end of the handle to tip of the brush. It is powered by two disposable AA batteries (included), instead of a built-in rechargeable battery in many upscale models. The brush head is fixed; it is not replaceable. So when it wears out, the owner has to buy a new brush. However, at fifteen dollars a pop, it is affordable. It is very quiet, compared to the Oral B electric brush I am using. For users who prefer a quiet electric brush, the Sonicare brand is the choice.When all things being equal, an electric brush does a better job of cleaning teeth than a manual one.  This Philips Sonicare Toothbrush is a good choice for those who want to graduate from a manual brush to an inexpensive electric one (See Note below)............................................Note:  Electric toothbrush 101There are two types of electric toothbrushes on the market today: the rotation-oscillation type and the vibration type.  The rotation-oscillation type toothbrushes rotate clockwise and counterclockwise alternately, whereas the vibration type vibrates back and forth linearly.  The vibration type is further sub-divided into the sonic and ultrasonic type.  The sonic toothbrushes vibrate at a frequency of 200-400 Hz (cycles per second).  It is in the audible range and hence sonic.  The ultrasonic toothbrushes vibrate at a frequency of 20,000 Hz or higher.  It is above the hearing range and hence ultrasonic.The difference is as follows: The rotation-oscillation type covers a larger area.  The user places the brush head on each tooth and progresses down the line.  The sonic vibration type moves in relatively shorter strokes and hence the user gets to move the brush head around a bit to cover the entire tooth.  The ultrasonic vibration type uses ultrasonic wave to break up plaque and bacteria instead of the sweeping action the sonic vibration type.This Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush under review is an example of the sonic vibration type.An example of a rotation-oscillation type is the Braun Oral-B Triumph with SmartGuide.

"Alaska always holds special fascinations among many viewers, myself included. It symbolizes natural beauty as well as rugged life in the wild. This series Railroad Alaska, aired in 2013 on Destination America, depicts the men who work on the Alaska Railroad and the ""off-gridders"" who live along the route.The Alaska Railroad starts at Seward with a deep-water all-season seaport. From there, it runs through Whittier, Anchorage, Palmer, Takeetna, Hurricane Gulch, and finally ends in Fairbanks and a little beyond, spanning over 470 miles. The viewers get to watch as the locomotive engineers drive the trains through treacherous terrain and the maintenance crew replaces cracked rails and removes waist-deep snow and ice to keep the railroad passable. The show tells the stories of the off-gridders who live in isolated cabins along the railroad which they depend on for food and vital supplies. Many segments are obviously re-enactments but they do tell credible stories. Don't miss out on this excellent reality TV series.P.S.

"This InterDesign Metalo Hose Shower Caddy is made of steel with a bronze-color satin finish. It measures 13-3/4 inches wide, 24 inches high, and 4 inches deep. It hooks on the shower pipe. A suction cup secures the bottom to the wall. The shelves measure 5-1/4 inches wide, 3-3/8 inches high, and 4 inches deep. They are 3-sided without backs. The wall is apparently the back. I found that odd when I first saw the caddy. Small items might fall off from the back if the suction cup detaches from the wall, intentionally or otherwise. This did happen the first time I used the caddy, when I tried to dry the tile behind it by lifting it slight away from the wall.  Now I take everything out of the shelves before I dry the tiles.  I also noticed that the caddy tends to twist from side to side. There is a clearance of 9-1/2 inches between the bottom of the top shelves and that of the lower shelves. Items taller than that will have to go on the top shelves. There are two sets of double hooks at the bottom for whatnots. I hang my roped sponge on one of those hooks. I can also hang my hats on them to dry after I hand-wash them. They surely are handy.In conclusion, I found this caddy very useful in my small shower. It also looks good.

"Jackie's new album Awakening is a mix of classical and contemporary pieces with several original compositions, as well as covers of musical & movie sound tracks. The Walmart exclusive 2-disc album also contains six Christmas classics. There's a lot for everyone on this album, just like Jackie said.For the classical fans, there are ""Ave Maria"" by Russian composer Vladimir Vavilov and the traditional art song ""Dormi Jesu"" (The Virgin's Cradle Hymn). They are beautiful and timeless. There is ""Vocalise"" by Sergei Rachmaninoff, which is a wordless song carried only by a soprano voice with light orchestra accompaniment. These classical pieces showcase Jackie's gifted voice, which has evolved through the years from the operatic in Dream With Me to the bright crystal-clear vocal today.For the pop fans, there are Jackie's covers of ""With or Without You"" from the album The Joshua Tree by U2, ""Memories"" from the album The Silent Force by Within Temptation, and ""Je t'aime"" from the album Pure by Lara Fabian.  More notable are Jackie's covers of ""The Rains of Castamere"" from the popular HBO TV series Game of Thrones and ""Your Love"" with lyric by Dulce Pontes and music by the legendary Ennio Morricone from the 1968 film Once Upon A Time in the West.For musical lovers, Jackie sings ""Think of Me"" from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera. This musical is her favorite.  There are new songs in this album.  ""Take Me There"" by Johan Oberholzer, ""Open Fields of Grace"" by Paul Sumares and Lisa Venkatrathnam, and ""Made to Dream"" by Jean-Pierre Steyn are original compositions for Jackie, written specifically to fit her range and tempo. ""Take Me There"" is notable for its faster beat than Jackie's usual singing style.On August this year, Jackie's third PBS Great Performance was filmed at Longwood Gardens in Pennsylvania. It is based on the songs of this album. The show will air in December on PBS stations. It will be a treat for Jackie fans.The music tracks were recorded in Budapest, Hungary with the Budapest Concert Orchestra and the Budapest City Choir, conducted by Nicholas Dodd and Richard Cottle. The Budapest Concert Orchestra has performed in a number of classical music recordings, including Symphony No. 1 & Hungarian Dances Nos. 5 & 6 by Brahms, and Mozart's Requiem - Coronation Mass.This album was produced by record producer Nick Patrick who has worked with many classical crossover artists, including Katherine Jenkins and Russell Watson. ""We all wanted to find a balance that would present Jackie in all that she is as an artist,"" says the famed record producer regarding the new album. I think he has succeeded. The mix of different genres in this album signifies new directions in Jackie's music while maintaining her classical root. Fans like myself are waiting with bated breath for new things to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKF58WQ011I1O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L4QYEGU#wasThisHelpful","RKF58WQ011I1O","A1D9V11QUHXENQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D9V11QUHXENQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This George Foreman GR136B Classic Plate Grill is advertised as ""Service for 2"", but that is a stretch, because it is so small it is only good for one.  The cooking surface measures 6-1/4 x 7-1/2 inches.  It is so small that I could barely fit three strips of Moriningstar Farm ""bacon"" on it.  The small size is actually okay, considering the fact that there are 102 million unmarried people 18 and older in America in 2011.  A lot of them are living alone and cooking for one.  There is a niche on the market for small one-person cookware.  In my opinion, George Foreman should sell this little grill as ""Service for One"".This grill appears to be made of heat resistant plastic.  It is electric, running on 110VAC.  The cooking surface is non-stick.  It is tilted downward so that grease and oil will run down to a detached plastic drip tray (included).  A green indicator on the cover lights up when the heater of the grill turns on.  There is no temperature control.  It will be nice if there is one.  Cleaning the cooking surface can be problematic because it is not detachable and since the grill is electric, it cannot be immersed in water.  I tried to wipe off the cooking surface with a soapy sponge, followed by a wet paper towel.In conclusion, this little grill is good only for one.  As such, it is a good addition to the microwave oven in a single person household.  The price at twenty dollars a pop is reasonable.  I recommend it to single Amazon shoppers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LHTK56ZHA9E8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2HXRK#wasThisHelpful","R3LHTK56ZHA9E8","A1D9V11QUHXENQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D9V11QUHXENQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my favorite EDC AAA light. It's comparable to the Maratac AAA light in stainless and copper, but the titanium Thrunite is a bit lighter than the copper, as much as I love my copper Maratac. If you want something lighter than Ti that's comparable the Olight i3s EOS AAA in aluminum is also a good choice and much cheaper in aluminum than the titanium. There's also the Streamlight Microstream AAA.If you prefer the AA format the Thrunite T10T is also very nice but I prefer the AAA for EDC because of the smaller size. If you want the AA format, and also in the pricier titanium category, the Klarus M1A Ti is also excellent, as well as the Eagletac D25A Ti AA light.But getting back to the AAA format there's also the Thrunite neutral white AAA version in stainless, as well as the rainbow flamed Ti version from Vinh over on the CPF, which is beautiful, but again not cheap. There are both cool white and neutral white versions, so you can pick the one you like. All of these are quality AAA lights but I prefer the Thrunite AAA Ti. Titanium is, after all, ""The metal of the gods."" :-)The UI and mode spacing are fine for me although I'd prefer the UI to remember the last mode which mine doesn't seem to want to do. But at about 130 lumens it's very bright. Threads are pretty smooth for titanium which can feel gritty. Some people don't like Ti because of that. The light has good throw for such a small light, which I like as I'm more of a throw than spill or flood type of guy. The knurling is not too aggressive. Overall a great little light.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MSC31ZIMFSUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFMFKQY#wasThisHelpful","R3MSC31ZIMFSUI","A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Silly and poorly written script, poorly employed science, stupid characters with inexplicable or unexplained motives (maybe they were just ""space happy?""), multiple plot holes the size of an asteroid, and a truly absurd climactic library scene (hard to explain, you just have to see it), this movie has it all, and I don't mean that in a good way. Even the gravitational field of a black hole couldn't hold this disjointed and illogical film together. Apparently cobbled together from the worst and most shopworn sci-fi ideas they could find, Intersteller is one Big Bang of a galactic sized mess. Two stars for the realistic spaceship and space station interiors and astronomical backdrops and scenes, but that's about the only redeeming thing in this otherwise one star movie. The talents of the otherwise competent actors in this movie like McConaughey and Hathaway are wasted here.

"We bought this after reading the positive reviews here.This is definitely the best call blocker around. The features I like especially are the capability to block whole area codes and automatic blocking of private, anonymous, out of area, name not provided, and unavailable numbers. It's easy to call up and block numbers. On our Panasonic cordless you had to manually punch in the number plus the capacity was only 30 numbers. With this unit you can potentially block thousands, especially the ability to block whole area codes where robocallers change one digit to bypass your device. For example, a lot of robocallers have a Detroit area code since the city has been losing population for years so there are lots of numbers available for robocallers. By comparison New York City has very few. And online services like Nomorobo are only available to those who have VoIP service for their landline which not everyone has. Also you can chain multiple units together.

"I have half a dozen different stainless and titanium holders which I use for everything from holding AA or AAA NiMH batteries, 10180 or 10280 lithium ion batteries, to pills, depending on their size, but the GUS model was my first. Great for pills, vitamins, or any small items. Well made and sturdy, it's nearly indestructible. The rubber O-ring makes it pretty waterproof. Occasionally you will need to lubricate the O-ring. I use DuPont Krytox which is popular but there are other good lubricants out there; I just haven't tried them personally. Be aware that you can't use petroleum based lubricants on neoprene O-rings as it will corrode the rubber.

Since a typical AA battery is 49.0 to 50.5 mm in length and 13.5 to 14.5 mm in width this capsule fits an AA battery just about perfectly. I have several AA battery holders in titanium and they're great for that.

Titanium is as strong or stronger than steel (depending on the grade of titanium, most everyday items aren't made from the highest grade titanium but then it's not really necessary) but unlike steel or cobalt is non-magnetic. These are perfect for CR123A size cells. I also have the Titaner ones in AA size and the BangGood and Steve Ku 10180 size holders, so if you need those sizes you might want to check those out.

There's no one who does this sort of thing better than Murray ever since Nicholson did As Good As It Gets many years back. But Nicholson's character had more of a belligerent in your face edge whereas Murray's persona has a sort of resigned and exasperated bellicoseness about it.

"If you want IMRs, I've found these are comparable to the AW brand ones (no relation to Andy Wan's company despite the similar name).

"This, along with the 4Sevens Quark Mini MLR2, is my favorite production CR2 EDC light. I really like CR2 form factor lights because they combine compactness with brightness. The Sens Mini is pretty much the same as the 4Sevens light, except for the accelerometer based interface which is somewhat controversial over on the candlepowerforum website which flashlight pros, tech types, and power users frequent and talk about lights. But I like it. Takes a little getting used to but it's actually a pretty cool idea. But you should research it before buying to make sure it's for you. Besides that, the overall build quality of the light is excellent, and I have no complaints there. The throw for such a small light is impressive, and I'm more a throw than flood guy when it comes to beam profiles. The 170 lumens is more than adequate from such a small package. Overall a nice little EDC light. BTW, I and other CPF'ers have found you can use 15270 3.7V batteries as well as the 3.0V CR2 batteries. Although not officially rated for them by the manufacturer, they seem to be able to handle the higher voltage without ill effect, and you get increased brightness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WBCF8ZTLAOCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z93KAUS#wasThisHelpful","R2WBCF8ZTLAOCV","A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have an old SOG Trident from the 80s bought at the now long defunct Cutlery World when it was owned briefly by the great Jim Parker, who revolutionized the knife world at the time when he was the first to produce quality, hammer-welded 512-layer Damascus at a price the working man could afford. Suddenly this fabled steel was now within reach of many ordinary knife buyers. This was one of the few non-Damascus knives I bought back then and have been happy with it ever since. Even with all the developments since it's hard to beat this knife. The newer versions with the seat belt cutter, the black titanium nitride finish, and probably an improved spring mechanism are no doubt worthwhile improvements, but they wouldn't be here if it weren't for the original. Sturdy, well made, practical, and an eye pleasing design are all hallmarks of a SOG knife. The Trident stands as an enduring classic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPLMMJDX4FOZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PIE2I8#wasThisHelpful","RPLMMJDX4FOZL","A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'd just like to make a few comments on this light and on the competition which potential buyers might find useful. I like the JetBeam titanium limited editions, which are considered better than average quality. But I also have a couple of their regular aluminum lights like this one, which, although production lights, are still considered decent quality. The PC10 compares favorably to the other regular production CR123A lights from major Chinese makers like the Sunwayman V10R, V11R, M10R, Nitecore SRT-3, Olight T15, and Fenix PD25 lights.You could also add the Surefire E1E and other Executive series lights here but of course Surefire is American made and much more expensive, but at one time was considered the ultimate in build quality. The expert consensus now though is that their quality has slipped significantly in recent years, which is attributed to the departure of Paul Kim and Dr. John Matthews, the chief engineer and founder, respectively, and the two main driving forces behind the company's success for many years.But getting back to the JetBeam, build quality is good and the feature set is fine. On the Candlepowerforum.com where high end flashlight users, engineers, and pros hang out, JetBeam quality overall is considered good but not quite as good as with Fenix, but better than Nitecore. I personally love Nitecore designs and ideas but they have gotten a reputation on the CPF for rushing new designs to market that aren't adequately debugged and tested and so they get more lights needing to be serviced, which they are happy to do. Next to Nitecore though JetBeam is my favorite light company for great looking designs and fun ideas, even if their lights have the occasional problem. Just my two cents and others mileage may vary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16O91WZMK8SXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007GGJXK4#wasThisHelpful","R16O91WZMK8SXV","A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good tester, and should be as it is U.S. made and costs about a hundred bucks. Because it uses a load testing method rather than simple voltage it gives you a much more accurate reading on the state of the battery. It tests 95% of the batteries I have and the remaining ones I rarely use. The number of devices around the house that use small batteries continues to grow, including smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, many remote controls, a postage scale, bathroom scales, a label maker, an iPhone power bank, and a number of high tech flashlights. These devices can use anywhere from 1 to 8 batteries. Then I realized we had over a hundred batteries after I rounded them all up and didn't know the state of health of most of them, so I decided to bite the bullet and get a real tester.The pros for this meter are:1. Easy to use, self-calibrating2. Uses four AA batteries rather than 9V which I prefer3. Tests dozens of different types and the most important chemistries (lithium, lithium ion, alkaline, and NiMH)4. It's fast, returns reading in just a few seconds5. Uses pulse load method which is more accurate but doesn't drain battery much6. Easy to follow manual and instructions7. Construction and build quality seems sturdy and solid8. The optional soft cover case is a plusThe cons, which really aren't serious, are:1. Would have preferred a continuous scale; this meter indicates 10%, 20%, 40%, etc. up to 100%. But then battery capacity measurement isn't super accurate anyway.2. You have to line up the small positive terminal of the battery with the metal stud on the meter. It would be easier to line up the bigger negative end of the battery.3. It's not a small meter if you're looking for something small and portable. It's not a big deal for me but be aware it's about the size of a regular hardback book and about as heavy.Also I note the comment from another reviewer here who was complimentary about the company's phone support. He also said they advised using alkaline rather than NiMH batteries because the slightly lower voltage of NiMH could give inaccurate readings. But I'm going to try it with both Sanyo Eneloop NiMH and alkalines and see what I get.So far I'm very happy with this tester and can recommend it for anyone who like me who has lots of batteries around the house and didn't really know which ones were good or not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNTGSB234X0SA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GM440FY#wasThisHelpful","RNTGSB234X0SA","A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Up until this light I had only owned small lights from Thrunite, but I was very happy with them. These were mainly their AAA or 10440 lights like their TISvn 10440 which I have in the beautiful flamed titanium version, modified by Vinh54 over in the Candlepowerforum.com to put out a whopping 750 lumens on high, which is ridiculous for such a small light, and it heats up quickly as you might expect. I also have the TiS NW XP-G2 and the Ti CW XM-L2 versions.This light however is a 18650/18350/16340, making it pretty versatile as far as batteries goes. With a couple of magnetic spacers, I can even use my AW, AWT, and Efest 18500 IMR batteries. At 1040 lumens it's very bright. The black anodized finish is flawless, the threads are smooth, the modes are spaced well, it comes with a decent holster, the extension tube makes it very versatile, the neutral white tint is nice, and I like the user interface. I also don't mind side switches instead of twist or rear clicky's. In fact there isn't anything I don't like except as with the other reviewers here the one thing it's missing is a pocket clip. Other than that I'd say an almost perfectly executed light especially given the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R61LNARFRKYC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PAKMSHS#wasThisHelpful","R61LNARFRKYC4","A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Knowledgeable flashlight users make fun of these on the candlepowerforum.com website but for the money they're really not a bad deal. The lumens rating is way overstated of course as it's more like 150 lumens, but the plastic focusable lens actually works pretty well and the machining and anodizing are actually pretty good. A focusable AA light from Coast like the H5 will cost you more like $30, and if you want a real AA light that puts out several hundred lumens (actually 500) you'll need to buy the recently released Zebra Light SC5 model, but that's a lot more money than this light. Some have complained theirs stopped working after a few months but mine (I have several in different colors) have been fine. There are several factories in China I've heard that are turning out these little lights. The design appears to be a ripoff of the small Voidhawk light (just do a Google search on Voidhawk) except these use non-lithium ion batteries. I wouldn't trust the low voltage protection circuit or the reverse polarity detection on these lights though as they probably don't have these features, but I just use them as beaters and don't care if I drop or lose them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVVE3FGV7MND8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K301272#wasThisHelpful","RVVE3FGV7MND8","A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of several makes of 18650 IMR batteries I've tried, the others include the well known AW reds and the AWT yellows (no relation to Andrew Wan's AW company). They've all worked well. These are the button top as opposed to flat top versions. This is potentially important for users of lights that have a battery carrier inside the tube holding three or four 18650 batteries. If you get button top batteries, especially those that also have a protection circuit board in the tail, they can be long enough so that they won't fit in the carrier and you'd be better off with flat tops or even without protection. This means that before buying batteries you should find out what the maximum length of a battery can be for your light, which the manufacturer should specify. However, since IMRs are typically offered without the protection curcuit, either button top or flat top batteries should work fine unless you have a really tight battery carrier.As far as the important points to know about IMRs goes, these include:1. They are lithium manganese dioxide chemistry rather than lithium cobalt oxide which is more common.2. They have higher drain but less energy capacity than ICR.3. They're considered safer since this chemistry is less likely to go into thermal runaway.4. Because of 3, they're typically offered without a protective circuit board.5. Although they lack 4, they do have vent holes and I'm pretty sure a fusible link although I'm not certain.6. They have a wider temperature operating range compared to ICR types.7. Considered better han ICR for high drain applications, such as high-end e-cigs and vaping devices.These cells have worked well in my high drain lights with 4x18650 battery carriers such as my Niteye Eye40 light. I have the Eye40vn version modded by Vinh54 (a well known modder over on the CandlePowerForum.com site) which now puts out 10,000 lumens on turbo mode and requires high drain cells. I also use these in my Soshine 2x18650 power bank, although I really didn't need the 35A version just for that. But in the Eye40 they're necessary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29LN9PANSFKRQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P8BXE3G#wasThisHelpful","R29LN9PANSFKRQ","A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I only have three lights that take this size, which isn't as common as the 18650 and the 16340 (CR123A) size.

"As you can see from the other reviews here people just love this clever little Spyderco. If there's a cute knife this is it. I bought mine 20 years ago and it's still in use. It's a testament to the ingenuity of the design that it's remained in the Spyderco catalog that long.It's small size makes it very convenient while being sturdy enough to tackle more serious jobs. Spyderco's trademark large thumb hole for one-handed opening doesn't seem out of place on such a compact knife which was my first impression. The Cricket's stout construction for its size is impressive, reminding me of my original S.O.G. Mini Tanto style model although that's a very different design of knife but similarly sturdily built for its size.The clip is very strong just like on all Spyderco's. It's attached by three tapped and threaded screw holes and small Phillips machine screws, and is removable if you prefer. It would be even better if Spyderco used hex or Torx screws but the Phillips are fine. I've never had a Spyderco clip strip out. I'm just not a fan of small Phillips screws, compared to the larger ones which I don't mind. You could even use it as a money clip.I like the all metal design but if there was a lighter version with a Kraton handle like my Mini S.O.G. or synthetic handle I'd buy that one too just for the lightness. But if you want super light you'll just have to buy the Spyderco skeletonized model with both a skeletonized blade and handle. It's another very clever idea on Spyderco's part and that knife always gets comments from friends and acquaintances who've never seen a knife like that before.I like the serrated version but there's a regular bladed version as well. I could see buying both as the non-serrated blades are easier to sharpen, the small teeth requiring a good set of ceramic triangle sticks to sharpen or similarly capable sharpener. It's also small enough so that it shouldn't cause any concern for law enforcement.Finally, a note on the metallurgy is in order. The VG-10 steel with 0.4% tungsten is excellent and a bit different from the more common sub-zero quench 440C stainless steel originated in the U.S., which I have on many of my other knives such as my Case XX models. (Case actually invented the sub-zero quench method after WWII if I recall right, which is notable for the very strong, needle like Martensite crystals which gives this steel it's high tensile strength). VF-10 is a cutlery grade steel originally created by Takefu Special Steel Co. Ltd. in Takefu, Fukui Prefecture, Japan. Blade making in this area goes all the way back to Shogun days when it was a sword-making center in the town of Echizen.Overall a great little knife that offers a lot in such a small package.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R2V8E1W8LBVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JEONXC#wasThisHelpful","R3R2V8E1W8LBVK","A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"An intense music school drama (set at a thinly veiled Juliard) that just keeps getting more dramatic and more intense until the final scene. Although there's a good supporting cast, the real show is the toxic, high decibel, over the top, and abusive relationship between the young drummer and the psycho band leader played by veteran TV actor J.K. Simmons in an Oscar worthy performance. I wasn't familiar with the young actor who played the drummer but he was also outstanding in the role.I'm no expert on drums but I found I enjoyed all the drum virtuoso parts. The talk about great past jazz musicians inspired me to look up names like Buddy Rich and Charlie Parker on Wiki and read their bios there.A brief comment on the psychology, however, is in order. The band leader uses as justification for his abusive methods the example of Charlie Parker who gave a historic performance after being persecuted by his band leader. Simmons comments ""There are no more harmful two words in the English language than ""good job."" This is just pop psychology nonsense of the worst sort. Decades of research and hundreds of studies by psychologists have shown that people overwhelmingly respond best to positive, not negative reinforcement. You can catch more flies with sugar instead of vinegar as the saying goes.This also applies to leadership styles. Of the various leadership styles, the leader who leads by example and by providing a positive image and exhibiting positive qualities and ideals has been found in studies to be the most productive and effective.Of course, then we wouldn't have had a movie. :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X2BLNSAM7SE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PRX8UBG#wasThisHelpful","R1X2BLNSAM7SE9","A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Beautiful overall design combined with great aesthetics, but practical too as it will handle most jobs quite well.

"I love the special snifters put out by breweries and distilleries and have a modest collection of them.A few words are in order about this popular premium bourbon. At a price point above the classic Jim Beam Black Label 8 yr. and Wild Turkey 101 which are the standard competitors here you expect something a little special. I find Woodford a clean tasting light to medium bodied bourbon similar to the more expensive Basil Haydens with smooth attack and finish, subtle top notes which I can't quite identify, and a lot of up front vanilla. It's a lighter, more delicate bourbon than either the Beam or Wild Turkey, or the Knob Creek at about the same price.Other light style whiskies but in the less expensive category are Early Times or Rebel Yell. Despite being cheaper I don't find them very harsh and spirity, my only quip is that the lighter bourbons lack enough true bourbon flavor and character in my humble opinion. My view is that since what distinguishes bourbon compared to other distilled spirits like cognac, scotch, rum, etc., is its emphasis on the darker fruits: i.e., prunes, plums, raisins, peaches, stewed fruit, etc., those flavors should be at least as noticeable in a bourbon as the vanilla imparted by the charred oak or the cereal grain maltiness which is pretty much universal among distilled grain spirits.This is also why, although many people love the Woodford and Basil Haydens, I prefer a heavier bourbon like Wild Turkey, Knob Creek, Bookers, Jefferson's Reserve, Bibb & Tucker, etc. I just think If you're paying a premium price you should get more intense flavors.This is also why I like the Blanton's, still a lighter bourbon (although getting very close to a medium one if not actually) but it has more bourbon flavor and character. At the same price point as the Woodford there's Knob Creek which is also more fully flavored and is excellent.  I just prefer a more intense, medium to heavy style. Just my two cents. Others mileage may vary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSW95BLB5U2QN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CGB7IEC#wasThisHelpful","RSW95BLB5U2QN","A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have the original Delica with the serrated edge from 25 years ago and it's still going strong. I think the VG-10 steel used today might be different from the original. I'm not sure if VG-10 was used back then.Anyway, it's an excellent steel and has small amounts of molybdenum, vanadium, and manganese which create extremely hard carbide crystals which explain this steel's edge holding ability but also can make it hard to sharpen for the amateur. If you've had experience with the old sub-zero quench 440C, a process which produces martensite crystals, which can have tensile strengths of 240,000 pounds per square inch, you know what I mean. Since Spyderco edges are only ground from one side I use a very low angle grind from the other side to sharpen, using a small triangle stick to get at the scalloped serrations.As far as EDC goes I really like the somewhat smaller size of the Delica compared to the Police model. The handles are light but sturdy and the locking mechanism is precise and strong.

"Show your love of one of the iconic Islays with this lapel pin! A few words are in order about this unique malt. Caol Ila isn't considered a beginner's malt by experts. That's because even for an Islay Caol Ila is considered a rather eccentric malt because of it's dual nature. It is in fact considered the most schizoid of all malts, with the phenolic and ""burnt plastic"" aspect of a Laphroaig (which many people find unpleasant) but the fruitiness and sweetness of a Longmorn, Little Mill, Dallas Dhu, Glenfarclas 108, or the famous Scapa 1965 (obviously more pleasant). This is why it is considered an unusual and even somewhat forbidding malt and not appropriate for beginners.Some versions by the varitous independent bottlers may be more approachable to the neophyte than the standard distillery issue. There was a very atypical one, it might have been a Whyte & Whyte bottling, that was relatively tame for a Caol Ila.

"I like the glasses put out by breweries and single malt distilleries with their logos and have a modest collection of them. This one commemorates the famous malt from the Isle of Skye, north of Islay where most of the island malts reside.A few words are in order about this malt. The Talisker 10 is famous for having an oiliness similar to Irish whiskey and a peppery quality and flavor which some people find off-putting, but there are people who will drink none other. There is an 18-year old which is definitely smoother, but is toned down considerably from the boisterous 10-year, as extra aging on the Islays tends to do.The Islays tend to get more restrained and darker, but also more integrated and more refined with age, but then I don't go to the more intense Islays for the Scotch equivalent of a French Burgundy or Bordeaux. This is why I don't think paying the extra money for the higher ages in the Islays is worth it. I drink them for their intensity and often idiosyncratic character and because I want a good kick in the seat of the pants. The Laphroaig 15 year for example just doesn't seem like real Laphroaig. Too tame. But there are exceptions. The Bowmore 18 yr., 21 yr., and others are good examples. Just my two cents.

"I used this book extensively for our many road trips around Calif. back in the 80s and 90s. I learned a lot of geology that I wouldn't have otherwise. For example, it was especially fun driving down Hwy 1 south of San Francisco where there are lots of exposed rock layers such as the graywacke near the famous Devil's Slide area, as well as many other areas. Driving down I-5 south of Hwy 152 we learned that the low mountains to the west comprised the Central Valley Sequence, and marked the location of the subduction zone for the Pacific and continental plates. The geology of Calif. is very complex which means it is a challenge for an expert to make it intelligible to the layman, but I thought the authors did a great job. If you're an avid naturalist and want to get to know your state better the roadside geology books are great way to do that. When approaching a new area we would break out the book and see what it had to say, and often there was a section on it.

"Show your love of the classic lowland malt with this lapel pin!A few words are in order about this great single. Auchentoshan is considered the archetypal Lowland, along with Rosebank. It was always the first lowland I introduced new whisky buffs to at tastings because of it's very balanced and integrated character. Lowland whiskies are typically triple distilled comoared to the highlands but there are exceptions as the highland single Glenmorangie is also.My other two fave lowlands were Littlemill, which was notable for it's cocoanut and vanilla flavors and overall very sweet and fruity character. I've seen bottles of Littlemill that you could literally pour over ice cream (I've done it, fun stuff :-)) like you could one of the sweeter bourbons. Littlemill could have quite an expressive range, though; check out the tasting notes on various bottlings by this reviewer who seems to have a pretty perceptive palate:http://www.maltmadness.com/whisky/littlemill.htmlThen there was Bladnoch, which has a very lemony, lemon-grass, citrus-like taste. As I considered those more ""specialist"" type lowland malts I would often follow the Auchentoshan with those. The point was to demonstrate that the lowlands could be almost as individualistic and eccentric as the weirder Islays such as Caol Ila since the lowlands usually don't get as much attention as the other regions.Note I said ""almost"" because in general the lowlands are traditionally considered softer and more approachable than the other regions. But they're an important part of a good tasting. You progress from the lowlands to the highlands and other regions and finally to the Islays. The lowlands are more well behaved; you start there and then end up with the Islays where you're in psycho-freakshow territory. :-) Usually the Caol Ila or one of the ""liquid peat"" Ardbegs was the last malt on the list. For a while I used a Cadenhead barrel strength Ardbeg at around 120 proof that was ridiculous; it tasted like heavily peated shoe or nail polish, until it ran out. I've seen died in the wool Islay drinkers almost spit it out and not be able to finish a shot. A tasting can be a lot of fun if set up right. :-)Now of course there are always the exceptions and limitations to the geographic approach. The classic examples of that are Bruichladdich and Bunnahabhain which are not typical Islays and are more like southern highland or even lowland malts. Most of the Islay lovers I've given those to who had never tried them before were disappointed. On the other hand, they liked the Springbank and Highland Park which although Campbelltown and Orkney malts respectively are basically second cousin to the Islays. They even liked a Clynelish which I mixed 50-50 with a Longmorn better (the favorite concoction of the late, great Victorian connoisseur, Professor Saintsbury--who am I to disagree with the professor?)

"I'm a bit obsessive when it comes to good battery cases and I've tried dozens over the years. The Storacell holders are in a class by themselves. They offer a number of advantages:1. Sturdy, thick plastic offers very strong construction2. Precise fit, batteries don't rattle3. Positive retention feature4. Recessed fit protects positive & negative ends5. No plastic hinge or clasp to malfunction or break6. The see-through frame allows you to see the battery label & info7. Last but not least, the colors are useful too, and there are even translucent glow-in-the-dark versionsI use the colors to color code the different makes and brands I have, which in the case of the many AAA and AA batteries I have include several generations of Sanyo Eneloops, Powerex, Duracell Iron Core, Tenergy LSD, etc. I also have the CR123A and 18650 versions which are for lithium ion batteries. The colors are useful there too since I have Nitecore, AW, Orbtronic, Panasonic, Voidhawk, etc.One important feature here which may not be immediately apparent is the lack of a plastic hinge or clasp. It's not uncommon for battery holders with those to break from ""plastic fatigue"" because the manufacturer didn't use the right plastic to make the holder. It might work for a while, but then over many cycles it eventually wears out and breaks. Also, sometimes the tolerances aren't very precise and the clasp doesn't really work right. The Storacell holder has neither hinge nor clasp to fail.This version offers storage for the 9V types. For some reason there aren't as many makers of 9V holders as of the cylindrical batteries, so if you need that, here it is. Overall a great line of battery holders.

This caddy version offers storage for all the main types of NiMH and is for someone who really needs to organize or transport lots of different kinds of batteries. Overall a great line of battery holders. They're more expensive than the others but you get what you pay for. There's one other possibility. If you just need an individual holder for one battery you can't beat the machined, military spec Delrin holders available at Countycomm. Again, not cheap but very high quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WRWHKBDN6CJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008QY3KB8#wasThisHelpful","R1WRWHKBDN6CJ","A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew Segal more as a scholar of the Greek and Roman classics rather than as a popular writer until he wrote this book, which became an instant blockbuster best seller and later movie. It propelled Segal from an obscure academic into worldwide popular fame. I remember a TV appearance for example where he talked about how he came to write the story. Suddenly he was a celebrity in a way most academics never will be. It's especially ironic since most Ivy League colleges had de-emphasized their Greek and Latin requirements and  curriculums since the late 19th century, and Love Story enabled Segal to become famous to an extent his scholarly specialty would never have allowed. It became one of the greatest one-hit wonders in the history of the U.S. publishing industry as the book sold millions of copies and was translated into dozens of languages.But onto the novel, which isn't nearly as interesting as a work of fiction as what it actually did for Segal's career, who went on to write a number of other screenplays and novels and even film scores. But Love Story wasn't Segal's first foray into popular culture; he had written the screenplay for the Beatles movie, Yellow Submarine several years earlier. As a novel and a romance it is very minimalistic and is simplicity itself (which is no doubt where its charm and popularity came from) so if you're looking for something deeper and more profound (Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther come to mind :-)), look elsewhere. Due to the brevity of the novel, for example, some things just aren't explained, such as the strained relationship between the father and son. But although not the greatest romance novel I'm sure it made Segal very wealthy. Since academics don't make much I have no problem with that and I say all the power to him.***Footnote: Segal was also an avid runner, who ran the Boston marathon 19 times until Parkinson's forced him to retire. Segal recounted that a spectator once shouted at him, ""Hey Segal, you run better than you write!""","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL57BR97XOIX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0380017601#wasThisHelpful","RL57BR97XOIX1","A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unfortunately I have to agree with the other one star reviews here that the remastered CGI special effects really destroy the historical accuracy not to mention the charm of the originals. It's especially unfortunate in the case of this episode which is one of the most admired and loved for several reasons, including the portrayal of the superior alien technology, the introduction of the Romulans, the rivetting battle of wits between Captain Kirk and the Romulan commander, and the first appearance of Mark Lenard in a truly memorable role as the commander. Of course Star Trek fans are aware that Lenard went to a distinguished career as Sarek, Spock's father in a number of later episodes and movies. I have to mention I had the honor to hear Lenard speak in the 80s at Calif. State San Francisco's school of TV & Broadcasting to a packed auditorium. But getting back to the present episode, just remember if you're a newbie that you're not getting the original.

"Batteries tend to rattle around and get nicked and so on especially when traveling so I've found good battery holders are essential equipment. I have these in five different colors which I use as color coding for different types of batteries. The glow in the dark feature is cool, as is the interlocking feature which works well, and I've only seen one other battery holder with this.Some reviewers have reported that the hinge wears out and breaks but I haven't experienced this. One commenter said this is because the plastic chosen is too hard to handle constant flexing and that's why it breaks, but again all I can say is that I haven't experienced this myself. I do try, however, not to bend the lids back all the way or flex them too much since I have seen this ""plastic fatigue"" myself in other products.I use these translucent/whitish ones for my third generation Orbtronics AAA and AA NiMH LSD's (low self-discharge) in the white color. I really like these holders although I don't use them for CR123A's because they're too snug as others have commented here. Since I mainly use them for the slightly smaller CR2 3.0 volt and 14250 3.6 volt batteries, and also a lot of AA and AAA ones, these work fine for me.They are also excellent for protecting very small mini-flashlights like the Steve Ku 38, 40, and 44 models in various metals, the Veleno Designs Quantum D2 and Helix Zi zirconium, the Lummi Orb Wee, the Modamag Draco and Drake models, the DQG Spy and Fairy, and others. All these lights use sub-CR2 size batteries such as the 10180, 10220, and 10280 sizes, which is why they're so small and fit into these cases.

"Great old time war movie with incredible and very realistic action scenes and with a fabulous all star cast. The movie makes clear some of the problems that contributed to the disaster, such as the correct deployment and use of the radar, the order to group the planes which made them more vulnerable, and the fact that admiral Kimmel had no direct phone line from his home to the base and a courier had to be used.

"Although I enjoyed the series the problem with this program is that there are so many historical inaccuracies as to render it practically useless as history, which is why the four stars, but it probably should be 3.0 or 3.5. These have been discussed in the many one star reviews by people far more knowledgeable than I so I'm not going to comment on that here except to point you to those if you're interested. But there are a lot of American history buffs out there, many of whom have spent their whole lives reading about it and they basically hated this program.From a dramatic and character portrayal standpoint though I think the series does better as it shows Adams as the fair-minded, intelligent, articulate, stubborn, and sometimes vain and socially awkward individual that he was, and as a man totally dedicated to his country, whatever his personal flaws might be. Giamatti did well in that regard as did the actress that played his wife, Laura Linney, whose intelligence and character were of great value to Adams and that comes thru here. Veteran actor Tom Wilkinson as Ben Franklin is also a plus, as was David Morse as Washington, although Wasington's part is quite low key until later in the series, which is okay as this is supposed to be about Adams. The actor who played Jefferson was also good and at least the series accurately portrays the tension between the northern bankers and the southern planters and between the Federalist and Republican views on government.I also agree with many other commenters who pointed out the series spends too much time highlighting the low points in Adams's career and the negatives in his character which were minor compared to his many great strengths. There are also those who hated Giamatti's portrayal of Adams and to see a real hatchet job on that see Stanley White's comment under Brandon Price's Highlight review for an informed take on that. I guess you could say it's priceless. :-)To mention one other positive thing, the script and dialog are snappy and taught; too bad they couldn't stick better to the facts as the series would truly merit five stars then. So overall a mixed bag but possibly worth your while as a dramatic story if you keep in mind the series's fast and loose take on the facts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27UKY2LWO7QJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00687PWQG#wasThisHelpful","R27UKY2LWO7QJD","A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think that Simple Green Smoothies, from the ladies who run the well-known website with the same name, is much more than just a smoothie cookbook. The drinks are all “Green Smoothies,” which they define as: leafy greens, plus fruit, plus liquids. It’s not a crash diet book, but there are testimonials of losing weight by replacing a daily meal with a green smoothie (There are several lists of optional “booster” ingredients, including a list of more substantial boosters when using smoothies as a meal replacement, like grains, seeds, and more). And while there are mentions of cleanses, this is clearly something I can drink everyday. I also found the book to be quite fun with lots of goofing-off photos and puns galore. My family’s favorite smoothie (so far) is probably the Simple Melon smoothie, which includes spinach, coconut water, honeydew, and pineapple. It’s refreshing and delicious, and takes just a minute to make. My kids also love their layered ice pops, and I’ve been known to sneak one or two myself. I would like to work my way through every single recipe.

"I enjoyed studying art history in college, especially the lavishly painted still-life’s of flowers — everything from Breughel to O’Keefe, I love them all. Veranda's The Romance of Flowers raises photography to the level of the great masters. Each full-page painterly photo and double-spread panorama show the absolute heights of artful, still-life photography, and the wide variety of flower arranging as well. It’s a brilliant coffee table book, in the very best sense. It’s all so incredibly beautiful, I’ve never seen anything quite like it before, just one jaw-dropping photo after another.There is a limited amount of text, portrayed in large and lovely typefaces — some quotations related to flowers, some inspirational keywords, some discussions of floral arranging, and so forth — which is engaging and well-written on its own, but primarily acts as a complement to the lavish photography. The book itself is very well-bound, with about 300 thick and large, semi-gloss pages (10.5″ x 12.5″).

But mostly I enjoy the various nautical designs and themes throughout. My favorites are those with mermaids, sailing ships, and surfboards. I suppose my favorite though is one with waves and small fish, in a yin-yang spiral. The book is softcover, and not too big to carry or bring with you. The designs are consistently drawn, lovely throughout and really enjoyable. I use my sharpest colored pencils for these since most have fine details, so I enjoy that, too.

"Making sushi for dinner is something I regularly do. And what I mean by that is, basically I make various versions of California Rolls, and that’s about it.  As far as I can tell, this is basically a sushi chef textbook — as it seems to teach just about everything a professional sushi chef would need to know. Yet, authors Elliot and Cook make these skills accessible to anyone in their beautiful and lavishly photographed book. Every style of sushi is laid out, step-by-step, showing how to make all the big sellers, in every conceivable style. Sashimi? Check. Sushi-in-a-bowl (Chirashi)? Check.

Rainbow Roll? All of our favorites are here and accounted for, along with many more, each shown step-by-step with a photo and explanatory text. There is also extensive info on all the various sauces, accompaniments, knives, and different fishes, along with how to prepare them in detail. Everything is presented so clearly and in such a straightforward manner that anyone could learn how (even me), alongside numerous helpful sidebars and explanations.

"Since I have been a huge fan of the author for what seems like forever, I was thrilled to have this opportunity to have a peek into her life! I loved the format, with text, photos and her lovely watercolor illustrations all together in one book and I found it hard to put down until I had read it cover to cover. This volume covers her moving away from California — and the fallout of her heartbreaking divorce — at the end of her twenties. Everything else is told as extended flashbacks, of her young adulthood, and then childhood. Her story intertwines with numerous quotes, song lyrics, photos, illustrations, and more. I really enjoyed reading about Susan’s growing interest in cooking, home decor, gardening, and domestic life. One of my favorite parts in the book is the story of Susan sharing her personal, watercolor recipe cards with a friend. The wise and insightful friend encouraged her to collect and publish them — an excellent foreshadowing of her future career.

"I’m a firm believer that Lucky Peach is the real deal. And their new book, Lucky Peach Presents 101 Easy Asian Recipes, proves it. These are genuinely simple-to-prepare meals — no frying (at least deep frying) and no sub-recipes (except a few epic sauces and condiments, if you like). It’s comprehensive in a way few cookbooks attempt, yet easy and fun to read, and just as easy and fun to cook. The cover promises recipes which are “100% INAUTHENTIC” and while they’re not remotely junk food, they aren’t expensively or meticulously high-end either. Their Summer Rolls seem pretty authentic to me, but I don’t remember finding fresh mint and basil leaves in them before, which is so good. My kids asked if our scrambled eggs can always be Dashimaki Tamago from now on (YES). I just buy frozen dumplings now ($2 a bag!) but their Dumpling Dipping Sauce is perfect for elevating them to flavorful heights.Their Miso and Doenjang Jigae Soups have become frequent favorites for our whole family, too. We have made Slow Cooker Pho twice, including once with meatballs and store-bought stock, and it was great both times (the short ribs version was greater, though). The recipes range across Asia, often in unexpected ways, including what for me was their two most unexpected recipes of all: Corn Cheese (which is a Korean bar snack that my kids are love), and their first and foremost dessert recipe: Oranges (“Cut them up or don’t.”).Each recipe has a sense of being urgently written, just as they’re designed to be prepared, which is also like the book itself, which all has a slightly random yet perfect awesomeness unlike any other cookbook I’ve read. The text explaining unfamiliar Asian ingredients is spot-on, yet sold-on-the-sidewalk accessible. It’s all like this quote about buying the best sushi rice: “Our blunt but hopefully helpful Goldilocks advice on that: Don’t scrape the bottom of the barrel, but don’t reach for the clouds either. The middle is just right.” Which sums up the book very well. Just right.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3484BYR6X1NGA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804187797#wasThisHelpful","R3484BYR6X1NGA","AGBB5TC7F7PDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBB5TC7F7PDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve never had the chance to go to The Hot Bread Kitchen, where women who have immigrated from all over the world offer their favorite breads from home, and they get an education in the American culinary world at the same time. Yet, I’ve been able to learn so much from this cookbook about lots of delicious breads from all over the world. The book starts off with a fantastic grilled flat bread, m’smen, from Morrocco. Mine didn’t look quite like those from the bakery when I tried the recipe, but my family loves them! Great for eating with hummus (recipe included) and curries (like the beef and potato curry recipe, also included here, which is simple yet so flavorful), or folded with cheeses and other ingredients inside, like a quesadilla from heaven. We’re looking forward to trying the naan next.We also enjoyed the olive oil focaccia, although I was in a hurry, so I didn’t let it rise much, and while not as fluffy and light as shown in the book’s photo, it still turned out crusty, flavorful, and fantastic — we love it with pasta dishes instead of regular garlic bread. I like how the book shows how to use one type of dough, like pate fermentee or traditional challah, and uses it for other baked goods, like bialys or rolls. I also appreciated the section which explains how to use leftover breads too, like their epic tres leches bread pudding, which is my favorite recipe so far.

Of course, in serving other, the happiest one is Jimmy Jinks, himself, which I think is a wonderful moral to this simple tale.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTZBJ4X1ZKIKS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YBAUBXQ#wasThisHelpful","RTZBJ4X1ZKIKS","AGBB5TC7F7PDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBB5TC7F7PDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Christmas Puppy is the original 1953 children’s picture book, republished for a new generation. I read this book with my grandmother when I was child, and as a new 9″ x 12″ hardcover presented with its original text and illustrations, it’s just as adorable as I remembered it. In the story,  Polly’s letter to Santa Claus for a toy puppy arrives on Christmas Eve, and Mrs. Santa says there is no time to make her a new one… but then Santa sees his own dog, Jingle — who just had puppies — and has “a wonderful idea.” Now, I'm so glad that I can share this sweet story with my own new grandkids!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRSG83RCUO4ZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0448487659#wasThisHelpful","RRSG83RCUO4ZK","AGBB5TC7F7PDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBB5TC7F7PDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My daughter loves the Disney princesses and is a big fan of characters from the Littlest Pet Shop and My Little Pony characters. I thought that this book kind of pulls those together into one adorable animal. It also does a good job of teaching the basic techniques of illustration starting with basic shapes, then adding secondary shapes, then filling in details. Each Disney princess has a little pony to draw, and a cute pet — kittens, puppies, etc. It’s helpful how the basic shapes are shown in different colors, and my daughters really love the cute style.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RJ7FTA269CGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1600584780#wasThisHelpful","R3RJ7FTA269CGI","AGBB5TC7F7PDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBB5TC7F7PDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set includes two parts, a book showing suggestions of how to fill out basic shapes into 26 different animals. The second part of the set, is found in the glossy folding cover, and has a drawing pad with the original basic shape included. This is helping my kids learn that, by starting off with general shapes, they can add details to create anything they want to draw — including all kinds of animals! There is extra space on the drawing pad, and my kids love to create their own animals by re-drawing the original shapes, and adding details from there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTN855TK70WMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1600584721#wasThisHelpful","RTN855TK70WMY","AGBB5TC7F7PDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBB5TC7F7PDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have some little artists in our home, and I want to encourage that, but worry that they won’t be able to transition from their doodles to serious artwork in the future. When I was young and trying to draw, I didn’t understand that most artists draw out the basic shapes and then fill in the details. This book and kit comes with an art set, and magnetic closing case. I especially like how the book shows how to draw simple cartoon-ish shapes, and then fill them out into a cute character. I think it’s a good skill for kids to learn while young, plus they are having a lot of fun making their own characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21SKMJDVZLQIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633220176#wasThisHelpful","R21SKMJDVZLQIP","AGBB5TC7F7PDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBB5TC7F7PDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m really liking these sponges. Normally, I replace sponges — every couple weeks or so — before they get yucky; it’s kind of expensive, inconvenient, and one more thing to remember at the store. As far as I can tell, the Pura Natural sponges don’t smell at all. So that’s great. But more than that, these are much sturdier sponges than what we normally use, no matter how expensive.They are thicker as well, so they soak up more spilled liquids than regular sponges. They also seem to be very long lasting. The scrubber materials are tough but don’t scratch. The embedded bits of soap work well and is gentle on my hands. And when I rinse them out, all the water runs out — in one squeeze. These are simply better sponges than anything else I’ve ever used.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SXUV0I9PIX18/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QUQCK6U#wasThisHelpful","R3SXUV0I9PIX18","AGBB5TC7F7PDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBB5TC7F7PDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve been concerned about my health and working to increase my well-being by eating more carefully, and getting more exercise, including yoga. The Essential Ayurvedic Cookbook, has been a big help to me in finding healthy and balanced ways of cooking in a realistic way for today’s modern world. Of the 350 pages, about 100 are devoted to offering guidelines for balanced Ayurvedic foods.From among the 200 recipes offered here, the ones I’ve tried are delicious and very healthy, including the Yogurt Parfait, which includes pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and slivered almonds with goji berries and is now one of my favorite breakfasts. My family all loves the Broiled Lime Ginger Shrimp, which offers sweet, sour, and savory elements! Most of the recipes are predictably Indian, but they range across the globe.

"This is the first time I've tried Niacinamide in a skin care product and I feel like it's working really well for me. I know the B vitamins play a large role in keeping skin healthy, so i thought it was interesting that they use Vitamin B3 as part of their formula.  I'm glad it is made without including alcohol, as I find products that have alcohol to be quite drying to my skin. It soaked into my skin very quickly and my skin seems tighter and firmer after applying it. My skin also has a healthy glow after applying, too.  It seems to  be helping with some light acne scarring I have, as well as the fine lines around my eyes, I hope it will continue to do so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3984F8HY16A8R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147PDMYY#wasThisHelpful","R3984F8HY16A8R","AGBB5TC7F7PDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBB5TC7F7PDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love cooking shows, especially those that include travel and a sense of adventure. So, I’m very happy about this book, which goes along with a new TV series (available on PBS) to America from New Zealand, where author/chef Annabel Langbein is a popular chef. It’s a beautiful book, with tons of lovely photos of the dishes and of Annabel exploring “Middle Earth.”There are many deliciously rustic recipes included, most of which are simple to make, and elevate simple ingredients easily and deliciously. The recipes are grouped around regional menus that span the globe, like the Turkish Bride Soup, which is one of my new favorites. It’s a hearty lentil soup with lemon and mint that brighten the flavor. It’s traditionally served to brides on the evening before the wedding to sustain them throughout the busy day ahead. My favorite menu so far is the Asian Summer Meal, which includes refreshing Pork and Cilantro Spring Rolls, with a sweet and spicy Apricot Chili Glaze.The recipes are healthy, yet often quite hearty, like my husband’s favorite Cowboy Hash, which he makes himself on weekend mornings. My children’s favorite recipe has to be the Orange Lightning Cake (because you can make it so quickly), although I use a fine grater for the orange zest, then blend the orange segments, rather than blending the entire orange. Gorgeous photos, too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KJSHAZ76TX8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0958266867#wasThisHelpful","R3KJSHAZ76TX8G","AGBB5TC7F7PDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBB5TC7F7PDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Max and Marla is so darling! Max and his non-speaking friend, Marla the owl, have decided to become Winter Olympians. I love how Max cares for Marla, for example, carrying the little owl to bed when she falls asleep while waxing their sled’s runners. I like how the story shows the importance of working to make things go well, rather than merely hoping they will, and how caring for others can make any effort a victory in its own right. The book also has some of the cutest illustrations I have ever seen. I also loved all the blues throughout the book.

"I found Robo-Sauce to be a simple, heart-warming story — with a big surprise at the end! It starts out with a boy, dressed as a robot, who is bothering his family. When they leave without seeing how much fun it is to play robot, the narrator offers the boy the top-secret formula for robo-sauce, which will change him into a real robot. But, things go awry and everyone, even the book itself, transforms into a robot!Spoiler alert: When I reached the page that reads, “ACTIVATE ROBO-STORY,” I found a hidden, silver-foil printed book cover, folded up inside. So I covered the book, and inverted it, then read the rest of the book (backwards). It’s a simple device that is nonetheless very creative and fun. I’ve actually never seen anything like it.

The arrangements are pretty simple to create and they show suggestions for decorations or centerpieces. Each floral creation has a large photo that shows the details of the project and I really liked how many of the ideas used recycled items.

"I’d actually love to see a movie version of The Last Kids on Earth, which tells a comic story about a team of friends facing off against zombies and monsters at the end(?) of the world. I enjoyed the first person narration as it describes the clever weapons and tactics they use to mostly avoid — and occasionally fend off — the monstrous people of this small town. The story moves along quickly, with lots of fun humor. My concerns that the book might turn grotesque or violent were unfounded, and I found that the characters, which include the hero/narrator, a strong female (who is definitely not in distress), a brainy friend, and a now-reformed bully, do a good job of showing how great teams can succeed together. I also really liked the illustrations that were part of the story, too.

"I'm really liking this product, it feels very healing and soothing to my skin. It is a clear gel that soaks into my skin very quickly and with no residue or greasiness left after it is applied.  I also like the easy to use pump. With my skin aging, I've noticed some rough spot and dry patches. This completely evens them out  and also gives my face a very smooth base for applying makeup afterwards.

The first is about a little girl and her grandfather getting ready on Christmas Eve — making little snowmen, and frosting sugar cookies.

"There are lots of great recipes in the Mug Shots Desserts! I’ve tried various mug brownies and (literal) cupcake recipes online, but thought that was all there was. But there are many clever ideas here, that I would have never thought of on my own. For example, Rice Krispie treats, monkey bread, pineapple upside-down cakes, cheesecake(!), and even creme brulee. Some require you to use the various power settings on your microwave, which I hadn’t really used before, I’ve found that the recipes were really spot-on, and made great treats in just a minute or two.I had some leftover pumpkin in an opened can in the frig, so I tried out the pumpkin pie recipe. I was concerned about how the custardy dessert would cook in the microwave, but it turned out fantastic! There were no hard parts or uncooked parts and I cooked it in a fairly tall and thin mug.

"When I see a crochet pattern, it can be hard for me to envision if the style would fit well on me or not. I like how this book has already tailored the sweaters to specific body types, so I have much better idea if the garment is one that would work for me or not. It explains the different body types and then has a sweater to create that will flatter that particular type. The instructions are very clear and helpful, with many color photos throughout and there is much helpful info on catering patterns to body types, too.Since I am a novice crocheter, I especially appreciated the tips about fixing things that didn’t turn out quite the way that I had hoped they would. Uneven edges is a problem I have always had and they had some good suggestions on how to prevent and fix that issue. One extra that I enjoyed, was the pretty edgings that I can add to my sweaters to personalize them a bit.

Of the recipes I’ve made so far, I like “Bestest Banana Bread” the best(est), and my husband’s favorite is the Six Ingredient PB&J Sandwich Cookies. My kids really liked the No-Knead Thin-Crust Pizzas, because everyone gets to make their own delicious work of pizza art and they are ready to eat very quickly (important with kids!).The Brown Sugar Shortbread (with three ingredients) turned out wonderfully, too. The brown sugar added a nice browned-butter flavor. I’ll definitely be sharing these around the holidays, which was suggested by the book’s listing of all the recipes divided up by occasion (“For Bringing to a Dinner Party”, etc.). Next week is my daughter’s birthday, and I can’t wait to make the Coconut Tres Leches Cake for her, which I know my whole family will love. I’m really glad I got Food52 Baking, it’s one of my very favorite baking books ever.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QALCAKAKVQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607748010#wasThisHelpful","R2QALCAKAKVQF","AGBB5TC7F7PDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBB5TC7F7PDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I appreciate how this book shows how to make enjoyable and authentic Italian food — without pasta, bread, or other gluten sources. It is also a beautifully designed and photographed book. The soft-bound, full-color book begins with several “starters,” including info about Italy, the Paleo lifestyle, how to set up your kitchen, and numerous cooking tips.The recipes include basics, sauces, condiments, appetizers, salads, brunch, Tuscan favorites, soups, stews, meat & poultry, seafood, sides, and (my favorite!) desserts. There is also a section of pasta dishes which use vegetables to replace pasta, such as Spaghetti Squash Puttanesca, I love this recipe for using one of my favorite veggies.My favorite recipe overall is probably the sole piccata, which is fantastic, yet is easily made and works well for a variety of different fish. I also made the Tuscan vegetable and herb-baked omelette for a my family and I’ve also tried the Osso Bucco, but with a less expensive cut of meat. Both were delicious! Such a beautiful book, with many authentic recipes from Italy that anyone (paleo or not) would enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XJOQUD6XDJ9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804845123#wasThisHelpful","R2XJOQUD6XDJ9V","AGBB5TC7F7PDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBB5TC7F7PDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve shared different stories of flights I’ve gone on with my kids, so when we see planes flying by, they’ll sometimes ask how this or that works. How to Build a Plane makes it easy for me to teach them about just how planes work. The story line of friends building a plane together is fun and engaging, and the diagrams are fantastic — with a clarity and warmth you rarely see together. There is also a section about how planes actually fly, and what the instrument gauges are for. I think this book would be engaging for children of all ages, especially if they have an interest in flight.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HSAAJY9XDKAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633220419#wasThisHelpful","R1HSAAJY9XDKAH","AGBB5TC7F7PDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBB5TC7F7PDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m really impressed with this book. I have a son who is destined to be an engineer of some kind, as he is always trying to figure out how everything works, especially vehicles, and he loves this book. It’s from the junior division of art-book publisher Walter Foster, so the illustrations are excellent, both in terms of their detailed, retro appeal, and also in how accurate and informative they are.Diagrams of the various components, such as the engine or suspension, are fun for kids, yet fully accurate, with little flags noting which part is which. The “technical tale” features a fairly in-depth story line of some anthropomorphic critters who decide they need to build a car. And although at first glance it seems like it is “just a kids book,” it encompasses everything I remember from a year of Auto 101, and then some.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H5C1XWBY6O0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633220400#wasThisHelpful","R1H5C1XWBY6O0M","AGBB5TC7F7PDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBB5TC7F7PDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My daughter-in-law is having a baby, and it’ll be our first grandchild. I got her this book, which was produced by three doctors from The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, one of the world’s leading pediatric care hospitals since 1875. The book provides exactly what the title claims, covering the basics in a friendly and concise book which still manages to be extensive and authoritative. It’s easy to read, with each chapter divided up into lots of very small sections, including sidebars, notes, pull quotes, FAQs, and “Works Best for…” bullet points, with clear headings, so you can find what you’re looking for quickly (even in the middle of a 3 a.m. feeding).I’ve had several children of my own and have had some training as a midwife, so I was glad to see the practical, accurate, relaxed and down-to-earth information new parents need, with a minimum of panic-inducing “see your doctor” commands. For example “Sleep when your baby sleeps,” is just the sort of advice every new mother needs, as well as a chapter introduction that advises new moms to just focus on them and the baby their first month together. There are many practical tips, like how to hold and swaddle your infant. There is some great info on breast-feeding, including different positions, how to get a good latch, and treating common problems.The book continues on through the first year, covering sleep, eating, teeth, and sickness, with some helpful charts on development stages. I especially liked the listing of how to interpret your baby’s cries — which generally increases toward 6 weeks, and diminishes thereafter, the book notes. The soft-cover book is well-bound, with nice paper, and includes lots of photos for reference as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19WXZFA5X4B97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778805190#wasThisHelpful","R19WXZFA5X4B97","AGBB5TC7F7PDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBB5TC7F7PDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In many ways, this book is a major work, with a fascinating interpretation of what a taco (and it’s many cousins) can be. The many variations of sauces, salsas, fillings, and toppings of all kinds are well-considered and delicious, respecting tradition while innovating in equal measure. For instance, the simple green cilantro sauce, which takes no more than two minutes to make, is really a revelation to me and I make it regularly now.Similarly, the various molcajete sauces included here (with alternate instructions for making them in a blender) are each fantastic, and for me, refreshingly new. Her numerous fresh pico salsas are fresh and delicious, and we end up eating them alone with chips or added to every Mexican meal we have.  My family also loves the orange and lemon juices and zests in her Cuban-style pork recipe, which is a new family favorite.Another one of our favorites is her recipe for crab salad, which I keep ready in the fridge, it’s a great meal or snack for the whole family, including in fresh wraps or burritos.

I loved how the dogs and cats are sitting in cute little positions, and each sits on its own chesspiece marked stand. The nice 2-sided chessboard is included.

"This is a large set which recreates Noah and his ark — in folded-paper oriami figures. The set includes a large case with plentiful papers for creating the 13 figures of Noah and his wife, and 11 different animals to go along with them on the ark. The book provides basic instructions for origami generally and then walks through the steps needed to create each figure. Plus, there is the ark itself, which my daughter put together herself easily.

"I liked how, since the recipes begin in her San Francisco home, I could get a sense of the author's favorite tastes and culinary perspective — vegetarian with a pan-Asian bent — for her later unique interpretations. I also enjoyed the listing of pantry items she would stock for each type of cuisine, which I found really helpful and informative. The book is well-designed and written, with helpful descriptions and tips, alongside beautiful modern photos of foods and scenes in each area she visits.I haven’t tried all the recipes, but some stand-outs for me so far were the shredded tofu stir-fry from San Francisco, although I substituted stir-fried greens for the pea shoots. I took her tip and rolled it up in spring roll wrappers, and my whole family enjoyed them. I’ve also tried the spring rolls, with brown sugar tofu and mushrooms, and I loved how the brown sugar carmelized the tofu and mushrooms, creating a sweet-and-savory combination.From Morocco,  the Harira soup was delicious, with chickpeas and seasonings like a mild masala, and a little bit of fresh lemon at the finish. The ricotta crespelle pancakes from Italy are a favorite of my husband, and I prefer them with the whipped egg whites, per Heidi’s suggestion. Her listing of kitchen basic recipes is very helpful, including her orange thyme za’atar seasoning. She suggests adding this mix to ripe avocado with a drizzle of olive oil, which I’ve been enjoying as part of a quick lunch. This is a substantial and well-written cookbook, that I’d recommend to anyone who enjoys expanding their palate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CZMKD1I11YSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607745496#wasThisHelpful","R3CZMKD1I11YSB","AGBB5TC7F7PDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBB5TC7F7PDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve often wondered how Iron Chefs cook at home. I think I  might have found the answer in this book. Based on the popular segment on The Chew, his food-oriented talk show, this sequel to his previous, best-selling book lays out very original recipes, based on simplified versions of high-end restaurant fare.  TBH, I haven’t actually eaten many dishes like those Symon offers within, but they all look fresh, healthy and inviting.A major theme seems to be salad-as-meal. Many take an unusual/trendy green or vegetable of some kind — raw, shaved Brussel sprouts and chopped endive are favorites — served with a quickly prepared protein, and served with a light sauce, frequently a vinaigrette. There are not a lot of starches, although a few pasta dishes do show up, like the Spaghetti Puttanesca, which was delicious even though I substituted a less-expensive kind of canned tomato.So far, I found the Spicy Salami, Cantaloupe & Mint Salad to be surprising and fun, which is served with a light vinaigrette and a spoonful of Greek yogurt. My family really likes several of the shrimp dishes, including the Thai-Style Shrimp Salad, served on finely sliced napa cabbage, and Shrimp in Coconut Broth, which is like a Thai soup but with tomatoes. Everything is very light and fresh, and I’m looking forward to trying more recipes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1095WHEN31U4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804186561#wasThisHelpful","R1095WHEN31U4O","AGBB5TC7F7PDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBB5TC7F7PDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I read the book over and over many times, and also looked forward with great anticipation the whole year to when the movie would be on TV. The book was not only incredibly entertaining and engaging, but it also taught valuable lessons in terms of children’s behavior, and I pondered on the character’s examples time and time again. My kids and I had fun making our own version of the lickable wallpaper from the book. One of my favorite snacks as a kid was graham crackers spread with vanilla frosting, so I thought that by adding some colorful fruit shaped Runts candies, it could evoke that delicious wallpaper from the classic book.

"This small yet thick book would make an excellent gift for anyone involved in designing things for a living or as an avocation, visually or otherwise, both as an introduction or refresher. These principles often concern issues of communication and persuasion, so I believe it could be very beneficial for anyone involved in marketing or advertising as well. It names a principle, gives illuminating visual examples, and clearly describes it in brief text. Each principle is described in a few paragraphs on each little two-page spread.I think that by reading (or revisiting) these well-described concepts, one would develop Depth of Processing (“Thinking hard about a thing improves the likelihood that it can be recalled.”) and avoid the Dunning-Kruger Effect (“A tendency for unskilled people to overestimate their competence and performance.”).

"Anyone who draws or paints will need to draw plant life at some point. For me, it seemed to take forever to draw trees, bushes, or flowers, and my results can seem overworked besides. I have wondered how illustrators managed to suggest a properly proportioned tree with just a few lines, and just the right amount of detail? I discovered that author/artist Matt Pagett has many answers to my nature questions, and showed me how to sketch plants with a light-yet-expressive touch, as detailed and/or evocative as I needed.Pagett reviews the basic media (pencil, pen, charcoal, paper etc,) and elements of art (line, tone, color, composition, etc.) in a brisk yet helpful fashion. A variety of truly beneficial exercises follow, and a series of approaching different styles as well. In addition, there is a second exercise sketch book included — both held within an additional hardbound cover — which is also exceptionally useful.

"According to Van Gogh, “Drawing is the root of everything, and the time spent on that is actually all profit.” For those who wish to spend their time more profitably, while being inspired by a true master, I think that this beautiful and inspiring sketchbook would make a wonderful gift. Each page features an original Van Gogh sketch, licensed from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, and many include quotes from (what I assume were taken from) letters to his art-dealer brother, Theo.Most of Van Gogh’s quotes seem to be comments about the artistic process, while others recognize the amount of work that it takes to create successful art, all of which I found to be encouraging. “I can’t help but make progress precisely through learning by doing; every drawing one makes, every study one paints is a step…” “for the great doesn’t happen through impulse alone, and is a succession of little things that are brought together.”I was able to find ample space for drawing in the large and beautiful hardbound book. There is lots of space to emulate the master, or strike out on one’s own. And even if some of my drawings are less than a success, well, as Van Gogh says, “…one must spoil as many canvases as one succeeds with"", so I'm trying to be patient with myself while learning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24W7NNMN0BQYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631060589#wasThisHelpful","R24W7NNMN0BQYC","AGBB5TC7F7PDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBB5TC7F7PDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I think the illustrations are clever and fun, with gothic touches throughout, and offers a warm ending that I enjoyed.

"Having been a fan of Ottorbox and LifeProof cases, I have tested many iterations.  These are the cases I love and the cases I buy and recommend to others.  I have tried impostors but have not found other cases that hold up to the rigor that most LifeProof cases do.  This has been my experience.I was given the opportunity to test the LifeProof FREPower iPhone 6 Waterproof case and did so happily.  I have had this FRE case LifeProof iPhone 6(4.7"" Version) Case - Fre Series - Soaring Blue (Light Cobalt/ Dark Cobalt) on my iPhone since Januray 2015 and was happy to take a step up to the FREPower.  I find that one of the biggest issues I have with my iPhone is running through the battery with a busy day.  I take precautions to save battery power - these are some of the more specific things I do:  1) You can find a list of apps using the most battery resources in the battery usage section of the device's main Settings menu. ...  2) Manage Background App Refresh. ...  3) Turn down the brightness. ...  4) Turn off Fetch  5) Turn off Bluetooth if not in use with a deviceNow with the backup 2600-MAH battery, even when I am careless with battery hog applications ... I can continue to work with my phone without worrying so much about battery life.  The form factor obviously is not as sleek as the regular FRE case but in my mind, it's better than carrying around external power and LifeProof has done a great job of making the form factor look attractive and less bulky than other options I have seen.To me, this case is winning.  I like the look and feel and find that the exchange of a little extra heft allowable for the option of longer lasting battery power.  As a side note, I found that the case charged perfectly fine with my Amazon Kindle power cord.  I am not saying that every or any 3rd party USB micro cord will work for you ... but for me it did.  The form factor did not differ greatly from the regular FRE, the main difference is in thickness but is negligible.Thank you LifeProof for the chance to test and review another great product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QNHBP0S4TWOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7SC0YY#wasThisHelpful","R1QNHBP0S4TWOY","A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But for me - drinking different loose teas like Yerba Mate, this is a perfect size.  The opening of the bottle works ok for me but does hit my nose.  I would have opted for a wider bottle design.

"These silicone suction lids are a great alternative to using plastic Saran wrap to cover leftovers.  They are dishwasher and microwave safe and contain no BPA.  The set includes a 5.5"", 8"" and 9.5"" version.

I am unsure about general covers for long-standing items on a stove (making pasta sauces or soups).  Versatile covers.

"This is great ""utility"" shirt that can serve a lot of purposes.  The fabric is light and 100% cotton so is breathable but I would not recommend this shirt if you are looking for something in a technical cloth (Coolmax, etc).  If you need something for camping or fishing and need SPF protection or wicking, you'll have to find something else.  This looks like one of those other shirts from Columbia or North Face.  But it's different.  A comparable shirt from Columbia is Columbia Men's Bonehead Long-Sleeve Shirt which is 100% cotton as well but has a few more features and a vent in the back of the shirt.  The Wrangler version does not ... this is more an everyday work shirt with a few flaps of velcro, tabbed roll up sleeves and a little venting at the neck of the neck.The could have done so much more with this shirt.  But as-is, it is a nice value at the $20 pricetag.  Just understand what you are getting when you buy this shirt.  It looks more technical than it is.  It has a nice, clean put together look though and looks great with jeans.

"For it's price point, this is a great shirt and is very well made.  The descriptors for this woven shirt on the Amazon page are wrong.  There are none of these things:- Mesh fabric in back neck for coolness  (no, instead there is chambray material lining the neckline)- Roll tab sleeve (NO - on the utility shirt)- Rod loop at front chest (NO - on the utility shirt)Instead, this is what you are getting with this Long Sleeve Classic Woven Shirt:  - 100% Cotton  - Imported  - Machine Wash  - Caviar mid-weight brushed twill  -  2 chest pockets with button thru flap closure  -  Button closure  - Relaxed fit  - Made in BangladeshThe shirt itself is great quality and will soften up over time.

"I have been using the Luseta Beauty Tea Tree and Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner over the past week and my hair is soft and supple.  I was asked to test the products in exchange for a fair review.The products arrived in two pump bottles and I was happy that the pumps worked smoothly to dispense small amounts of product with each pump.  The shampoo has a great smell (mainly tea tree) and a wonderful, luxurious feel when lathered.  The lather was perfect and the feel on my scalp was extremely refreshing without being overpowering.  The main difference comes from the addition of Argan oil which aids this formula in providing moisture and smoothness (I am using another Tea tree product which is very very drying).  I love the way my hair feels when using both products together or just one at a time.This is a great scalp calming formula that feels refreshing without overdoing it.

"I have used so many different selfie-sticks and most of them are the same and only differ slightly in form factor.  I have found many of them contain very cheap components, are funky colors or designs (I don't necessarily want a selfie-stick with pink accents on it).  Many of them look and feel pretty lightweight and cheap.I was asked to review the Kamotech Selfie-stick and received it free in exchange for an honest review.  I get asked to review many selfie-sticks and refuse many of them because they are all the same.  When I saw this one, I knew it was a bit different than most of them I have tried given it's size and portability.  I was anxious to test it and compare it against so many of the others.  It is different in a few areas and really sets itself apart quality-wise because of this.If you are looking for a truly pocket-sized selfie-stick, this is one that fits that description.  When you receive it, you also get a small carrying bag so that it fits in a pocket or purse without getting hung up on keys or other items.  The bag is soft and contains a drawstring.  This is a nice plus.  But really, one of the main features that I love and think is versatile is the GoPro type of mount/hinge that allows me to hook a GoPro camera to it.  This adds another level of versatility that makes this Selfie-stick just a little bit better than the others.Sure, this SS is more expensive than some but If you are looking for a selfie-stick and value compactness and flexibility, this is the one.  I definitely recommend it based on it's size.  It truly is compact.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7GY59MRZMVJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012T4JBDQ#wasThisHelpful","R7GY59MRZMVJP","A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried various supplements for this or that usually with results I cannot truly identify.  My Mom's doctor recommended Antronex for her (she deals with some minor allergies and post-nasal drip) and I decided to give it a try without any great expectations.  The bottle calls for one pill a day.  I actually take about 6-10 per day to support my severe allergies (I take Zyrtec too and am a bit too chicken to NOT take my OTC antihistamine).To preface, I have asthma and get sinus infections like it's no one's business.  I live in Florida and the allergies can be intense.  I have found a regimen though now that excludes the nasal sprays I was on and minimizes the use of Sudafed.  I took Sudafed like crazy and it was contributing to UTI's for me.  I have MS and Sudafed changes bladder tone ... who knew!?  I was taking quite a bit of Sudafed and I knew it wasn't the best for me but I needed it to avoid getting sick.  Well, since starting Antronex about a month ago ... I have managed allergies pretty well in the moment and as they arise.  I take my daily Zyrtec and my nightly Benadryl but inbetween instead of reaching for a Sudafed for sinuses or a Kid's Benadryl for breatkthrough allergies during the day ... I take two Antronex and voila, it does the trick.For me Antronex took a few days to really notice much of a difference.  Now about a month later it is working well and keeping my allergies at bay and under control.  The biggest change I see is the sinus support it provides me so that I do not have to take Sudafed every 4 hours and at night.  For me, this is a huge change and one that I am very happy about.  I am impressed with Antronex ... no doubt about it.  I certainly am not afraid to take them throughout the day as needed.  This equals 6-10 a day.  The stuff is smelly as heck but it really works.  My allergies are intense and severe and this is a great supportive therapy option for me.5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22RZ3S4NR70EK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019FUFEQ#wasThisHelpful","R22RZ3S4NR70EK","A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice quality sleeping mummy bag for the price.  I prefer a down bag for warmth and weight but for a modest price, this bag will do.  It has features on it like more expensive sleeping bags and is well made ... but the I agree with many of the others who reviewed stating that the warmth rating is probably an overstatement.  I cannot test in this temperature as I live in Southwest Florida.The bag is comfortable and with a camping mat, more warmth and comfort is achieved.  The bag comes with a stuff sack and the zipper is on the right.  This bad does not appear mateable and no left-handed option is available.Factors such as humidity, how you are camping (mat or no mat) and amount of clothing worn in the sleeping bag are all going to contribute to overall warmth.  I would treat this bag like a 30+ range and probably be happy.  I am accustomed to an Army sleeping bag and did well with mine back in the 1980's sleeping in the Appalachian mountains in Alabama.  It was wet and cold and the middle of Winter.  The trick ... sleeping with very little on and the use of a mat.I do not believe this bag could fare in temps of 20 degrees.  I would trust it in the over freezing temperatures and even in the 40's.  Of course there are multiple factors.  This is a nice sleeping bag for the hobbyist ... a more serious camper and outdoor enthusiast.  For about $30 more I would probably opt for a Kelty Kelty Tuck 30 Degree Sleeping Bag or Kelty Tuck 20.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIG5EUV2V4IWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LQF9FTU#wasThisHelpful","RIG5EUV2V4IWC","A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a solid and very rugged reversible Black/Brown grommet belt.  Like a throwback from the 70's, this belt reminds me of Wrangler jeans and even bell bottoms.  But it is a very functional and sturdy belt.  The leather is stiff and as listed on the belt itself is a ""Genuine Leather"" product (this means layers of leather versus one solid piece as in ""Full Grain Leather"").  For the price, it is a value and a little bit of break-in time is to be expected.  The hardware and buckle on the belt are good quality and the buckle roller help make the job of securing the belt on the waist a little easier.  Getting out of the belt when it is new is a bit more of a challenge.One of the coolest features that was not immediately clear to me at first was the fact that this belt was reversible.  The black or brown side can be worn with the simple twist of the buckle.  The brown side is very dark - think ""Espresso"".  No latches or screws to undo to take advantage of the belt color of choice, a simple pull and twist motion and you are in business. Without directions I ALMOST pulled out my tiniest of screwdrivers but had to believe there was an easier way.  There was.  Maybe the belt twist and turn is familiar to you, but I am depicting it anyway in attached photos.If you want a soft and supple belt, this is not the one for you.  If you want something rugged, Wolverine has your covered at a price point that won't break the bank.

"This tuner, metronome and tone generator is really like the Swiss Army Knife of musical gadgets.  Great for pitch, tempo and tones.  It also comes with great directions and a nice soft carrying pouch.I appreciate the metronomes out there and even metronomes with tuners ... but this one also provides a tone generator along with an earphone-in jack and a 1/4"" plug in and out jack.  It has a stand on the back that makes it flexible enough to position it multiple ways - whichever suits your particular set up.  The unit is small enough to fit in a pocket and isn't much bigger than a standard cassette tape (for those who actually remember them).  Every feature on this little device has a purpose.  From the sharp and flat lights to the volume button on the left side to the thumb wheel (JOG dial) which moves like a charm and helps to toggle between tones and tempos.  The Tap In feature is neat and allows you to tap in your desired tempo ranging from 30-250 beats per minute - just the way you want it.To top things off, turn over the Metropitch and you will find a tempo range table that corresponds from ""Largo"" to a jumpy ""Prestissimo"" (200-208 bpm) and everything in between.  This provides a nice reference.I received this Metropitch tuner and metronome for free in exchange for a review and this is the second product I have reviewed from KLIQ. This is definitely a versatile gadget for hobbyists like me and professionals.  It's priced right so that if you need to have several, you can place them strategically in a music case, studio area, etc.Really a great and handy little device that even accommodates instrument specific tuning modes.

"I have owned 4 Evriholder FURemover Broom over the past 6 years or so.  Some people have ""borrowed"" them and 1 actually got worn out.  With a house full of cats, a fur removing rubber broom is an absolute necessity.  These brooms work great on all kinds of surfaces: laminate, wood, tile and carpet (but expect more labor on carpet).  I am doing a little comparison on both of them.When I compared both brooms, the Perky (this one) and the FURemover and found that each has their strengths.  If you are mainly using bristles and less squeegee, I think the FURemover wins hands-down for it's smooth sweeping feel on hard surfaces.  The Perky was not nearly as smooth over my tile surfaces and the rubber was different ... creating a bit of a ""pull"".  The Perky did a fine job sweeping up debris, but the effort to use it seemed greater with more resistance on surfaces.  I also think that the larger bristles on the Perky worked better on my short pile area rugs.  But sweeping rugs with any of these rubber brooms is a chore.The Perky has a better squeegee and does a bit better on rugs.  The FURemover has a longer handle that telescopes and can give you some height where the Perky does not.  It is also a pleasure to sweep with because it's smooth motion.  Effortless on hard surfaces.Pros of the Perky:- the Squeegee is awesome! Works well- the larger bristles work better on carpetPros of the FURemover:- smooth as butter on hard surfaces.- telescoping handle allows for height adjustments.For my purposes, I prefer the FURemover.  I use mostly on tile and small area rugs.  I prefer the smooth motion versus the resistance I feel with the Perky.  Each has their place and perceived values.  Both are good and will do the job.  It just depends what you want this rubber broom for.  Regardless, if you have hard surfaces and pets ... you really should consider picking one or the other.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RE9LOKDOT6MX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQNI99O#wasThisHelpful","R1RE9LOKDOT6MX","A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I am basing my review on that.Our LED ball stopped working after the first night and no catnip was included in the package as promised.  The plastic is also quite brittle unlike the Bergan Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy, Colors May Vary and products which have a scratching surface and a ball and don't cost $40+ for poor quality and QA.In theory, this would be a nice toy for cats.

"I think that conceptually this is a pretty cool tuner.  Please keep in mind that I am testing on a 4-string Ukulele  and this tuner is supposed to shine with a 6-string guitar.  Even when tuning with a Bass guitar, the PolyTune technology is disabled.I like it's relatively compact design and it's flexibility to toggle between needle and strobe viewing.  I like ""needle"", so I chose that view.  However, given that there are so many tuners out in the market today for so much less ... I am underwhelmed.  Especially given the cost of this tuner at just under $50.The Polyphonic tuning feature seems more gimmick than substance.  If you have a guitar and strum, it can attempt to tell you where the strings are individually as far as pitch +/- ... but to me, a well trained ear can do as well if not better.The clip is grippy but I personally like the Snark tuners better and find the rubber clips on the Snarks a little more amenable to expensive instruments.  I clipped the PolyTune to my KoAloha Concert Ukulele (this uke is the lightest and nicest I've ever owned - feels as light as balsa wood with a tone that is gorgeous).  Besides the lack of the PolyTune feature, I don't feel that this tuner is the right one for my preference.Snark SN-8 Super Tight All Instrument Tuner in a pack of 2 has been my choice for my multiple ukes.  Two for $25 and they cannot be beaten.  Totally not convinced that this PolyTune clip does anything that warrants the price tag.  If you have the extra money, and if you like a sleeker look and want to try something a little novel - grab the PolyTune Clip.  It works wonderfully as a standard tuner with a new little twist for those playing guitar.  I don't personally see the value of the features being worth the cost ... I could buy a pair of cheaper tuners for my Uke and a set of strings or two for the same price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15V7ABVHW7SX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZU4G0ZK#wasThisHelpful","R15V7ABVHW7SX5","A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are a beautiful pair of Pro Mark Hickory drumsticks created with a twist.  Not only are there articulations to enable grip at the end of the sticks but there is also a finish on them that gets more tacky as you perspire and warm up.  You need to evaluate if this tackiness is something that will be amenable to you?  Imagine playing your set after eating a bucket of caramel corn or Cracker Jacks.  That is what the tackiness feels like to me.  Like I have caramel corn-laden sticky hands and I just picked up my sticks to play.  If that kind of stickiness doesn't bother you ... then these sticks might be your favorite pair.  If, like me, you may feel a little bothered with sticky hands ... I would recommend something a little different like the Zildjian Trilock Gurtu that have a rubber grip/  I prefer the Zildjian sticks.These Glenn Kotche Active Wave 570's are about a 1/2 longer than most and have a nice, responsive feel.  They are weighted well and my pair showed no signs of warping or unevenness (except for some of the finish/coating which is flaking off right out of the package - thus the 4 stars).The acorn shaped tip is nice and responsive and DOES NOT have any of the tacky finish on it.  Free and clear so they shouldn't leave any strange marks or stickiness on your drum heads.They feel good with weight and length.  A nice balanced stick.  I am not sold on the tacky finish though ... or me, I will stick with my Trilok Gurtu sticks - Zildjian Trilok Gurtu Artist Series Drumsticks","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BN5LS0OS8BTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011QVG9L0#wasThisHelpful","R2BN5LS0OS8BTF","A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in Sarasota, FL (South of Tampa) where the lightening storms can be intense and frequent.  I use surge protection on everything to save my electronics.  I trust APC as my brand of choice and definitely do not skimp on power protection (no dollar store surge protectors for me).  We used the brand where I used to volunteer as an EMT and also in my corporate workplace.  APC is the brand I recommend when looking at surge protection and I can say that I have used the brand for about 20 years.When offered a product geared toward more sensitive electronics like those used in home theater, I was glad to try it out.  While this is not the most compact of power strips (it's titled a ""power filter"" not a standard power strip) it offers some flexibility with a rotating outlet bank which is cool.  So you can stand it on end or lay it on the ground and use the orientation that works best for your set up.  I am using the APC C20B version (although the enclosed instructions also encompass info for the C25B version as well which is a little smarter and has a couple more options).  Still, the APC C20B seems like it will be a solid performer.I am using 7 of the 8 outlets in my living room where one of our plasma televisions and the cable box, FiOS/wi-fi, Amazon Fire TV, Blu-Ray players are and everything fit just fine.  There are outlets for a telephone, but I have not connected one to this device.  Installation was easy and straightforward and the APC directions are thorough and clear as usual.Another great product from this company.  I'm thankful to protect my sensitive electronic devices a little bit more with this Power Filter.  APC will continue to be my brand of choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V1VJIT34U59W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTJ2QQU#wasThisHelpful","R2V1VJIT34U59W","A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD replaced ""Asperger's DIsorder"" in the DSM 5 in 2013) encompasses all levels of Autism.  What was once called ""Aspergers"" (and Just Add Water still uses this diagnosis) has now been replaced with a spectrum diagnosis.  Asperger's sits high on the spectrum and depicts someone who is high functioning.Clay Marzo is a master surfer.  He surfs with finesse beyond his years and an ability that is hard to quantify and replicate.  He surfs without distraction and is purely focused in this pursuit.  This book is about his journey as a Prodigy of surfing and through school and life as a surfing celebrity.  It shares the story of Clay's struggles socially and in the limelight as a representative of the Quicksilver brand.  The reader gets a practical peek into the mind and thought processes of someone struggling on the Spectrum (Asperger's).For a teen struggling with Asperger's and for the parent trying to understand what it is like ... ""Just Add Water"" is a triumphant story of a child who moves into adulthood with a new awareness of coping and eventual outreach.  Clay is doing some great things for those with Autism these days.  His struggle becomes a story of greater awareness and giving.  The water was his joy and comfort zone ... being out of it was hellish.  This great book shows how he made the journey to greater awareness and living.Great book, inspiring and telling.  The surfing story makes it fun but I feel the greater value in this book is in the journey towards awareness by both Clay, his parents and his sponsors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11V8T6T8PPMZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544256212#wasThisHelpful","R11V8T6T8PPMZ8","A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fun and functional toy that takes a bit of patience to build.  I don not have children but I understand from a cognitive perspective how the mind of a child works.  I could recommend this set to a more advanced 8 Year Old or an average 10-11 year old.  This building project takes time and I was able to build them myself with the direction booklet which was clear.  The pieces were also arranged well and easy to identify.The finished product is neat ... but to me getting to the finished project is where the value lies in this product.This is a project that works best with a child who is patient and organized.  Be careful around very small children and dogs because there are many small parts.

"This is a great flat bench that fits a general workout niche.  It works well on it's own as a place to leverage and stretch or as an adjunct to barbells.  Dumbbells are great on here too.It's low profile makes it easier to store than I expected .  The only caveat to that is the thick legs (which add to stability and are necessary) make it more bulky to store than it would be if the legs were foldable.  Of course, that creates another more expensive product.  This product out of the box had a little bit of assembly.

"I've noticed over the past 10+ years that I have had problems with various Apple cables.  Whether for an iPad or iPhone or Macbook Pro ... it seems that there was one end of the cable towards either the pin connector or USB connector where the vinyl covering bunched up.  I was able to watch YouTube and find ways to remedy this problem .. .but it seemed to be a problem inherent to all of Apple cables that contained the vinyl outer cover.  It seems like this cover would crinkle and lead to exposed and eventually frayed wires.This Belkin cable alleviates any of that problem by using a braided material that provides a bit more flexibility along with an aluminum shell at both of the connector ends.  This seems like a good combination.I use the cable in my car to plug my Apple devices in it.  It holds up to Florida heat without a problem (but so did the OEM cable).  This cable looks cool, is easily identifiable and has an extra layer of ruggedness.  It does well being wrapped up and shoved into a purse, bag or whatever.  No need to have to baby this cable.

"I love the shape of these glasses and they are crystal clear out of the box except for a couple of slightly visible seams.  The shape feels great in the hand, they are boxed well and for the price  They are much thinner walled than I would have ever imagined and can be easily manipulated (squeezed) out of shape.  Besides those stackable plastic cups you see at open bars or a red Solo cup ... I would not expect a pastic wine glass in this price range to feel so cheap.  At $22+ for the set of 4, I could not find any person I asked who thought the glasses were a good value.  What they and I did like was the shape of them.  The ergonomic shape is wonderful and wine looks great in them.  They serve a great purpose when glass or crystal is just not the best option.  But the thin walled nature of these glasses undermines them and makes them feel almost disposable.Let your guests know these are not throwaway glasses if you are serving others.  They are of a beautiful design, and it's the design and shape that gives them 3 stars in my eyes.  I took off two stars for the build and price.  They seem far too pricey for what a person is getting.  Priced at the $10 mark, I would definitely increase the rating by 1 star.I received these Govino glasses for FREE in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YIHZ27TA937K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XCHX78K#wasThisHelpful","R1YIHZ27TA937K","A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I live in Southwest Florida where the humidity is high but I can BBQ all year long without a hitch.  I use a Weber Genesis grill that has a thicker handle.  I was concerned at first that this light would not fit the circumference of my BBQ handle ... not a problem at all.  The adjustable bracket on the light is easily adjusted just right to fit the handle at whatever angle I choose to mount it.  The bracket allows for a lot of variability and this is definitely a great thing.There is a small screwdriver included with the light ... this is simply to open up a screw on the battery compartment (which takes 3 AA batteries).  It was a nice add-on in the package.The light is turned on through touch and shines bright at 100 lumens.  Just enough to focus on the job at hand.  The switch is sensitive to touch and responds easily.  The light has some heat resistance but optimally, the instructions say to keep it dry and a half meter away from the ""bbq station"" - I think the handle is the perfect place but will need to be assessed if you are using the light with the top closed.It mounts easily and does a nice job in circumstances that do not have optimal light.

Those tangled cable messes that result from so much technology and so many different ways to plug in.

Playtex is a trusted brand so I was happy to try this bra out.  A little lengthening of the shoulder straps for me made this a better fit (so that the underwires fell a little lower).  When I made the adjustment, it took care of wrinkles at the top of the cup where the shoulder strap starts.  For me, this is a problem area.This is a good bra for rounder, fuller breast and is not particularly pointy ... I'll try bras on that are more pointy and they never work.  This is NOT one of those bras.I am not sure I would order more of these given the underwire ... but it is pretty and it works as a non-padded bra with a good solid backstrap and 4 hooks versus 3 hooks.

"Bought a pack of two of these Snark SN-8 Super Tight tuners for my Ukuleles.  I have multiple ukes and needed a simple tuner to clip on the headstock and pack in the case.  This tuner does a great job of helping me find the sweet spot on each string.  The display is bright and it just works.  I like the included metronome too.  But my favorite is the transpose tuning feature which can be adjusted to whatever fret I have my capo on.  That is a very neat feature.The other great thing that makes this such a nice and easy tuner is that a simple click of the yellow button gets the unit on and the unit turns off too with a simple push.

"I always loved At-a-Glance products.  Always so well thought out.  For this planner, I have struggled with a rating between 3 and 4 stars.  I opted for 4 stars in the end.This Weekly planner is a great option for teachers, professors or older students.  Although I cannot imagine NOT using my smartphone for the things that this planner provides ... this is a great option for those people who are still the pencil and paper type.  Some of the classic stuff in this weekly planner make it useful:  A 3-year reference calendar, contacts, notes pages, an event calendar, 4-year holiday list, and a U.S. time zone and area code page.  A smartphone can make this obsolete in a second ... but there are those people who will never go with technology.  For those people, this is a nice option that steers away from the black covers that scream traditional.  For someone not ready to go purely digital but who wants to veer away from the black covers.  This is a cool option.The one thing I did not like (on my unit at least) was the spirals on this spiral bound book.  I found the spiral a little bendy and flimsy.  I can see this being a problem over time as this notebook gets jostled in my briefcase, backpack or book bag.  Other than that, it seems like a nice option that is priced like it's competitors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34252SWMK106I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCC4WUA#wasThisHelpful","R34252SWMK106I","A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having finished Fairest, a novella of the Lunar Chronicles, I do feel as though I have more insight into Lunar Queen Levana's behavior as we see it in the other books. Fairest follows her from the time she's sixteen and has just lost her parents to assassins; her sister Channary has been named queen. That's less problematic to Levana than the fact that her crush, palace guard Evret Hayle, is married and unavailable. When his wife dies, Levana uses her gifts to ensnare him, but obviously that's not the way to make a happy relationship. The relationship between the two is the main focus of Fairest; the way Levana chooses to ensure that she becomes queen and remains that way is the second, lesser sub-plot. In a short novel, it's easy to see where the plot is going but it's the insight into Levana's thoughts that make this more than just a throwaway story.All that said, I really wasn't all that thrilled with Fairest. Levana is, of course, the villain in the Lunar Chronicles, but her own self-delusion is really pitiful and her mistreatment of others places her on the same level as the sister she dislikes. I'm aware that I'm not supposed to like her (and I don't) but there was almost a time when I felt sorry for her. It seems whatever she wants, she cannot have, and she takes all this out on the situations and people around her. By the time I was done with the book, I definitely wanted to see her destroyed, not just redeemed (not that I think that's possible). This is a fast read, but not really one that made me think, ""Wow, so there's a whole, well-rounded backstory to Levana."" I wish it had given me a more multi-dimensional feeling for Levana, because that would certainly have made for a conflicted, exciting next installment.  Instead, it simply reinforces my low opinion and makes me ready to get to Winter...which, I suppose, was the author's intent all along.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I98O3W7Z6CZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250060559#wasThisHelpful","R2I98O3W7Z6CZ9","A265NE6H6LYX87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A265NE6H6LYX87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Anya's Ghost is a good graphic novel that pulls the reader into the story quickly, and keeps you turning the pages to find out just what is up with this ghost...Is she really just a friendly ghost who wants out of the well where she's been stuck for nearly a hundred years? Or is there something slightly more sinister going on?Built around Anya, a teenager whose mother emigrated from Russia to America when Anya was a child, we follow her through a normal, teen-angsty type day, wherein the boy she likes has no clue she's alive and school is such a bore. Then she trips and falls into an old well, and unable to make herself heard, she realizes she's not alone--there's a skeleton in there, with its ghost still attached. Turns out the ghost belongs to Emily, who died nearly a century ago, and now wants to experience more than her hole in the ground. When Anya is rescued, she finds that somehow she's brought Emily's finger bone home with her, thus enabling Emily to leave the well. The thing is, Emily is pretty handy, helping out in school and giving advice on how to make Sean take notice. But Anya wants to help solve the mystery of Emily's murder, and it's this fact that changes everything.The story itself is good, and the characterizations are spot on. I really enjoyed the artwork; Emily's pupil-less eyes give a definite creepiness to her appearance, and the black and white theme adds to the ambiance. This graphic novel would most definitely appeal to teens who feel isolated in social situations, and it's got enough depth to the story to make even a reluctant reader want to keep going. I wasn't such a fan of Anya's friend Siobahn (still not really sure what her purpose was, to be truthful), but I loved the way Anya's confidence grew over the course of the story, and I liked the idea that she had difficulty fitting in because she came from another country.  This is one graphic novel with a good story that can easily be recommended to anyone who wants to escape for a bit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R211NNXP385IXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250040019#wasThisHelpful","R211NNXP385IXN","A265NE6H6LYX87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A265NE6H6LYX87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 19th Wife by David Ebershoff is really two stories, something I didn't realize when I initially began reading. Not that that turned out to be a bad thing, but going in I thought I was just getting the story of Ann Eliza Young and I ended up with that and more. I'm still not sure the present-day story was needed, or even all that good, really. But interesting? Yes, indeed.So...This is the story of Ann Eliza, who became the nineteenth wife of LDS leader Brigham Young and later divorced him amid much public turmoil and sensation in the 1870s. We follow the story of her mother, Elizabeth Webb, who was the first wife of Chauncey Webb, and whose faith is strongly shown in her life and the way she raised her children. Ann Eliza is very headstrong, however, and quickly marries James Dee once she's an adult; that marriage, though disastrous and ending in divorce, produces Ann Eliza's two sons. Interwoven with Ann Eliza's problems are those of her brother, Gideon, who ends up at the mercy of Brigham and convinces his sister to marry the leader, even when she does not want to. All of these stories are told from differing points of view, some in several chapters and some in only one, and we even have Brigham's voice telling us his doubts and desires. It's obvious Ebershoff did his research thoroughly and well in the way he illuminates the tenets of the LDS Church and the problems and interests of polygamy.Bouncing in and out of this story is the present-day mystery of Jordan Scott, whose mother (Number Nineteen in her own marriage) is accused of the murder of her polygamous husband. Jordan doesn't buy this story because he knows his mom; she's not unhappy with her conservative, fundamentalist lot and there are other wives/people with more motive than she has. Jordan, traveling with his dog, Elektra, goes to the town of Mesaville to see what he can discover and finds out that not only is he unwelcome, he's not wrong, either. While he investigates, he also becomes involved with a new boyfriend, Tom, and a fellow runaway/former ""First"" child, Johnny.The story of Ann Eliza is well done, and the focal point for most of the book. I loved how we moved among the important people in these events. Ebershoff uses a variety of methods, including newspaper clippings, narratives, and even a wikipedia entry to get his points across, all to good effect. He's brought Ann Eliza to life and given us a fairly accurate (or as accurate as can be) portrait of a woman who had finally had enough and wished to be more than just a number in her husband's harem. She wasn't always likable, and she had her own issues, to be sure, but without her interference, polygamy might have taken much longer to not be recognized in the LDS.The modern day story is good, in that it points out that there are still sects that practice polygamy and the subjugation of women, and the children of those unions often turn out disenfranchised and forsaken. I just never really liked Jordan all that much, and didn't get very involved in the overall story. There were too many characters I didn't really care about, and maybe the intention of alerting the  reader to the continuing problem should have been the focus rather than a murder story. It's not bad, and I did find myself trying to figure out what happened. I just don't think it was a necessary component to the overall success of the novel.If you don't know much about the history of polygamy in the United States, this book will do a pretty fair turn at informing you in such a way as to give several sides to the story and making you think about how/why it happened. It's well written and engaging, and will probably have you looking up more information once you close the last page. I'll be thinking about this one for a while.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW28N8YNOTU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812974158#wasThisHelpful","RW28N8YNOTU2","A265NE6H6LYX87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A265NE6H6LYX87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Okay, yes, I admit it:  I am addicted to these fun novels about the Rat Pack! This time, our Eddie G. is asked to help a friend of Dean's...one Marilyn Monroe. What red-blooded male of the early 60s would turn down such a gig? Not our favorite pit boss. Marilyn feels someone has been following her, so Eddie agrees to look into it. Unfortunately, he receives word of the passing of his mother back in New Jersey, so Eddie turns the job over temporarily to detective buddy, Danny Bardini. Things take a turn for the worse when the funeral doesn't go well and Danny disappears. Along with sidekick Jerry, Eddie becomes determined to discover what happened to his friend and also to keep Marilyn safe. Suffice it say, nothing goes as planned and someone ends up injured and someone ends up...dead.The portrayal of Marilyn in this mystery is handled sensitively yet realistically; it's great to see Eddie react with care and concern for Marilyn's worries, and to see her portrayed as sexy yet vulnerable. Along with Marilyn, Frank comes off particularly well in this installment, agreeing to help Eddie G out more than once. I can feel the relationships developing here, deepening into true friendship. Jerry is a delight as usual, and it's great to see Eddie relying more on his friend, and realizing just how important Jerry is to him. The story does go off in an unexpected way, but more icons of the 60s are involved and it's easy to see how seamlessly Randisi weaves personalities into his story. Particularly poignant is the ending; you'll start to believe it all truly happened this way. And that is the true beauty and fun of this novel. So much fun!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z5HND3E5EJK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031237643X#wasThisHelpful","R1Z5HND3E5EJK6","A265NE6H6LYX87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A265NE6H6LYX87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Princess Mia, and I've loved all the Princess Diaries books. Yes, I even love the movies though the changes didn't make me very happy. So, after years of having read all about Mia's insecurities and foibles, I was a little apprehensive to dive into this one. Was the magic still there? Could she possibly come across well as an adult? I'm very relieved to say YES, this is just as much fun as the other titles, and I'm just as happy with the story.It's been five years since Mia last wrote, and in that time she's graduated college and moved into an apartment in the Genovian Consulate. She's still with Michael and still balancing her princess duties with her real life; she's involved in causes she's always espoused but is also waiting for Michael to pop the question (even though they'd agreed they'd wait until life calmed down for both). Mia has a stalker so it's even more important that she watches where she goes, and her grandmother is as obnoxious as ever. She keeps an eye on her Rate the Royals rating and the stress of her father running for office in Genovia has caused her eye to twitch. Just when she thinks she's going to lose it, Michael whisks her off to a private island and...well, you can guess the rest. Enter Grandmeré, who wants to take everything over, but also has a major announcement about Mia's father that will impact all their lives.There's so much more--there always is with Mia--but it's so much fun to visit with her and hear her thoughts as her world goes haywire. I liked that while it's still basically the same Mia, there's a more adult edge to the story, in both situations and language. If there's some parts that work out a little too conveniently, that's all right because hey, it's Mia, and it's a fantasy. I love how it worked out and I'm hopeful we haven't seen or heard the last of the POG.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQV9V8XTG34GT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NEPLPC0#wasThisHelpful","RQV9V8XTG34GT","A265NE6H6LYX87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A265NE6H6LYX87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a Lord John fan. I admit it and embrace it. So I was thrilled to find this novella about his adventures into the Canadian wilderness to stand up for his friend (but also to get out of England for a bit following a duel that went awry). It was nearly the perfect length for a recent flight, and took me right into the Outlander universe as well.I won't waste time recounting the entire plot, other than to say Lord John finds it expedient to get out of town and when he's asked to stand up for his friend, he takes it. Once he's made it to Canada, however, he finds his cousin's husband has disappeared...after creating his own second family with a Native American woman. Lord John is nothing if not a beacon of integrity, and he does his best to set things right in this regard, and ends up taking part in a British raid on a French fort (which also involves Simon Fraser). If you are looking for a happy, upbeat slice of Lord John's life, this isn't it, but it is gritty and real.There's a lot packed into the novella, and while it doesn't really illuminate more of the overall story, it's an excellent glimpse into what Lord John stands for and it strengthens the backstory of his life in general. I love how Gabaldon has given us a hero, although one with many secrets, who stays true to himself as best he can in any circumstance in which he finds himself. This novella will keep you engrossed with its wry humor and believable twists.

"By the time you get to the third book in the Rat Pack Mysteries, you pretty much know what you're going to get: a Rat Pack member (or two) with an issue that our hero, Eddie G., can help discreetly, but things go awry and bullets fly. This time it's Sammy Davis Jr., who has the problem: a roll of film has disappeared from Sammy's home and it contains some photos Sammy would prefer not be made public. Of course the situation calls for the utmost care and discretion, and Eddie G., pit boss at the Sands in the 1960s, is called upon to act as a go-between for Sammy and the blackmailers holding the photo. It doesn't take long for the incident to take a deadly turn and soon Eddie finds himself, along with his buddy Jerry Epstein, into things much, much deeper than an embarrassing photo for Sammy. Indeed, it becomes clear that there is something else on that roll of film that people in very high places need to make sure does not get out. But can Eddie maneuver his way through the obstacles and stay alive?It's no secret that I love these books, and this one is no exception. When I think I have things figured out (and I did feel pretty smug about this one), I find out that I'm not as smart as I thought I was. Randisi does an admirable job of weaving people and events of the times throughout his novels, and  he evokes the era clearly in his descriptions. I'm totally hooked on this series and highly recommend it to anyone, but especially those with an interest in the heyday of Frank, Deano, Sammy, and the gang.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1257V28STCT5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312376421#wasThisHelpful","R1257V28STCT5B","A265NE6H6LYX87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A265NE6H6LYX87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

No bulk and great protection! The corners of the bumper case are just thick enough to provide enough protection from drops, and add to the ""looks"" of the phone, in a very good way. I've dropped my phone face down, on its sides, on God-knows how many different surfaces and it's survived just fine.In the few weeks I've owned this case, I've grown all the more fond of it, for reasons mentioned above, and more. If you're not looking for something not quite too rugged, but rather more so an all around great case that provides grear protection at at excellent price: by all means I do recommend this case!!Disclosure: I received a product sample to evaluate and provide my honest and unbiased review.

"This is my favorite self tanner by far!! Ive been using them for years, and have had some pretty strange and interesting results. Once, even a doctor of mine had wanted to refer me to a dermatologist because he said that something is wrong with the way my skin tans (he didn't know it was a self tanner I had used). See, I live in Florida where EVERYBODY has gorgeously tan skin; everybody BUT me! I will burn a million times over before getting tan, which is why I use self tanners. The tanners I used prior to this would rub off on areas like my elbows and knees, and usually, as they were fading my skin would just look so splotchy it was ridiculous and/or disgusting. It's no wonder my doctors was concerned. There were so many other things that would go wrong, too. And each experience I'm referring to are with big name-brand products!!Not with Thermalabs!! I've had nothing but a completely positive experience with this tanner!!! For 2 primary reasons:1. It allows for gradual tanning, while still giving you an instant, all-over glow on first use.2. It comes with an extremely thorough ebook that tells you everything you've ever done wrong with self-tanning, how to fix it, and how to get it right the first time. No other tanning product has offered directions as clear as Thermalabs- which are eye-opening, and explain some (but not all) of the problems I had with other tanners.Of course, when it arrived I didn't so much bother with the book. I immediately went straight to my normal routine (assuming I knew everything having done it for so long). The application was consistent and easy. As a precaution, since I did not know what to expect, I mixed it with lotion before rubbing it all over my body. While the immediate result was not super dark bronze (which I didn't expect anyway), there was a noticeable difference. My skin tone was even all over, and had a gorgeous sunkissed glow.I watched for signs of discoloration as the days passed and it slowly began to fade. I didn't want to reapply it again just yet, because I really was curious if it would turn me into looking like a leper as almost every other self-tanner had. Over the course of a week, it faded as evenly as it applied- with no splotches, unevenness, or streaks.I applied it the second time without a base lotion, and followed the tips and suggestions (many of which I was completely unaware of!) in the included ""Self Tan Secrets"". Oh- I should mention that this ebook is very easy to read, understand, and follow.The second go around, my tan was FLAWLESS! It was streak-free and completely even all over. I purchased an applicator mitt which I also think helped a lot. But really, I think that what really makes this so much more effective than other products is that it uses all natural and organic ingredients. Based on the results of my second tan, I expect this product to last for some time, as a little does go a long way. By all means- I LOVE this self tanner, and highly recommend it for all skin types!Disclosure: I received a discount to purchase this product, to evaluate and provide my honest and unbiased review.

"I live in Florida. High, and frequent, sun exposure is a given unless you're a total recluse. But even IF I were, as a single mom of two boys: I have to be in the sun, a lot.As a result, we keep sunscreen with us at all times. It's in the car, my kids backpacks, and even a small bottle I keep in my purse. For me, personally, I find it important to keep sunscreen on my face at all times due to the damage that can be caused with frequent sun exposure, such as accelerating premature aging.It seems harder and harder to find foundation that contains sunscreen. And when I do, it isn't long before the heat melts it completely off of my face. I've tried to use other brands of sunscreen to use when I moisturize, but they always clog my pores causing breakouts.That's where this sunscreen works beautifully! Especially since I use vitamin C and other face serums that require an SPF moisturizer. Now, when applying moisturizer, I mix equal parts of this sunscreen and let it do its work as a moisturizer. It absorbs fast and deep adding essential antioxidants and nutrients in addition to sun protection. Plus, with mixing it with my moisturizing cream, it is guaranteed to last quite some time. Still, I make sure to apply it generously to my neck, since that is the most overlooked area but often shows aging much faster than the face.Then, I add a little to my liquid foundation. Even though my foundation might melt right off, due to the Florida heat, with this absorbed into my skin I'm still protected from sun damage.Since doing this, I haven't experienced any burning or breakouts- which to me, is a complete life changer for me. Not only do I feel comfortable being outdoors more often, but I AM outdoors more often! By all means, I highly recommend this sunscreen.Disclosure: I received a discount to purchase this product, to evaluate and provide my honest and unbiased review.

"There is nothing I can say about this coffee and tea press that does it justice. Seriously. But that seems to be the norm, I'm learning, with Bruntmor products in general.I had recently purchased a press for my boyfriend that was still practically brand new, but when I was offered this one at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I figured since he works offshore, that he could use another to keep on the job. Coming with 4 extra filters, I thought it'd be perfect!But when I saw this one- well, it is just so much better than I ever imagined,  I decided to keep it for myself. It's incredibly unique, completely shatterproof, the handle stays cool to the touch, and it makes one heck of a good cup of tea. In every way, it puts his to shame. The design is absolutely magnificent and I have no problem leaving this one out, in full sight.The plunger fits snugly inside the reservoir, so it makes a great cup of tea without leaving behind any trace of leaves in my cup.  Which is highly surprising, since my tea leaves are finely ground, more so than my boyfriend's coffee (he grinds his own, and very fine, too).All in all, this is a very functional and presentable French press. The glass is thick and shatterproof, but crystal clear; the frame is solid and well made. I love the heat resistant handle, which I've never before seen in any press of this sort. Although this design is similar to some, in the most general way, it's the most modern and unique I've seen by Bruntmore. I am very happy overall, and certainly recommend it!Disclosure: I received a discount for my honest review and hope my observations and experience can help you make a better buying decision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWBT2EDU0Y55I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZAXFGTC#wasThisHelpful","RWBT2EDU0Y55I","AG7ZF2YS4DE56","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG7ZF2YS4DE56?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is by far one of, if not THE MOST, impressive RFID wallets I've ever seen! The fact that the wallet itself is crafted of a beautiful high-quality, grain leather- which appears to be rather strong, and quite durable, really sets it apart from other RFID wallets.But this is so much more than a wallet alone, with RFID capabilities: this is an ENTIRE KIT that will fully and extensively secure each and every possible card from potential fraud. In fact, this kit is expansive enough to protect an entire family!I've bought quite a few RFID wallets for myself, family, and friends, over time, but all have been ""plain-Jane"" in appearance being plastic or stainless steel. None have looked like a REAL wallet. Nor have they been exhaustive enough to provide ample security for ALL of my cards-- especially my children's! So I was quite excited when I received a discount to purchase this kit, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.The leather of the wallet is especially soft, nice, durable, well made, and constructed of good quality materials. The stitching is reinforced all around. It's also easy to open and close, doesn't seem to have any significant bulk, allowing quick access to your cards. There doesn't appear to be any ""break-in"" period either, as with most leather wallets.The interior is impressive! It has a total of 6 regular sized card holder pockets (3 on each side), with extra ""side"" pockets to neatly store cards (receipts, etc...) beneath the card pockets, on each side. In addition to having a deep and wide ""bill holder"" section- for keeping cash, and like size materials- there is a second ""bill holder"" section just beneath it.In every way, this wallet looks and functions as any regular wallet should- but with more pockets; having BUILT-IN RFID blocking protection; and being real, top-quality, high-grain leather. In addition to its ability to hold cards,  securely in place inside of the RFID casing (which is invisible to the naked eye), the inside card openings also have a sufficient space and openings to keep cards, cash, receipts, tickets, and misc. papers completely separate aiding in quick access to each as needed.As IF the wallet want enough, this kit takes it to the extreme by including an additional: 10 separate, individual, RFID blocking credit card sleeves;  and 2 RFID blocking passport sleeves. These are AWESOME for giving to family members, protecting cards that are kept at home, and/or when carrying a wallet isn't really practical and it's easier to just bring along a card or two.All-in-all, this is an excellent wallet (loaded down with essential accessories )that is functional, practical, constructed of good-quality leather, and protective from card scanning thieves. I expect this wallet to last for some time, and it has done a wonderful job holding up for the few months I've been using it.  If you're looking for a luxurious, protective, roomy, and overall great quality passport  wallet - I feel fully comfortable with giving this case a high recommendation.Disclosure: I received this product at a discount, to evaluate and in exchange for providing my honest and unbiased review.

"First of all- this is a beautiful corkscrew! It's constructed of a high-polished, high-grade, stainless steel that's got an absolutely gorgeous handle with an ebony wood inlay. It screams ""quality"" in every aspect.Other than just being outright gorgeous, what I really like about this corkscrew is that it is more of an all-in-one multipurpose wine tool. As far as the corkscrew alone is concerned, the handle allows it to be easily screwed right into the cork,  without any breakage. Literally, within 5 turns or less, using the handle and double-hinged fulcrum for leverage, the cork can be quickly and easily removed, fully intact.Just above the fulcrum is a bottle opener, and at the opposing end of the handle is a serrated knife, which has the intended purpose of a foil cutter, that neatly folds into the handle. Having every tool needed, effectively and functionally designed into one gadget makes this an exceptional wine accessory!Overall, this is a highly functional, essential utility tool for any wine connoisseur - novice or expert. The quality is unmatched, which is further backed by a 100% no questions asked, lifetime refund/replacement warranty. With a company willing to stand so strongly behind their products, says a lot. Their confidence gives me full faith that this product will last an incredibly long time.

"For years I've been desperately seeking solutions to problems such as: aging, fine lines/wrinkles, acne scars, acne, scars, and discoloration. I even considered using a deep chemical peel, to just shed the whole first layer of skin, when this product was offered to me at a discounted price, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.I've suffered some major breakouts over the past few years, which ultimately spread into patches. I couldn't help but pick at them, which had resulted in scarring, leaving dark splotches all over my face. Attempting to lighten them, without any guidance, I picked up a bottle of Hydroquinone awhile back, spot treated, and ended up lightening the scars rather quickly. The problem is that while the scars themselves lightened significantly, the result of using Hydroquinone left my face full of much lighter splotches that look like ""rings"" from doing targeted treatments. I was afraid this might do the same, or exaggerate the problem- but I had to give it a try as I desperately need a solution.It's been about a week now, since first use, and I have not experienced a single breakout since. I noticed my discoloration is becoming less visible, but subtly. I like that it won't result in more blotching, but instead, evenly lighten and brighten my whole skin tone. Still- to be most effective, and see the permanent elimination of old scars, I believe this product will take some time, but in the end will work beautifully!However, I'm quite impressed with the results, just as a moisturizer. It doesn't take much to apply for it to provide thorough coverage that is quick to absorb, and deeply so.

"This is such an adorable headband! I bought it for my niece to wear with her Christmas outfit, and couldn't be happier. She's only a month old, but come Christmas, I still expect that it will fit just as nice and comfortably as it does now. The band is easy to stretch, is extremely soft, and fits just good enough to not come off but at the same time isn't tight whatsoever. It just fits perfectly, and after about a minute of her curiousity, she doesn't even realize she's wearing it.The covering over the elastic band is a nice, white silk which flows very nicely into the rose bow, that is a real eye-catcher. It's very decadent, especially with the pearl accent, but in no way is it even close to gaudy. It's a very unique, but classic sort of style. The bow is just the right size on her little head, too.

"This is an great, fast charging, portable, user-friendly, 2-port USB wall charger! Each of the two ports, are clearly marked for charging either 2.4 or 1 amp devices, and both have IQ technology, which makes charging time much faster than most other USB wall chargers I've used.  I really like this feature because with its Smart IQ technology, it knows what you're charging and does it at the maximum speed and/or amperage possible for that particular device.Now I don't know much about ""tech"" stuff, but I can tell you that I plug my 10ft lightening cable into it, and my iphone charges pretty dang fast. Oh- and another important thing: in ones that I've used in the past, I've has issues with being able to use my phone while it's charging (my phone will just start going crazy on me).  I've been using this one for some time and haven't experienced a single issue. It's perfectly compatible with my iPhone 6 and my ipad. Even when charging them both at once! Plus, I'm not limited to charging my iOS devices, because I often charge my kindle simultaneously with my phone, too.I really like how portable it is!  For travel, the prongs easily fold in for packing or really anytime when it's being stored and not in use. What I really like about its size, though, is that unlike most other adapters I've used, it doesn't take up so much space that it covers both sockets- so I still have an open socket to use as I wish, without either interfering with the other.Also, the color is very nice. I chose the green and white, which is high gloss black, and has grooves along the side which help with grip when unplugging it.If you're looking for an all-in-all excellent USB fast-charging wall charger, for any purpose, you cannot go wrong with this one.

"My father used a razor just like this one his whole life.  I remember how smooth his face looked, and even felt, when I was young.  I thought it odd as I got older that he wouldn't use  ""normal"" disposables like the rest of the world, and curious that he would go through so much trouble.  But he insisted ""its the best shave you can get.""So I decided to order this for my boyfriend, who knew my father well as a child (we grew up together).  He won't be getting it until Christmas, but I had to go ahead and take a peek at the razor beforehand.===IT IS GORGEOUS!!  My father's was the same color, just decades old.  Seeing one all shiny and new like this caught me a bit off guard.I picked it up- and was amazed at how wonderful this felt in my hand!  It seemed perfectly balanced, and made with superior quality. The 11 extra blades that are included ensure an excellent cut for some time to come, before needing replacing.I am so glad that I was offered this at a discount for my honest and unbiased review!

"There are a lot of great things about this no-bark collar, with the first being that IT WORKS!! With first use, literally straight out of the box, I put it on my dog - It wasn't long before the first bark came, and immediately stopped. Lord only knows what was going through her head!In just the first day, the barking dramatically decreased. Of course, this is not something I intend to leave on her at all times, but to use as a training aid. I plan to take it off after 3 days time and see if she even realized it's off. If she does, I like that I can just put it back on her. Eventually, she'll get the point!I like that this collar is adjustable, because it gave me plenty of room to put in around her neck. I just cut off the excess. It's not heavy, either, but she could tell it was on her initially. I also like that there is a battery included, and when it runs out, I can easily  and quickly replace it at my local hardware store- or order it via Prime shipping.It has two prongs which can feel the vibration when the dog is about to bark. It alerts her with a beep, which gets louder with each consequence bark. Should she keep it up, it omits a vibration along with a beep, which also increases with intensity. But it never really ""shocks"" her, like most people believe.This is certainly an effective collar for training, or even for travel when you need something to keep the barking under control. To me, it's much more humane than any muzzle.

"I purchased this for my niece who is an avid dog enthusiast. She breeds them, shows them, and loves each of them (well over a dozen) as if they were her children. Yes- we all love our pets like children, but she loves her dogs so much she decided to not have children in fear it would interfere with her time with her dogs. To me, that's a bit overboard, but to each their own.The only real problem I have with visiting her, is that she insists that we take her car any and every where we go. That means my boys and I have to sit on her seats, which reek of dog and are completely covered with hair! As a result, we step out of her car covered with hair from the seats. While she didn't care so much about having the car seat cover, or not, personally- she knew that it would help preserve her seats and make guests riding in her car much more pleasant.After a very thorough vacuuming, I helped her install it. This part was very easy: the straps are quite sturdy and slip over the headrests, and there are also anchor tie down straps (at the bottom) which give it an extra measure of security, knowing it will stay in place. Prior to this, I had bought her a different seat cover- but it wasn't even close in comparison to this one, in terms of: quality, coverage, and ease of use. This one offers FULL protection, more than any other I've seen.When riding with her now, she just takes off the cover and we have nice, clean seats to sit on. Afterward, she just puts it right back on; but I've personally seen her use that time as an opportunity to wash it.I don't dread visiting my niece anymore, knowing that if we went anywhere that we wouldn't look and smell like dog when we arrived. She seems happy with this seat cover, and so am I! By all means, I highly recommend this for anyone with pets- or even toddlers for that matter!Disclosure: I received a discount to purchase this product, to evaluate and provide my honest and unbiased review.

"Let me first begin by saying that this is by far, unlike ANY backseat car organizer I've ever seen! It's way above par, and truly has got to have them all beat in terms of space, quality, design, etc...by a long shot. So it's really hard to write a fully comparative review, but I'll do my best by highlighting what makes this one so very special. First, though, I must say that I love that it includes a safety hammer- which is a must have for any driver.Overall, this is an high quality organizer that is great for just about anything!  It has an incredibly strong hold, and out of the box it is obvious that it is made of high quality material. The stitching is strong, the straps are strong, and I have no doubt that it will hold quite well with all of the things my kids will be stuffing into it! It doesn't sag either, no matter how much it's stuffed.Installation is easy, and is only a matter of: strapping the top band on and under the headrest, the bottom band around the front seat, and the elastic hooks underneath the seat in the rear. What I like about this design is that it keeps the organizer super secure, and by tucking the bottom band (that one that straps around the front) into the seat- it's completely comfortable (and undetectable) by the front seat passenger. Often being the front seat passenger myself, I can tell you that disregard for this is a critical design flaw in other organizers which make the strap (and buckle) a huge discomfort for any passenger seated in front of the organizer.I have a minivan, and this organizer does exactly what it says- by literally covering the entire back of the seat. The pockets are plentiful, and just the right size, too. I especially like the depth of the various compartments, because it gives my kids ample space to put their larger, essential items; while the pockets also keep organized thinks such as their sunglasses, toys, etc... Well, I'm kind of wrong there because no matter what I do, they just stick the weirdest stuff wherever they can. But that's kids! And at least with this bag, I can always dump it out, throw it in the washing machine, and start over fresh  :)Back to the pockets, though: they are deep, so that they so hold a good bit. But at the same time, they aren't so deep that you have to dump the whole thing out to see its contents. That's what makes the mesh pockets so great. I also really like that it has space for their sports bottles, because all too often I find them under seats and such from rolling around in my van.I also like that with so many separate pockets, and various sized pockets, each of my two kids can store their phone cords, chargers, dirty socks, or whatever in designated ""spots"" of their own, and the arguments over whose stuff is whose is eliminated, for the most part at least.But it certainly does make cleanup a lot easier for me, being able to stash things in their proper places when on the road. It's especially suitable for snacks and drinks. That, and when we take trips that require specific items (like sunscreen), they are easily accessible, being within reach when stored in any of the pockets, and like items are kept together. The fact that I can also use it to hold my ipad so that they can watch movies and such, is a great plus.And while my kids aren't little anymore, it still comes in extremely handy with them as pre-teens. In all regards, as an organizer in general, this is really a great product for anyone. It's an essential part of our daily lives, in our vehicle housing our essentials.  On that note- I highly recommend this organization bag, for anyone who might ever have the need to organize anything, which pretty much covers everybody. This organizer does the job quite well!Disclosure: I received a discount to purchase this product, to evaluate and provide my honest and unbiased review.

"My brother is into weight lifting, which is constantly keeping my mom worried about his safety. So when I was offered the opportunity to purchase these at a discounted price, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I thought they'd be a great solution to ease her worries and keep him safe. While I know nothing about weights, or what these collars were for, I gave them to my brother and asked his opinion after giving them a try. So this is what he said:""Well mom is sure happy!  I'm used to lifting by simply sticking a weight on the bar and going at it. These actually keep the weights in place so that they won't slip off. But I like them a lot too, because they are easy to use being quick release. They're solid, sturdy, and something I've needed for a very long time.""I guess that says it all! He's happy, likes them, and believes them to be well made and an essential safety item.

"With the holidays coming up on me so fast, I've been looking for any and every thing that will help make my life easier as mom and host of my family. I've been using the same colander for years, and while I know of many occasions (especially holidays) where I've wished for another- it's been rather difficult to find one that isn't more trouble than it's worth. For example, I've had nothing but bad experience with plastic ones, and the metal ones I've seen have holes so large they'll undoubtedly strain away half of the food! So when I was offered this one at a discounted price, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, coupled with another holiday season upon me, I decided to give it a shot.When this arrived, I was rather impressed, immediately after removing it from the package. It's made of what feels to be a good quality stainless steel, felt very sturdy in my hand, and was well balanced. Looking closer at the holes, I was happy to see how they were close enough together to provide ample drainage, and small enough to prevent food from slipping through.The first time that I used it was straining angel hair pasta in the kitchen sink. The round base is high enough to keep food from touching the sink directly, and the top rim is wide enough that I was able to pour the pasta straight from the pot, at a distance of approximately 10 inches above the strainer. Overall, it is sturdy enough that it did not move, shake, or bend despite the large amount of water poured into it from boiling. the noodles. I also liked that I was able to immediately remove it from the sink, with the handles being cool to the touch even after being doused in boiling water.Indeed- this is an excellent colander! It's easy to store upright and hang by its handles, it's construction is solid, and it is made of high quality steel. I believe it can also be used as a steamer (I don't see why not!) which is an excellent bonus. By all means, I do recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24DTQK5TGHEIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014L1OB6W#wasThisHelpful","R24DTQK5TGHEIJ","AG7ZF2YS4DE56","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG7ZF2YS4DE56?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is by far one of the most elegant and classy RFID wallets Ive ever seen! The fact that it's a beautiful quality leather, which appears to be a strong, and quite durable, really sets it apart from other RFID wallets. But add on that its an RFID wallet that holds a PASSPORT, in addition to the above, highly impressed me from the start. I've bought quite a few RFID wallets for myself, family, and friends, but all have been plain-Jane in appearance being plastic or steel, and none have been able to hold a passport! So I was excited when I received a discount on this one, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.The leather on this is especially nice and seems to be durable and constructed of good quality materials. The stitching is reinforced all around. It's also easy to open and close, allowing quick access to your cards.It has a total of 5 regular sized card holder sleeves, which suit me perfectly having 4 credit cards and my driver's license. It fits all really snug, but not tight. The same with the passport, with the back cover sliding into the larger pocket, allowing for quick access while keeping it secure in its place at the same time.In every way, this performs like a regular wallet. In addition to its ability to hold cards,  securely in place inside of the RFID casing (which is invisible to the naked eye), the inside card openings also have a sufficient opening to keep cash separate, receipts, tickets, and misc. papers.Out of the box, it's ready to go. The leather is soft, and it stays closed, without requiring a ""break-in"" period, like most leather wallets and/or goods.All-in-all, this is an excellent wallet that is functional, practical, constructed of good-quality leather, and protective from card scanning thieves. I expect this wallet to last for some time, and it has done a wonderful job holding up for the few months I've been using it.If you're looking for a luxurious, protective, roomy, and overall great quality passport  wallet - I feel fully comfortable with giving this case a high recommendation.Disclosure: I received this product at a discount, to evaluate and in exchange for providing my honest and unbiased review. I hope my observations and experience can help you with making a better buying decision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IMAB84A36UV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144NOC8Y#wasThisHelpful","R3IMAB84A36UV0","AG7ZF2YS4DE56","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG7ZF2YS4DE56?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been on various prescribed medications for years, and have suffered from a weak immune system equally as long. Plus I'm a smoker. That whole combination has me with chronic fatigue and depression. Only recently, when I read up on body wraps and mud baths, did I realize that I'm in serious need of detoxifying my body.Although I've noticed a subtle difference in the way I feel, with my body being on toxic overload, I don't expect any product to be an instant full body cleanser. But this one is a great start. Especially since I have problems with swelling pills, this one makes it easy to take being in the form of liquid drops.My biggest struggle involves drinking water - which is most likely one of the reasons body body stays fatigued and me, chronically ill. Not to mention my whole weight gain phenomenon recently. Water is essential for cleansing the body no matter which way you look at it, and this product gives it the boost to expedite the detoxification process in a safe, natural way.But I assume that most people with toxin buildup are in the same position: lacking sufficient water intake. So yes- drinking a full liter of water is hard when you're not used to it; and/or if your like me and drink soda all day long. How can this product work, then, if you don't drink water?First, I believe in baby steps. I began with drinking about 2 cups of water with this product. It's tasteless and doesn't change that your still drinking water. Needless to say, I had to figure out a workaround. And putting it into my Coca-Cola isn't an option.For me, to actually get the full benefit of this product with the appropriate amount of water, I bought an infuser bottle and stocked up on fruit. Now, my water doesn't taste like water and I'm getting all the benefits of fruit while detoxifying with this product. Hint: another fun way to mix it up using an infuser bottle is to use sparking water. It's just like soda!Once I got that all figured out, I'm now consuming the recommended dosage. Which is precisely why I'm beginning to feel better, and getting more active each day. Not once have I experienced any side effects with this product either (i.e. frequent bathroom breaks, etc...)!Lastly, I like that the bottle is small enough that it's travel friendly. I just put it in my purse if I know I'm going to be away from home for lunch and/or dinner. That's the thing I don't like about the detox teas I've tried: I can't really take them along as easy as I can these drops.Overall, I expect this product to perform exactly as described, making it a wonderful, natural way to detoxify your body. By all means: I do recommend it!Disclosure: I received a discount to purchase this product, to evaluate and provide my honest and unbiased review.

"I absolutely LOVE this speaker! The fact that it's waterproof, really is the icing on the cake. Especially since I go to the beach quite often. I hate using my cell when I'm there, because it gets disgusting with wet sand. With this, I can have it on my beach blanket, keep my cell in my bag, and before I leave just give it a rinse off and it's brand new again!It has exceptional sound clarity. Even on windy days. It's crisp, clear, and well balanced- as a phone and/or music player.I've had absolutely no problems with pairing this to my iPhone 6 or my ipad 2. I did test the feature to pair them simultaneously, and it does work. I just haven't figured out the point yet- unless maybe I just want to listen to music from one device and take calls from another.I love that I can play my music on it loud and clear, and if it rings, I just answer it. When I'm done, I hang up and my music resumes right where I left off. My hands can be full of sand, and I never have to reach in my bag for my phone.The control buttons are perfectly designed, in my opinion. They're big buttons with the controls far enough apart that they can be pressed ""eyes closed,"" without worry of pressing the wrong one and messing up your whole playlist. I particularly like this for when I'm tanning.Another excellent feature of it is it's incredible operational distance, so that I can take this to the water with me and it doesn't cut off the signal. It has its limitations, of course, but it suited me perfectly well at the beach.Even more incredible is it's charge time vs working time. It was dead on arrival when I received it, and in less than 2 hours (using the included cable) it was at 100%. A full battery gives me a steady 6-8 hours of continuous use. A whole lot more if I turn it off here or there, or charge it intermittently.All in all- this is an incredibly useful speaker for everything outdoors, and that serves well for many purposes, in many places. I'm very happy to own it, and everyone whose seen it has been quick to ask about it. By all means- for whatever purpose of your choosing: I highly recommend this speaker!Disclosure: I received this unit as a product sample, to evaluate and provide my honest and unbiased review.

"It's only been a few days since I started using this serum, but I'm honestly impressed that not only do I really feel a difference in my face, but I actually see one too.I've tried so many over the counter creams, serums, and gels over the years, with only one or two (at best) having almost immediate results like this one has. So I do have high expectations of seeing some significant long term results from using Purevida's serum.Based on my experience with Vitamin C serum alone, it is notably effective! So when this particular brand was offered to me at a discount in exchange for my honest review, I had to give it a shot.From the moment it arrived, there was a feeling of luxury, as if the box was saying ""get ready for the spa!"" It's packaged nicely in a reusable, recycled box, that hold the serum and a lovely little carry bag. The serum itself goes on nice and smooth without any negative side effects from applying it over my regular serums/oils.I like the way it feels on my skin; the soft, supple, yet tightened feel of my face immediately after application, and especially the next day, when I apply it at night.It also absorbs quickly- and I can feel it infusing deeply into my skin. I've noticed that my face has become more radiant- or ""luminous."" My dark spots and acne are diminishing, too. Oh- and it feels like I have increased elasticity in my face overall.So far, I am quite impressed and feel equally good about this serum. With all of the above in consideration and my initial reaction,  I cannot help but recommend with a 5 star rating and high recommendation.Disclosure: I received a discount to purchase this product, to evaluate and provide my honest and unbiased review.

"I've only been using this eye gel for about a week, but so far I really do ""feel"" a difference. It goes on nice and smooth without any negative side effects such as burning, stinging, swelling, or redness.I honestly have NEVER seen an eye cream or gel- of all of those I've seen and/or tried- have such a combination primary ingredients! I know based on my experience, each, even alone, it is notably effective for any-aging. So when it was offered to me at a discount in exchange for my honest review, I had to give it a shot. I've tried so many over the counter eye creams and gels over the years, with only one or two (at best) showing almost immediate results like this one has.

"I honestly had never heard of these before the day it was offered to me at a discount, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. While waiting for it to arrive, I did a bit of research and ironically, found this product may be exactly what I need to combat a long-standing problem! I was quite excited to give it a try.You see, as a teen and all through my 20's I never had a problem with acne. Then, here I am at 38 years old, and out of the blue my chin is now constantly covered in very deep acne (as well as acne scars). As it turns out, I'm not as odd as I thought I was. Chin acne, based upon my Reserach is a phenomenon that affects many women in their late 30's as a result of hormonal changes.As soon as it arrived, I gave it a shot, taking it daily as directed. I can't swallow pills well, so the fact that they're dissolvable is a huge plus. Over the course of a week, I've noticed that I have not experienced any new acne, and the deeply embedded cyst-like acne that I had is finally starting to dissipate! That said, based on my experience alone, this seems to be an effective remedy for the treatment of acne!

"Seriously: theses are just one of those essential ""must-haves"" for any tackle box. I always thought it was catfish flippers, myself, but these proved to be even more necessary than those! Its an overall, incredibly impressive multitool.There are several reasons to LOVE these pliers:1. They are a huge space-saver by combining many tools into one.2. They are compact and lightweight being portable enough to fit in your pants pocket, so you're ready with essential tools at all times.3. They are made of what is an obvious high-quality stainless steel, making them rust and corrosion resistant.4. They have comfortable grips, even preventing slippage with wet hands.5. They cut ANY type of line: I've tested them on a wide range from 6lb all the way to 50lb (including monofilament, fluorocarbon, and copolymer in that mix) and they cut each line precisely, with ease.6. They are spring loaded, but also have a locking mechanism to keep them shut when not in use.7. They work beautifully for crimping ANY size weight!8. They make removing a hook sooooo much easier! They have an excellent, tight, front closure (in addition to sturdy hand grips) making them easy to maneuver without hurting yourself or the fish. In fact- I had one almost swallow the hook, but because the plier was long enough, I was able to reach in and twist it right out!9. They come with a sheath, which is wrong and durable. Not only does it protect me and others, but it also helps preserve the pliers.I absolutely LOVE these pliers, and now that I have them- I don't know what I'd do without them! They work exceptionally well, don't take up a lot of space, are great quality, serve multiple purposes, and all at an incredible price!

"I absolutely LOVE this cleanser! After washing, my face actually feels impeccably clean, with no feeling of any sort of oily residue behind. At the same time, it feels soft, supple, and moisturized in a way unlike any cleanser I've used before.I absolutely LOVE the way it feels, while washing and afterward- because although it does have serious deep cleaning powers, it is not scratchy/harsh/rough on the skin. For me, this is perfect. It left my face feeling fully cleansed and very refreshed, and it did in fact appear brighter- which was much to my surprise after having used it only 3 times so far!I have used it at night and first thing in the morning, and can say that this is an excellent moisturizing cleanser, that deeply infuses itself into your skin for a pure, deep clean with true rejuvenation. It is especially great for someone like me, who gets their fair share of daily sun exposure, with it having multiple crucial ingredients for fighting and reversing dry and sun damaged skin. From first use, my face felt instantly hydrated. And deeply cleansed.Also, having old acne scars on my face, I really needed something that would truly help, since nothing I've tried to-date has done anything but make my face more blotchy! To help with toning my skin, I lightly brush the scars and imperfections with a clean, dry toothbrush before using. I seriously don't doubt it's effectiveness, and look very forward to the long-term results of even toned skin with this product! Oh- and it takes only a little to be effective and thoroughly cleanse the whole face.Although I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I will definitely store it in my cart for when I run out again.

"We live on the beach, and this bag has proven invaluable for protecting our things from the sand and surf. What I like best about this bag, though, is that when we take it to the beach with us, for example: it is big enough to carry all of our things, eliminating the need for packing the many ziplock bags we are use to bringing for our smaller stuff, and it literally keeps our towels and everything else dry (and sand-free) as a bone!It has so much room it's unbelievable what I can fit into it! At the same time, it's not so big to be impractical. For a family of four wanting to protect a change of clothing, beach towels, and whatever other accessories/articles: it's perfect.It tightly seals, so that should it get submersed for whatever reason, water will not get into it. This makes it great for taking along our tubing excursions, too, being submersible should our inner tube and/or kayak flip. Plus, it's easy enough to open and close as we need to get different things out of it throughout the day.It also works the other way around. For example: Even at the beach, when I open the bag there's no trace of sand or water. Afterward, I can rinse it off, quickly wipe it dry, and put it straight into the trunk. If we put our wet clothes in it afterward, the bag keeps them from leaking into my carpet.Lastly, the color options are great! Not only because of the variety offered, but the high visibility serves a wonderful purpose for locating your bag should it float off or sink.This is something that I've desperately needed for quite some time, and something I feel every household could benefit from in a variety of ways.  In every way, I highly recommend this dry bag sack!Disclosure: I received a discount to purchase this product to evaluate, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I always tend to keep towels close by and at hand, especially for going to the beach! This one is very lightweight and extremely soft. It's  the PERFECT length, and has many added benefits. I particularly like this one, out of most I own and use, for relaxing on my deck after a dip in the pool or even sitting outside reading a book. The reason that this one differs is because of its incredibly innovative cooling  'technology.'I live in Florida and the humidity has the heat index off the charts! With a quick dunk of this towel in cold water - it INSTANTLY cools, almost like turning on the A/C. I have NO idea how or why this works- but all you do is get it wet and the cooling action is activated.Here, in Florida, I'd almost swear that the second it's wet it evaporates with the heat. It's not a design flaw, by any means- I do get a good 20 minutes, or so,  out of it before dipping it into the jug of ice water I usually keep next to me to 'kick-start' it again!It's also SUPER absorbent, which is great for pretty much any activity where water is involved.Although I received a discount to purchase this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I would not hesitate to purchase another if the need were to arise.

"I honestly had no idea what saw palmetto was for, until the day I was offered this at a discount, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. While waiting for it to arrive, I did a bit of research and ironically, found this product may be exactly what I need to combat a long-standing problem! I was quite excited to give it a try.You see, as a teen and all through my 20's I never had a problem with acne. Then, here I am at 38 years old, and out of the blue my chin is now constantly covered in very deep acne (as well as acne scars). As it turns out, I'm not as odd as I thought I was. Chin acne, based upon my Reserach is a phenomenon that affects many women in their late 30's as a result of hormonal changes. And it just so happens that saw palmetto is a traditional, herbal remedy to aid in the regulation of hormones!As soon as it arrives, I gave it a shot, taking it daily as advised. Over the course of a week, I've noticed that I have not experienced any new acne, and the deeply embedded cyst-like acne that I had is finally starting to dissipate! That said, based on my experience alone, this seems to be an effective remedy for hormonal changes and imbalances. That, or it just clears up acne! Either way, I'm happy and do recommend this for its many benefits.Disclosure: I received a discount to purchase this product, to evaluate and provide my honest and unbiased review.

"This dual layer protective case for the Galaxy S6 has such a rugged, but gorgeous design! I live on the beach and am quite active outdoors, so using a case without port covers and hard core protection has always been a bit scary. Which is why I've always been reluctant to buy hybrid, or bumper, cases since they not only make me feel unprotected, but with everything I'm involved in, for the most part they are impractical. But the way that this case is made, makes me feel as though I have the same rugged case on my phone that I'm used to- Without the bulk!It's quite rigid, and undoubtedly, impact resistant. Especially with its two layer backing, and raised bumpers that protect the front and back of my Galaxy.Other things I like about this case:1. the way that the corners have a curved mold around all sides,2. the sturdiness of the corners themselves,3. the perfect ""fit"" of the case -being slim and snug on my phone,4. that it doesn't slip out of my purse or pocket,5. the port cutouts are deep enough to protect from debris, but not too deep so I can still use my accessories just fine.With this case I benefit from both worlds, because not only do I have a gorgeous case but also some serious protection.I'm glad I was fortunate enough to receive a sample of this case to evaluate, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, because I absolutely love it! Without a doubt, I highly recommend this case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNO6LHC4RCGQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012ODT67I#wasThisHelpful","RNO6LHC4RCGQJ","AG7ZF2YS4DE56","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG7ZF2YS4DE56?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all: this backpack is amazing! It's got so many wonderful things about it, I honestly don't know exactly where to begin. It has incredible eye appeal due to the craftsmanship, quality, and color. In the photo it looks nice, but no pictures do it justice.Cirrently, I'm finishing up my PhD and have had  my full and fair share of experience with backpacks over the years. I also spend a lot of time traveling, and outdoors, too, where a backpack of this sort is also perfect for weekend trips, camping, and pretty much everything you might need a bag for.Just to name a few of the reasons that explain why I LOVE this backpack in particular:1. It's very versatile and all around durable, which makes it a great backpack no matter if it's for school, work, travel, sports, outdoors, etc...2. It is made of very high quality, heavy-gauge, WATER RESISTANT material that is of high-quality and appears in every way to offer rugged, durable, safe protection. The inner lining adds an extra measure of water protection.3. It is apparent that much attention was paid to detail, even down to the fine details, such as reinforces stitching.4. It was well designed with PLENTY of room! But deceptively so, because it's not huge or anything. It's a decent size backpack that you would never expect to have such room.5.  The bag itself is very lightweight. The weight dispersement of its contents is even, no matter what I pack in it. This is a HUGE benefit for me since I have chronic back pain, and it alleviates much of the stress. This is also where the padded straps are a huge benefit, making it very comfortable to wear.6. The interior pockets are zippered, and there are plenty to store and organize your things.7. It has a buckle locking system that allows the bag, and its contents, to be adjusted for the perfect, secure fit.All in all: I LOVE THIS BAG!!! It's absolutely perfect for a weekend getaway, school, hiking/camping, or even a computer bag (it's held both my 15"" and 17"" computers with a great secure fit), which also makes it great for gifting to that someone who's almost impossible to shop for, or please. With this bag: they won't be disappointed! I highly recommend this backpack to anyone, who may ever need a practical bag for any and all practical purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ISWWU2Z4LI33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014ZQUR6Q#wasThisHelpful","R1ISWWU2Z4LI33","AG7ZF2YS4DE56","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG7ZF2YS4DE56?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I LOVE that this shower head has so many different settings! With the turn of a dial,  it is super easy to adjust from one to another. This shower head accommodates everyone (including pets and guests) with a huge variety of 8 settings, which are: full body spray, massage, body spray & massage, jet stream, body spray & jet stream, mist, body spray & mist and pause. And despite the larger head, in no way is the water pressure compromised.So many settings makes it useful in so many ways, too. I especially am fond of the pause function, which save a ton of water when I'm deep conditioning my hair and/or shaving.I remain highly impressed with this shower head, and do expect it to last for some time. The overall construction is quite solid and well designed.

"The LAST thing I want to do is exercise! BUT- after overindulging during the holiday season last year, and now coming up on another, on top of it being such a hot summer I was practically lethargic. Exercise quickly moved to the top of my priority list! I'm definitely not saving it for a New Years resolution.  I needed a way to work off the weight that was fun and wasn't really 'exercise,' at least in my mind. So when I was offered this jump rope at a discount, in exchange for an unbiased review, I was so excited! .....because even though it is 'technically' exercising, a jump rope is FUN :)The way that it handles is definitely not like the last few that I remember using-- ions ago!  It has a very smooth, free-flowing sort of movement that eliminates a lot of the stress on my joints. Especially in my upper arms/shoulders where I'm already experiencing pain. Yet, at the same time, I can 'feel' it working and toning my muscles, while giving me a good cardio workout.What I really like the most about this jump rope is the fact that it is adjustable. I no longer have to worry about smacking myself in the face with it, like I used to notoriously do as a kid. That - and my kids can use it, too!Overall, this is a wonderful jump rope that is very well made, with attention to detail, and quality material. I am comfortable recommending it to anyone of all ages!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13LDDV2ME8H0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01113I7HW#wasThisHelpful","R13LDDV2ME8H0B","AG7ZF2YS4DE56","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG7ZF2YS4DE56?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a high-quality, durable, and nicely designed set of essential silicone tools! Each that I've used has been highly effective at serving it's intended purpose, but being easier to use than most.I got this to replace an worn out bamboo set that had silicone tips. This one I like much better, because it has silicone on the handles making it easier to work with. It's also much stronger than other ones I've used before. It looks a lot better, too.

"Thermos Food Jar with Microwaveable Container / B00EO0K1M4I really like this thermos as a microwaveable food container. I eat a ""mini-can"" of Spaghettios every day at work for lunch, and the contents fit perfectly in this thermos jar. And even though pasta sauce will stain most plastic food containers red, this jar is still crystal clear after multiple uses and daily runs through the dishwasher. I also appreciate that the thermos keeps my food warm while I eat it--I've used food containers before where the food would be cold by the time you finished.I personally find the rotate-to-lock/unlock snapping mechanism for the thermos and jar to be perfectly intuitive and easy to use. I've not had any problems with the jar falling out when it shouldn't; nor have I had trouble rotating the jar on my own without help (I have weak hands). It's been totally easy to use, and I appreciate that.I wouldn't use this Thermos for hot stuff that you hope will *stay* hot longer than 2-3 hours; the container holds heat pretty well at first, but not for the long haul. And obviously you want to check your food-size needs; 12 ounces isn't a lot for a packed lunch for some people or some situations. This jar is also very likely too wide for a briefcase, though it will sit well in most ""sack"" lunch bags (the one I use has a roll-down top that works great with short jars like this one).NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.~ Ana Mardoll","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31CEU9EWCJXM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EO0K1M4#wasThisHelpful","R31CEU9EWCJXM9","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Longbourne / 978-0345806970I've never been a huge fan of Pride & Prejudice, though I freely acknowledge Jane Austen's skill as a writer. But I've always been more interested in the lives of the serving girls than the lives of the women upstairs, with their balls and shoe-roses. (Seriously, Margaret Atwood's Alias Grace is one of my favorite novels specifically *because* of all the servanty bits.) So as soon as I heard of Longbourne on Sarah Wendell's review site (Smart B------, Trashy Books), I knew I would love it.I sped through this book over the course of three days and bitterly resented every moment that I had to put it down! As other reviewers have mentioned, this book is more ""around"" Price & Prejudice than ""about"" it, and the format of the one novel serves as a perfect backdrop for the material in this one. Jo Baker's writing is superb and evocative, and fits well with the language I expect in a Regency without being turgid to slog through. Baker has wholly embraced the servant framing, and we receive all the world-building of that sort which you could possibly hope for, and she perfectly interweaves characterization through the daily grind of chores.What I like most about this novel is how it focuses so well and so thoroughly on its entire cast of characters. Whereas this might be confusing or jarring in another novel, the multiple characters work well here and we care deeply about exploring the romantic relationship between Sarah and the men in her life, and the surrogate familial relationship between the servants in the household as they quarrel and love and comfort and scold and shelter each other. The result is realistic without being too harsh, touching without being saccharine.I struggle with recommending this book without giving too much of the plot away, but I will touch briefly on the issue of Mr. Bennet. I will say that I have never much cared for Mr. Bennet--yes, he is the comic relief and gets the best lines, but he is also harsh to his family members and careless of his daughter's futures. Longbourne explores this side of his character further, pointing out (for example) how callous it is for him to receive Mr. Collins for a stay without alerting the household staff. The staff not only have to prepare at short notice for a guest, they also need to impress Mr. Collins deeply so that he will not dismiss them when he inherits the house. I thought this handling of the character of Mr. Bennet was realistic towards what was displayed in the original P&P novel; here he is not overtly villainized, but his casual self-indulgence does provide some of the conflict for the servants to overcome.If I can find fault with this book, it is that at the 3/4 point there is an extended flash-back which is well-written but could not hold my interest as I was too anxious to find out what would happen in the future to take time out to hear about the past. This is important to the characterization in the novel, though, and I don't feel right complaining that the book hooked me so deeply that I couldn't wait to turn each page!A couple more things I want to mention that gave me great pleasure: One, this is the first Regency book I've read which has a black man as both a major character *and* as a viable party in a love triangle. I felt like this was handled fairly well, and he is treated in the story with respect from most parties and like it would be no big deal for Sarah (who is white) to marry him. Even the characters who react to him in (relatively mild) racist ways do acknowledge that he's the handsomest man in town and certain to turn the girls' heads. I loved that.Two, this is also the first Regency book I've read which has a gay man in it. And even better, the book strives to not treat him like a rare unicorn: one line which particularly pleased me was ""The farmhands--at least, those of them that tended towards the liking of women--stopped and stared, mouths hanging open, as she went by in Mary's pretty cast-offs."" Of course, I haven't read a ton of Regency books, but it seems (in my experience) that a lot of authors tend towards entirely white casts and heteronormativity; I appreciated that Jo Baker didn't do that for her novel.Probably the best compliment I can give Longbourne, though, is that it made me want to read Pride & Prejudice again (something I'd decided I'd had enough of for a lifetime) just so that I can relive the lives of Sarah and Mrs. Hill and James and Polly and Mr. Hill all over again in my imagination. I strongly recommend this book and consider it the best fiction I read in all of 2013. (And I most seriously hope that Jo Baker decides to tackle Sense & Sensibility next, if she sticks with Jane Austen as an inspiration.)~ Ana Mardoll","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22MXUQRFRXEH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CCPIITQ#wasThisHelpful","R22MXUQRFRXEH6","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"360 Mobile Solutions Smart Micro USB LED Cable Powerful 2.1A Output / B00FYIB7F0I bought this fast-charge cable for use with my chargers which claim fast-charge capabilities (including a car charger I recently received) so that I could be sure that any lag in charging wasn't the fault of my older cables. This cable from Mobile Solutions has worked really well for me so far, with a variety of chargers and devices, so I'm really pleased with it. The price is a little steep (though check across all the colors because some of them cost more than others), but if you're not seeing the performance you'd expect from your chargers, this may be worth the investment.I'm not sure why one reviewer said they were getting a slow charge on this, but one thing you do need to be aware of is that not all chargers charge fast. And not all devices (especially older devices) can charge fast. Basically in my experience, for a fast charge you need 4 things: (1) a device that can accept a fast charge, (2) a charger than can deliver a fast charge, (3) a cable that can carry a fast charge, and (4) a connection between device, charger, and cable which *doesn't* put the device into a data transfer mode which usually provides only a minimal trickle charge.The lighted tip on this cable is something you'll probably either love or hate. It's convenient for letting you know if the device is charging, and if the connection is good--the cord lights up blue when not connected and red when connected and charging. On the other hand, if you're using this in your bedroom when you're trying to sleep, it'll probably be way too bright. I've been using this in the car with a car charger where the light doesn't bother me.Note that this cable is about 3 feet long.~ Ana Mardoll","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32SX08JI2A0XY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FYIB7F0#wasThisHelpful","R32SX08JI2A0XY","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Black and Decker SL5470C Stainless Steel Slow Cooker / B002SB8K4WI've had an older-model Hamilton Beach 33967 Set 'n Forget 6-Quart Programmable Slow Cooker for years and we've gotten so much use out of it. I thought it might make sense to try out this Black & Decker model and maybe upgrade to it permanently if it turned out to be better.Controls: This Black & Decker model is manual control, which means that you just have a turn knob with three options: Low, High, and Warming. I don't really like manual control, and I prefer my digital programmable Hamilton Beach model (which also has Low/High/Warm functions in addition to fancier temperature settings). I will say, though, that I can see manual being useful if the power goes out (briefly) while you're cooking and if, when the power comes back on, the manual cooker continues cooking. (Though it seems like this could be dangerous, in the Food Safety sense, if the power was out for some time without your knowledge? I'm not an expert, though.)Lids: One thing I don't like about this Black & Decker model is that the lid just sits loosely on. My Hamilton Beach model actually has lid-clamps to hold the lid firmly in place.Sizes: This Black & Decker model has a 7-quart capacity whereas the Hamilton Beach one only has 6-quarts, however (a) I can't tell a difference by sight (and both units look the same size to me), and (b) we've never cooked anything which needed more than 6-quarts worth of space.All in all, this is a good slow cooker--don't take away from my rating that it's not. And if you really need a 7-quart capacity or if you prefer manual to digital then I do recommend this model. But I'll stick with my Hamilton Beach one for now, because I so much prefer the digital options.A note on cooking: When we were new to slow cooking, we thought that roasts had to be covered to the top in broth or water, and we never understood why the meat came out so tough. Someone finally told us to stop using so much liquid and that made all the difference in the world. I now never use more than 1 small can of broth with our roasts and they come out as tender as you can imagine. Also look up how to cut against the grain instead of with it, because that can make a huge difference as well.

"Tylt YCHGBL-T Ycharge 2.1A USB Car Charger Dual Port / B00BJR64CQI have an older model phone that needs to be charged throughout the day. I figured I could use this on the morning commute and save my battery backup for when I get out of the car. This car charger works well. The feel of the device is nice; a rubbery feel with a ""give"" that is still very sturdy and well-made. The Y-design fit well in my car, and (unlike previous car chargers I have tried) didn't try to work its way out of the car-charger port--this charger has stayed in place for a couple of weeks without needing to be pushed back in or readjusted.However, this charger isn't as speedy as some 2.1A battery backups I have at home. At first I thought it was the fault of the USB cord, so I bought a new cord specifically rated for 2.1A (360 Mobile Solutions Smart Micro USB LED Cable Powerful 2.1A) and that gave me a little more speed but still not as speedy as I'd like. With my Skyrocket playing an Audible book and using the stock Navigation app, I got approximately 1% of my battery every 2 minutes; without running energy-intensive apps, I was able to get 1% every 1 minute.Now, obviously those stats aren't going to mean a lot to you unless you have my phone (1% of my phone's battery isn't going to be 1% of *your* phone's battery), so the more generalized version is that this charger is faster than ones I've tried in the past, but still not as fast as some of my speedy battery backups. I don't know if that's the fault of the car, the cord, or the charger, but I can recommend this charger if you need a dual charger, want something that isn't molasses-slow, and/or want a charger that will stay put and won't fidget in the charging port.NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.~ Ana Mardoll","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R397IK7JBK80O2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJR64CQ#wasThisHelpful","R397IK7JBK80O2","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EasyAcc® 5000mAh 2.5A Dual Port / B00EK3UHS8There's not a plug handy at work so I've been trying out a lot of battery chargers lately for my phone. This one hits the perfect sweet-spot of having an all-day charge in a slim unit with a fast charge rate, and I was really pleased to have the chance to try the version sent to me by the manufacturer for review.I love the size of this charger -- it's almost exactly the same height and width of my Samsung Skyrocket, and it fits perfectly in my purse or pocket. The built-in charging cable is convenient and sturdy, and means that you get the fast charge promised without having to worry if your cable is up to snuff. The LED lights that let you know how much charge is left is the usual 4-tier affair (25/50/75/100%) rather than a percentage display, but I don't really need precision estimates on a day-charger I expect to plug in every night. I'm not a big fan of built-in flashlights, but at least this one doesn't turn on by accident like my last one did, so that's a plus.I get one full day's charge on this unit, give or take a little on either side depending on daily phone usage. Do note that this is one of those chargers where you can't just plug it in -- you have to plug it in and then press the power button to start charging. I'm used to that now and hardly ever forget, but it does take a learning curve if you're used to the automatic plug-and-charge. The good news is that even if you do forget to turn it on when you plug it in, it'll catch up fast when you finally remember -- this is *easily* the fastest charger I own.I currently own 6 battery chargers, and this is the one I reach for every time I leave the house. It wouldn't keep well for a long vacation, or even necessarily for a 14-hour day trip somewhere, but for a 9-hour shift at work, it's perfect.NOTE: This review is based on a free review copy of this product.~ Ana Mardoll","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E0AZY353A32C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EK3UHS8#wasThisHelpful","R2E0AZY353A32C","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Philips HF3500/60 Wake-Up Light / B00F0W1RIWWhen I received this from Amazon Vine, I'd already purchased (and been using for a full year) its older brother model, the Philips HF3520. This 3500 model is significantly cheaper, so I was interested in seeing how it held up without the bells and whistles.The Good: For a 'bare minimum' model, this 3500 model gets the job done. The unit is less bulky and -- since it uses push buttons instead of the touch-screen of the more expensive model -- is less prone to accidental touch-changes. The 'snooze' feature of tapping the top of the unit is intuitive once you know what you're supposed to do. Actually setting the unit is less intuitive; I had to use the manual not only for the initial setup but again a couple days later when Daylight Savings Time hit -- but this wasn't a big deal-breaker. This unit can get just as bright as its older brother, though it doesn't have the colors of the HF3520 model (i.e., it doesn't get orangey like a real sunrise).The Bad: You can't turn off the alarm sound with this, so if you just want to wake up with the light, you'll have to invest in the higher end models. Similarly, you only get one buzzer -- you don't get the radio or nature sound options. (Having said that, the nature sounds on the HF3520 are *very* disappointing, as they're all on an extremely short and therefore noticeable loop.) You don't get the dusk simulation, which can be nice for tuning your body to go to sleep at night.The big reason I've been holding off on reviewing the HF3520 is that, well, the light didn't wake me up! It gets pretty bright in the room, but not nearly so bright as a full-blown sunrise (at least, in my opinion and in my neck of the woods). And I'm a very heavy sleeper who routinely managed to sleep through the light, and didn't feel like I was waking up naturally. Interestingly, I've found that coupling the HF3520 with this new HF3500 has made the room more at the 'natural' level of brightness I'd expect, and I am able to wake up more easily in the mornings. But of course it's mostly luck that I ended up with two wake-up lamps instead of one, and not everyone will be able to afford two lamps.But I mention this so that if you're new to these, you will know that they don't wake up everyone. I recommend investing in this cheaper model first to see if it works for you, and then upgrading to the bells and whistles later if you really love it. You'll be missing out on the radio/nature sounds and the orange colors and the dusk setting, but you'll be able to judge whether this lamp actually wakes you up in the morning, which is the most important thing, I think.NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.~ Ana Mardoll","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRWQ205OM2KIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F0W1RIW#wasThisHelpful","RRWQ205OM2KIZ","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:39 MinsiClever Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Receiver / B00FLL2ZTWThis device is designed to hook into a stereo which takes an auxiliary input (AUX) to play through the speakers; the attached dongle is a bluetooth receiver which accepts music and audio sounds from your phone/tablet/other-device-capable-of-sending-via-bluetooth.This is *great* for stereos (especially built-in stereos in cars) which have aux capability but no bluetooth capability. As has been noted by other reviewers, people sitting in the backseat can access the stereo now, using their phone as a remote control, and if you just get tired of wearing an earpiece all day, this stereo accessory will let you listen to music without having to use your phone's tinny speakers. (Assuming your phone has tinny speakers. Maybe yours doesn't! But mine does, lol.)Huge bonus, not always true for all bluetooth devices: Pairing with this dongle is amazingly easy. I held down the power button until the light alternated blue and red, scanned on my phone, and *boom* there it was. No passwords, no combination button-presses, no fiddly connection issues.A couple things to note here:1. The device does have to be separately charged; it doesn't draw power through the auxiliary cable. The device comes with a USB cable (USB-to-plug) for charging, but I am unsure if the cable plug is an industry standard or a proprietary size. You'll need to be careful not to lose the cable.2. The charging cable is 48 inches long, which is long enough in my car to reach from the stereo to the cigarette-charger. So it is *possible* to keep the device entirely in your car, if you have the right distance between stereo and cigarette lighter.3. The device charges in 2-3 hours; I need to run some benchmarks on how long it can go between charge. I'll update this review once I know.4. The device will NOT play phone conversations -- this is for music/audiobooks/""media"" sound only. My phone was able to simultaneously connect to both the iDevice for media AND my earpiece for phone conversations, such that I could listen to music on the stereo but when a call came in, the call audio came in on the earpiece. (My phone also pauses the media playback when a call comes in, so the stereo wasn't still playing.)5. I've played audio from my phone via an actual auxiliary cable strung from phone to car stereo and now from phone to iDevice via bluetooth. The iDevice sound is noticeably crisper and cleaner to listen to, with very little white noise or ""hiss"" in the background. I'll definitely keep using the iDevice, even though it's technically more work (because of the charging) than the auxiliary cord.The only downside I can see to this device is that I don't understand why they engineered the power button to have to be ""held"" 3-5 seconds to turn on and off -- I guess they were afraid of incidental bumps, but I would have preferred a physical switch. But that's just me being nitpicky for various quirky hand-related issues I have.NOTE: This review is based on a free review copy of this product.~ Ana Mardoll","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QK5OQGV8QF8J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FLKW0JI#wasThisHelpful","R3QK5OQGV8QF8J","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:55 MinsiClever Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Transmitter / B00FLKW0JIThis device is designed to hook into a music player (in the headphone jack) in order to transmit the music from the player to a headset/stereo/other-device-capable-of-receiving-via-bluetooth. This device is NOT to be confused with the iClever Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Receiver, which looks the same, but does the exact opposite (i.e., it receives signals rather than transmits).This is great for MP3 players or portable CD players which don't have bluetooth capability. People in the backseat of the car can send with their MP3 player to the sound system, or if you want to use a portable bluetooth speaker without having to tether to an MP3 player or CP player, then this is what you want to use.Pairing with this dongle is easy, but there's not a lot of input from the user -- you put the speaker into search mode and the dongle into send mode and they either find each other or they don't. I was able to pair this dongle with my HMDX JAM Plus Portable Speaker and with my Plantronics M165 Bluetooth Headset. I couldn't get the dongle to pair with my phone, which didn't surprise me (because the phone is a sender, and not a receiver).A couple things to note here:1. The device does have to be separately charged; it doesn't draw power through the auxiliary cable. The device comes with a USB cable (USB-to-plug) for charging, but I am unsure if the cable plug is an industry standard or a proprietary size. You'll need to be careful not to lose the cable.2. The charging cable is 48 inches long, in case you want to keep the device entirely in your car and need to know if you have the right distance between wherever you want to keep the MP3 player + dongle and the cigarette lighter.3. The device charges in 2-3 hours; I need to run some benchmarks on how long it can go between charge, but so far it seems to last for a good while.The only downside I can see to this device is that I don't understand why they engineered the power button to have to be ""held"" 3-5 seconds to turn on and off -- I guess they were afraid of incidental bumps, but I would have preferred a physical switch. Plus, you also hold down the power button to go into ""search"" mode, so it's sometimes fiddly and you get Power Off or Search when you were trying for the other.

"PS3 Bluetooth Headset / B0042R81XUI bought this to be able to hear game sounds while my husband sleeps; we have a ""proper"" full-sized PS3 headset that plays game sounds, but it weighs fully one hundred pounds and hurts my neck to wear. I noticed several reviews lauding this headset as great for ""night play"". However, it turns out that this headset is ONLY for online chat -- you can hear yourself and others speak through it, but no game sounds whatsoever will come through. I wish the current marketing blurb would actually make that clear; maybe they'll update it soon.So, to be very clear: This is *not* a PS3 headset in the sense that you can hear games. It only allows you to hear other players. If that's what you want it for, it works fine. (Though it is a little big to fit comfortably on smaller ears. And I didn't even know that my ears were particularly small! But this headset is a bit too big for me.) I am leaving this review not to ""trash"" this product, but to help other buyers since the product blurb is ambiguous about this limitation (at the time of writing). I would prefer to leave no stars, but Amazon doesn't provide that option.~ Ana MardollETA: I note that this review has already attracted negative attention. I wish to underscore that I am leaving this review entirely to help inform other customers, with no personal animus towards the manufacturer. Please note that just because the Amazon description says ""voice chat only"" on one day doesn't mean that description was the same when I left the review or will be the same next week; Amazon descriptions can change frequently.I would prefer to leave a ""star-less"" rating, but since I have to leave a star-rating and since the device was uncomfortable to wear AND not accurately described at date of purchase, I have left 2-stars in order to inform other potential buyers. As the product has 500+ 5-star ratings already, this will not hurt the overall average rating, but will make it easier for shoppers to locate and understand drawbacks/limitations when making their purchasing decision.Thank you.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AFMNVSR9V7UK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042R81XU#wasThisHelpful","R3AFMNVSR9V7UK","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Satin Pillow Case / B00BEZ546KI bought this case because I read that sleeping on satin, rather than cotton, would be better for my hair and would dry it out less. Let me just say that this is a stellar pillow case: it has a recessed zipper so that the case doesn't slide off the pillow and the satin flap over the zipper means you're not going to scratch yourself on it. I got the beige color and it's a nice dark-cream color. And all the stitching is very nice on this case; if I were going to do over all the pillows in the house in satin, I would use these.Unfortunately, it seems satin isn't really for me at this time. I have kind of a thin pillowcase that I like to ""bunch up"" under my head, and the satin causes the pillow to slide into a fully flat position. And on the rare times when I get the bunching up to stick, my head starts sliding off! Whoops! I'm going to keep the pillowcase, though, and experiment with buying a few more pillows and see if any of those work.So, bottom line: If you know you like satin, these are great pillowcases.

"Zanies Rattling Hypno Mice / B000M1B7I6I bought these for my two cats, and they look absolutely lovely on the living room floor.

I will point out, though, that these are *very* hard so you don't want to step on them because they *will* hurt your foot. Shuffle like a zombie and you'll be fine.Alas, I cannot speak to the durability of these mice as my cats are too lazy to play with anything, including these.

"Toddy Gear 5x7 Microfiber Cloth / B008XGTYT6I received a free review copy of this cloth (the French flag model, to be specific) and I just love it.I have about a zillion microfiber cloths because they always come included when I buy my Skinomi screen protectors. The problem is that the cheap microfiber cloths on the market attract cat hair like nothing else, and my very fluffy calico just loves to roll all over the cloths. After she's spent about five minutes rubbing her face on them, they're forever-furry and not something I want carrying in my electronics bag.Not so with these Toddy Gears! I'm not sure what the microfiber is made from, but it's obviously a high quality material and seems to have been doused in fairy dust because it's VERY cat hair resistant. I rubbed this cloth all over my calico (which was very painful for me to do, as it is a VERY nice cloth and I hated to ruin it, but I figure it's my job to try to break free review copy items!) and the only hair that stayed on the cloth was a few strands that got caught in the side-stitching and which were easily removed.The size of these cloths are pretty perfect for my 8"" Samsung Note. I just lay the cloth on the screen and close my screen cover and everything stays snug and tight for traveling.

"Rosa Faia by Anita Active Range Front Closure Sports Bra / B000JLI4JYThis bra is made from what seems to be a high quality material, but I ordered it because it was available in higher sizes than the other front-closing bras on Amazon only to find that it runs WAY too small.I ordered a 42 band size and even though that's what the tags say on the bra, it isn't even close to a size 42 -- I couldn't even get the hooks to meet.

"Closet Candy Hangars / B00A2AI8PMThe Closet Candy manufacturer contacted me and asked if they could send me a set of hangars in exchange for a review. I figured it might be fun, as I've never reviewed hangars before, so I said to send them along. When they got here, mindful of the fact that a beta tester is meant to try to break the product, I enlisted my husband to break these ""unbreakable"" hangars. For SCIENCE!Now, I'll note that the ""unbreakable"" claim is followed by the words ""under normal daily use"" and I believe it now. It took my husband well over five minutes to break this hangar, and we were seriously considering pulling out the power tools except that seemed unfair. (HANGAR VS. POWER DRILL! FIGHT!) He *finally* got it to snap by folding it in half about three dozen times, and then lying on his back, hooking his foot into the hangar bottom where the newly-created weak spot was, and then pulling with all his strength on the handle. I wasn't able to work out the physics of the amount of force applied, because I was too busy laughing at the amount of trouble this hangar was causing and how determined he'd gotten, but I feel reasonably confident estimating it at A LOT.By contrast, I was able to snap one of our old hangars on the first twist. And I'm nowhere near as strong as he. To add injury to insult, the regular hangar snapped in such a way that a shard splintered off, flew across the closet, and hit the bathroom mirror with considerable force. That seemed kind of hazardous, so we stopped the experiment at that point. But the Closet Candy hangar did NOT shatter, so I'm chalking that up to SAFETY.Others have pointed out how thin these are, so I won't belabour that point; the hangars are thin, your clothes may not be, your mileage may vary, etc. But something I personally really like is how strong they are and how well they keep their shape when holding heavy clothes -- I have some thick jeans and sweaters that usually bend thin hangars, but these are still straight and strong after several days use. My biggest disappointment, though, is that the dimples in the hangar-shoulders are ridiculously shallow and won't hold my spaghetti-strap clothes with any real conviction; for those I'll have to stick with the hangars that actually have a little sunken ""holding area"" for straps.At more than a dollar per hangar, I don't know that these are worth the price -- but then I haven't priced hangars lately. What I *can* say is that these are thin-but-sturdy, and they won't break unless you're *really* trying to damage them. So that's pretty impressive.NOTE: This review is based on a free review copy of this product.~ Ana Mardoll","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVG081S5H1C6Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A2AI8PM#wasThisHelpful","RVG081S5H1C6Z","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Skinomi TechSkin for Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 / B00C9HYTVSNormally I like the Skinomi skins; they aren't good for eInk devices (as I belatedly learned with my Kindle), but they work well with tablets and phones. And I love that the wet application method reduces bubbles and fingerprints and all the other little hassles which accompany putting on tablet skins.However, I have sadly learned that the Skinomi skins simply do not agree with the S-Pen that comes with the Samsung Note. The Skinomi skin has a pleasant ""give"" to it that makes it spongy, and the pen presses down into the spongy skin and leaves a permanent impression. After the Skinomi skin was applied, I drew a dinosaur later that night with the Sketch 'Em app, and the dinosaur was permanently etched into the skin to be seen forevermore. I ended up having to peel the skin off and toss it; a complete waste.I have attached pictures to the Amazon product page which I hope illustrate the problem.~ Ana Mardoll","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K42CGBS9OUKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C9HYTVS#wasThisHelpful","R3K42CGBS9OUKZ","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Flex Belt Ab Belt / B00340H2TUBecause I have a history of reviewing medical equipment from the perspective of my disability, the Flex Belt company contacted me and asked if they could sent me a promotional copy of this belt in the hopes that I might be moved to write a review. I researched the existing reviews online and noticed that at least one other openly disabled person had found good results with the belt, so I told them I would try it.I have been through two major back surgeries (the most recent being a little over a year ago).  I have three metal rods screwed into my back, and several of my vertebrae have been fused into a solid mass. My range of motion is *very* limited, and as a result there are very few stomach muscle exercises I can perform -- crunches and sit-ups are actively dangerous for me. Prior to my most recent surgery I was able to exercise my core muscles by repeatedly clenching them, but my last surgery left me so weak for so long that I lost that capability from extended disuse and muscle atrophy.What this device does is stimulate the underlying muscles by using electrical charges. I was able to confirm online through several sources that the electrical charge would not be dangerous to my internal metal rods -- and then mentally slapped myself because my physical therapist used a similar device directly on my back for several sessions a few years back. So I felt comfortable that this would be safe for me to use. (And, as anticipated, I have experienced no harmful side-effects.)The setup and use of this device is easy and has been covered more adequately elsewhere in the other reviews, so I'll just jump straight to my experiences with it. I've used this belt almost every day for a month, for 40 minutes per session. I have had zero trouble with the pads -- they went on the belt fine, and have never once tried to peel off or stay stuck to my skin. (I do try to do my sessions in the morning before my shower since they sometimes leave a slightly sticky residue.) I *really* like that the belt lets you set different electrical charge strength for the left and right side; my back surgery left the right side of my body significantly more numb, so I was able to use a stronger charge on that side.I started with the charge set to 20/25; after a month of use I'm now using 40/50. I've been testing during the day, and I have finally gotten to where I can clench my muscles on my own -- something I couldn't do for months before I started using this device. I'm really very pleased with that. (For the record, I have not lost weight, nor do I have visible stomach muscles, but I wasn't expecting to, and would have been deeply concerned if I had because I knew my body wouldn't react that way.) I've gone ahead and ordered replacement pads since the ones that came with the belt are getting kind of ratty.I'm glad that I had a chance to receive and review this device, but I'm not sure I'd throw down for the 199 dollar price tag if something happened to this one -- as it is, I'm already a little anxious about the 15 dollar recurring monthly cost of the replacement pads. I intend to keep using this for now, with the hopes of getting up to the max charge and see if I'm still seeing improvement in my core strength at that point -- if I'm not, I'll retire the belt with my blessings; if I am, I guess I'll keep using it regardless of the maintenance cost since I'm not precisely spoiled-for-choice when it comes to disabled-friendly devices. (I will say, though, that if there were one of these for arm muscles, I would definitely buy it, as I'm concerned that I may need to start building up for an eventual wheelchair.)NOTE: This review is based on a free review copy of this product.~ Ana MardollUPDATE: And I've just been informed that there *is* a Flex Arm, so I know what I'll be asking for at Christmas, lol.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IPE50ZOT135S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00340H2TU#wasThisHelpful","R1IPE50ZOT135S","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Feathered Serpent / 0-609-61029-5Falconer shows his genius again with this fantastic novel. The characters of Cortes, Malinali, and Motecuhzoma are brought to vivid life on the page. In careful steps, Falconer outlines how a handful of men can wreak havoc on a powerful empire - provided that they are aided by a powerful mythology, by united allies driven by a long-standing enmity, and by a detrimental caution on the part of the empire.While I am not a student on the period in question, Falconer appears to hit the topic of historical accuracy as closely as one can expect with a historical novel. Cortes is shown to be a very clever tactician, but burdened with an unbending conviction of his own rightness at all times. Malinali is proud of her birthright and impressive talents as interpreter, but she has learned that women and slaves have little power in her world, and she uses her power carefully and cautiously. Motecuhzoma walks a fascinating tightrope between a shrewd emperor and a superstitious man, plagued by the many doomsday prophecies that his unhappy subjects issue on his head.""Feathered Serpent"" really shines with careful use of secondary characters to highlight the many aspects of the conflict. One Spaniard prefers the lifestyle of the American Indians, and he provides a useful narrative counterpoint by explaining that the American Indian custom of sacrificing humans is not fundamentally different in his view from the Spanish custom of burning witches, heretics, and Jews. Another Spaniard grapples with his initial distaste for the American Indians as it is rapidly counterbalanced with his growing distaste for his fellow Spaniards. The native woman Rain Flower acts as a foil to the determined Malinali as she struggles to gauge between her duty to her Spanish ""husband"" against her desire for her Spanish lover.Powerful and tasteful, ""Feathered Serpent"" carefully treads the historical and the personal by giving private details of the lives and thoughts of these compelling people without sliding into vulgarity. This book is a fantastic introduction to this period in American history and is a compelling read - I couldn't put it down until I finished it entirely.~ Ana Mardoll","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LVUOAZ6W2TRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0076NJ9JM#wasThisHelpful","R3LVUOAZ6W2TRJ","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sultan's Harem / 1-4000-8312-5""The Sultan's Harem"" is a spectacular tale of hatred and revenge, as Falconer weaves the tale of a single woman - a slave of the most powerful man in the world - who tears down a powerful empire by careful manipulation of the man who loves her. This one woman, Hurrem, manages to take down an entire empire, all while only ever being seen by a handful of men - the sultan and his personal eunuchs.Falconer makes it difficult not to admire our cold-blooded heroine, who staunchly refuses to be a good little harem girl and concubine to the man who bought her from her parents. She despises the man who tore her from her home as just another bauble to add to his vast harem, and whom she must amuse endlessly lest she be tossed callously aside for another girl in the harem. If she must play the game of harem politics to survive, she will play it - but survival is too meager a goal for her. Carefully and coldly, she devises a plan to bear a child, remove the Sultan's favorite, entice him to fall in love with her, and then secure her freedom and unprecedented marriage to the emperor. Even as a wife, she is still a slave in everything but name, and she ruthlessly turns her mental hold on her husband to send him spiraling into madness while the kingdom collapses slowly around him.Falconer carefully treads the personal and the political here, as with all his novels, and we see sympathetic glimpses into both the main players (sultan and sultana) and into the lives of the hapless girls living silently in his lavish harem. Each girl has her own history, her own loss, and her own sadness, and - faced with the realities of the harem, and of the monogamous sultan - finds her own pastimes and petty jealousies. Are these women better off than the ones on the outside? They are safe and pampered baubles in a collection of sex slaves that are almost never ""used"" by their relatively monogamous master. But the silence and loneliness gnaws at their souls and the passage of time weighs heavily on all involved. Is our dark heroine really so unusual in her hate and cruelty, or are her sisters in the harem just as enraged but powerless to act out?Gripping and suspenseful, ""The Sultan's Harem"" is a compelling read - I could not put it down. I agree with another reviewer in that the story would make a wonderful movie, should anyone ever acquire the rights. Like other Falconer novels, the writing is frank and does not shy away from the facts of life, but the writing is never lurid or vulgar.~ Ana Mardoll","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37PFWHAK51VXU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006JV8IW6#wasThisHelpful","R37PFWHAK51VXU","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No/No Red Cardinal Bird Feeder C00322 / B000HHLHK8I'm really impressed with how big and solid this feeder is; I was expecting something smaller, and was pleasantly surprised at the size. (In fact, it's too big to hang on our fence-hook, so I got this free-standing Shepherd Hook which has worked great.)The feeder itself is a little unusual (at least, to me). The middle part is collapsible, which means that the empty feeder is basically the top and the bottom sandwiched together. This is great for storage but does mean that you'll need to have the feeder actually hanging down from something (and therefore expanded) before you can fill it.The top of the feeder is covered by a ""cap"" with two sliding flat bolts that hold it in place; you can slide the bolts to the side and then slide the cap off to fill the feeder. I wish the cap was entirely removable, but they were probably afraid that the cap might get lost if we could take it all the way off.What I like most about this feeder is the construction. It's big and solid and feels super well-made and nicely built. The color is pretty and bright without looking garish or like it will chip or fade over time. I expect this to last a long time. I do wish the lip around the bottom was a little bigger, but I haven't had any problems with birds being able to use this, and I don't mind squirrels, so I'm quite happy with this big, sturdy feeder.NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.~ Ana MardollUPDATE (5/26/13): Ohmigosh, I have never seen a cardinal in our neighborhood and I just now this morning saw a no-kidding cardinal at our feeder.

"Fellowes I-Spire Series Tablet Lift / B00BXF5GKKThis is a very simple what-you-see-is-what-you-get tablet stand. It doesn't fold or collapse or disassemble; it comes exactly as you see in the picture with no assembly required. But there's a line between ""simple enough"" and ""too simple"" and I think this stand crosses it for me.1. Limited use for smaller devices. The ""stand slot"" has a hole in it I presume was added to accommodate a charge cable but which effectively limits the portrait uses of this stand. My 7"" tablet falls through the slot if I try to sit it in portrait mode. My phone can just barely sit on the stand in landscape mode. So basically, this stand will accommodate most tablets and phones in landscape, but only the larger 9"" crowd for portrait-viewing. This seems like a missed opportunity crying out for a narrower slot or a closing capability.2. Not adjustable. The stand angle is hard plastic with no way (that I can find) to adjust it. If you don't like the angle of the inserted tablet, it's up to you to jury-rig a solution (by adding a thicker or thinner cover) or to just live with it.3. No extras. Not everything has to be a charger or speaker dock or keyboard jack or combination desk lamp or whatever, but considering that those do exist at comparable prices, I'm not sure what makes this stand shine out from the crowd unless you're buying the complete matching desk set.I'll probably keep using this until I find something a little more adjustable. If you like simple and you have a large tablet, you'll probably find that this meets your needs.Update: I'm adding another star because, several months after receiving this, I'm finding that it's my go-to stand for when I want to watch Netflix on my tablet. I still wish it had adjustable options, but it clearly works very well for me for at least one use-case (movie watching), so I'm bringing this up a star in response. Also: After several months of semi-regular use, it still looks brand-new, so that's a nice plus.NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.~ Ana Mardoll","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UKOWQQQDY84F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BXF5GKK#wasThisHelpful","R2UKOWQQQDY84F","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Brand Failures / 9780749444334Who doesn't love reading about epic failures in marketing and product branding? A good ""brand autopsy"" can be both fun and educational, and can really help educate amateurs (like me) and marketing savvy experts alike on what pitfalls to avoid and how to properly package and market a new brand.""Brand Failures"" attempts to ambitiously tackle 101 famous branding mistakes and errors, from the classic ""New Coke"" to the failure of ""Betamax"" to Kodak's recent efforts to remain relevant in a world where casual consumers are increasingly turning away from film and to digital cameras. If there is a problem with this approach, it is that at 235 pages, each brand failure story is spread distressingly thin - most of the vignettes have less than 2 pages devoted to them. This simply isn't enough time and space to discuss all the factors that went into the failure of Enron, or Crystal Pepsi, or most of the other brands on display here.The other problem with this approach is that some of the ""autopsy analysis"" statements seem a little questionable. It's easy, of course, to say when a brand has failed, but it's much harder to say WHY the brand has failed. Did ""Earring Ken"" really fail because his 'alternative' approach to masculinity alienated homophobic parents, or did he fail for the same reason that Ken sales have traditionally lagged behind Barbie - because little girls care more about the doll they can project upon? Did the leather substitute Corfam really fail because it didn't ""feel"" as good as real leather, or was it because the company failed to emphasize the animal-cruelty issue (which would still be a failure to correctly market a brand, but a different failure than what is given here)? Did the HotWheels PC and Barbie PC fail because parents didn't appreciate the overt gendered marketing or because parents in 1999 weren't quite ready to invest heavily in personal computers for their children?In some ways, ""Brand Failures"" is a failure because the quick overview approach leaves a lot of questions unanswered and aspects unexplored. I would have liked to see this book about twice the length and containing half the products - a solid 10 pages or so per product would have given the reader a much better grasp of each product and a better look at why the brand *might* have failed, with heavier discussion on potential alternatives and competitors and market factors that may have doomed the product. In other ways, however, ""Brand Failures"" is a success because as a good overview of failed products, there is a lot of information here that probably can't easily be found elsewhere in a similarly compiled form. I think this would be a useful text for an ""intro"" course as a supplemental material to a meatier book, or an interesting foray into the subject for casual readers who are intrigued by the subject but don't want to get bogged down in a lot of extra details.NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this book provided through NetGalley.~ Ana Mardoll","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25Z7XVXNRD0NC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0054J31KI#wasThisHelpful","R25Z7XVXNRD0NC","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jam / B00A7H2E3WI loved Yahtzee Croshaw's first book, Mogworld, and I went into Jam expecting to love it and I *did*, so at least I'm both consistent and predictable, lol. (And I'm already on tenterhooks hoping that Jam will come out on audiobook soon so that I can listen to it for a second read-through.) But let me also just state upfront that Jam is not going to be for everyone (though nothing ever is), and then I'll get to why.Jam is essentially a zombie apocalypse story with the zombies replaced by man-eating jam. Our point-of-view character wakes up one morning to find that his city was covered with three feet of jam while he slept and now it's up to him and the remaining few survivors to paw through the wreckage while navigating the rooftops of a ruined city. And this whole setup reminds me of one of Yahtzee's Zero Punctuation reviews -- I think it was one for Left 4 Dead -- where he theorized that as long as an author can re-create the tension and horror of the zombie apocalypse, you can replace the zombies with koalas and you'd still have a zombie story on your hands. And that's what Jam essentially is: a proof of concept that is delightfully grim and utterly original.If you've read Mogworld, you'll already be familiar with Yahtzee's style of writing: Jam is semi-serious, but with a strong undercurrent of parody and sardonic wit. Most of the main characters are recklessly stupid and detrimentally self-involved with their personal preoccupations to the point where they routinely prioritize trivial impulses over their basic survival. And in some ways, the villains are differentiated from the protagonists ONLY by a matter of degree: when everything goes all Lord of the Flies a few days after the apocalypse, there's a strong implication that the villains just spiraled down a little faster than the majority of our protagonists.What keeps the novel from being a bleak indictment of humanity (unlike your usual Lord of the Zombie Apocalypse novel) is the humor that saturates every page. The protagonists bicker amusingly with each other as they work around each others' shortcomings, and with dialogue that had me cracking up on numerous occasions; the villains are cartoonishly evil even as they shrewdly point out the flaws of the protagonists; and the apocalypse surges on around the confused and deeply distressed point-of-view character as he tries to adapt to the total destruction of everything he's ever known. It may not sound like a laugh riot, but it has the same delightful gallows-humor of Mogworld and I loved it: it's like if Douglas Adams wrote a zombie apocalypse with Arthur Dent as the POV character. And also there was jam.Having said all that, Jam isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea. Many of the protagonists really are (or eventually become) flawed, sexist, racist, stupid, and/or evil to the point where some readers aren't going to appreciate being forced to stick with them to the end; to continue the above analogy, picture Zaphod Beeblebrox slowly devolving from a sexist misanthrope to, well, significantly worse. The characters are frequently called out on many of their flaws, both by each other and by the narrative, but always in a humorously sarcastic way that doesn't really make way for catharsis or improvement. For myself, I found the dysfunctional dynamics of the group incredibly compelling to the point where I finished the book in a day (and enjoyed every minute of it), but I also recognize that dark humor surrounding dark characters isn't going to be for everyone. (Relatedly: if you require your zombie apocalypse novels to be inhabited by sensible characters, this isn't going to satisfy.)[SEMI-SPOILERS] Speaking of, Jam continues the Mogworld tradition of bittersweet endings where things are nominally fixed but still deeply, terribly broken. Now, granted, this is a zombie apocalypse novel and those are pretty much *guaranteed* to have bittersweet endings unless it turns out to have been a dream all along, but even allowing for the genre and the ""sweet"" part of the ""bittersweet"", there's still a profoundly sad note underlying the ending. As a reader, I didn't find the end dissatisfying, but ... it's not something that will sit well with everyone. Again, you'll probably be the best judge for yourself as to whether or not gallows-humor and tempered cynicism will be your thing or not. I offer no judgment on readers, either way. [/END SPOILERS]I genuinely enjoyed this book and (as mentioned) tore through it in a day simply because I couldn't set it down. The premise is delightfully original, the POV character is deeply sympathetic, and the main characters are flawed in that very special way where they would be utterly insufferable in real life and yet are amusing to follow in a novel just so you can see how badly they will screw things up and so they can all call each other out every five minutes (in a manner which suddenly reminds me of Brian Clevinger's 8-Bit Theater comics, which I also immensely enjoy). If you won't be put off by a little unrealism (in the world) and a lot of unreason (in the characters) in order to carry a lot of delightful gallows-humor, I absolutely recommend this book if only for the sheer uniqueness.~ Ana Mardoll","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWM08AP0VCDFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A7H2E3W#wasThisHelpful","RWM08AP0VCDFD","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TEKwriterUSA Gelwriter Gel Pen Set with Pop-up Case / B00B80SOUEI ordered these through Amazon Vine along with their cousins: the pens in the ""rotating"" stand (TEKwriterUSA Gelwriter Gel Pen Set with Rotating Stand). I vastly prefer this pop-up case.For one, the pens come ""pre-inserted"" and not in a big bag like with the rotating stand. (Though they're not organized as prettily as in the picture, I think. But I'm unusually particular about these things, so.) For two, the rotating stand is wobbly, while this one is comparatively elegant and tight. The case works fairly simply: you twist the lid off, set the lid on the table, and then place the case onto the lid. A skinny little obelisk attached to the lid pushes up through the bottom of the case and the tiers stand up.It's reasonably elegant for the price, and I've had no issues occur while popping up or retracting; it all goes fairly smoothly. I was going to say that one thing I do wish is that the case came with a carrying handle, but then I ran my hands along the top and lo-and-behold there are TWO carrying handles. They just blended in with the design so well that I hadn't realized it. So that's awesome and I'm really pleased with that.The pens themselves are pretty great. Most of them start a little ""dry"", but if you press the tip against the paper a couple of times like the instructions say, the ink starts flowing smoothly. These aren't as fine a tip as I usually like, but the writing is still remarkably precise and controlled, and with no ""bleed"" that I've seen so far. I'm quite impressed, and I think I'll be using these a lot. I wish there were a few more black pens (I only got 6) and fewer brown pens (I have at least 10+ of those), but I guess I can't complain. And, as I've noted in my previous review, I still regret that the pens colors aren't labelled with writing as well as with colored grips: some printed colors like on my Crayola crayons would be a nice upgrade for the company to implement in the future.Bottom-line: Great pens; would be nice if they had printed color labels on the pen barrel; this pop-up case is WAY cooler than the rotating one, and it has carrying handles too.NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.~ Ana Mardoll","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FOYFTYIZSGRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B80SOUE#wasThisHelpful","R3FOYFTYIZSGRW","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TEKwriterUSA Gelwriter Gel Pen Set with Rotating Stand / B00B80SOVILook at that product picture! Isn't it pretty? YES. Do these pens arrive like that? NO. (*sadface*) The pens come in a big bag, all mixed together, along with the empty stand and it's up to you to try to recreate the display. I wish they could have at least packaged them by color, but I suppose one bag for everything saves plastic.Once I got the pens into the stand, I was a little underwhelmed. The stand is a touch wobbly and feels cheap, and the pens aren't inserted very deeply or securely -- I can pretty much guarantee that one of my cats will eventually brush too hard against it and there will then be a Big Mess to clean up. So I wouldn't count on using the stand in a high-traffic area frequented by grabby children or pesky cats.The pens themselves are pretty great.

I wish there were a few more black pens (I only got 6) and fewer brown pens (I have at least 10+ of those), but I guess I can't complain.The approximate numbers above does lead me into one semi-major complaint: I'm a little irked that the pen color isn't written on the pen anywhere. The cap, the grip, and the bottom are all colored, so if you can see all colors equally well then you're fine, but if you have any kind of color-blindness, there are no words to help you differentiate as to what pen color you're using. (And before someone asks why a color-blind person would want to use a colored pen, I've worked in a lot of disciplines where colors were imbued with meaning for others, such as red ink for reviewing.) For myself, I'm not color-blind but I still struggled when assembling this display because I wanted to separate the orange from the brown and there were several pens where I just wasn't sure which was which from the external color. So some printed colors like on my Crayola crayons would be a nice upgrade for the company to implement in the future.Bottom-line: Great pens; would be nice if they had printed color labels on the pen barrel; some assembly required to recreate the pretty display; the stand isn't made to endure harsh treatment from clumsy hands.NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.~ Ana Mardoll","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R99S2G3DUMDZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B80SOVI#wasThisHelpful","R99S2G3DUMDZQ","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"CaseLogic 14"" Neoprene Netbook Case / B001F7HI02I bought the 14"" netbook case based on the measurements given in another review saying that this would fit 13-14"" slim laptops. I have an ASUS Zenbook which has a 13.3"" screen and is (when shut) 13"" wide and 9"" tall. This case fits my laptop with room to spare on either side, and I've been very happy with it.The front zippered pocket has a sewn-in case for USB sticks, and the interior for both pockets is a soft gray (I've attached pictures to the product listing above). Other than that, this case is no frills but in a good way -- it doesn't add a lot of bulk, and there are no handles to take up space in your larger bag (assuming that you carry this case in a messenger bag or backpack like I do). And the zipper is a nice strong rubber, which means it's not always trying to scratch up the other stuff in your bag.Overall, I'm very happy with this case for my laptop carrying needs, and I think the product is of high quality. I've already purchased the 7-10"" version to carry my smaller Asus Transformer tablet and docking keyboard. (Which I think is why this review is labeled by Amazon as being a Verified Purchase for the 7-10"" case instead of the 14"". But they're both the same, except for the difference in size.)~ Ana Mardoll","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EETJ1AQWB6EQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001F7HI02#wasThisHelpful","R1EETJ1AQWB6EQ","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CaseLogic 7"" Neoprene Case / B004LSUR3MI bought this as an eReader carrying case. I own four eReaders, but I didn't expect them all to fit this 7"" case. The results were (not entirely unexpected):1. Kindle Paperwhite with Amazon Leather Cover (fits)2. Sony PRS-350 with Silicone Cover (fits)3. Sony PRS-950 with Silicone Cover (doesn't fit; reader too tall)4. Nook Glowlight with Silicone Cover (doesn't fit; reader too wide)Note that even though this case does fit the Kindle Paperwhite w/ Cover, the resulting fit is a bit snug. But I like it that way, since I didn't want my reader rattling around in a big, mostly-empty case.Other than that, this case is no frills but in a good way. The interior is a clean, smooth black (I've attached pictures to the product listing above), and the case doesn't add a lot of bulk (unlike those 'bubble' cases, which tend to be larger and weightier). There are no external pockets, which is a bit of a shame, but I never really used them on my last case anyway. And the zipper is a nice strong rubber, which means it's not always trying to scratch up the other stuff in your bag.Overall, I'm very happy with this case for my eReader carrying needs, and I think the product is of high quality.~ Ana Mardoll","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YFF6UCIQ31B0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LSUR3M#wasThisHelpful","R1YFF6UCIQ31B0","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"HP 11.6"" Mini Sleeve / B002SU2DICI bought this carrying case for use with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7"") student model. The student edition of the Tab comes with an 11"" keyboard that features a hard drop-dock which sticks out at an angle. I searched high and low for a case that would accommodate both the keyboard and the tablet, and finally settled on this one.This case is 12"" wide from side-to-side and 9"" tall from top-to-bottom. The zippered opening is on the left side and is 9"" wide -- perfect for sliding in my Tab keyboard. The front zippered pocket is 6.5"" tall with a 12"" zippered opening, and perfectly accommodates my tablet when I slide it in sideways (landscape). In this way, I'm able to protect both my tablet and keyboard without worrying that they will scratch each other or that the tablet will fall out. It's very difficult to find neoprene cases with zippered pockets that come up as high as this one does (nearly 7""), so I consider this case to be quite a find.Additionally, I was pleasantly surprised to note that this case has a little carrying handle at the top that slides flush with the case when not in use. So many cases have either bulky, floppy handles that are always in the way or no handle at all -- it's nice to see a case that has an invisible handle for use only when needed.~ Ana Mardoll","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK3LG6PGE4F5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002SU2DIC#wasThisHelpful","RK3LG6PGE4F5U","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fosmon GYRE Series Revolving Leather Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7"") / B009UV3PJII bought this case for my Galaxy Tab 2 on the grounds that it was white and I wanted a white case to match my white ""student edition"" of the Tab. I've been entirely happy with the case, given the idiosyncrasies that Samsung forces on users and case-makers.I love my Galaxy Tab 2, as well as the keyboard I received with my student edition, but I wish Samsung would adopt the Asus model for keyboards -- the Asus keyboards turn the tablet into a mini laptop that can be ""shut"" as needed, and the case-makers are able to create cases that enclose both the tablet and keyboard seamlessly as one. The Samsung keyboards, in contrast, have a solid dock-drop where the tablet is connected, and there's no moving from that position.I searched high and low, and couldn't find a single case that would accommodate the tablet while docked -- every case I found on Amazon has to be removed before the tablet can fit in the dock-drop. So if I must have a case that has to be taken on and off all the time, the next best thing is a case that comes on and off easily without (a) being a big hassle each time or (b) becoming loose over time such that the tablet is in danger of falling out. This case satisfies both requirements.This case is composed of a hard/firm snap case, where you press the Tab into place, and a leather cover that closes like a book cover and can be secured by means of an elastic strap sewn into the cover. The snap case works beautifully; the Tab snaps in without fuss, and then snaps back out again with moderate pressure -- not so little that you have to worry about it coming free in your bag, and not so much that taking the Tab out becomes a chore. The leather book cover is attached to the snap case via the circular swivel component, which lets you swivel the cover a full 360 degrees. This means that you can close the cover from either the left or the right side (depending on handedness and preference).You can additionally use the swivel combined with the grooves cut into the cover to loosely ""stand"" the tablet in place while using this cover. There are two cut grooves; the stand function works in landscape with both grooves, but in portrait with only the first groove -- if you use the second groove with portrait, the tablet will fall over. I feel that this is a product of the Tab's size and the cover limitations rather than a defect in the cover design, and the angle for the first groove is better suited for portrait viewing at any rate.Overall, I like this cover just fine. It does increase the size and thickness of the tablet, of course, but not so much that I find it bulky or difficult to carry. I think it offers good protection for the Tab when on the go, and I appreciate that it can be removed easily when I want to dock with the keyboard. I would have preferred something that can accommodate the keyboard dock without removal, but Samsung doesn't seem to consider that functionality enough of a priority to put out their own case. C'est la vie.~ Ana Mardoll","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BL2ZOOXJWEGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009UV3PJI#wasThisHelpful","R1BL2ZOOXJWEGE","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brutally Honest Fast Food Reviews / B008PEZV20I usually enjoy blog-to-book collections, but this one didn't really hold my attention like I thought it would.To start with, I was disappointed with the technical aspects of this ebook. The pictures are displayed well, but the font-size seems stubbornly hard-coded to a very tiny font; using the Nook display options to increase the font-size didn't change the text size at all. This means that in order to read the book, you have to squint at the page until your eyes ache, and that didn't really enhance my reading experience. (This was as of February 2013, on the Nook version. I hope the publisher can fix this aspect after this review goes up.)Beyond technical issues, the content of this book was a little disappointing. I love a good snarky entertainment review, and for awhile this book delivered. But a lot of the jokes are repetitive and one-note, like the ""joke"" that fast food isn't considered terribly healthy fare. That's not exactly a new and original joke, and to see it repeated here in every other joke in the book ... well, it gets old fast. Maybe this would have been funnier on a website where the jokes were interspaced by time or by other reviews, but in a book collection, it starts to feel like every 'chapter' is the same.Adding to this feeling of repetition, the reviews are grouped by restaurant (McDonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, etc.) instead of appearing in the order they were published on the blog. This is probably useful if you were wanting to drill directly down to a specific product, but if you're just a reader looking for something entertaining, the result is somewhat detrimental. Reviews across a specific restaurant -- like, say, Taco Bell -- contain the same jokes each time, with similar lead-ins each time about how the reviewer has historically felt about that restaurant. Again, on a blog this would make sense because it may have been three weeks since the last Taco Bell review and new readers might need to be brought up to speed, but in a book format the result is repetitive and bogs down the reading.Unless you're already a fan of this blogger (and therefore just want a book collection to save off your favorite posts), I would recommend giving this book a pass. It seems like a nice blog, but I didn't find it to be an entertaining book.~ Ana Mardoll","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K0ZJHYZ8E5G9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008PEZV20#wasThisHelpful","R1K0ZJHYZ8E5G9","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Baggallini Zipper Bagg / B002ZG92BKI've been using an eBags Piazza Day Bag for the last couple of years and while I really like the purse, I wanted something a bit smaller. I thought I'd try this purse, but I ended up having to send it back as it was too small for my needs.The product description claims that the purse is 9"" x 9"" x 2.5"", but I genuinely think that the depth is much smaller than that. Here is what I hold in my Piazza purse: long thin credit card wallet (upright), glasses case (upright), very small leather bag with toiletries (lengthwise), Kindle Paperwhite (upright), keys and eyedrops (side pocket). I don't feel that's a whole lot to stuff in a purse, but I wasn't able to fit it all in this bag -- the wallet, glasses case, and leather bag were all arguing with each other, the bag was bulgy in the center, and it kept falling over in defeat.Most disappointing of all, the outer pockets don't have any expansion room, so you can really only fit something very flat in there -- flatter even than my already-pretty-flat Kindle Paperwhite. So I ended up sending this bag back and I will keep searching for something that holds my stuff while being fairly compact.Incidentally, this was my first Baggallini bag, and I was pleased with the material. The mushroom color is a nice medium brown, and the internal blue liner was very attractive. The nylon was light-weight, which is important for me in a purse, and the strap was easy to adjust, though a little more thin than I would have liked. The zipper pulls were pretty, but a little heavy. I'll probably try Baggallini again sometime, but will ""size up"" accordingly.~ Ana Mardoll","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YQZZH4CLKBOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PDIC6K#wasThisHelpful","R1YQZZH4CLKBOZ","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Skinomi TechSkin for Kindle Paperwhite / B009CG0LOII love the Skinomi TechSkins. They apply so much more easily than 'regular' skins, and whoever thought of the liquid application is a genius. What's more, the bubbles and streaks always dry out for me within a few hours, and I'm almost always happy with the final product. I currently have Skinomi protectors on at least 4 electronics in my house, and any time I get a new device I always go straight to Amazon to order a Skinomi for it.I can also vouch for their no-hassle lifetime warranty on these skins: after I applied this skin to my Paperwhite, I noticed that there was a small tear in the plastic that I am 99.9% sure I didn't cause. I wrote them what had happened, and they sent a new skin out that very day, no further questions asked and no extra cost for shipping. Now that is what I call great customer service.But. As much as it pains me to say it, I wasn't able to stick with this protector on my Paperwhite. I usually don't notice any added glare with the Skinomi skins, but I guess it's different on an e-ink screen rather than on an LCD one (like my tablet and phone). When I tried to read my Paperwhite with this skin on under the florescent lights at the local Y, the screen was pretty much unreadable from the glare. After a lot of experimentation with holding my reader at different angles, I gave up and removed the skin.If you're going to use your Paperwhite only at night in dark rooms, I think this skin will work just fine for you, but if you're going to be reading under bright lights -- particularly florescents -- then the glare will probably be very distracting. I've uploaded some customer photos that I took with my phone which show the glare effect and you can decide for yourself whether it's worth the added screen protection.~ Ana Mardoll","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XOQ9RPH92Q25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009CG0LOI#wasThisHelpful","R2XOQ9RPH92Q25","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Princess Curse / 978-0062008138Here is what you need to know about ""The Princess Curse"": I started the book a little after dinner one evening, and ended staying up till after midnight to finish this addictive and satisfying story.""The Princess Curse"" manages to seamlessly blend the fairy tale of the twelve dancing princesses with the Persephone myth, and does so in a way that is truly intriguing. I am enormously impressed with Haskell's elaborate world-building as well as with her ability to deal out gripping (and often delightfully creepy) details about the curse as the novel progresses.I am also deeply pleased with the characterization in this novel; even the ""bad"" characters are complex and if not sympathetic then at least understandable. And the heroine and her interactions with others is delightful: it's very nice to see Haskell's dialogue unfold organically, and to have a main character who understands how to maunevre herself thoughtfully through socially fraught conversations. For every reader who has hated Big Misunderstanding plot-twists and has wanted characters to just talk and think things out a little more, here is a novel that does that very thing.Another nice detail is that the protagonist Reveka is an herbalist's apprentice, and this shines through every time she's on the page. She has a real passion for her craft, she thinks in terms of herbs and remedies, and she approaches problems like a professional solving a puzzle. It's wonderful to have a protagonist who is truly unique from all the blank 'reader insert' characters out there -- you may not be much like Reveka, but I can almost guarantee you will find her interesting and likable.I also absolutely love that there are more female characters than male ones in this novel, and despite this being a novel with a 'historical setting', there isn't really a huge heap of sexism on display every five minutes. Instead, there are powerful women in the novel -- an Abbess, a herb-wife, a witch, an herbalist's apprentice, a Princess Consort, etc. -- who are powerful because they are clever and intelligent and because the men around them are willing and able to recognize their talents and give them space to use them. It's really wonderful to read a 'historical' setting which acknowledges that, okay, yeah, sexism exists while still giving its female characters room to be awesome and letting its male characters be sensible about the situation rather than being enormous jerks every five minutes for no good reason. More of this, please.If there is a place where this novel falls down a little, it is perhaps the ending. (Minor spoilers ahead.) I like that the ending is happy, but in places it feels a little too cozy and a little too unfinished. There's actually a line that sounds a lot like the old ""and that's how I spent my summer vacation"" stereotypical ending for old books and films which weren't sure quite how to wrap things up. And there are a number of dangling minor plot holes, which I'm not sure were avoidable given the specific myths involved, but which kind of niggle at your brain an hour after putting the book down. But I feel kind of picky enjoying an exquisite 5-course dinner only to harp that the dessert course was a bit short and a little too sweet.If you enjoy fairy tale re-imaginings, and particularly if you enjoyed the fairy tale of the twelve dancing princesses (a particular favorite of mine), I believe you will think ""The Princess Curse"" was worth the read. In spite of the occasional little plot hole or hiccup in the narrative, the overall writing style is fresh and evocative, and the final product is a tale that manages to be dark in the telling but bright in the resolution.[Content Notes (Spoilery!): Some ableist terminology which may be intended as deconstructive; blood and bleeding feet; some mention of torture in the context of iron shoes; kidnapping, Stockholm Syndrome romances, and underage marriages (but no sexual content, and an explicit-and-tactful denial that underage sex is taking place); comatose patients; religious themes involving witchcraft, paganism, and immortal souls and their possible salvation/damnation; minor discussion of siege warfare; some discussion of abusive orphanage upbringing.]NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this book provided through Amazon Vine.~ Ana Mardoll","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OBOID2ZUTB41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062008137#wasThisHelpful","R3OBOID2ZUTB41","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Juicer / B000FHQJ6CI bought this juicer back in 2009 and have used it less than I'd hoped (more on that in a minute) but often enough to feel that the purchase was worth it. When a Kuvings NJ-9500U Centrifugal Juice Extractor came up on Vine, I figured I was well-placed to review an expensive juicer and contrast it with the cheaper stuff on the market, and post the same essential review in both places. But I'll just cut to the chase right here: as a hobbyist juicer who just wants to whirl the juice out of a handful of fruits, I cannot honestly tell that much of a difference between the expensive Kuvings and the half-price Hamilton -- the Kuvings is better in some ways, but it's not twice as good in proportion to being twice as expensive.* Parts: Both the juicers have mostly the same basic parts: base (with cord and buttons), whirl-er (where the mesh screen sits and the juice comes out), pulp-bucket (where the waste goes), top (where the fruit is fed), and piston (to help jam the fruits through the top and to the whirl-er. But I was surprised to see that the juice pitcher that came standard with the Hamilton is NOT included with the Kuvings; you have to supply your own bowl for the juice to pour into, and since our bowl was wide and uncovered, the new juice pouring in caused the existing juice to splash lightly all over the nearby counter, which I found quite annoying.Advantage: Hamilton.* Weight: The juicers take up about the same footprint on the counter, in terms of width and height. The immediate obvious difference is that the Kuvings is plastic and lighter, whereas the Hamilton is heavier and uses stainless steel clamps. The lighter Kuvings is easier to carry, but I don't know how sturdy the clamps will be over time. Personally, I care more about weight than about sturdiness (we tend to 'baby' our appliances in general).Advantage: Kuvings* Assembly: The Kuvings is more fussy at assembly time; the pulp-bucket has to be sort of tilted up and in and snapped into the top before then being tilted down and sideways to snap into the bottom. The Hamilton, in contrast, just has the pulp-bucket sit flush to the side and the top secures it in place.Advantage: Hamilton.* Speeds: The Kuvings has two speeds, regular and turbo; the Hamilton only has one. Since I only use fruits with my juicers (and therefore only use the regular speed on the Kuvings), I can't say whether the turbo speed is worth the extra cost. That's something to look into if you're planning to use really tough veggies in your juices.Advantage: Neither / Depends.* Noise: The Kuvings boasts a 350-watt motor while the Hamilton uses an 800-watt motor. I do think the Kuvings is less noisy, but not proportionately so and not so much that it doesn't still mightily startle the cats. What I am saying is, when you are using the Kuvings, the rest of the house is aware that you are using the Kuvings. And when you are using the Hamilton, the rest of the house is aware that you are using a slightly louder version of the Kuvings. Neither of them are so loud that the neighbors will hear, nor so soft that you won't disturb your napping husband.Advantage: Kuvings.* Cleaning: Cleaning is the major reason I don't juice more often, and it's an area where I think improvement is possible. The only thing that doesn't need to be cleaned after juicing is the base (unless it got dripped on, which does happen); the whirl-er, piston, pulp-bucket, and juice pitcher will all need cleaning. (I did see recommended in another review that the pulp-bucket be lined with a plastic bag, which is a good idea I will try next time.)This means that if you want a quick juice on your way in to work, you have to assemble the juicer, run the juicer, unassemble the juicer, and either wash everything or at least put all four parts in the sink to soak. If you skip the unassemble-and-wash steps, you will come home to a sticky caked-on mess that will be a nightmare to clean. And since none of this is particularly fast, it means that your 'quick juice' is going to be a 20-minute proposition. No, that doesn't mean that the juicers are ""hard"" to clean, but it does take time -- or at least it does for us. (Maybe the rest of you have super-speed powers. If so, please come wash my dishes?)Both the Kuvings and the Hamilton use the mesh-screen whirl-er and that little guy is a fright to get clean. Husband -- who does the dishes in our family -- has declared after a great deal of consideration that the Kuvings mesh is slightly faster to scrub clean than the Hamiltons mesh, so I will award the advantage on his say-so but with the caveat that the Kuvings mesh still took several minutes of scrubbing to clean. (Husband also registers a concern that the Kuvings cleaning brush doesn't seem very sturdy. But we'll cross that bridge when we get there.)Advantage: Kuvings.* Juiciness: Both the Hamilton and the Kuvings juiced the heck out of a collection of apples and clementines, and in both cases the pulp was very dry afterward. And in both cases there was a lot of flecky foam that can either be strained with a cheesecloth or can be stirred in and drunk. We saw no difference in actual juicing performance between the two juicers.Advantage: Neither / Identical Performance.---I'm pretty sure that if you add everything up mathematically, the Kuvings comes out as better than the Hamilton. But the advantage overall is pretty slight -- the Kuvings is lighter, but seems more in danger of breakage; the Kuvings is less noisy, but not super-noticeably so; the Kuvings takes a minute less to clean but a minute more to assemble; and so forth -- and for twice the price I'm more than a little irked that there's no juice pitcher included because it means that if you don't have a bowl or glass that can fit under the juice nozzle, then you'll have to make another trip to the store.If you're a first time juicer and aren't sure how much you will use your new appliance, I would recommend starting with the Hamilton and seeing how you like it and whether the excessive clean-up process is a turn-off for you. But I would recommend buying the Kuvings over the Hamilton if:* You have strict weight-lifting limits. (I have a bad back.)* You intend to pulp a large volume and/or tough veggies. (Turbo speed!)* You need a less-noisy motor for medical reasons.Otherwise, I think both juicers are very good and do the job they're meant to do.~ Ana Mardoll","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NU259C8OZ51Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FHQJ6C#wasThisHelpful","R3NU259C8OZ51Z","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But the advantage overall is pretty slight -- the Kuvings is lighter, but seems more in danger of breakage; the Kuvings is less noisy, but not super-noticeably so; the Kuvings takes a minute less to clean but a minute more to assemble; and so forth -- and for twice the price I'm more than a little irked that there's no juice pitcher included because it means that if you don't have a bowl or glass that can fit under the juice nozzle, then you'll have to make another trip to the store.If you're a first time juicer and aren't sure how much you will use your new appliance, I would recommend starting with the Hamilton and seeing how you like it and whether the excessive clean-up process is a turn-off for you. But I would recommend buying the Kuvings over the Hamilton if:* You have strict weight-lifting limits. (I have a bad back.)* You intend to pulp a large volume and/or tough veggies. (Turbo speed!)* You need a less-noisy motor for medical reasons.Otherwise, I think both juicers are very good and do the job they're meant to do.NOTE: This review is based on a free review copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.~ Ana Mardoll","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7ELH4NYA3DD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005G05JJ6#wasThisHelpful","R7ELH4NYA3DD","AK0CENM3LUM28","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK0CENM3LUM28?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To extend the life of Birkenstock sandals, it is important to keep the cork bed sealed and protected from weathering and wear and tear.  Kelly's Cork Renew was recommended by a local shoe repair shoe for this purpose and it works great: goes on easily, dries to a tough clear finish, and protects the cork foot bed.

"I have used Meltonian shoe cream for many years. It is an excellent product, made with consistently high standards, goes on easily, polishes nicely, protects and restores the look of the leather, and doesn't dry out in the jar.

"""Downfall"" is an amazing German-language film (with English subtitles) that tells the story of Hitler's final days. The story is a factual account based on well documented sources and is told for the perspective of one of his secretaries. The performance by Bruno Ganz as Hitler was truly amazing.

"This movie can be summed up as how one man beat the hide-bound British establishment and his own incompetent coworkers at Bletchley Park to develop the machine (almost single-handedly) that opened the door to the intelligence that won World War Two. Exciting stuff if it were actually true! If you read the book upon which this movie was based, Alan Turing: The Enigma: The Book That Inspired the Film ""The Imitation Game"", you will find that much of the story and most of the dramatic moments in the film were made up out of whole cloth. A few examples (!!! SPOILER ALERT !!!):- Turing thinking up a scheme to identify potential cryptology candidates through a puzzle contest -- he never did that and never personally administered those tests. In fact, Joan Clarke (played by Keira Knightley) was not recruited in that way in any case.- Turing sending a personal letter to Churchill to complain about the lack of resources due to clueless leadership at Bletchley Park -- he did write a letter that was given directly to Churchill requesting additional personnel and resources, but it was also signed by most of his peers at Bletchley Park and also defended the leadership there.- The British bombe decryption machine was never called ""Christopher"" as it was portrayed in the movie. In fact, many machines were eventually made and were located offsite from Bletchley Park.- Turing realizing he could use a daily weather message to give the bombe enough information to determine the German Enigma machines settings, then used those settings to decode German naval messages and plot all the positions of U-boats and German navy ships on a map in one night -- never happened. Upon cracking the Enigma, British Intelligence had to develop a large organization to interpreted and exploit the information. For instance, U-boat positions were reported using a grid system. The British did not have access to the map used by the Germans with those grid designations and had to develop one through painstaking analysis. That had to be done before U-boat positions could be plotted.- Turing locking himself in the room with the bombe while armed guards came to arrest him -- never happened.Bottom line, this movie diminishes (rather than celebrates) the scale of the intelligence challenge and achievements made by Alan Turing and the army of hardworking personnel at Bletchley Park in order to make a politically correct statement. Turing deserves to be celebrated, but not through a fairytale such as this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32WSPQT0VRAXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R7FZ074#wasThisHelpful","R32WSPQT0VRAXB","A291H4XSTIHHHS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A291H4XSTIHHHS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this speaker as a gift for my mother so she could get more out of her Fire, 7"" Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Black. I have been extremely impressed with the powerful and crisp sound this stereo speaker produces from such a small footprint! The speaker is not much larger than a paperback book. That said, the sound is best when not at full volume. It is best suited for a small to mid-sized room or in a local area of a large room. My mother (who is not tech-savvy) loves the great sound, small size, and intuitive controls. I liked it so much I bought one for myself! Highly recommended!The good:- Small footprint.- Clean, sharp, crisp sound with up to 30 watts of power.- Dedicated subwoofer with dual passive radiators for deep bass sound.- Easy to setup.- Excellent Bluetooth performance and NFC technology.- Built-in USB charging port (on the back).- Aux-in 3.5mm audio jack for direct connection to the speakers.- Speakerphone functionality.- Ten-hour battery life.The bad:- Only one physical control button (on/off), the rest of the controls are touch sensor points which are almost impossible to use in a dark room. I would have preferred that all the controls have real buttons as my other Sony Bluetooth speakers have had in the past.

"I love this 7.0"" tablet. I bought six as part of a six-pack deal and could not be happier! It is truly an excellent value for the money!The good:- Excellent Wi-Fi performance with dual-band capability.- Excellent Bluetooth performance.

To hear anything adequately, I have to max out the volume.- As of this review, Amazon has not yet posted a user's manual for this tablet. The customer service representative I talked to said it should be posted in a week.Instructions from Amazon Customer Service on how to insert the MicroSD card into this tablet:- To insert a MicroSD card, hold your Fire tablet vertically (like for portrait viewing), with the front-facing camera top center in the tablet. The Micro SD card slot will be on the upper right-hand side of your device.- Open the MicroSD card port cover and rotate it slightly to reveal the MicroSD card slot. With the notch in the MicroSD card facing up, carefully insert the card into the slot -- the copper contacts on the MicroSD card should be facing toward the back of the tablet and the printing on the card facing toward the screen.- Push gently on the MicroSD card until it locks into place.Accessories I recommend for this tablet (and own): Amazon Fire Case (5th Generation - 2015 release), Black, Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Bluetooth Mouse, Logitech Keys-To-Go Ultra-Portable Bluetooth Keyboard for Android and Windows, and SanDisk Ultra 128GB Ultra Micro SDXC UHS-I/Class 10 Card with Adapter (SDSQUNC-128G-GN6MA).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROIEJY1W6PF5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TSUGXKE#wasThisHelpful","ROIEJY1W6PF5R","A291H4XSTIHHHS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A291H4XSTIHHHS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a fan of Coach wallets for many years since I bought my first one at their flagship store in San Francisco (at 190 Post Street) in the early 80s. I have worn this style wallet ever since and my current one has lasted over five years and should last for at least several more. I love the quality leather, workmanship, and classic design. The price has remained very consistent despite inflation over the past thirty years. One reason for this may be that Coach has clearly cut a few corners in the past 15 years or so to keep the cost down: the wallet is lined with nylon fabric instead of the gorgeous leather lining they used to use; and most (if not all) of the wallets are now made overseas and not in the United States.

"I bought two of these fobs to replace 18-year-old original Viper fobs that are no longer working properly: work intermittently and no longer have the range they once had -- you have to be very close to the car door for them to work. I only bought these replacement fobs because they were described as ""reconditioned"". Unfortunately, what I actually received looked ancient (grimy, badly worn, and very old) and are in worse condition than my 18-year-old original fobs! With these electronic devices it isn't good enough that the green light works, they need to produce a strong signal, as well, to use them at distance from the car. Opening the cases, I found the circuit boards were filthy and the components were oxidized. I have no faith they would function any better than the ones I already have. Additionally, the price ($15) is way too high for something in this condition. At best they should be priced at no more than five dollars. You could do better than this at your local automobile junk yard. The following is the text of the email I received from the seller confirming these fobs are marginal: ""I am sorry to hear that.

"I am really impressed with the restoration given to this 1959 film. It is amazing war drama with standout performances by Jeff Chandler and Jack Palance as German bomb demolition specialists working in the ruble of post-war Berlin. The film has a strong documentary feel and was shot in bomb blast sites in Berlin. In fact, on one occasion production had to be delayed until an actual bomb was defused! I have always found it suprising that director Robert Aldrich considered this film ""awful"" and it was plagued by production, distribution, screenplay and personnel problems.

"I bought this for a Magnum Damascus Black Bone Knife. This is my second Boker leather sheath (my other one is a Boker Leather Sheath I). They are both well made from beautiful full grain leather and are an excellent value. I prefer this one (the Sheath III) over the Sheath I because the color is a little darker and the Boker Tree logo is a bit more pronounced. It fits my four-inch long knife perfectly. There is is still a little more room, so it could fit a slightly longer knife as well. My only complaint is the belt loop consists of two slots cut in the back of the case. I would have preferred a stitched-on leather loop.

"I bought a used (""new"" condition) pair of these earbuds from the Amazon Warehouse and am extremely happy with their quality and the excellent deal I received. I really notice the brilliant sound these earbuds produce; although, they are not very comfortable to wear (but not painful) and the sound from my high-end headphones is superior.

"I received this book yesterday and have to agree with other reviewers, this is a riveting account and I can't put it down! I learned about this book from an excellent review on the Daily Mail website on November 5, 2015. In addition to giving Mr. Nicolai's personal account, it reveals many of the complex ethic, cultural, religious and political issues that are in play in the region. That said, the book has some editing problem (typos, grammar, etc.) and the pictures are poor quality. The book states that ""a significant part of the book revenue will be donated to the children in the UNHCR and UNICEF refugee camps in Kurdistan as well as a vets home"".

"Absolutely gorgeous gentleman's pocket knife and an excellent value for the money. I bought two (one for a Christmas gift) and could not be happier. The Damascus steel blade and bolsters and black bone handle make a beautiful combination. Both knives are well made and I could find no flaw with their workmanship, finish, and operation. This knife comes in a gun metal-colored metal presentation tin -- the color of the one reviewer-posted photo showing this (the one with the pack of playing cards) is not quite right (too brown).

"I bought two of these finders because they are well made, the batteries are rechargeable, and they interface well with my Samsung Galaxy Note 4, Frosted White 32GB (Sprint). After using them for several days, I am getting a bit tired of the alarms on my phone and the devices going off every time the Bluetooth connection drops. The app is nice, but the settings allow for very little customization of the system (app and finders): only for the first finder's name, working range, and ringtone. I wish I could mute the proximity alarm (or at least set it to vibrate), but that is not an option. Currently, I have my finders set to ""sleep"". The hole on the finders is too small to fit on any of my key chains. I solved the problem by attaching Nickel Plated Split Rings (12mm). Overall, I am having some seconds thoughts about this purchase, but will give it more time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VD6W4F95Y7MC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TG23QDG#wasThisHelpful","R1VD6W4F95Y7MC","A291H4XSTIHHHS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A291H4XSTIHHHS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this for the Fire HD 10, 10.1"" HD Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB - Includes Special Offers, Black. It fits perfectly and is an excellent value. The protector includes dry and wet screen cleaning packets, a screen cleaning cloth, and an adhesive dust removal tool. I especially appreciate the careful packaging to protect the glass during shipment. The instructions were easy to follow. I did have a few problems with my installation and still have a dime-sized air bubble near the middle of the screen that will not go away, but don't think it is due to a problem with the protector. I tried peeling off the protector and lifting off any lint in the area of the bubble (with scotch tape), but the problem remains. I had no problems otherwise.

"I bought a three-pack of these key trackers because the batteries can be changed, the smartphone app is well designed, and I like the idea of supporting a small startup company (founded by a team of former Boeing engineers) that want to ""build a better mouse trap"". Unfortunately, the one device I actually put on my key chain only lasted two days before malfunctioning (button stopped working, quit interfacing with the app, and the light on the device stayed on permanently) and the company's technical support is only an email address with a 36-hour response window. Also, I couldn't get the battery cover off the device with the three supplied tools: small rectangular pieces of plastic with two bumps that fit the battery cover. Although not perfect, I subsequently purchased the Veho VBA-008-S8 SAEM S8 Reperio Bluetooth Proximity Alarm/Finder with Smartphone Photo Remote and recommend you consider that instead.For the manufacturer: consider designing a battery compartment cover with a coin slot-style opener and ditch the tool.The following are the tech support email replies I received. Unfortunately, it took so long to get them that I had already returned my order for refund:""I'm sorry to see you're experiencing a problem with one of your Honey's! Re-inserting the battery should turn off the light. Here are more detailed tips for removing the battery cover:Put the plastic tool provided in the package into the two little holes on the battery cover and turn about 1/8 a turn, until it stops. It's a short turn, just enough to unlock the cover.  The seal on the lid may make it stick a little, in that case it is easiest to either push the battery out from the other side, or use tape to stick to the cover and pull straight out. If you have misplaced the tool, two dull pen tips can be used as well.Once open, there are two things you can do to reset the device's light:1. Reinsert the battery2. If that does not work, remove the battery. Please short the two metal leads in the Honey by using a metal object such as a spoon or knife.  That will release any power buildup and restart the system.  Then insert the battery again.""Second email response:""Thank you for the feedback! As a small-but-growing startup, we do our best to respond to all customers in a timely manner and work hard to keep our response times to under 36 hours.I'm sorry to see the issue was not resolved better. We do hope that if you do not find a tracker that works great for you that you consider giving us another try down the road, as we are working constantly to deliver the best experience possible.""","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LBJE5VMI6D3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OA4PC8C#wasThisHelpful","R1LBJE5VMI6D3E","A291H4XSTIHHHS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A291H4XSTIHHHS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The three drawers are roomy & deep, and the basic height of 29"" was tall enough in my bedroom that I had no need to add the four 3"" beige plastic feet provided as an option.  I'm so pleased I just ordered a second one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XQL3EVGP1NVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V87C10Q#wasThisHelpful","R1XQL3EVGP1NVJ","A1ORZKYPMHLRUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZKYPMHLRUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this style of paper hot cups, usually sold in supermarkets in the 9 oz. size, as these disposable cups are much healthier to drink from than the cheap foam variety which could or does have carcinogens.  These 16 oz. cups are pretty, particularly for the coffee lover, as the designs over a burgundy background have different coffee bar style drawings of steaming coffee cups, and wordings all around including café, latte, espresso & cappuccino.  Since my 9 oz. size supermarket hot cups are increasingly hard to find, I ordered 2 packages of these, and on looking at them they seem HUGE (about the size of a Starbucks Grande), so unless you want to quickly go through your morning 12 cup pot o' joe, only fill these a little over halfway for a regular size cup.  I wish they would sell the 12 oz. size in smaller packages than only the case of 300 offered, otherwise filling this size cup a bit less is a minor adjustment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H9P0C0FE2VL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZAJ94KI#wasThisHelpful","R1H9P0C0FE2VL5","A1ORZKYPMHLRUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZKYPMHLRUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently bought a 2 ft. tall white tabletop tree for the holidays, and decided on these mini colored lights with white wire to complement it.  The little lights are in beautiful colors, the blue is actually a bright teal rather than royal, and you can count on Vickerman for reliability - if one goes out, the others stay lit.

"I think most people are complaining of a skimpy tree because they are not unpacking it properly.  The tree arrives in a slim vertical box, and each branch must be pulled downward to create the full image pictured.  Some branches are packed very close together, appearing as one piece, so observe carefully as you are doing the ""onion peeling"" (or, have the patience to arrange the tree as you would a bouquet of flowers, moving the branches around at different angles).  My tree came out as full as the photo, though the height is slightly smaller than 2 ft. - 22"" from the three sided white base to the top.  We have a small apartment without a lot of extra room, so my tree is going on top of an end table beside a sofa, right at the picture window of the living room.  I have already begun decorating it pre-Christmas with a small silver beaded garland, and have ordered multi colored mini lights w/ white wiring from Amazon to complement it.

"This latest entry from one of my favorite suspense authors Rick Mofina moves at lightning speed.  Bombs are strapped to the bodies of a husband, wife and young son, with orders for the husband to cooperate from four desperadoes holding the others hostage.  Reporter Kate Page is hot on the case, a repeat character from other novels (Mofina, a reporter himself, almost always inserts a key reporter into his stories, often as the protagonist).

"I chose this Monarch (by Coaster) pedestal table because most round tables sold online have problematic drop leaves, and I don't want any accidents at dinner while entertaining.  We have a small dinette area, so this 48"" round table is the perfect size.  Oak grain finish is called amber on the box, and is actually a warm medium golden oak shade that blends well with most furniture shades (we have some dark warm oak and medium cherry pieces and all look compatible).  I chose a highly rated oak company that created a courier label same day of order, but in fact the delivery was not completed until the full two and a half week window, so if you choose the oak version I would advise you to have patience to wait, because you will LOVE the finished product it's a beautiful functional table that looks higher quality than the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLNN7K032J948/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028TF5XI#wasThisHelpful","RLNN7K032J948","A1ORZKYPMHLRUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZKYPMHLRUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is perhaps Sundram's most beloved work, and if yours is a romantic heart you will love placing this print in a special place in your home (ours is right over our bedroom headboard).  Perfectly captures intimate memories or dreams about the paradise that is Hawaii;  the flower-bedecked heads of an embracing island couple next to a double rainbow in the sky, a spectacular volcanic mountain vista, below which dolphins swim joyously in the sea.

"A beautiful young teenage girl goes on holiday with her family from England to Greece, where she meets a seductive, handsome young Greek boy about her age, who pries her for personal information & learns she has an unhappy home life and is a vulnerable candidate for the sordid life of forcible prostitution that awaits her.  For ten long years she is transported violently from country to country, shackled and abused along with other girls, offered drugs to keep her complacent, and going on a hellish journey from private houses to brothels to the red light district of Amsterdam, Holland where her body is obscenely displayed in a window for prospective customers.  She finally ends up in a brothel in England that is raided, and admits the truth about her ordeal to the authorities;  however, she is extremely fearful of being returned to her parents and the miserable home life which is the classic lifestyle that produces many sex workers.  Told from 2 points of view, the girl Scarlett's, and the group of female DCI's who care for her and offer her a degree of protection, this is written by an author who worked inside Britain's Behavior Analysis crime unit and speaks from experience.  This subject of human trafficking/white slavery has always interested me, from the time when I was an impressionable young woman and could always imagine ""there but for the grace of God, go I"" if one were just unlucky enough to trust the wrong person.  You have to feel a deep sympathy for these poor, tortured, brainwashed girls, most of whom accept this life until they get too old to be of use, when they are killed or otherwise thrown aside as no longer needed.  A riveting, almost true to life account (the author does reference one of these girls' journals) that is well told but definitely unsettling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XOJRNO9206SK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062276115#wasThisHelpful","R1XOJRNO9206SK","A1ORZKYPMHLRUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZKYPMHLRUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robert Crais' antihero Elvis Cole PI is a witty, wisecracking gumshoe character in the style of Chandler's Philip Marlowe and Spillane's Mike Hammer.  There is usually a pretty girl or two for flirtation or romance in each story, and each short novel in this collection of Elvis Cole mysteries is guaranteed to be a fast, enjoyable ride that keeps you smiling throughout.  This is the second three-books-in-one volume of Crais' early stories published in the UK in 2002, so check the sellers' origins as most are in Great Britain (takes a little longer to arrive, approx. 2-3 weeks) but you can often find a few in the U.S. for quicker delivery.  Elvis' sidekick Joe Pike is in these stories as well.

"MJ Arlidge is a new British crime fiction author who writes a riveting story.  His first book Eeny Meeny was a Target book selection here in the USA, and I picked it up there about a month ago and became hooked on his main character, Detective Inspector (DI) Helen Grace.  She is a tough, plain spoken and somewhat unpopular  lead detective (a younger version of Helen Mirren's Jane Tennison), with a bit of a dark side due to her tormented childhood.  This book The Doll's House is the third in Arlidge's DI Grace series, and it is more focused on the serial killer, his victims, their families as well as introducing other detective personnel rather than strictly on DI Grace.  Very compelling killer, the doll's house of the story is not only a toy from the killer's youth, but is a metaphor for the underground dungeon where he keeps his female victims prisoner.  This book and Pop Goes The Weasel are UK publications so I had to wait a couple weeks for the books to arrive via Royal Mail, but these large paperbacks are well worth the wait and are enjoyable fast reads from start to finish.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R255G397VG7DPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1405919191#wasThisHelpful","R255G397VG7DPV","A1ORZKYPMHLRUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZKYPMHLRUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This beautiful black floral purse is in the currently hard to find 3x5"" size, which has always been my favorite size to stuff credit cards, cash and coins, and still have room to add lists and receipts.

This Apt 9 beauty is made of a strong grainy imitation cowhide that should be durable, and it has many features of a finer brand including taffeta lining, a keyring in the inside corner, a see thru ID window on one side, as well as a great removable insert panel with three credit card slots on one side, and another see thru ID window on the reverse side.

"As an avid reader of crime fiction, I thought it wise to foray into the noir genre books of the great writer Raymond Chandler.  This 4-story collection is a marvelous journey into the life of Detective Philip Marlowe, wisecracking and jaded, and in my mind I could only picture Robert Mitchum as the weary Marlowe (though others have played the part also on film).  From the first to last novel, though many characters come and go through Marlowe's life (his romances are sexy for the day, with an amusing sarcasm), you are focused on this mesmerizing PI and his smart, snappy dialogue.  This hardcover book is in the classic mode and includes a wonderful descriptive introduction about each novel and well as Chandler's life, and has an attached top gold ribbon insert to conveniently use as a bookmark.  Most of these stories have been made into films and I look forward to finding them on DVD.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4MG8BJG0KCU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375415025#wasThisHelpful","R4MG8BJG0KCU4","A1ORZKYPMHLRUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZKYPMHLRUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These bikini panties by Fruit of the Loom are THE most comfortable undies I have ever owned.  If you have a tummy and get pinched by the underbelly waistlines of bikini underwear, these panties are a marvel in that you cannot even feel the line around your gut, the elastic is so stretchy and overlaid with very soft cotton rich (60% cotton) fabric.  They are not skimpy about the size, I wear a 7 but these have a roomy fit even after washing.  I have also purchased the boy shorts in this Beyond Soft line, and its the same feeling, as if you have no panties at all on, yet you are comfortably protected by a really attractive pair of underpants.  Though they are a 60/40 cotton poly combo, there is a reinforced bottom panel that is probably 100% cotton for ventilation.  The different panty colors are also really pretty, and I have to say that while I shop panties for value and often go with the Hanes brand, I am now 100% devoted to Fruit of the Loom and hope they keep this Beyond Soft line around for a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYEZUIGVHQ1QT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WG3ZKRC#wasThisHelpful","RYEZUIGVHQ1QT","A1ORZKYPMHLRUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZKYPMHLRUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Many years ago I saw the movie Single White Female starring Bridget Fonda and Jennifer Jason Leigh, and really enjoyed the suspense and tension of the story.  If you liked the movie, reading the book is a bigger thrill, as there are more and expanded characterizations, as well as deeper psychological analysis of the disturbed girl Hedra (called Hedy in the movie).  John Lutz is a favorite suspense author of mine, and this is one of his early works (reissued here), originally released as ""SWF Seeks Same,"" referring to the ad placed by the nice girl Allie for a roommate.  Lutz paints a vivid portrait of living single in NYC and its dangers, and he adds a postscript to this book of how he greatly enjoyed the filming of the movie based on his book, which he didn't expect to as most authors dislike the filmed version.  Even if you are familiar with the story from the movie, you will not be bored reading this, as the book holds many surprises and is a great ride.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27XHAT39PF34V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786028815#wasThisHelpful","R27XHAT39PF34V","A1ORZKYPMHLRUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZKYPMHLRUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though the book title is a line from the Billie Holiday song Strange Fruit about lynching in the American South, this tale of racial hatred is set in DCI Banks' West Yorkshire territory, and is between a group of law breaking Skinheads and their Pakistani neighbors.  Very well written and nuanced regarding the seeds of racial intolerance (the murdered boy's grandfather let a comment slip about his Jewish landlord, and feels a deep shame and responsibility upon learning of his grandson's involvement in a Nazi loving hate group, when he himself had helped liberate the camps after World War II), it is always an enjoyable and educational experience reading a DCI Banks story.

Though no prayer card is included, the beads arrived in a protective plastic packet in a cushioned mailer, shipped very quickly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ALEBXXCUNYSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOVGH22#wasThisHelpful","R1ALEBXXCUNYSV","A1ORZKYPMHLRUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZKYPMHLRUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Firstly, Gregg Olsen is a very good writer but this book about serial killer(s) is a sick departure for him.  The methodology of the killings has been featured a few times on the show Criminal Minds, and there is a hint during one of the early murders as to who is behind the killing.  I read a lot of murder/serial killer/suspense novels, and I have to say that though any perversion is believable of a murderer, the rape violations in this one are pretty revolting and paint an unforgettable picture in your head.  Beyond this, its very well written and the law enforcement characters (one partner has an autistic son and is very compassionate) are interesting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25L518WCZPWY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078602044X#wasThisHelpful","R25L518WCZPWY0","A1ORZKYPMHLRUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZKYPMHLRUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased these lights in the amber, which after inserting 3 AAA batteries in the box, makes them a beautiful bright fire orange that is perfect for Halloween.  What's nice is, you can choose from three settings, regular continuous light, blinking type (like batting an eyelid, not twinkling), or the Off position.  However, the minus is that the batteries wear down quickly and make the lights pin dots after several hours on, even with long life batteries you need to change them frequently, so I now use the dollar store brand as those work just as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11CAQN5P4U2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008CGPZPY#wasThisHelpful","R11CAQN5P4U2","A1ORZKYPMHLRUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZKYPMHLRUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 3-book set of early works by Robert Crais feature one of his most popular characters, Elvis Cole PI, as well as another favorite PI, the elusive Joe Pike, in a minor role.  My first Robert Crais book was the excellent recent release Suspect about a wounded K9 dog pairing up with a wounded policeman, and I became intrigued by this marvelous writer.  I then purchased a used copy of his early book The Monkey's Raincoat (featured in this set), but because of its late '80s release date, the book was rather yellowed & musty.  Since the dates on the other two novels in this collection are also late '80s-early '90s, and this 3-book set is dated 2001, it was a much better choice to purchase this more recent set.  I got the large paperback which is a bit bulky at @ 600 pages. but it works out that each of the novels is around 200 pages apiece (his works got longer later).

"As a young schoolgirl, I used to buy these Pine Bros drops (called cough drops back then, though the ingredients are the same, and throat drops is a better description since they contain no medicine) at the local deli while waiting for my school bus, and they came in three of the four flavors now offered, which were honey, cherry & black licorice.  They were soft and chewy as now, and the only discernible difference is that the cherry was sweeter and less tangy then it is now, otherwise still the same great product.  It's rather expensive for a small bag of 32 drops that goes pretty fast, but its well worth the price if you have any issues with a dry throat - mine is that we share a duplex with heavy smokers, leading me to cough and have a raspy throat, and of everything I have tried, these Pine Bros drops do the best job of moistening my throat all the way down and preventing coughing.  I think the best flavor is the honey, which is like taking a spoonful of liquid honey and will certainly help a dry throat.  Highly recommend these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OURT18UPESH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G5LQ5WK#wasThisHelpful","R2OURT18UPESH9","A1ORZKYPMHLRUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZKYPMHLRUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a special, prosaic book that is a wonderful read.  The story of Lilith, a beautiful schizophrenic young woman confined to a mental asylum, and her manipulation of the young male attendant Vincent's emotions to the point where his own sanity is threatened, is very insidious and believable.  As Vincent slowly falls under Lilith's entrancing spell, you are swept into their rarified world, as you become all too aware of Lilith's destructive power over the young man and his youthful gullibility.  Though the book ends on a hopeful note, the 1964 movie has a more realistic ending, and I would encourage readers to get this DVD.  Jean Seberg played the part of Lilith perfectly, mysterious and seductive, and though Warren Beatty's wooden acting was widely criticized, it was actually a well done take on Vincent's naïvete.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H7W8VL3LULZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005W97R#wasThisHelpful","R2H7W8VL3LULZD","A1ORZKYPMHLRUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZKYPMHLRUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having been a reader of crime fiction (i.e. Michael Connelly, John Lutz) as well as non-fiction (Anne Rule) for many years, I am always on the lookout for a suspense author who is new to me.  I have recently begun Rick Mofina's books, starting with Full Tilt and now this one No Way Back.  While this story is gripping and revolves around the tense kidnapping of a reporter's wife, and it moves as a good fast pace, I am not wild about Mr. Mofina's choices as regards victim abuse.  In the former novel, a serial rapist/killer transports his young female victims across state lines in steel coffins, and in this book, poor abducted Ann Reed gets jostled around from place to place covered up at the bottom of the car, and her final punishment is hanging suspended in a deep subterranean well.  Being somewhat claustrophobic, I personally am not thrilled with these torture methods, though they are written about believably and engrossingly.  Hoping I did not spoil some of the story for any readers, but I had to remove a star for the discomfort factor.  As a tribute to Mr. Mofina's writing talent, though, I will be seeking out other books by him.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZCXFLC936PUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078601525X#wasThisHelpful","R1ZCXFLC936PUI","A1ORZKYPMHLRUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZKYPMHLRUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Back in the late '70s I had seen the film Bobby Deerfield starring Al Pacino and Marthe Keller, based on this book, and the intriguing story led me to read this haunting romance.  Lillian is dying of tuberculosis and resides in a sanatorium in the Alps, where wealthy people often hoped to find a cure.  Clerfayt (renamed Bobby Deerfield in the movie, and based on the real life race car driver Alfonso de Portago) is a formula one driver whose car breaks down in Lillian's Swiss town and needs repairs, and they meet by chance in a restaurant.  They become a couple, and set off driving around Europe on an odyssey of romantic discovery, living life to the fullest (staying at nice hotels, shopping, eating out) all the while aware of Lillian's unfortunate future.  When you read that Clerfayt will be driving in Italy's Mille Miglia race (where de Portago met his untimely end), you realize that the tables may be turned regarding their destinies.  Told from Lillian's point of view, E.M. Remarque's writing is absolutely prosaic, its the kind of book to savor and re-read, the book's title is so accurate, as in the old adage, ""man makes plans while God laughs.""  Also try to see the movie which is now on DVD, as the actors are 100% true to the written characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMMGXVQI1A7DR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0151399530#wasThisHelpful","RMMGXVQI1A7DR","A1ORZKYPMHLRUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZKYPMHLRUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These Frosty snow boots have a tag that says ""Mountain Warehouse Ltd, London, UK"" attached to the boot, and a tag inside them that says Made In China, with both sizing for UK & US.  When you order from Amazon, choose your regular American size, not the British, as I ordered an 8 and it was true to size.  I have a wide foot & with shoes usually order a 7.5C (or 7 1/2W), but as most boots are only even-sized I end up getting an 8.  These boots are a good fit, slightly roomy but not so your foot moves around inside, and the good news for wider feet is I had no need to use a shoe stretcher or split (cut) the boot, and they don't pinch my feet.  Also for comfort, the Velcro closure is a very wide panel placed at the outside of your foot so there is no rubbing when you walk, and it opens in a deep V like an accordion, so you have many choices of adjusting from looser to tighter.

If you are familiar with Mother Angelica of EWTN and her televised Chaplet of St. Michael (it is on every morning in my area, I love to say the prayers along with Mother), these beads are very similar to hers at less than a third the price the EWTN catalog charges for them.  I like that there are nine separate colors for each salutation, so you can remember your place if you let go of them.  The colors in the necklace part right to left are:  red, clear, amber, clear iridescent, blue, pink, green, amethyst & blue violet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F6KEHUCR1DAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Q8MNC6#wasThisHelpful","R2F6KEHUCR1DAE","A1ORZKYPMHLRUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZKYPMHLRUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an absolutely stunning, completely realistic portrait of a lifesize pineapple surrounded by golden pears, berries & a bed of greenery (hard to tell from the online photo, the same green stalks on the crown of the pineapple are splayed out beneath it, as if it is naturally growing).  So many garden flags I've purchased are paler in person than online, but not this beauty, the colors are intense & gorgeous - the pineapple itself golden brown, its crown stalks shades of grass & emerald green, the pears Bartlett yellow, the background palest yellow, and framed in emerald green.  This is a terrific welcoming flag (without the annoying Welcome word) for any time of year; I will put it out in early autumn when fruit displays seem most appropriate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFWGJCR8VJDYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BOZ0VM2#wasThisHelpful","RFWGJCR8VJDYH","A1ORZKYPMHLRUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZKYPMHLRUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My mother could hem pants & skirts perfectly freestyle without a sewing machine, an art that I could never master and which sent me to the tailor's to hem pants for years.  That is, until I discovered this product a few years ago.  This adhesive cream comes out like Elmer's glue but isn't sticky to work with, it goes on in a thin line (or two if you're hemming more than 1""), just lay the pants out on a table or the floor, apply per instructions, press each side & edges, then put something heavy over each leg to set the hem (don't laugh, I use pyrex pans).  I wait 30 minutes, take the weight off & I have a pair of evenly shortened pants.  Just be sure you apply the cream middle to bottom of the hem line, not near the top so there isn't overflow & the pants don't stick together.  This is a quick & simple solution to sewing, even if you use a machine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DFE9WO37YHKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001685U78#wasThisHelpful","R2DFE9WO37YHKE","A1ORZKYPMHLRUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZKYPMHLRUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know these little stork shaped scissors are meant for sewing, and they are great for that purpose.  However in my household, this sharp & cute little fellow has many other uses.  For myself, it replaces cuticle scissors for trimming fingernails & toenails as it cuts carefully & never gets dull.  For my husband it's a great mustache clipper, which is a job that usually falls to me (better eyesight, but only slightly).  At these prices it pays to have a couple on hand, as I'm always digging to find one in my cosmetics box.  The gold plated one is really pretty, it also comes in pewter, and both have that pretty detailing over the bird shape.

"This collection of bossa nova songs is from the late '50s when the musical style was just beginning.  Its most famous composer at the time was Antonio Carlos Jobim, and according to the CD's liner notes his breakout bossa nova hit in Brazil was ""Chega de Saudade"" which is featured here sung by both Joao Gilberto & Elizete Cardoso.  The primary singer in this collection is Cardoso, with 13 tracks from her 1958 album ""Cancao do Amor Demais"" mostly composed by Jobim, only a couple well known but all very melodic with gentle rhythms.  There are a few lovely guitar selections from Luiz Bonfa & Laurindo Almeida, a couple early songs by Sylvia Telles & Garoto, one gorgeous romantic ballad by baritone Agostinho dos Santos ""Sucedeu assim"", and several early songs from the Os Cariocas group who harmonized like The Lettermen.

The Time Out book is packed with pertinent information along with many photos on such topics as restaurants, maps & neighborhoods; for instance, my husband is staying at a business hotel on Avenida Paulista in the Jardins area, and the book has corresponding info particular to that area.

"This cobalt blue recycled bottle glass suncatcher has a beautiful raised (about 1/2"") sculptured scallop shell in the center that is very lifelike, just like a beach shell.  If you want it to lay flat against your window, just reverse the side, as the shell image easily shows through and is very reflective on sunny days.  Because of the fine detailing of the sculptured side however, I like mine to face frontward, and I purchased a pair to go in the side panels of my 3-sided bay window along with the Amia large seashell design painted suncatcher in the center.

"I bought these for my husband because he asked if my ladies version of the New Balance 801 slide came in a men's style, as he is comfortable with a clog shoe.  The ladies side sole is the same ridged rubber in white, and from the online photo the men's shoe appeared to have the same white side sole & New Balance ""N"" logo - but on receiving the shoe, both are in a nice dove grey, which complements the black suede beautifully.  I had purchased black heel & sole polish with plans to color the stark white rubber side sole for him, but with the grey color there is really no need - this is a case where the shoe is better looking in person than online.  From my own experience with the ladies version, they're very, very comfortable and I'm glad they come in wide widths as we both need them.  The satin placket at the lip of the shoe is soft & stretchy, and there is an upward dip in the arch for those of us who don't like the flat-to-ground type walking shoe.  Another winner from New Balance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHT3CVXHFQTU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001RXR5EI#wasThisHelpful","RHT3CVXHFQTU5","A1ORZKYPMHLRUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZKYPMHLRUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He loves this, doesn't need a pillow because the material is soft faux leather/vinyl with a nice cushioned top, very well crafted & stitched.  Slight new odor in box, but not on item once removed.

"Woe is us, but another holiday season is upon the world.  Before you know it, the kids’ll all be nestled snug in their beds with while visions of sugarplums are danced in their heads … so why not let the adults have their particular visions, too, eh?  Merry Christmas and God bless us all, but isn’t it time Christmas Eve unveiled a new hero in red, perhaps even a ritual slayer of the undead?  Such is the case with this darkly assembled caper, a clever and smartly tuned anthology sure to serve up a yuletide affair you’ll not soon forget.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you’re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I’d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you’re accepting of a few modest hints at ‘things to come,’ then read on …)From the product packaging: “Last Christmas Eve, two teens came to a grisly end in a school basement.  Now, one year later, a new set of horrors has come to town …”There’s plenty more, but like any good giver I’m going to leave you with that as A CHRISTMAS HORROR STORY remains a gift best left unspoiled.  It isn’t perfect, nor methinks was it truly meant to be, but it does effectively skewer every treatise of the greater holiday season.  Santa.  The nativity.  The elves.  Even the blessed virgin makes an uncharacteristic appearance in this warped enterprise from the minds of writers James Kee, Sarah Larsen, Doug Taylor, and Pascal Trottier.  It’s as delightfully executed by directors Grant Harvey, Steven Hoban, and Brett Sullivan as it is magically conceived, so – if you’re as patient as can be – you’ll likely enjoy the full thrust that this deliriously fractured fairy tale delivers.Essentially, HORROR is an anthology flick but that simple term dismisses the genius of it all.  Instead of serving up three or maybe four stand-alone installments this red-nosed reindeer is gleefully interwoven – both with characters and timing – playing out more like PULP FICTION than it does THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  To its credit, each segment dishes up cookies and milk by way of great performances (there are honestly too many good ones to mention), and it’s all held together by the glue of a singular William Shatner’s performance.  His turn as the demented disc jockey for the rarely heard of Bailey Downs radio station gives the picture a special place in the warm hearts of horror aficionados everywhere … and stay tuned for the stocking stuffers of even more lunacy as the final credits start to roll.Now, HORROR as I said ain’t perfect.  The Nativity segment – though worthy – kinda/sorta drags in spots, and the mythology behind Krampus never quite makes the kind of sense SAW’s erstwhile scribes tried to imbue their potboilers with.  But the sum total of this holiday affair is that if you like your days off celebrated more than just a bit off-center, then pour yourself some eggnog (duly spiked) and pop this wicked little disc in the DVD player.  You’ll be glad you did.And having the North Pole look like Mordor during the Ice Age?  Brilliant.A CHRISTMAS HORROR STORY (2015) is produced by Copperheart Entertainment.  DVD distribution is being handled by the reliable RLJ Entertainment and Image Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications?  This is one smartly assembled production with the best quality sights and sounds available.  (The packaging insists its Closed Captioned for the Hearing-Impaired, but there was no subtitle track available – I almost always check that.)  Lastly, if you’re looking for special features, then there is a behind-the-scenes short that is actually quite good.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Bah humbug!  The season’s merry enough as it is, so it’ll take time to see whether or not the shining star that is A CHRISTMAS HORROR STORY rises high enough to become the subversive holiday favorite for the rest of us (mainly horror fans, that is), but – as bad Santas go – I found it delightful in just the proper measure of naughty and nice.  Mind you: it’s definitely not for the young (in fact, a luscious Zoé De Grand Maison turns in some of the hottest teen sex while clothed in a motion picture ever, proving that age old expression “gingers rule” once more) – nor the young-at-heart (buckets and buckets of Elvish blood) – but for those of us properly disillusioned?  It’s exactly the gift that keeps on giving.In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at RLJ Entertainment and Image Entertainment provided me with a DVD of A CHRISTMAS HORROR STORY (2015) by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SIMDMUQOHNRU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JA9TIG#wasThisHelpful","R1SIMDMUQOHNRU","AYG1U47VFZ165","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYG1U47VFZ165?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I’ve mentioned before, I don’t believe you’ll find anyone penning reviews these days who truly appreciates a quality listening experience more than I do.  I’ve been listening to music since the days of the early 1970’s, and I enjoyed a good decade or so gaining experience in amateur radio.  Those my time these days doesn’t allow for near as much listening as I used to do, I think I still possess ‘the ear’ to distinguish between low-quality and high-quality sessions, and it’s in the spirit that I try to approach each and every review I pen about headphones, Bluetooth speakers, and the like.For my tastes, this ThorX set from Sentey is phenomenal.  (Testing this morning was done via my desktop and my iPhone 4.)  They are very well made, built with track adjustments allow the top which allow for you to fit them to your particular preference over your ears.  The foam cushion is light enough so as not to cup your ears too firmly but solid enough to block out any ambient noise from distracting you from whatever it is your listening to.  The cable comes with AUX-style posts, one that plugs into the base of your ‘Left’ earpiece and another that jacks into your device.  Also, the cable has a microphone attachment that dangles a few inches away from your left side; it’s perfectly positioned to pick up your voice if you’re using the set to make and/or receive telephone calls, and there’s even a pushbutton in the housing which allows you to pause the music, make/take the call, and then return to the track right where you paused it.Kudos to Sentey for also including a soft plastic case for carrying and storing your headset while it’s waiting for your attention.  That’s definitely a nice addition from a caring manufacturer.Highest recommendation possible.  Nothing – and I mean NOTHING – replaces the euphoria of a quality listening experience, and these headphones from Sentey are truly exceptional.  Although they’re advertised as being something one can use while working out, I prefer vastly lighter and more compact sets when getting in my cardio.  But for good old-fashioned listening?  These are brilliant.In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Sentey provided me with sample testing product of their ThorX Headphones with Microphone by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TV9L0THJ8X1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LMX5AY#wasThisHelpful","R1TV9L0THJ8X1E","AYG1U47VFZ165","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYG1U47VFZ165?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I’ve mentioned in my reviews before, I spent a fair number of years broadcasting “back in the days” of fairly amateur AM radio.  That’s something to still be celebrated, especially in this age of the YouTube generation wherein everyone has their own show and web-based networks in development.  As such, I like to think I know a thing or two about how something sounds, and while I probably couldn’t spend any time debating decibel issues with some of the more technically accomplished I still maintain what I prefer to call “an ear for quality.”That said, I think this Desktop Condenser Microphone from Fifine is pretty spiffy for what it is.  The mike itself is either USB-port enabled OR AUX-style post depending upon your particular system requirements.  The microphone base is a bit thicker than other desktop models I’ve tried in the past, and the only downside to that is it may not work well with established microphone stands or extending arms you may already have in your possession.  There’s also a built-in echo feature that sounds OK but I didn’t hear it as anything all that special; there’s still no replacing high-end computer software that allows you to better augment voices for whatever projects you may be working on.  Still, the sound quality is good; I’d argue that it’s at least the caliber regular folks or gamers need in order to have a satisfactory experience.  Given the fact that it’s definitely modestly priced it might be worth the purchase if you’re looking for an addition.Kudos to Fifine as they’ve actually included a pretty nice (small) tripod-style stand and an accompanying windsock.Highly recommended.  It’s safe to say that this Desktop Microphone from Fifine not only looks good but performs as expected in the variety of basic consumer tests I walked it through this weekend.  Granted, it’s probably not going to produce the highest quality recordings imaginable – nothing would when you consider this price point – but it’s a far better mike than the cheapie low-end knock-offs which tend to come with desktop computer purchases these days.In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Fifine provided me with sample testing product of their Desktop Condenser Microphone by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IQMMHG6OAOQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014F7BO58#wasThisHelpful","R1IQMMHG6OAOQF","AYG1U47VFZ165","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYG1U47VFZ165?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my lifetime, I’ve used a variety of headlamps.  One of the most reliable ones I had the good fortune to operate was a variety that attached to the bill of a baseball cap; the only problem with it over time was that it tended to wear down the bill.  I’ve also used ones that serve as attachment to glasses as well as a few versions that clipped over the ear.  Still, the best I’ve owned have been the type that take the place of a cap over the head, very similar to the latest from Wolverine.Essentially, their soft straps slide over the skull much like a hat, and the wearer can adjust the tension so that it fits to whatever level of comfort is preferred.  (I tend to like mine relatively loose as anything too tight over time tends to give me a nagging headache.)  The straps do have enough give as well so that you can adjust it to whatever position you like on your head.  The light itself rests in a frame on the front (forehead) with the on-off switch located on top.  To their credit, Wolverine has built this one with three settings: there’s a bright, a soft, and a blinking light, though I’m not sure what use a blinking light would be on the head.  (My guess is that this is a safety feature wherein the user could have it serve as a warning light for others in the area.)  Wolverine’s also has a sliding case which allows the wearer to adjust the light cone for broader or narrower focus when dealing with whatever circumstances may require.The headlamp operates on 3 AAA batteries (not included), and you may be surprised at how much light you get out of so little charge.  This is a great item to have on hand for emergencies or the like, and I’m presently keeping mine in my hiking pack where it’s within arm’s reach should I require it.In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Wolverine provided me with sample testing product of their LED Headlamp (Red) by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R217WQXECUVLU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZSI8PQK#wasThisHelpful","R217WQXECUVLU2","AYG1U47VFZ165","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYG1U47VFZ165?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ah, I do so love my cabled earphones!  As I’ve mentioned before, I’m a huge fan of this old school technology (meaning ‘cabled’ instead of Bluetooth).  I’ve always believed that sound is richer with this tried-and-true tech, and that’s certainly no different with this pair from Dialon.  The set comes with the usual silicone sound-cancelling buds, allowing the user to focus in on just the music (or whatever else you’re hearing).  Also, the designers have included a switch that allows the user to make and/or receive telephone calls while making use of them; in fact, when you press it, it automatically stops the music.What really matters (so far as this user is concerned) in making a good decision with respect to earphones is how well the quality is, and Dialon’s is pretty solid.  I’ve tried listening to a variety of tracks at different levels just to see if I notice anything unusual or any dip in quality; I didn’t detect anything significant; occasionally, there was a bit of a crackle when I tested the phone feature (iPhone 4 tested), but as I don’t make use of this feature all that often I didn’t find it any real deal-breaker.In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Dialon provided me with sample testing product of their In-Ear Wired Sports Earbuds by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY8ASP1F4ZXGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0173BFKJE#wasThisHelpful","RY8ASP1F4ZXGH","AYG1U47VFZ165","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYG1U47VFZ165?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The health club I go to is a bit behind on updating their cardio equipment, so the stationery bikes and the treadmills are good though a little outdated.  The problem this poses for me as a consistent user is I don’t have any place wherein I can store my iPhone.  I’ve had to either keep it in my pocket or pouch – making it challenging to retrieve while I’m burning calories – OR position it “just so” on a handy little plastic magazine or book ledge provided by the machine.  I’ve noticed other folks have purchased these plastic grippers of their own that they use, but I’ve been slow to spend the extra money.Shineda has come out with a Multifunctional Mount that has been a bit of an answer to my prayers.  Their mount is two flexible clamps, one of which easily fastens to the handrail and one that grips the phone.  There’s a rotary dial between them which allows the user to turn the phone so that it’s in the desired position (if you’re watching video), and that’s a nice extra.  (I listen to music, and that makes it less important.)  For my take, the only downside to it is that the rail gripper could have greater tension: it works fine for keeping the phone in place on the bike but the constant thump-thump-thumping on the treadmill has proven greater than the clamp can withstand.  Basically, it slips around the bar slightly; though not a big deal to me, I’m wondering if – over time – the grip may become so loose that it slips off.  Time will tell.To my surprise, the grip on my iPhone is quite good.  At first glance, I honestly didn’t think it was going to hold; it seemed a bit big and, consequently, felt a bit loose to the touch.

"As I’ve mentioned in the past (long story), I’ve had to resort to using external batteries in order to have enough juice to get through the busy workday on my cellphone.  Over the past two years, I’ve had the good fortune to try several different models, and Aukey’s has proven themselves over and over again to produce some of the most reliable support products in the market; this 20000mAh External Battery is no exception.The more powerful the battery, the larger it tends to be, and this 20000mAh one is fairly big.  (For the record, though, it still isn’t much bigger than the average SmartPhone these days!)  The case is built with two separate USB ports (output) as well as an industry-standard Micro port (for charging) or the increasingly popular Apple Lightning (also for input).  Aukey has done like many of makers are doing and has included a handy little LED flashlight built into the housing, but for all of the bells and whistles available it really isn’t all that grand: it’s just a special extra for those who like that sort of thing.Also, Aukey utilizes LED technology in a series of indicator lights with the on-switch.  It glows white when the battery is at anywhere between 20%-100% charge capacity, but it’ll flash red when the device has dropped to less than 20%.  That’s a great warning for those who are paying attention so kudos for including it.Also, kudos to the people at Aukey for providing an actual User’s Manual along with their battery.  So many manufacturers these days have either dispensed with this little nicety OR they’ve shrunk the type so small as to be nearly illegible.  Granted, Aukey’s type is small but at least I can read it without having to reach for the magnifying glass, and it’s all put together handsomely and is easy-to-follow.In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Aukey provided me with sample testing product of their 20000mAh External Battery Charger by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U08MTP1J6QSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0176HQ1O8#wasThisHelpful","R2U08MTP1J6QSG","AYG1U47VFZ165","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYG1U47VFZ165?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In all seriousness, I have nothing but respect for technology that can interface with something which appears slightly outdated by today’s standards in order to prolong the life and usefulness of that earlier purchase.  Several manufacturers use to seek this comfortable middle ground but nowadays when cost containment becomes critical they’ve forgone serving consumer needs in favor of achieving cheaper production costs.  However, Etekcity and companies like them long ago realized that there was no reason to see this particular focus of their product lines drop off, and they’ve continued to impress with affordable yet practical solutions for those of us hoping to keep part of what we’ve already purchased while still bringing it into the modern technological era.For example, this Mini RoverBeats Bluetooth Receiver can be used with existing sound systems lacking any Bluetooth capable interface so long as there’s an old school style RCA jack with which to plug in.  I’ve had such a set-up in my kitchen for quite a few years now, and I was dreading having to pull the mounts and wires out of the walls so that I could update to something wireless; now I’m able to put that off a few more years by simply plugging this receiver into the system, jacking it into the speakers, and I’m ready for some tunes.I tested it out this morning for the past few hours.  (FYI: I used my iPhone 4 – also a bit older, as many will point out.)  The RoverBeats kit comes with everything one would need – the receiver and a variety of associated cables and cords for electricity and stereo hook-up – so I hooked everything in in only a few minutes, paired it up with my SmartPhone, and played music through a speaker system I thought was going on the scrap pile as obsolete.  Everything sounded brilliant, and I even (just for giggles) made a telephone call (with phone on speaker) just to see how well that audio came out, and it was terrific (though I’ll never do that again, most likely).As I said, the single greatest advantage to using this is that it prolongs what you already have (assuming it’s a generation or two behind-the-times like mine is) by giving you a contemporary access with Bluetooth tech.  That alone makes this worth the investment, giving you one more option as opposed to buying all new if you can’t afford it for now.

"Our household is not filled with big drinkers of – ahem – adult beverages, but what we do love to enjoy from time to time is the more-than-occasional cocktail.  We’ve always been a bit old school about it, simply pulling out a tall glass and pouring in a little bit of this along with a little bit of that, but now we’ll able to actually do it up in style with this Cocktail Shaker Set.  It includes four pieces – the shaker, the top, the cap, and the jigger – all of which are fashioned out of a very nice stainless steel.

"It’s pretty rare that I’m gobsmacked by a product.  To be fair, it usually isn’t the product alone that gobsmacks me; it’s the presentation.  It’s the bells and whistles that come with.  It’s the obvious interest in making the consumer experience not a good one but a great one.  This one gobsmacked me.My wife and I are avid hikers.  No, we’re not out climbing and sweating our lives away on the side of some treacherous mountain; but we love simply being out-and-about on a great walking trail – medium difficulty, at best – so that we can soak up the outdoors.  And the older we get the more we’ve had to rely on walking sticks to help alleviate the stress and eventually swelling of our knees (curse you, Father Time!).  We’ve tried out a handful of competing ones, but this one from H-Walking Poles gets our high marks for being the complete package.See, we don’t need to use the poles all of the time, but it’s nice to have them along with us in the event that a knee or ankle starts to tense up; and H-Walking Poles’ version comes with a carrying case.  It’s a canvas sling that contains the retracted stick that you can easily throw over your shoulder or as a cross-body bag, and you can leave it there until needed or even if it’s not.  As an added plus, the small bag also has a few Velcro pouches which allow you to carry a few items you might need while you’re out on the trail; and there’s even a webbed-style pouch for a water bottle.Now … THAT’s thinking.  Clearly, somebody at H-Walking Poles put some serious thought into what hikers need, and they went out and built THAT.  Instead of just giving you a pole that can go in your already full pack, these people built a pole that can go in a pack of its own AND gave you a little something extra for your money’s worth.  THAT’s innovation.  THAT’s useful.  THAT’s impressive.  Kudos to a company for being on top of their game.As for the pole?  It works like a charm.  It’s one of those telescoping varieties, so it extends to your exact height’s need, or it retracts for the next user.

"Now, this is going to be a little different reviews, folks: as I’ve nothing more than a bald head, I agreed that my lovely and gracious wife would use the Dry Shampoo and Conditioner and that I would do a touch’n’feel response for Luseta.  Basically, what we did was use it over a weekend (Saturday and Sunday) with the sole purpose of seeing how this ‘felt’ to both the user AND me.Application of the dry shampoo is a bit of a challenge (she thought) as it’s very much like applying hair spray; you have to be patient to get it evenly over a full head of hair (which she has), so be patient.  Once that’s done, you have to massage it in (I got my hands in there on this part, too, just to see how it all felt).  It’s a very light sheen feeling to it, but it’s pretty easy to see when you’ve got an equal distribution.  Then, you simply brush it out, though both of us thought this took a bit longer to do than either of us had expected.  (Only mentioning that because we figured it was relevant for those thinking they might be able to use this fast and on-the-go: might take a lot of practice for that to be the case.)As for the conditioner, that was really more of my wife’s ‘thing’ than it was mine as the user sprays it in and then basically styles the hair.  She thought that it seemed more like hairspray in this respect as if you get a bit too much conditioner on a patch of hair it works similarly, though with what she called a dull shine instead of bright.  Still, it was an easy process, and I didn’t notice (as the ‘feeler’) that the hair felt brittle the way that it can with some forms of hairspray; it had more of a subtle quality to it, though I’d agree with her that one area (where perhaps she oversprayed a bit) was a bit stiff and hard to manage.In the long run, I’m not convinced either of us were totally sold on the benefits of dry shampooing.  Don’t get me wrong: I think it’s definitely a convenience for some who are more concerned about keeping up appearances maybe on-the-weekend … but I’m not certain this is a Monday-thru-Friday workplace solution for some folks.

"I’ve mentioned before that due to circumstances well beyond my control my cellular life practically depends these days on keeping a portable battery charger on hand for when I’m out and about in my neighborhood; sadly, my cell provider doesn’t have as strong a signal presence as it should near my home, and my iPhone tends to run through the battery charge quicker than it should thanks to what seems to be afternoons of endless roaming.  In any event, I keep one of these puppies with me when I’m on-the-go, and this one from Lumsing gets my thumbs up.  (For the record, I have a handful of other related Lumsing products around the house that I’ve been using for well over a year, so I’m definitely a fan of their quality and craftsmanship.)As for the charger, their latest – the 10050 mAh portable charger – is about the size of a late 2000’s Smart Phone (still a plus as it can fit in one’s pocket), and it feels of excellent construction (very solid).  All of the ports are located on one end – the power input and two USB slot outputs – and there’s an on/off button easily built into the housing along its side.  The only other identifying characteristic I’d mention is that it’s a bit heavier than competing models I’ve had the chance to own or test, but that’s a small price to pay when you’re dealing in ounces and not pounds.Charging was a breeze: when I noticed my iPhone had dipped down to under 20%, I simply plugged it in (had my own cable in tow, as you’ll need to do for making use of this battery) and I was back to a full charge in about thirty minutes.As an extra added plus, Lumsing has cleverly put a flash-style bulb into the interface end; you can turn it on by holding down that power button (on the side), and now your battery becomes a flashlight.  It’s a ‘nice’ selling extra, but – to be perfectly honest – the flashlight isn’t all that illuminating: as I said, think of it as an ‘extra’ – nothing more, nothing less – but if Lumsing can get the next generation of this to have a more powerful beam then that might become a legitimate selling point.Still, it’s a great battery, and theirs is a great, reliable company.In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Lumsing provided me with sample testing product of their 10050 mAh Portable Charger by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MU3983M0IEA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011UIMZDU#wasThisHelpful","R1MU3983M0IEA1","AYG1U47VFZ165","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYG1U47VFZ165?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you’ve failed to notice, effective horror movies do several things very well.  They introduce characters the audience can either identify with, care about, or wish dead.  They develop an interesting universe in which a monster, ghost, killer, slayer, or something else exists with a requisite hunger to sate.  And they focus all of this in such a way as to keep an audience focused on what’s coming next, building the suspense for a big finish.Now, I’m not saying that SOME KIND OF HATE is such a film.  It’s more than a bit uneven at times – some of which are problems due to its low budget – but it also fleshed out a mildly interesting Moira as its chief villainess and bloody antagonist.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you’re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I’d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you’re accepting of a few modest hints at ‘things to come,’ then read on …)From the product packaging: “Relentless bullying has turned Lincoln’s life into a nightmare.  But soon he learns the true meaning of terror when he is sent to a remote school for trouble teens and the harassment starts all over again.  Only this time, someone is watching …”I’ve edited down the promotional blurbs because, mostly, I think it gives away more than it need to (certainly more than I would’ve), and I’ve left you with the nitty gritty.  Essentially what you have with a film like SOME KIND OF HATE is maybe one part originality with three parts derivatives: we’ve had horror films set at ‘remote schools’ before, and there’s even a major horror franchise that’s already marketed the whole ‘summer camp’ scene (of which HATE at times looks more than similar to) … so I’m not at all convinced writer/director Adam Egypt Mortimer has enough material here to stand entirely on its own.  As is often the case with first films in a potentially developing franchise, “only time will tell.”What he does have is Moira, a vengeful spirit from beyond the grave who only comes out to play (or is that ‘slay’?) when called from the other side.  Once summoned, she’ll use all of her ghostly feminine wiles to deliver her own brand of justice, one based entirely on the fact that even she took her life as a result of bullying by her supposedly good and pure school counselors.  Like any good horror flick worth its weight in blood, HATE works best when everyone involved plays second fiddle to Moira’s gruesome pursuits, but I’m not sure the script (from Mortimer and Brian DeLeeuw) really spent enough time developing the other warm bodies to the point where any of us in the audience would truly miss ‘em when they’re gone.Lacking that connection, HATE ends up being more ‘slash’ than ‘splash,’ and better production qualities – along with another draft – would probably have been required to elevate this to the level of wanting more.  As it stands, there’s nothing wrong with it … but I suspect you’ll forget most of the particulars with the exception of cunning little Moira after all is said and done.SOME KIND OF HATE (2015) is produced by Caliber Media, Destroy All Entertainment, and Revek Entertainment.  DVD distribution is being handled by the reliable RLJ Entertainment and Image Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications?  Meh.  It’s reasonably well shot, but I had some issues with the sound work (as I had to crank it up quite a ways to clearly hear all dialogue).  For those needing it, the packaging indicates that close captioning is available.  Lastly, if you’re looking for special features, then get set for some deleted scenes and not one but two commentary tracks for your enjoyment.(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED at best.  Here’s the thing: unlike many, many other horror releases I’ve watched, SOME KIND OF HATE isn’t without its merits.  Granted, they are few and far between, but it’s also pretty obvious someone put a modest measure of thought into the idea behind what makes for a successful franchise and then tried to start one.  While this may not be the last we’ve seen of Moira, I’m not exactly clamoring for a follow-up either.In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at RLJ Entertainment and Image Entertainment provided me with a DVD copy of SOME KIND OF HATE by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29CKLK3420GBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01489LAPM#wasThisHelpful","R29CKLK3420GBL","AYG1U47VFZ165","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYG1U47VFZ165?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For what it’s worth, I’m certainly experienced probably a bit more than the average person in confronting wrist and thumb pain issues.  Both of my thumbs have a curious ‘double-jointing’ issue that have caused some trouble.  My family (mom’s side) has a history of arthritis.  Also, a few years back, the place I worked decided to ‘right size’ my cubicle, and that sad sorry attempt brought me an unwelcome bought of carpal tunnel syndrome for an extended period of time.  Mostly, my condition is much better today, but it occasionally flares up, and that’s why I’ll use a wrap while I sleep overnight to help alleviate some pain from unneeded movement.Aegend’s Breathable Wrist Wrap is a bit of a step down in terms of what I’m used to, but – in some regards – that’s not a bad thing.  The one I own and have used for years is much more heavy duty in terms of materials and construction, the downside of which is that occasionally it feels heavier on my wrist than what I’d prefer.  Also, it gets to feeling warm and muggy during the warmer months of the year, and that’s probably when I’ll be reaching for Aegend’s version as an alternative.  As it’s advertised, it’s much more “breathable” – lighter fabric, etc. – and that’s really its biggest advantage.I know and have worked with plenty of folks who use a wrap of this sort while they’re on the computer, but (thankfully) I’ve never had to.  I have tried Aegend’s at my home PC station, and I can say that it definitely helps in maintaining one’s wrist in the proper position to help minimize some of a busy day’s works’ associated aches and pains; however, I’ve always found wearing one while working a bit too restrictive.  Still, because it’s lighter than my other, I’d be inclined to give this one a go should my symptoms point me in that direction.The only real drawback is (hate to admit it) I’m never all that good with Velcro.  I’ve had to reposition it a few times with the first few uses, mostly because of my own personal inefficiencies, but it is what it is.  It certainly complies with all of its advertised traits; as to how well it is long-term, I’ll have to continue testing and update here as needed.Also (thought it worth a mention), this is probably a great lightweight to use IF you’re a business person who travels.  It rolls up like a pair of socks, so it’s easy to stow it a backpack, briefcase, or toiletry pouch.  Kudos on that.RECOMMENDED.  It’s a good wrap though a bit difficult to get positioned perfectly the first few times, though I suspect repeated use will iron those issues out quite nicely.In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Aegend provided me with sample testing product of their Breathable Wrist Brace by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XLUMB8FUMNIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016CZ2U6S#wasThisHelpful","R1XLUMB8FUMNIC","AYG1U47VFZ165","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYG1U47VFZ165?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Truth be told: I fell in love with Lucy Griffiths back in the days of her appearances aboard the BBC’s occasionally campy Robin Hood (2006-2009).  A few years later, she turned up aboard HBO’s True Blood, though her character – Nora Gainsborough – was sadly relegated to second-tier status, essentially a supporting player to Alexander Skarsgård’s Eric Northman.  Today, I was delighted to discover her as one of the leads aboard 2015’s UNCANNY, a clever and thought-provoking SciFi potboiler that deserves to find an audience as big as its ideas.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you’re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I’d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you’re accepting of a few modest hints at ‘things to come,’ then read on …)From the product packaging: “For ten years, inventor David Kressen has lived in seclusion with his inventions, including Adam, a robot with incredible lifelike human qualities.  When reporter Joy Andrews is given access to their unconventional facility, she is alternately repelled and attracted to the scientist and his creation.  But as Adam exhibits emergent behavior of anger and jealousy towards her, she finds herself increasingly entangled in a web of deception where no one’s motives are easily decipherable.”Amazon review readers are quick to lambast me for taking more than a few words to tell you what I thought of a new release, so I’ll try to keep it as simple and sweet as possible, trying that in with my affection for the simple and sweet Lucy Griffiths.  She’s at times subtle, at times luminescent in this star-crossed triangle where woman meets man and machine.  In ways, it’s a mildly predictable tale – anytime testosterone edges out the estrogen there’s bound to be a conflict – but it’s still nonetheless ably delivered and smartly performed by Griffiths and her co-stars, Mark Webber and David Clayton Rogers.Granted, this is the kind of film that nerds, geeks, and general SciFi enthusiasts will have a blast with (with, as a said, some reservations for its more ‘soapy’ elements); but it’s also the type of feature which might win the genre some crossover appeal: Griffiths and her suitors are all lookers, and UNCANNY might just turn out to be one of those unheard-of releases that finds itself the recipient of solid word-of-mouth.UNCANNY (2015) is produced by Accelerated Matter, Shoreline Entertainment, Emergent Behavior, Ambush Entertainment, and Uncanny.  DVD distribution is being handled by the reliable RLJ Entertainment and Image Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications?  Director Matthew Leutwyler does an impressive job sighting and sounding the picture, though some of the close-ups seemed a wee bit too high (or too low) and the flick is adorned with those God awful JJ Abrams’ lens flares far too often.  Packaging states that there is closed captioned for the Hearing-Impaired (though there was no specific subtitling track that I could find).  Lastly, if you’re looking for special features, then you have about 10 minutes of deleted scenes (nothing all that grand, so far as I found).HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  I’m a SciFi junkie, and that means there are parts of UNCANNY that I just couldn’t get enough of – the classic misdirect, the nuanced discussions of artificial intelligence, etc.  Granted, I could’ve done without the JJ Abrams’ lens flare effects constantly peppering the screen and some of the more obvious potboiler elements could’ve been dialed back just a bit … but – in the end – I’m still left with a smart, excellently conceived, and well performed cautionary tale about what’s likely going on psychologically behind-the-scenes in the whole man-versus-machine smackdown.In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Image Entertainment and RLJ Entertainment provided me with a DVD of UNCANNY by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AQU5DBRQR89H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HS2A5E#wasThisHelpful","R2AQU5DBRQR89H","AYG1U47VFZ165","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYG1U47VFZ165?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Me, I don’t drink coffee myself, but I have been known to partake of some hot (or cold) tea from time to time, so I was definitely willing to give this particular item a try. It’s an extremely smart-looking and well-made mug; the top screws off easily, revealing an excellently designed ‘pour’ piece that’s crafted to minimize the chances for spilling. Simply pop that off (it has its own seal embedded in the ring, so be careful when putting it back on to get it completely down as I noticed that mine ‘hangs’ a bit, requiring a firm pressing) and fill with your favorite flavor. This model comes with a certificate of authenticity, the company’s guarantee, and a spiffy little owner’s manual with directions and suggestions for extending the life and effectiveness of your exceptional travel mug.As to its ability to keep hot things hot and cold things cold? Well, I tried it with some iced tea while working around the house, and I’m pleased to say that it kept mine reasonably chilled for a few hours, though it’s pretty easy to notice a bit of a fade off after that. Still, that’s a minor price-to-pay for being able to keep it cold WITHOUT ice (I actually don’t like ice IN my tea, so there’s that), and I’m perfectly happy with it.In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Urbane O2 provided me with sample testing product of their 17 ounce vacuum mug by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JD29CWKIGEAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014G63YUG#wasThisHelpful","R3JD29CWKIGEAF","AYG1U47VFZ165","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYG1U47VFZ165?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the household’s resident cook these days, I make use of practically everything I can in the kitchen to get the job done … and – as a man – there’s nothing I appreciate more than a set of sharp knives.  (Pfft: call me old-fashioned!)  I’ll cut, chop, and dice anything until either it’s ready for the stove OR my heart’s content, and that means I always need something ready in the drawer when I’m in the mood to create dinner.This 3-Piece Knife Set from Livin’ Well is pretty spiffy.  You get 3 blades – a paring knife, a Santoku one, and a general purpose one (with a serrated edge) – so you’re really prepared for practically anything you might need to accomplish.  Each comes with its own storing sheath (that way you can keep in the drawer in full confidence you won’t cut yourself when reaching for it), and just exercise an amount of care when taking it out or placing it back in the groove.  Also, there’s a soft grip material built into the handle of the two larger knives which serves to give you a better hold on them when using them in meal preparation.  (The paring knife – for some reason – doesn’t have the same material and is a routing plastic mold.)  Excellent set, especially if you’re just starting out in the kitchen and needing something to get the job done.In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Livin’ Well provided me with sample testing product of their Pure Komachi HD 3pc Knife Set by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z6PZJ8TGJDVR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016N6YVFE#wasThisHelpful","R2Z6PZJ8TGJDVR","AYG1U47VFZ165","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYG1U47VFZ165?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I’ve mentioned before, I’m still relatively new to this whole world of oils and aromas.  My wife has been a user of them (pretty religiously) for a few years now, but I honestly put it off thinking it was little more than some ‘quackery’ on those looking to make a quick buck.  I have to say that – for the most part – I’ve been proven wrong as I have found several different products to work quite well in what they’ve been advertised for … and I’ve even found one that helps provide a wonderfully relaxing ‘aura’ to our family room while we enjoy TV in the evening (used in a diffuser).My family has a history of developing mild arthritis in the joints of our hands (mostly), and – within the last few years as I’ve grown older – I’ve noticed more than a bit of the symptoms starting to plague me as well.  The greatest personal downside to this is that I spend a good portion of my day slaving over a hot keyboard, so anything (and I do mean ANYTHING) I can do to alleviate even a small amount of the discomfort actually goes a long way.  I received a bottle of Prime Natural’s Muscle Relief Blend last week, and I’ve been using it (daily) ever since.Immediately upon applying it to the skin, I do feel what I’d call a very mild ‘warming’ sensation, not unlike what one experiences with menthol-type salves or medicated rubs.  After a while (about an hour), the effect seems to dissipate fairly quickly, which usually encourages me to try another application.  To my benefit, I have noticed a mild decrease in pain … and, wow, if I take a quick sniff of the area boy does it open my sinuses!  (A secondary plus!)  I suspect I’ll have to experiment a bit more with the amount I apply in order to see if I can a longer positive effect but for now I’m perfectly happy using it situationally to help ease my ol’ bones through another day on the keys.Recommended.  I’ve only been using this for about a week now, but I’ve found that I honestly achieve a bit of what I’d call ‘short term relief’ from the mild arthritis in my left knuckles with this Muscle Relief Blend.  I’m interested in seeing what the long-term potential could be; though I suspect it won’t be the ultimate cure-all, I’m certainly hoping it’ll continue to help me get through the day when I need a bit of extra help with the pain.In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Prime Natural provided me with sample testing product of their Muscle Relief Blend by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34MZ62LUKEYHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01557P2CI#wasThisHelpful","R34MZ62LUKEYHH","AYG1U47VFZ165","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYG1U47VFZ165?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Confession time: I’m not a big user of oils of any type.  Now, I don’t mean that to imply that I’ve no experience in reviewing them; rather, it’s just that my list of reasons for using them tends to be fairly limited.  Generally speaking, I only tend to use them seasonally (like so many I get terrible itching and flaking skin on my shins during the chillier seasons of the year) OR whenever my skin may be feeling particularly abrasive as a result of too much time in the sun.  Although my needs may not match most, I’d still argue I’m more than aware of what it is I’m looking for in such a product, and this Olive and Jojoba Body Oil is really close to the thing.As a guy, I’m prone to definitely rub a bit of this onto my legs and forearms during the cooler season, and it definitely helps keep skin in good condition so that it isn’t cracking and/or peeling from the cold.  Also, body oil of this type tends to work some soft wonders on my whiskers; they tend to also get a bit brittle seasonally, and I’ve found I can rub a bit of oil (or even shampoo conditioner) in at bedtime (which washes out in the morning shower); this helps keep the hair vibrant soft (which my wife appreciates!) and also helps the skin underneath.  (Ladies do the same on their heads of hair, from what I’ve been told.)  That’s the kind of trick I wish someone had shared with me earlier in my life, and I could’ve benefitted more from it.  However, don’t apply too much as it can do a number on your pores (at least, that’s my experience).The only drawback so far as I’m concerned is that this does leave a very mild fragrance on my person.  I’m never a big fan of that; I prefer to be more of an odor-neutral guy, if there is such a thing.  I don’t mind a little bit of a clean odor, and thankfully this one does stop well short of seeming like a perfume.  Again, this could be because my nose tends to be fairly sensitive to certain smells.In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Luseta Beauty provided me with sample testing product of their Olive and Jojoba Body Oil by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R152P7SD9FHDHR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144S0JJU#wasThisHelpful","R152P7SD9FHDHR","AYG1U47VFZ165","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYG1U47VFZ165?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"True story: I actually have had and used a competitor’s version of this sort of backseat covering for several years, but now I’ll be throwing that one out and making use of this one instead.  Why?  That’s because the BarksBar version is superior in that it affixes both to the back seats AND the front seats.  The version I’ve used before didn’t connect to the front, and difficulty that has also posed is my little guy loves to prop himself up on the middle console between the seats, making it occasionally difficult for me to safely drive the car (he’s always ‘nosing’ me for attention).Otherwise, the basic trick to operating this seat cover safely is to essentially make certain you clearly get it affixed both front and back so that it isn’t sliding down, creating something for the knuckleheaded beast to either play with OR decide he can slip around.  I’ve done that before, and it gets really inconvenient when you have to pull over and make adjustments.Also, the big plus with this version (as compared to the other I’ve used) is that it feels a bit more heavyweight; stains wipe up very easily but it isn’t so heavy that I’d be fearful of pitching it into the washing machine from time-to-time in order to really get it clean.  Some of these tend to feel more ‘foamy’ that actual material, but that’s not the case here: excellent quality construction makes this a superior choice for those of us who do travel with our canine children in tow.Also – because this is more durable material than I’ve seen used in the past – I’ll be far more inclined to keep this thing IN my vehicle for the duration as opposed to taking it out, folding it up, and storing it away.  Instead, I’ll probably unhook the back seat straps and allow this to simply drape on the floor (in the back) where it’ll be ready for me to install for that quick trip to either the pet store or the bark park.  Kudos on making it durable!Highly recommended.In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at BarksBar provided me with sample testing product of their Pet Car Seat Cover by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OE1ANYW1T91Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013VPZTAQ#wasThisHelpful","R1OE1ANYW1T91Q","AYG1U47VFZ165","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYG1U47VFZ165?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every now and then, I (as a reviewer) am offered a product that doesn’t fit with my particular life needs but can definitely be of use in my household; and such was the case with this Luseta Argan Oil Hair Mask.  In short, I don’t have nearly enough hair on my head to make use of it, but my wife definitely does: she agreed to give this a go and share her results with me so that I could provide some feedback.She maintains what I’d christen as a pretty full head of hair.  As a business professional, she’s in front of people all day long, so it’s important that she provide a solid impression.  She’s used this mask twice now, and she’s only had good things to say about it.  As hair products go, she tends to prefer ones that don’t offer any overpowering odor (she tends to find that annoying and/or distracting); while Luseta’s definitely is noticeable, she found it relatively light by comparison to other products she’s used in the past.  I noticed that it does have a floral scent, but I agree with her: it isn’t ‘bold’ in the way many over-the-counter shampoos, conditioners, and the like can be.  In many ways, I’d liken it to an after-effect – light and airy – with just a hint of fruit.But she insists the effect on her hair is definitely pronounced.  She insists that there’s a mild tingling sensation with the application.  After leaving in for a few minutes, she’s surprised how easily it washes out, and afterward she says that her hair feels very soft and silky to the touch.  I’ve checked it out in the evenings, and it definitely retains what I’d call a ‘fresh look,’ though I’m not sure how that directly translates to other folks’ experience with it.Also, she’s told me that she finds her hair easier to style for a few days with those effects pretty much wearing off my week’s end.  As this is a once-a-week application, she’s definitely ready for next Monday to come quicker than it does.In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Komar Beauty provided me with sample testing product of their Luseta Argan Oil Deep Repair & Moisture Hair Mask 8.5oz by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1US6G171X3F2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144S0J0O#wasThisHelpful","R1US6G171X3F2P","AYG1U47VFZ165","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYG1U47VFZ165?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a houseful of animals.  At present, we’re blessed to have one dog and nine (you read that right) cats.  Like many houses with that many little monsters, we didn’t start out that way intending to have as much as we do, but it is what it is.  And – as pet lovers – we’ve made several small investments over the years in beds, blankets, and whatnot to give the creatures more than a fair share of comforts, so we’re proud to consider them our experts when it comes to what works and what doesn’t for their needs.The Blueberry Pet Bed honestly wasn’t of much interest to our sole pooch.  He tried it – stepped around on it a few times, mostly, before lying down in it – but we could tell right away it just wasn’t for him.  Now that doesn’t mean that your canine won’t like it: ours has always been a bit dismissive of mats and mattresses, and he tends to prefer to hop up on the couch and snuggle with us when we’re in the family room during the evening hours.  At best, he’ll begrudgingly stretch out on an area rug from time-to-time.As for our cats?  They’re totally in love with it.In particular, our oldest (Ashley) will practically not abandon it except for meal times.  Since I took it out of the box and plastic, she’s pretty much parked herself in it daily for good measure, allowing the others to check it out only briefly before once again assuming the roost as the oldest cats are wont to do.  She’s always loved baskets, and I suspect this particular bed captures some of the same aura as the high, plush walls do surround her as she’s curled up in there wasting away the day.  Two of our youngest cats have ventured into the bed when it’s been available, and both enjoyed it briefly but they were more inclined to drape themselves over those subtle walls with their hindquarters resting within.It’s definitely a well-made bed.  There’s obviously just the right amount of cushion for Ashley, and I suspect you’ll probably have a like-minded feline in your house who’ll be smitten with this as she has been.

"In all seriousness, I love a good psychological thriller as much as the next viewer.  Tales of borderline dementia or the pursuits of those potentially suffering one can be an excellent way to vicariously experience events from a somewhat jaundiced perspective, but – if I’m also being perfectly honest – it can be a fine line between legitimately exploring some psychosis AND distinguishing between a director, a screenwriter, and a cast’s cinematic trickery.  More often than not, visual storytellers take the easy way out, opting for chills instead of bold originality.In short, methinks that’s exactly what plagues AMNESIAC.  At no time did it seem all that original.  At no time did it feel all that compelling.  Instead, the film delivers up easy pickings with little more than a clever twist here or there … but not one intelligent enough in its big finish to make you believe it’s worth a second thought (or viewing).(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you’re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I’d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you’re accepting of a few modest hints at ‘things to come,’ then read on …)From the product packaging: “Kate Bosworth and Wes Bentley star in this twisted psycho-thriller about a man who wakes up in bed after an accident, suffering from memory loss.  He begins to suspect his wife isn’t really his real wife and soon finds himself a prisoner in the house.”There used to be an old canard about promoting a flick that went something like this: “If all you can boast about are your big name actors, then you’ve really nothing to boast about at all.”  See, the dirty little secret of filmmaking is that there’s so often not enough originality in it, which is why after DIE HARD studios starting searching for ‘Die Hard On A Train’ and ‘Die Hard On A Train’ and so on.  The same affliction strikes casting-types when another trending-setting feature film – say 1990’s MISERY – kinda/sorta stumbled through James Caan’s acting prowess; you could almost hear them say, “How much better would this have been had it headlined Jeff Bridges?”Essentially, that’s much of the impression left from AMNESIAC: you end up with a man (Bentley) being trapped, tortured, and tormented by a curiously low-key Bosworth (constantly attired like a MAD MEN castaway), and no doubt everyone involved predicted they were somehow chasing cinema gold.  Don’t get me wrong: the story isn’t exactly the same, and what transpires certainly involves a few more twists and turns … but the film lacks a freshness – much like Bentley’s flawed memories – that this story just can’t quite overcome.The script by Mike Le and Amy Kolquist never quite tells you where these people come from, or perhaps it’s more apropos to say it never tells you enough to care about them or the plight they suffer.  Instead, director Michael Polish left out any polish that would allow anyone to rise to the level of “interesting,” and you’ll likely ask more questions about this, that, and the other when everyone involved thought you’d be captivated.AMNESIAC (2015) is produced by XLRator Media, Infra-Red Pictures, and Jeff Rice Films.  DVD distribution is being handled via the reliable XLRator Media.  As for the technical specifications?  Meh.  At times, AMNESIAC uses some interesting cinematography to transport the audiences into this otherworldly environment (director Michael Polish seems to have wanted to pull signature elements from out of time so as to keep everyone guessing what’s up), but it isn’t as effective a device as I’ve seen used in other films; also, Bosworth and Bentley spend far too much time speaking in hushed tones to always be perfectly audible.  Lastly, if you’re looking for special features?  Well, I hope you find a theatrical trailer ‘special.’  (Note: no closed captioning OR English-assisted subtitles that I could find.)(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  AMNESIAC feels more like the bloated episode of an old TV anthology series than it does an original motion picture that can stand on its own two legs.  Still, it wasn’t a bad way to spend less-than-ninety minutes, but – in the end – it raised more questions (via plot holes and circular logic) than it ever answered … and don’t audiences deserve smarter thrillers than this these days?In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at XLRator Media provided me with a copy of AMNESIAC by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26M2GPUI81YTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XZF385Q#wasThisHelpful","R26M2GPUI81YTB","AYG1U47VFZ165","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYG1U47VFZ165?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The American Southwest can be brutal on Smart Devices.  Oh, I’m not just talking about the sun and the heat (and, yes, it’s a dry heat); rather I’m talking about the fact that in certain pockets of our rugged terrain cell towers can be few and far between.  For that very reason, many of us in this ‘other land down under’ have to make regular use of batteries and car chargers in order to have enough juice to get a job done right, and that’s precisely why it’s easy to give these a solid thumbs up.HAWEEL’s latest version is a two-port 3.4 Amp charger, the kind that convenient hooks into your automobile’s cigarette lighter or similar power port.  The face is conveniently marked with which slot the manufacturer intended to be used for Smart phones and iPads or tablets.  (A reasonable plus, but nothing all that special.)  And this particular model is outfitted with an adjustable swing that allows you to point the charger in a specific direction, a tremendous advantage over competitors’ models that simply go straight and occasionally don’t give you enough space to easily plug a cable into the port as some auto interiors have taken to placing this lighter in really obscure locations.However, what may appeal to those of us in the Southwest in particular is the fact that this charger is equipped with an LED screen that shows the car’s battery voltage.  There’s even an alarm built into the device that sounds if the voltage falls or rises out of the optimum range.  This can be a huge advantage over other models as you do NOT want to find yourself stranded out in the boondocks in the middle of that ‘dry heat’ with not enough power in your battery to get back home.  That, my friends, is perhaps the best selling point to this version.Highly recommended.  Seriously, you probably won’t find a bigger fan of secondary power sources than me on the World Wide Web these days, and that’s largely because I’m unfortunately shackled to a low-cost cellular/wireless provider whose coverage in my living area leads a lot to be desired; consequently, I’m almost daily forced to make use of such products as external batteries and these USB car chargers in order to get enough juice to do my job.

"As I’ve mentioned many times, I don’t travel as much for business as I used to.  Nowadays, I’m fortunate enough to have to get around more for personal and/or family occasions.  But when I do travel, I’ve always preferred making the best use of the kind of satchels and bags that give me more than a single option AND provide protection to my belongings; I’ve had more than my fair share of knicks, dings, and bangs that anyone should have to experience in a single lifetime, so I tend to shield my PC and SmartDevices with better-than-average protection against damage from others, not so much my own clumsiness.Ecosusi’s Laptop Bag is exactly the kind of pack I’m talking about.  For starters, it’s constructed out of a relatively lightweight polyester ‘canvas’ style material which means that it generally resists stains and scuffing but also cleans up easily if marked.  Essentially, it’s built to resemble the standard run-of-the-mill black briefcase (the traditional office worker ‘look’), but it’s also smartly adapted to go on your back as a rear zippered compartment conceals lightly padded back-straps should you with to make use of them.  (Big plus: when you’re not making use, then you can still use that space to store items such as magazines, books, etc. as the compartment does offer modest protection.)  Want another option?  It even comes with the basic shoulder sling so that you can carry it ‘purse-style’ should you choose.There are two interior areas, both with a good amount of padding to protect ones delicate electronics.  The PC pouch measures 16 inches long, and there’s even an additional Velcro sleeve to hold your laptop in place once secured within; and the other pouch offers a variety of smaller areas to secure practically anything else you’d want to take with.  The front exterior includes one open sleeve (shaped about the size of those oversized paperbacks as well as two zippered ones perfect for items such as cell phones, wallets, passports, etc.Really, this is a terrific travel bag.  Even if you don’t have a PC and you want to take a large tablet or the like, it’s exceptional.Highly recommended.  While some may think Ecosusi’s 3-Ways Travel Laptop Bag might not be the ‘best first impression’ to make around the office, I’d argue that it’s definitely what casual and business travels could use when toting a PC with when on-the-road for business or pleasure.  It has an ample assortment of pockets with which to help you keep organized; it has the added flexibility of being carried by hand or over the shoulders; and it’s constructed in such a way as to insure one’s prized possession isn’t being ‘roughed up’ while on-the-go.

"True dat: I’ve been listening to music for well over four decades.  Having even worked in amateur radio for a short time, I’ve always been a big fan of mainstream music, and I swear by proven technology every chance I get.  These cable headphones from SoundPEATS are exactly the kind of thing I love; they produce a wonderfully sharp listening experience, and the fact that this particular version is outfitted with a modest noise-cancelling technology only makes it easier to give them my ringing endorsement.Because this is the modern era when some users want to enjoy their tracks as well as use their Smart Phone in conjunction with making and receiving telephone calls, the manufacturer has outfitted these with a small microphone built into a small ‘nub’ that hangs fairly close to where your mouth is.

"These days, there are a handful of products I swear by, and one of the greatest are external battery packs.  As I’ve relayed several times, I live and commute throughout the American Southwest, sometimes in territories where cell towers can be few and far between and my phone tends to burn through power as it roams for signal.  Consequently, I rarely go anywhere without a handful of chargers and batteries in tow, and I’ve had very good luck with several different brands.  Aukey’s is one of them.The battery is relatively thin but still puts out a great charge when I’m in need, and the fact that this model is equipped with twin USB ports – meaning I can get juice to not only my Smart Phone but a second device as well – is a huge plus.  Granted, I don’t use it as much as I might a car charger, but having a backup power source is essential: Aukey’s 12000mAh has proven to be fast and reliable up to this point, so it’s pretty easy to give this handle little device a thumbs up.In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Aukey provided me with sample testing product of their 12000mAh Portable Power Bank Charger External Battery Pack by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WVUI3NT9A63D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSY1AJU#wasThisHelpful","R2WVUI3NT9A63D","AYG1U47VFZ165","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYG1U47VFZ165?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few years back, I developed some issues with my knee, and doctors eventually discovered that I had a relatively minor tear in my meniscus.  Anyway who’s suffered such an injury can probably assure you that even a minor tear can bring with it some pretty major discomfort, so eventually it was something that had to be mended by surgery.  Recovery was a bit slow, but one of the things the surgeon assured me is that my knee would never be in the shape it was before the tear, though there wouldn’t be that much cause to ‘change’ my lifestyle to something less mobile.In any event, what I’ve learned is that – from time to time – the knee still needs a bit of ‘babying’ in order to get through things like extended hiking and the sort, and I’ve had to try a variety of products to carry me through some of the newfound aches and pain, and support sleeves like this one from FireFit are terrific for that very reason.  They certainly help reduce fatigue, and they can even help to reduce some of the modest swelling that tends to follow some of my more extreme hiking excursions.  FireFit’s is a bit thicker than what I’m used to wearing (in fact, I found it a bit difficult to have on under clothing, though it’s definitely possible), but it’s certainly soft and supportive in the way I’ve grown accustomed.Now, even though I’m not a medical expert of any estimation, I can say that my experiences have made me aware of what works best for my tired knees; in that respect I think this is definitely a good sleeve best used in conjunction with other ongoing care programs.  While I’ll admit it’s not the favorite of ones I’ve used, I can say that it works very well as intended.  Overall, sleeves used in concert with oils and salves that help reduce pain are great tools for those of us who need them; this one’s just a bit bulky compared to what I prefer.Highly recommended.In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at FireFit provided me with sample testing product of their Knee Support Sleeve by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NX7OJ2XWPX7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QG6NNOW#wasThisHelpful","R1NX7OJ2XWPX7H","AYG1U47VFZ165","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYG1U47VFZ165?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in the days of my wild youth, you had to have a cabled set of earphones in order to enjoy music privately, so maybe there’s a little something that’s somehow written into my DNA which makes me believe tunes sound better via your grandfather’s technology.  Still, when I’ve had folks over and had them compare, they all tend to think the sound is a bit purer as well, so maybe it’s not just me after all.In any event, today I’m listening to what’s up and coming on my iPhone (4) compliments of this set of earphones from MAXROCK, and I’m totally digging them.  The ear pieces fit into my ear canal very nice, and they use that usually noise-cancelling tech which blocks out the greater world outside so that all I have is the music and me.  Fantastic.Also – for those of you who can’t go five minutes without receiving or making a telephone call – MAXROCK has provided the tech, as well: there’s a handle little contraption built into one of the cords leading up to the bud that allows you to stop the music and make a call on your SmartPhone.  I rarely (if ever) use those little gadgets, but I did give it a go for the purposes of testing this item, and it worked just fine.  (But I’ll probably never use it again.)Highest recommendation possible.  I’m a huge fan of the old school, so you’ll always find me using a tried-and-true set of earbuds with the cable before I resort to my Bluetooth ones.  It isn’t that I dislike the wireless stuff; it’s more likely a psychological thing – that I think the music sounds better via the cables – and I’ll stand by that ‘til I’m finished.In the interests of fairness, I’m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MAXROCK provided me with sample testing product of their Slim Flat Cable 3.5mm Metal Headphones with Mic and Remote Control by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20QS5PIZ52K5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGK8AS6#wasThisHelpful","R20QS5PIZ52K5L","AYG1U47VFZ165","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYG1U47VFZ165?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's so nice to find an Avengers item with the full team! Not only am I ecstatic that it features Black Widow, who is rarely on anything, but also Hawkeye!  Though this is an Age of Ultron lunch bag, it doesn't feature any of the new characters.The bag itself is very nice, with a long strap that can go over a child's or adult's shoulder (I'm 39 and I regret nothing).  The bag is soft, brightly colored and of good quality.  Yes, it costs more than a similar item in Wal Mart or Target - but I prefer not braving crowds and having it delivered to my door. That is worth a premium.  Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase. Highly recommended for any Marvel or Avengers fan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TK84ZKKD1ZJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTI4534#wasThisHelpful","R3TK84ZKKD1ZJJ","ACEA95FQS1AVP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEA95FQS1AVP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had high hopes for Original Sin, especially after the non-event collection of issues that was Inhumanity.  And while it was definitely a better, more cohesive story, it didn't live up to the hype. Mainly because the ""wow"" stuff doesn't happen here.The main plot of Original Sin is a murder mystery to determine who robbed and killed Uatu, The Watcher.  All the excitement of Captain America learning what the Illuminati did to him, of Iron Man maybe being connected to Bruce Banner's accident, etc. - none of that is explored here.  When Cap learns of the death, he takes Nick Fury and few others to the moon to investigate.  Nick subsequently sends a few different groups tracking down leads, including who took the Watcher's eyes and much of his arsenal.  I actually liked the story a lot. It gives a deeper look into Fury's life, with some unexpected revelations. And, when one of the Watcher's eyes goes off like a bomb, people suddenly learn secrets, and not always about themselves.  However, as a Marvel event, it's not that impressive (like Civil War, even without tie-ins that was EPIC!)  To truly get to the consequences, readers will have to go to the individual series (or the Original Sin Companion, as I intend to).In addition to Original Sin #0-8, this collection also includes ""Original Sins #1-5."" I found these to be mostly a waste of time, with a couple stand outs.  The artwork is generally poor, and in a couple instances downright hideous.  Included are:1) ""Hidden in Plain Sight"" a Young Avengers story about a confrontation with Red Hood. Boring.2) ""Terminus"" a Deathlok story about him killing some poor sap who knows who he is thanks to the eyeball explosion. Over quick, and forgotten as quickly.3) ""Buried Memory"" about Black Bolt's dog searching for a lost dog bone. I KID YOU NOT.4)""Black Knight in Black Legacy"" about a writer who learns Black Knight isn't immune to the curse after all. This was almost enough to interest me in the character. Almost.5) ""Before Your Eyes"" two pages of Howard the Duck. Meh.6) ""Whispers of War"" This story was actually worth the read. Lineage has the souls of his ancestors inside him, ready to tell him secrets. A new arrival has some interesting news about Black Bolt.  I foresee consequences for this story.7) ""Bury the Lead"" J Jonah Jameson once wrote a positive story about Spidey. Another quickie over in 2 pages.8) ""Checkmate"" was the best story of the lot BY FAR and made the inclusion of the entire Original Sins worth it.  Some nobody has learned a secret about Doctor Doom. And he's foolish enough to consider blackmailing the villain.  Perfection in every way: the art, the writing, the ending.9) ""Catharsis"" Marvel should have to refund me some money for these two pages.  Any artist who manages to make Captain America look like Pete the villain from a Mickey Mouse cartoon should find a new line of work.10) ""How the World Works"" was the second best story of this lot. Dum Dum Dugan confronts Fury about his extreme methods, with a very sad outcome.11) ""The No-Sin Situation"" is two pages of various characters revealing ridiculous secrets (e.g. She Hulk never passed the bar, etc.) Filler.12) ""Original Sin: Secret Avengers"" was a fun, if useless, little adventure for Agents Fury and Coulson. I love Phil Coulson, so this worked for me. It was inconsequential, but entertaining.Overall, this collection is definitely worth reading. Plus, I recommend the beautiful, high quality hardcover edition. I just hope the OS Companion delivers on the hype. I wanna see what sins the main Avengers are hiding!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R3RYJ8IM8AHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785190694#wasThisHelpful","R1R3RYJ8IM8AHT","ACEA95FQS1AVP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEA95FQS1AVP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had great experiences with the Amazon Collection of jewelry; I've purchased many of their created sapphire and ruby pieces and been very pleased.  The stones has gorgeous color and the silver is great quality.  When this bracelet popped up on Vine I decided to request it. I've been wary of simulated opals because they can be iffy.  This piece was a nice surprise.The bracelet has a good weight to it and the rhodium plating on sterling has a brilliant shine.  The opals are nice. Though to me they obviously look created (when compared to real opals I've seen in jewelry stores), they're still very pretty.  Overall, if you're looking for created opals that are indiscernible from real ones, this probably won't satisfy.  However, if you just want a beautiful bracelet, this one certainly qualifies. For the price, this bracelet is an excellent value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UI0EAFOK7H55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFT81KS#wasThisHelpful","R1UI0EAFOK7H55","ACEA95FQS1AVP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEA95FQS1AVP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"During the Infinity event, Black Bolt released the Terrigen Mists worldwide in order to protect Thanos’ part-Inhuman son from being identified and killed.  As a result, people all over are emerging from cocoons as newly-powered Inhumans. I was eager to get to this event after reading Infinity to see how such a global “crisis” unfolds and impacts the Marvel Universe.After finishing Inhumanity, it’s apparent that this isn’t really an event at all (in the usual Marvel sense). This is more like one of those aftermath or companion collections – there is no “core” story.  This is a collection of stories, across various Marvel titles, about people emerging from the cocoons, factions fighting over what to do with the cocoons, or Avengers responding to emergencies arising from the Terrigenesis.  Some of the issues are also included in the Infinity Companion.The individual stories were interesting, with a lot of action and some really cool new powers, but I was a little disappointed that there isn’t much done with Medusa and the “original” Inhumans.  Queen Medusa is now ruling the Inhumans (Black Bolt is MIA) and she shows up here and there among the stories to collect her new “subjects”. But, readers don’t get much more than that. Did the Inhumans just accept Medusa’s rule without question? Where are they headquartered now that Attilan has crashed into the Hudson? These and a lot of other questions are never addressed.Overall, this collection is definitely worth buying for some fun stories (I loved Spider-Girl’s section) and, of course, the artwork. The hardcover is a great value, and it was very satisfying to see the consequences of the Infinity event.  I just wish it had delved into Medusa and her crew more. Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R302CHUDPX5FG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785190333#wasThisHelpful","R302CHUDPX5FG1","ACEA95FQS1AVP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEA95FQS1AVP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the look of these sandals, which is why I took a chance ordering them online without trying them on. They run very small. I usually wear a size seven, however, these were so tight in width and length I think I would need to go up a full size for them to be wearable. Also, the leather has no give at all. So if you prefer wide width shoes, do not buy these even at a larger size.Bottom line, they're going back.

"When I first put these on, I thought they were great. Though they are a bit narrow, the straps adjusted enough to compensate.  However, it only took a few steps for me to realize something was wrong.  The up curve of the arch is too far back, rather than close to the center.  So the show was forcing some of my heel up.

"I wanted a rose gold watch to go with some of my jewelry that is neither gold nor silver.  And at first, I was delighted with this watch. It is beautiful and elegant; a lustrous rose gold color and the face is clear and easy to read.  However, a week after I got it I went on vacation to New Orleans. It's hot and muggy in New Orleans and I soon discovered that the finish wears off with even a little sweat. As soon as I noticed the links discoloring, I stopped wearing it.I know it's not real gold, but I expected it to last more than a week before it started losing color.  I got this watch on a lightning deal for $30, so overall, I'll keep it for special occasions, or wearing it in the winter.

"I have encountered Black Bolt across several stories due to his role in the Illuminati, but had never read the Inhumans before. With the announcement of a film, and the recent Inhumanity event, I decided to move this to the top of my reading pile. It started off very strong, lost a lot of steam in the middle, and ended with a solid finish.Though this is a good introduction to the Inhumans, it is not strictly an origin story. When the story opens, Black Bolt and Medusa are King and Queen and have been for some time.  New readers are given entry to the world by a group of teens who are about to undergo Terrigenesis, whereby they transform into super-powered beings.  We also meet Black Bolt's insane brother, who is currently plotting his escape and the conquering of Attilan. He orchestrates humans into attacking Attilan and Black Bolt categorically refuses to respond with aggression; his inner circle begins to question his lack of action.Black Bolt is unable to speak, as his merest whisper can level a mountain, so aside from some dialog between secondary characters, the story unfolds mostly via exposition in dialog boxes.  Very often, the exposition asks a question like ""Imagine you were given one chance to speak. What would you say?"" At first this was fine, but it quickly grew tiresome.  The middle of the book became so bogged down by telling and not showing that I actually set the book aside for a couple weeks before going back to it. Once I got to the point where Black Bolt's plan unfolds, the book picked up speed again and finished with a satisfying conclusion.Overall, this was a solid story with some intriguing themes.  Attilan congratulates itself for its diversity, but the people are prejudiced against one another regardless. Some gifts are more highly desired than others, such as flight, and a class system is based upon this.  It's a good introduction to the characters, I just wish it hadn't relied so heavily on exposition. Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M5VNGC6MPJ32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785184740#wasThisHelpful","R1M5VNGC6MPJ32","ACEA95FQS1AVP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACEA95FQS1AVP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:49 Mins We have an older car and the brakes have been changed more times than I can count. That job is normally an easy one but getting everything off of the car has proved difficult. Most of the time we have to rent a kit like this one but now we own one! This has really made things a lot easier and cheaper. There are twelve pieces included in this kit. All of the pieces are made from quality steel and coated so they do not rust. I recommend keeping them put away in the box when you are done to keep them in tip top shape. Each piece seems to be well made and does a great job. We have had parts break when changing our brakes before and these ones didn't have a single problem.

These are perfect for him to get the excitement of going out and watching lights without all the people.

These gloves are a two hand light show and light up the room for tons of fun.To use the gloves you will need to pull the tab on each. Also each glove has a sticker to let you know where they on/off button is. It is super easy to push and immediately lights up. There are different modes you will go through every time you push the button. The colors are bright and flash a lot which makes for a fun night at home. Shutting off all the lights has never been so fun before. You could of course also use this if you like to rave or for Halloween. Each mode does completely different things. They flash, go steady, change colors, light up in different patterns, and then repeats! These are comfortable to wear and aren't heavy at all. So fun if you happen to have a child that needs a sensory fulfillment like my son or if you like to party. Please see my video for an up close look.

" 0:21 Mins These handmade crochet boot cuffs are beautifully made and super comfortable to wear. These look great over my black leggings and under my black boots. I absolutely love how I can wear these dressed down or up. They keep my boot zipper from scratching my leg and keep my calf warm. These are super adorable and look great with any sized boot. Since they are only a small piece of crochet instead of a whole boot sock they can be worn with ankle, calf, or any other sized boot. Wonderfully handmade crochet job!

" 0:28 Mins These crochet boot cuffs are so cute. I love them so much. They are a great combination of girly and stylish. I love the dual color. The cream and brown look so great together. The four buttons are a very cute detail that adds to these boot cuffs so perfectly. I ordered them big thinking they would probably run small but they run right on size. I should have ordered a size smaller and that is all my fault. They still fit well tucked in the top of my boots. I am loving these so much and am thrilled with the quality.

" 0:49 Mins This Remote Control Robot is so fun to play with. My husband, son, and I have been playing with it regularly. It is so cool how it says ""greetings master."" Its control allows you to make the robot move, shoot discs, and lift its gun. It lets you know it is going to fire at you, and then lifts up the gun which has a red light that glows. It makes shooting sounds and moves exactly like a robot should. It glides easily across my linoleum floors and the play mats in our sons room. It needs to be a relatively hard and flat surface.Our absolute favorite part about this robot was the disc shooter. You load up all 12 discs into the head of the robot. You just simply tilt the head back to load them up. They are made of foam so they shoot far. You get 3 yellow, 3 red, 3 blue, and 3 green. You press the button and you will hear the shooter starting to work. Then you fire them off one at a time. I couldn't believe how well they were flying. We were all laughing because my husband was shooting us all with them. You can also use the buttons on the robot if you do not want to use the remote control. You will need to have 6 AA batteries handy to run this robot. Please see the video for an up close look at this awesome robot.

It comes with a screen protector too! All of my buttons still work just as good with the case on. I really like that when I set this on something it doesn't just slide off.

We ordered my husband a size XL to wear for work because he goes through belts like crazy. He had to cut it down a bit but it was very easy for him to do. They always seem to break easily but not this one. When it gets in place it stays and doesn't rub the nylon the belt is made of away. It is solid black as is the buckle and the buckle has no metal.

"I am so loving this Merry Christmas banner for my holiday photo shoots. My families love using it in the background and it is very easy to transport. I did have some issues with it blowing in the wind but that is to be expected. You get 16 cards and two red ribbons. You are going to need to string the cards together yourself to make your banners.

" 0:44 MinsSenbowe Super Bright 8 LED Solar Powered light is perfect for by our garage. It covers a good amount of space as it is wider than others I have used. We are going to be ordering another for the other side of the garage it works so well. I just make sure it is always set to on and then mounted it in the sunniest place on the garage. All day it soaks up the suns rays through the wide solar panel and then it shines when we need it at night. I love that we could mount it up in just a few minutes and never had to do damage to our garage. The quality is great and it hasn't failed us yet.

" 0:34 MinsI am incredibly impressed with these EmaxDesign Makeup Brushes. They come in a neon orange bag that makes for easy transporting. This 12 piece brush set and blending sponge are all the tools you need to get a perfectly flawless face. In this set you get: Set Contains: A manual on how to properly care for the brushes, blending sponge, bag, foundation brush, small smudge brush, large eye shadow brush, highlighting brush, concealer brush, eyebrow brush, blush brush, small eye shadow brush, brush to comb through the lashes, kabuki brush, and two brushes that are universal. All of the handles are made from a beautiful bamboo. The brushes are made with synthetic nylon so they are cruelty free.The brushes are very soft and blend well. I have tried this with powder foundation as well as liquid, and both work beautifully. After getting my foundation and concealer put on with the brushes, I like to go over with the damp blending sponge. I am not allergic to latex but if you are the blending sponge is supposed to be free of latex. Cleaning them is easy. After each use I like to run them through some warm water. I then take a little bit of baby shampoo and swish them on my hand until the water runs clear. None of the hairs have fallen out for me and they work beautifully. The price is incredible for the quality and amount of brushes you get. Please see the video for up close pictures of this set.

" 0:49 MinsI really love the look of these Sentey Headphones. The microphone is pretty good quality and picks up my voice clearly. I spent a couple hours listening to all kinds of songs with these and my favorite were ones without too much bass. I feel like these didn't pick up the bass as well as I would have liked with dub step. However, it played all of my other music beautifully. I love that in an instant I can adjust these headphone or fold them right up and put them in their case. The head band is super comfortable for long wear. The ear cushions are so comfortable! When I am rocking out to my music I can't hear anything around me so I can really relax.These are very good quality without being overly bulky. I was able to use them easily with my laptop and my cellphone. I am also a huge fan of the brushed metal look on the band. You can easily answer calls with the control on the cord, it is small but easy to control. You can also play and pause the music right from the same controls. Talking on this headset worked great for me. I was able to answer calls and pause the music in a matter of seconds. Overall I love the sound and call quality of these headphones.

" 0:15 MinsBeyond adorable! This is the first stuffed animal my son has loved. It is really hard for him to bond with animals that are real and anything that looks like a real animal. He has issues communicating and things can be very scary for him. We have been trying to find a friend for him to keep him from being scared at night. It took him about a day but he became very fond of this little puppy. We call him Patches. The different colored patches and stitches are so adorable. It is a very refreshing look for a stuffed animal. The tin is really cool as well. It looks like a paint can but it made of plastic and metal. My son loves carrying his cars around in the tin. As we speak that little dog is on his pillow in his bed. I know it just seems like a very soft stuffed dog to some but to my son it means the world. The quality of the dog and its tin are great!

"I have tried several outdoor survival bracelets and this hands down is the best. It is the best because of how simplistic it is. The bracelet fits comfortably around the wrist. You get the bracelet itself which is made from heavy duty rope. This rope can be used for just about anything. Maybe you need to make shelter or tie off a hurt let, this can do that. You can use it to climb as well if you need to in a survival situation. There is a knife that clips safely into the bracelet so you never have to worry about getting cut while it is on your wrist. It also has a flint so you can make a spark to start a fire. I have not had to use this yet thank goodness but my husband is confident enough to wear it when he hunts. Being safe is important to him.

"We moved into this house last year and I scrubbed it clean. The only places that never came clean no matter what I used was the bathroom and some of the carpet. I was really hoping that this would help me with the mold problem in the corner of the shower. I have bleached it, scrubbed it hard, and now tried this steamer, nothing works! We will be stripping the entire molding since the hot steam didn't work but I was a little disappointed since the description said it removed mold. That being said it did do a good job on the carpet I couldn't get clean. They had kids that left gum in a couple places and I was able to get most of it out.This steamer is pretty easy to use you just fill it up, put your attachment on, plug it in, and wait. The wait time for the steam to heat was 2 minutes for me. It might depend on how hot the water is when you put it in. The cord is very long, 9.5 feet. I was able to reach all around my bathroom with it and into the hall way. The steam was steady for about 10 minutes then started to lessen a bit. At the 20 minute mark it needed a refill. It was honestly just as much work to use this in the bathroom as it was just to hand scrub it down. I would not buy this to clean mold at all or really target a shower. If you are looking to use this for carpet or furniture it seems to work much better. Also it does really well on mirrors and windows. Make sure you don't apply the hot steam to a cold window!Included in this package is:- Extended connecting spray nozzle- This helps so much with me being short. I can reach without straining.- Long spray nozzle- This reached well behind the toilet. I have a small space to work with and this helped.- General spray nozzle- I used this to clean the walls of the shower. It works fairly well to steam them up and then I wiped them clean.- Spray nozzle for doors and windows- I really loved this attachment it does work fabulous on windows.- Round brush- This bends very easily and doesn't hold up well.- Bent nozzle- I like how this targets the steam into one place.- Brush plate and a microfiber towel- couch, floor!Overall it isn't bad for the price. Again, I would not buy it to clean mold or solely for the shower. It works well on windows and fabric.

"Stealth G4 8GB Tablet is perfect for web surfing. If you love Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, & Google surfing, this is perfect for you. It can play light games and apps just fine. The screen is way better than a lot of tablets we have used. It isn't quite as great as the Fire HD screen though but definitely a step up from typical childrens tablets. I think this tablet would be awesome for a child. It is wonderfully priced and works well. The battery doesn't drain super quick, so you are not constantly attached to a charger. You can load a bunch of apps quickly and customize the screen to what you like. I think this is an awesome buy for anyone looking to do basic things with it. You are not going to be able to run WOW on it or anything but for everyday things this is great. We have been using this as a car/store tablet for our son. He is autistic and sometimes needs a distraction. It lasts just fine in the store and both ways without dying. You seriously can't beat the price.

"We have been loving these Poop Sprays! This by far though is our favorite scent. It is light and refreshing without being crazy overpowering. I noticed with these scents they really last longer than one use. If you are sensitive to perfumes or sprays this isn't a great option for you. You hold it about 6-8 inches over the toilet and spray a couple times. Do your business and all you smell is Coconut & Lime. When we spray it, it travels down the stairs. We can flush the toilet three times and still smell it. We absolutely love that our bathroom smells fresh all the time.

"Our car has a stereo but nothing fancy. We can get basic radio stations and it just irritating. We wanted something that would let us listen to whatever we wanted to. We do not even have CD player in our car so we connected this right up to our phone. It was pretty easy to get working and the instructions weren't hard to decipher. The music quality was pretty good. The bass came through well even when turned up loudly. It isn't the best ever but it does work better than our previous options. The issue we had was the hands free calling. It sounds like it is screeching or echoing to the person we are talking to. It doesn't sound good at all and it is quite annoying. We bought this mostly for the music part of it so, I am not overly upset but it is still a bummer. I like that I can also charge my phone while using this Blue-tooth car kit. I don't have to pick over charging my phone or listening to music, which makes me super happy. For the price this item isn't bad.

"My husband has a deviated septum and it can be quite irritating for him and I. Not only does it cause issues with snoring but also causes him to have a constant post nasal drip. We have tried silicone snoring devices before but they only last about a week or two before they fall apart. These ones have been holding up so far and are most of the time comfortable for him to use. They have different sizes so you can fit them to your nose. Half way through the night on some occasions he gets irritated with them and pulls them out, but most nights he sleeps snore free. He has been throwing up less in the morning since his post nasal drip is down from these. I would give them a try if you are having issues.

His games are running better and his computer hasn't crashed since. He had ordered this computer last January and didn't get what he paid for. He needed a reliable company to order these from to complete his computer and this company was it. Everything went smoothly and is working great.

" 0:37 MinsI am really loving this Kinga Nano Ionic Facial Steamer. It is like having a spa treatment at home. I have been having horrible issues with the skin on my face. No matter what I do it always looks dry and is flaky. Between stress and the weather changing I felt completely hopeless. I have used this three times now and it has made my skin look great. It is kind of like having a mini sauna for your face right at home. I have never been to a spa and have never used anything quite like this. Instead of using my normal chemicals I tried this for a week and WOW. I can't believe how smooth, healthy, and filled in my skin looks. I make sure to moisturize my lips and face after using this steamer to prevent dryness.It is very easy to use and you can get started minutes after opening it. You need to make sure you are using it on a flat surface. Take out the water compartment and fill it up. I used a purified bottle water as it suggested not to use tap. I put the cap on tight and put it back in. I then plugged the steamer in, turned it on, and waited for it to steam. I don't even think it took a minute for the steam to start rolling out. I stayed about 6-8 inches away from the steam because it was super hot. At first it made me cough a bit because I was not used to it. I think breathing in through your nose and out of your mouth works best. My face begin to produce sweat and just melted all the bad away. I stayed in front of the steamer for 5-7 minutes. I patted my face dry and then applied my moisturizer. It is as easy as that. Your skin will thank you for it.

"Unfortunately this won't work for my husband or myself. We are both about 5""4 and 200lbs. I wear a size 16 jeans and my husband a 38. This barely velcros across us and neither of us can breathe when it is secure. It is very unfortunate that it doesn't have an extending option around the waist. It is very well made and the design is perfectly modern but if you are heavier it won't work. While we did have it on very briefly to test it, we put our son in it and the cushion to sit on was very comfortable for him. Everything else on this carries is adjustable but the waist.It is very easy to front carry, back carry, and face baby outward. I don't recommend facing baby outward as most doctors will tell you it can hurt their hips. My son is 29lbs and 26 months old, he fit in this very well. In this package you get the orange baby carrier, two shoulder pads, and a bib.I like it has a little cap for sun protection. We will be passing this along to our smaller friends.

"Whelp let me start off by saying this kennel was purchased with the intent of housing my miniture potbelly pig, yes, I said potbelly pig. He has learned how to escape from absolutely everything that I have ever put him in from day one, and he is now about 9 months old and weighs close to 70lbs. This kennel by PetSafe was extremely simple for me to assemble by myself in about an hour or less, however I do have some suggestions for anyone thinking of purchasing this item:1. Have someone handy when you are putting on the fencing ""fabric"" it is a pain in the butt to unroll a bunch of fencing while securing it at the same time because the moment you let go of the fencing roll it gets tangled in itself.2. Make sure all poles are completely vertical and square before installing the door otherwise it will drag and get caught on the bottom pole.3. Skip the tie wires all together and invest in a huge stack of *ZIP TIES* I swear zip ties are the only thing that made this cage even workable for my needs. Read why below:I used the included tie wires and they are a major pain in the butt as well because it's not easy to get them to stay securely on the bar or the fencing. My pig would nudge his way right through the fencing fabric and be roaming around freely. Actually the very first time that I put him in this cage BEFORE I could even latch the hinge on the door he nudged through the fence and was out the other side, literally, within about 2.5 seconds! I was so mad I thought I was going to have to dissassemble the whole cage and have to return it but that night before bed the true savior came to me...ZIP TIES and I swear they work wonders!I bought a huge stack of zip ties and tied the fencing fabric to the bottom pole probably about 2-3 inches apart on the bottom, and I even used a few to anchor the fencing to the vertical poles and some to anchor the fencing to the top poles and since then my pig hasn't been able to escape the cage at all! I am beyond happy because like I said above he has escaped from everything I put him in previously.I am still only giving this cage 3 stars because the cage itself and the contents that came with it completely didn't serve my needs whatsoever because my pig escaped within 2.5 seconds, but with adding the zip ties it made the cage fort knox as far as I am concerned.If you purchase this cage, or even if you have purchased it in the past just plan on getting some Zip Ties and I can guarantee you this cage will serve any needs you may have!","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDC2E7EYKO7QP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009GZCXK#wasThisHelpful","RDC2E7EYKO7QP","AD3PHHFTCOBT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD3PHHFTCOBT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been searching high and low for a reasonably priced safe to store my items in and this one has met all of my expectations. This Ivation Electronic Biometric Safe is not only sturdy, it's very responsive and secure as well.One of the things I love most about this safe is, obviously, the security! I have tried other so called Biometric (finger print reading) safes and they all have failed because they just sensed the warmth of a finger and opened, even when it wasn't supposed to. This Ivation safe is secure in the fact that it ONLY opens when it scans one of the fingerprints that were stored in the device. This safe can store up to 32 different fingerprints! I tested the security of this feature by registering all of the fingerprints on my right hand, but then trying to access the safe using my left hand, it wouldn't open! I absolutely love that. It also has a keypad for you to store a key code if preferred, and it even comes with fail safe keys for you to use in case the battery dies, or just for quick access.The safe also features two adjustable shelves with padding that protects your items inside. The safe is made of very heavy metals and none of the hinges are visible on the outside, so it is pry-resistant.I really enjoy the added security that this safe offers, and I believe it would be a good asset in any home, it's amazing what you find you may want to put inside a safe when you have one, I've even started keeping my social security card in there just for safe keeping!

You can use it as a Bluetooth Speaker with it's built in Bluetooth capabilities, it also has an NFC function for even easier pairing with your device, all you have to do is tap your NFC capable device onto this speaker and bam it's paired!

That feature sold me.This speaker is also very durable perfect for someone that loves the outdoors. It is waterproof, dustproof, anti-scratch, and shockproof. There is no need to worry about this speaker in the elements as long as it isn't completely submerged in water it will be just fine!​The sound quality of the speaker is also something that sold me.

I love the fact that it is so whisper quiet. I am an extremely light sleeper and the fan I used before this one was LOUD it would annoy me and keep waking me up in the middle of the night, but this one has been a life saver.

"One of my most favorite things in life is chewable ice, I know it's terrible for your teeth but somehow I just can't help but love it. Well this Ivation Portable High Capacity Ice Maker w/LCD Display - 2.8-Liter Water Reservoir, 3 Selectable Cube Sizes - Yield of up to 26.5 Pounds of Ice Daily produces the most perfectly chewable ice and I couldn't be happier!This portable Ice Maker is crazy simple to use, I simply plugged it in added water to the reservoir and selected the ice size. Within 10 minutes it was producing medium sized ice. This was completely astonishing to me because my package had been sitting on my hot porch all day, but that didn't bother this ice maker one bit! There is a backlit LCD display that allows you to set the time, choose your ice size, and even set an auto produce allowing your ice machine to make ice during the hours that you select. You can easily choose between small, medium, and large ice cube sizes.There is a water reservoir with a max fill line, all you do is fill water up to that line and turn the machine on and it's good to go. No hooking it up to the water line in your home making it perfectly portable or great for a household with no ice machine! There is a ""catch basket"" that will catch your ice once it's made. Personally I like to use my ice directly from the catch basket because I find that if I take the ice and store it in my own freezer, my freezer makes the ice really hard and not so ""chewable"" as I love, a random and unimportant fact I'm sure. Another fact is that you will need to remove or use the ice in a somewhat timely fashion. If you don't the ice in the basket will re-melt and drain into the water reservoir and be recycled, also it needs to be emptied so that it can actually produce it's maximum of 26.5lbs a day.This machine has been so much fun for me to have around the house and I can't even think of a reason you shouldn't own it also. If your looking for perfectly chewable ice, or even if you just need an ice machine this is the one for you!Sample provided for unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT32ZH01NBC2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O7U6I0A#wasThisHelpful","RT32ZH01NBC2K","AD3PHHFTCOBT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD3PHHFTCOBT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To much of my dismay the master bedroom of my new house is exceptionally warmer than the rest of my home, probably about 15-20 degrees, no joke. I suffer from severe insomnia as it is, and being too warm definitely adds to the no sleep- so I was searching everywhere for something to help me sleep through the night until I ran across this Cooling Mattress Pad - Feel Cooler Basic® Cooling Mattress Pad. (Queen). I have been using this cooling mattress pad for a few weeks now, and it has helped tenfold! It does just the right amount of ""cooling"" to keep you comfortable throughout the night.I sort of think about this cooling mattress pad more as a temperature regulator. I think that will really help you when purchasing this item. I have a memory foam mattress topper on my bed and that is one of the things that contributes to the immense amount of heat while I'm trying to sleep at night. I simply popped this cooling mattress topper right over my memory foam and it has drastically decreased the heat in my bed which I love!The mattress pad itself is made with a super soft cotton cover and the sides all stretch with extra deep pockets so they even fit over my pillow top mattress, with my memory foam mattress topper on! That in and of itself is a feat! The filling of this mattress topper is where all of the magic happens. In easy to understand terms the filling of this mattress topper keeps your body heat regulated. If it goes above a comfortable level, the filling will help cool it back down, also if it goes below the ideal level it will warm you back up.If you hate sleeping with a bed that is way too warm, you definitely need to check this out! It has been an absolute life saver for me!

"I just recently bought a new house and I have an elderly dog who just turned 12, so he has rather frequent accidents. As you can imagine I have been searching high and low for pet training pads that he will use to stop any smelly situations before they start. These Superior Puppy Pads and Pet Training Pad- Perfect for Puppy Housebreaking,Bonus ebook,100% Guarantee have been an absolute life saver.These Pet Training Pads are made of a very thin material that works perfect for my dog and I because I find if he notices that he is walking on a different material he wants to ""go"" right next to the training pad-how's that for frustrating?! I don't know if it is the combination of a thin material or the dog pheromones but something does the trick and he uses these training pads without a fuss.I have noticed since having these pet training pads my dog will have his accidents only on the pad and no where else in my home while I'm gone which is something of a miracle in itself. I need to order an entire case of these things! The feature that I appreciate the most is the fact that these pads really do turn the urine into a gel almost instantaneously. With the countless other training pads I have tried we have had potty leaks that run over the sides of the training pad and right in to the carpet. That has so far never been an issue with these training pads, best of all sometimes he goes 2 times before I get back home from work and still no leaks!I also love the fact that the training pads so help mask the urine smell. Even with using our old training pads there would be a urine smell in the air until I threw away the soiled pad, not with these training pads, luckily they seem to mask that nasty smell rather well!I would encourage anyone with a dog to purchase these training pads, they really will make pet parenting much easier!I received this product in exchange for evaluation, I thoroughly tested it out to make sure it preforms as stated.

"I live in Nebraska, and here camping is something we do every summer, but I recently lost my tent in a move so I have been on the hunt for a new one. I am so happy that I found this Yodo Pop Up Instant Dome Tent.

This is great for those days where you want to be out of the tent but it's just a little too sunny, or even if you have a baby that you don't want to burn. Simply attach the canopy and place it wherever you want and you're good to go!This tent is very well made I haven't had a problem with it leaking at all, another feat my previous tents were not all able to achieve. Of course when this tent arrived it actually rained every night for about two weeks. I tested it in the rain for two days and it was perfect! The only down side to this tent that I can find is that it is unfortunately not a 3-4 person tent. I went camping in it with my friend and I and we barely had room once our few things came inside the tent with us. I am about 5'11'' and she is 5'6''.

"I am a single woman and I just recently purchased a new home so I am constantly trying to ""beef up"" my security. I got the opportunity to try out this Foscam FI9900P Outdoor HD IP Camera and I was very happy to accept.

This camera is the first exception to that. The camera itself is very easy to affix to your home or wherever you choose to place it, but the Foscam interface is the craziest thing to maneuver. The website is broken or nonexistent for this camera even though on the small paper of ""directions"" this camera comes with tells you to visit this website for further help. After much research and external searching I finally got it set up.Once the camera is set up it's wonderful. The picture quality is truly beautiful and true HD as promised. I appreciate the fact that this camera comes equipped with night vision as well so you don't have to worry about not being able to see what's going on at night. I have this camera affixed near my front door of my home so I can not only see who is coming to my house, but I can even see who drives by etc. which gives me a great sense of security! I could definitely use a couple more of these and feel like I'm in Ft. Knox!Final thoughts:This camera definitely has it's hiccups and I can imagine for a non tech savvy person it would be even more stressful trying to set this thing up.Once it's set up it's perfect, the stress is definitely well worth the struggle!I received this product for evaluation.

I like something that is soft but still blocks out all of the light, and this is exactly what the Memory Foam Sleep Mask does.

I thoroughly test out all of my products before leaving my reviews, these are my own opinions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R381JIGTY96CUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SLGUB5E#wasThisHelpful","R381JIGTY96CUU","AD3PHHFTCOBT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD3PHHFTCOBT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**UPDATE** Took my dog to the vet today because I thought he had an ear infection, turn out he has a GIANT sore on his neck from this collar malfunctioning and shocking him. If you read my original review below you will notice that I NEVER use the shock or even the vibrate function at all on my dog to begin with, I only used the beep function and still this collar was apparently shocking my poor dog without my knowledge for the course of three days.  I had one of the collars on him for about a week with no issues, changed the collar when the first one needed to be charged. I changed the collar to the second one 3 days ago and in the course of 3 days this collar has made a gaping hole in my dogs neck and he lost all of his fur around the collar. He is still at the vet being treated. Please do not do this to your animal. I feel like the most horrible person in the planet because I allowed this collar on my dog. I had no idea that this collar was doing this to my dog because the remote didn't signal that it was doing anything and he never cried. The wound on my dogs neck from this collar is infected so badly in the course of 3 days that it smells when he walks by (why I thought he had an ear infection) I will update my review once again with pictures of the damage when my dog is finally home to deter all of you from doing this to your dog. Please do not buy this product. I am leaving my original review below so that you can see my original thoughts before all of this was brought to my attention.I live in an apartment with a 9 year old dog that has unfortunately gotten used to barking at absolutely nothing. He is one of those dogs that thinks “test barks” are great and even worse than that every time someone enters or exits their apartment he barks when he hears the doors shut. I have lived in this apartment for 1 year so imagine my stress whenever this happens! I have tried every sort of training to get him to stop and he normally responds well for about a week or so and goes back to his old ways.  I got the opportunity to test out this Petrainer Remote Training E-Collar for review and of course I couldn’t pass up this chance! This collar has worked wonders and is absolutely my favorite thing I’ve ever had the chance to review, and I’ve reviewed THOUSANDS of items, so that says a lot!What are the features?• Advanced RF 434Mhz Technology boosts a range up to 330 yards• Rechargeable and waterproof transmitter and collar receivers• Convenient and easy to read backlit LCD screen that shows the stimulation level• 4 modes; Static shock, vibration, beep, and light• 1 year free replacement warrantyMy experience with training collars:Okay, so as I said before my dog is 9 years old and has always been a very vocal dog, I’m talking barking at leaves flying in the wind, birds, squirrels, the whole nine yards. It drives everyone insane because these are things he sees multiple times a day yet he chooses to bark, nonetheless I’ve tried countless different training collars. These collars have probably cost me upwards of $1,000 in the past because I have never seen any that cost any less than $100. The training collars I’ve used in the past have been the automatic type that will deliver the vibration, shock, etc automatically without the owner of the dog having a remote. This sounds nice except for the fact that the dog has to bark at a certain level for it to register on the collar, then the collar will deliver the training. My 9 year old dog has gotten wise to this and decided that if he barks quietly nothing will happen to him, so you can see how this is frustrating because it’s still loud enough for other people to hear.My opinions:This Petrainer collar is 100 times better than any of the other pet training collars I’ve had, because the owner of the dog has a transmitter remote that they can use at their own discretion to deliver the training to the dog wearing the collar. I absolutely love this fact because not only is it great for barking dogs, but it can also be great for training your dog not to go potty in the house, not to get on furniture, really it’s great for any sort of training you can think of.The remote is wonderful as well because not only does it have two channels to control the two different collars, but it has 4 different modes of training. It includes Static shock, vibration, beep, and light, and there are different levels of static shock and vibration as well for the most stubborn of dogs!How this collar worked with my dog:I tried all of the different methods on my dog. I had tried different shock collars in the past that didn’t even phase my dog so right off the bat when I put this collar on my dog I had it on the static shock mode only at LEVEL 1, the LOWEST level available for the shock setting. My dog started barking and I pressed the button on the remote and zapped him, he yelped. I felt like the worst dog owner ever because I had never had that happen to me before my dog normally doesn’t even get phased by shock collars. I felt so bad I changed it to the beep setting. To my absolute surprise the beep setting works wonders! For whatever reason my dog despises this beep, and it’s not even loud!  I’ve tested this in every setting I get the chance to, now my dog can be in the presence of squirrels, strangers, children, anything and he doesn’t even try to bark I can’t express how surprised and happy I am. My life is so much easier having a dog that isn’t a crazy barking psycho at all hours of the day.How I use this collar:I keep my remote transmitter actually clipped to my clothing at all hours of the day when I’m home with the clip that is attached to the back. This has worked great for me because I am a firm believer that you have to stick with training, you can’t be lazy about it otherwise your dog will never learn. Honestly in the time I’ve had the collar (about 2-3 weeks) he doesn't even try to bark anymore but I still keep the remote on me at all times just in case he forgets. I also keep the remote on the charger at night so I am never without it.This Petrainer Remote Training E Collar is an absolute life saver and I would recommend it to anyone, even with the worst dog. This collar is amazing and has turned my dog from a vocal barking psycho to a very obedient dog, even just with the beep setting! For the price of this training collar, you can’t pass it up!","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WZKDCBGXHKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6ZHZMI#wasThisHelpful","R2WZKDCBGXHKX","AD3PHHFTCOBT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD3PHHFTCOBT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love listening to music and I make it part of my daily life whenever I’m doing mundane things such as waiting in the car, jogging etc, however I have very small ears so traditional ear buds tend to hurt. I have been searching everywhere for quality over-the-ear headphones that won’t hurt and have great sound quality, and I believe I have found them with this AUDSOM Bluetooth Headphone set. These headphones offer superior sound quality, Bluetooth capability, as well as a corded option if you forget to charge them, making them super versatile and great for those of use that don’t like earbuds!What are the features?·  Can be used both wired (via the 3.5mm audio cable) and via Bluetooth 3.0 EDR·  Deep enhanced bass and full range sound for a superior audio experience·  Compatible with Bluetooth enabled music players and A2DP enabled devices such as iPad, iPhone, iPad touch, Android Smart Phones, Tablets, etc·  Control your music player directly from the headset with functions such as play, pause, next, previous track, and volume·  Up to 18 hours of music playing and talking time.·  Standby time is more than 250 hoursHow did I test this?I tested out these headphones for a period of a couple months, because I find that most Bluetooth headsets work great in the beginning and then start “fizzing out”. I also wanted to be sure that over a few months time the cord wasn’t going to break down like a lot that I’ve used. This AUSDOM Bluetooth Headphone set worked beautifully and passed both tests with flying colors.  I used this headset every day and most nights (to listen to ASMR videos before bed) and the Bluetooth functionality works exactly the same as it did straight out of the box. The cord has also been great and hasn’t frayed or broken down in any way.My opinions:These AUSDOM Bluetooth Headphones are amazing quality for a very inexpensive price tag.  First off, these headphones are extremely comfortable to wear they have quite a bit of padding not only on the ears, but also on the band that goes over your head as well making them comfortable to wear even lying down. The fact that these headphones have a built in mic makes them versatile and easy to use with your cell phone. If you get a phone call you can answer it with ease and you don’t have to worry about switching things over. The Bluetooth functionality is nice as well and paired quickly with my Android, 4 different tablets, an iPad, and my T.V.!These headphones have superior sound quality offering rich deep bass that makes any listening just that little bit better. I would recommend these headphones to anyone looking for a nice headset at an affordable price!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R123D44GVKDIO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TDLG1XM#wasThisHelpful","R123D44GVKDIO8","AD3PHHFTCOBT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD3PHHFTCOBT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am always on my feet, and since I’m in the middle of a big move, I have really been noticing my foot pain. I have tried everything from getting more regular pedicures, to getting Reflexology and massages on my feet which only tend to help for a very limited amount of time. With the Yoga Toes Gems I am able to pop these on my feet and give them a nice stretch, all the while continuing on with whatever I’m doing at that moment.What are the features?  Stretch, Revive, and Exercise your toes in style with gems·  Fight Bunions, Hammer Toes, Claw Toes, and other unsightly foot problems!·  Doctor recommended·  Made in the USA of medical grade gel·  30 day money back guarantee·  Lifetime warrantyHow do they work?The Yoga Toes Gems are super simple to use. All I do is pop each separater in between my toes and go on about whatever I’m doing.What are my opinions?I believe the Yoga Toes Gems are absolutely wonderful. They are great for stretching out my feet in a way I haven’t been able to achieve on my own, and I love the fact that I can wear them while cleaning, reading, or catching up on my favorite TV show, there is no work involved whatsoever.I have really noticed a difference in the way my feet feel after wearing these daily for about a month. At first when I started using the Yoga Toes Gems my feet felt like they were stretched too far and it was a little uncomfortable to wear (not painful, just a different feeling). I know for sure these are working now because when I put them on I no longer have the discomfort I had in the beginning, and I can wear them for longer periods of time. I don’t suffer from hammer toe or any of the other conditions mentioned above, however these DO make my feet feel much more relaxed after a hard day at work!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30HRT16EKEYXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HE94SE#wasThisHelpful","R30HRT16EKEYXY","AD3PHHFTCOBT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD3PHHFTCOBT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Cooking is one of my favorite pastimes, but all of the different kitchen gadgets I’ve accumulated take up quite a bit of space in my kitchen. With the VonShef 12pc Kitchen Utensil set I can hang it up neatly on the wall and have all of my utensils at arms reach! This set is a wonderful high quality feeling set that looks beautiful but is also functional.What are the features?·  12 Essential Kitchen Utensils·  Easy to mount hanging rack·  High Quality Stainless Steel·  Stylish and attractive·  Dishwasher safeThe Packaging and shipping:First of all the shipping was EXTREMELY fast! I got notice that I was receiving this product and within two or three days later it was already there waiting for me. I love the fact that the shipping was so fast, no wait time! The package arrived in perfect undamaged condition to my home. It came in a box within a box with air packs all around so nothing would jostle and get damaged.The product itself:The product itself is great and wonderful quality. This set runs about $23.99 and for 12 pieces that equals $1.99 per utensil, NOT including the hanging rack. That value alone is absolutely outstanding. Each utensil is a medium weight, nothing too heavy, but nothing cheap and tin-y which is perfect. I also love the fact that it comes with it’s own hanging rack. I hate having my utensils shoved into a drawer because they have a high possibility of getting damaged which wouldn’t be great!I tested out each and every utensil, and they all work perfectly every single time. I am thoroughly impressed with this set by VonShef, for the price it simply can’t be beat.

"A great clothing iron is difficult to find, they all have just about the same features, but not all of them are easy to use and effective. I don’t know about you but the one thing I hate is waking up early in the morning and spending forever trying to iron my clothes with an iron that doesn’t work very well. The Smartek Streak Iron is an efficient iron that works perfectly the first pass!What are the features?·  1500 Watts of bursting steam·  Auto shut off and self clean·  Heat and steam control·  Easy fill water spout with multi angle ironing·  Vertical steam, variable steam control·  Water mister·  Soft grip handle·  9’ swivel cordMy Opinions:This iron is very lightweight and weighs about 2 ½ pounds which is perfect for me, it’s weighted enough to hold the wrinkle or fold down on your clothing but it’s not exhaustingly heavy. It is made of a very high quality material and has a nice, sturdy construction with a handle that is easy to grip, and well balanced so your hand doesn’t get fatigued.I appreciate the fact that there are so many different temperature settings because I would rather not scorch my clothes to death just to get a simple wrinkle out! To change the temperature you simply twist the dial and it’s ready to go. The steam settings are great as well. This iron does the standard misting while ironing; it also has a function to mist the garment and to burst the steam as well. Another wonderful feature of the steam settings is to use this iron as a vertical steamer of your clothing items.The iron also has a nice shape to it, other irons I’ve had in the past have had a wide appearance and made it difficult to iron smaller garments, or to get in tight spaces on my garments such as between buttons etc. This Smartek iron has a very interesting yet functional shape, the nose is very thin and pointy which helps me get in the smallest nooks and crannies of my garments.My Overall Opinions…Should you buy?Overall, this Smartek Iron is a great iron, and honestly the best one I’ve ever owned. Until this iron I had never noticed the subtle differences that could make an iron even better and I would say if you’re someone that irons often this would be even more apparent to you. The iron is very budget friendly and I think every single household needs this one!

"My dog is part Beagle so he loves going on walks all over the neighborhood, but once he gets on a scent trail of something –it’s hard to get him off of it! I had always attached his leash directly to his collar, but he would end up choking himself if he got on a really good scent trail and started pulling. With the Smizel Soft Dog Harness I am able to walk my dog without fear of him choking himself while we walk along. This dog harness also makes it super easy to control your dog and keep them in line while walking.What are the features?·  Made of 100% Polyester·  Adjustable chest straps·  Quick release buckles·  Padded neck opening·  Soft and stretchy neck line eliminates pressure points and distributes weight on chest not the back·  Machine washableThe construction:This dog harness is made of a very lightweight yet durable, breathable fabric. I really enjoy its texture because it’s not too constricting to my dog he is able to run around and do anything that he wants to do with this on. I have also noticed that he doesn’t find it annoying when it’s on because he doesn’t try to shake it off. I actually took it off of him once and he got upset and wanted it back on. I’ll try to get a video of that and post it with this review if I can!My opinions:This dog harness is absolutely wonderful. If you have a hunting dog like I do, or even a dog that is a little more difficult to control while walking you should get this harness. It has truly made our lives easier because my dog is no longer being choked any time we leave or go on a walk. The harness itself has a ring for you to attach your leash right on the back, so when the dog pulls it simply holds them back by their chest instead of their neck.I also enjoy the simple fact that this harness comes in a multitude of colors and sizes. I ordered a size Large for my dog and it fit him absolutely perfectly. You can also adjust this harness with the straps on the side if you need.This Smizel dog harness is wonderful, and it’s offered at a very economical price. I would recommend it to anyone!

"I have recently been getting in to deep cleaning of my teeth and keeping that going while at home as well, so I stumbled upon this XTech Ultrasonic Toothbrush. This toothbrush is absolutely perfect for your teeth because it deep cleans better than any other electronic toothbrush.What are the features?·  Effectively removes 2 times more plaque than a manual toothbrush without irritating the gums·  Ultrasonic Technology produces a dynamic cleaning action with 40,000 vibrations per minute that thoroughly clean your teeth and gums·  5 different operation modes- Clean, Sensitive, White, Gumcare, Massage·  Battery indicator shows how much battery power is left·  Safe to use on braces, fillings, crowns, veneers, and periodontal pockets·  Alerts every 30 seconds to change brushing area·  2 minute auto timer·  Built in UV Sanitizer to store and clean up to 4 brush heads·  Kills 99.9% of Bacteria in 7 minutesThe Set Up:This brush is extremely to set up, I simply took the unit out of the box and plugged it in. I also rinsed the brush heads and popped them in the UV sanitizer so they were nice and sanitized and ready to go! The brush wand charged very quickly, and I ended up using it about 20 minutes later just because I was so excited to give it a try!My Opinions:This XTech Ultrasonic Toothbrush is great, my teeth have never felt so clean. This toothbrush had many different “vibration” settings that all work a little differently to target different areas of your mouth, my favorite is the strongest one which is for deep cleaning. I love the size of the brush head as well because you are really able to get in the tiny nooks and crannies of your teeth making them nice and clean.To change to a different Ultrasonic setting you simply press the button and it will change to a different mode, this is super easy to do! I enjoy the fact that I can work through all of the different modes in my tooth cleaning routine if I wish, it makes me feel like I’m getting a dental cleaning from the comfort of my own home.I have noticed quite a difference using this toothbrush as opposed to my other one. My teeth feel much cleaner and look much whiter since using this one, and I have noticed a drastic reduction in the plaque that had already been on my teeth.This Ultrasonic Toothbrush is an excellent deal offered at this price point, with the added UV feature this is a very unique toothbrush. The UV Sanitizer has to be one of my favorite features of this toothbrush because there is nothing more disgusting than brushing all of the leftover food and what have you out of your teeth, rinsing the toothbrush and using it again a few hours later. When you stop to think about it, imagine how much bacteria grows on toothbrushes. This UV sanitizer stops that immediately! There is something very gratifying about brushing your teeth and then knowing that when you put your brush head in the UV compartment 99.9% of the bacteria that are now on that brush head are being killed and everything is nice and sanitized!There is also a docking station that this toothbrush sits on when not in use. I love this feature as well because as soon as the brush wand meets the docking station it begins charging automatically, so essentially your toothbrush will always be perfectly charged. I love that there are no pesky batteries to worry about changing or cords to remember to plug in to.Overall, this XTech Ultrasonic Toothbrush is a must have, especially at its very economical price. In using this toothbrush for a few weeks I have noticed a drastic appearance in my teeth, and using for months, or even a year I can’t even begin to imagine what they would look like! This toothbrush should be in everyone’s home. I received this product for evaluation, but these are my own opinions. I thoroughly test out each product before writing my reviews.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W0PR9ZQ9DT7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QU5V2WE#wasThisHelpful","R3W0PR9ZQ9DT7G","AD3PHHFTCOBT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD3PHHFTCOBT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

These work great, but I always seem to forget a portable battery pack at least once a week which makes my day extremely stressful.

The battery case itself is very easy to use all you do is press a button to turn on the charging feature. LED light will indicate how much battery is left in the case so you never have to guess how much juice you have left. When you want to charge this case you simply plug it in just like your cell phone, super simple!The only downside to this case is the fact that it doesn’t have cross through technology, meaning when you plug in the case to charge it doesn’t charge the case then switch and start charging your cell phone. You have to charge both individually at night which can be a hassle to some, but it’s not  a huge deal to me.I absolutely love this case!

"My phone and tablet have quickly become irreplaceable in my life, and when one of them dies while I’m out and about there is nothing that stresses me out more. I hate having to frantically search high and low for a wall outlet, and, even worse is when there are no outlets available.

I love the fact that it can charge 4 devices simultaneously if you so wish. It charges my phone VERY quickly which I can appreciate, and furthermore charges my phone so that I can actually disconnect it from this charger and use it on its own. There’s nothing that I hate more than a portable charger that just gives your phone enough juice to stay alive but not to actually disconnect and use it on its own again.I tested this charger out on my Samsung Galaxy S4, my brother’s iPhone 6 plus, 4 different Android tablets, 2 Kindles, Bluetooth headphones, a GPS, and another portable charger, and this device charged them all perfectly! I enjoy the LED indicator lights on the side that way you know how much charge you have left on this device itself.This charger fits easily into my purse with no issue whatsoever. It’s relatively thin for how powerful it is, so it slips in to my purse and it’s ready to go at a moment’s notice! This has become the only charger I take with me when I go out simply because it charges my devices at top speed, and it seems to hold a charge FOREVER. I normally only need to charge this device once a week after using it every day, sometimes multiple times a day.I charge this PowerBus on Sunday nights, when I’m settling down for the night to watch T.V. I throw this on the charger and when I get up in the morning it’s fully charged and ready to go for the entire rest of the week!If you are looking for a high capacity charger you need this PowerBus by Elivebuy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LS5ZRQVYLE9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQ0042M#wasThisHelpful","R1LS5ZRQVYLE9S","AD3PHHFTCOBT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD3PHHFTCOBT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The picture is crisp and clear and all of my T.V. shows are high def looking.My favorite thing to do with this tablet is watch my shows from Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, or online in general.

"I love cooking, and find myself to be a big kitchen gadget connoisseur. One thing that I have quickly learned is that you need to have a range of different cutting boards for different needs. You should never use the same cutting board for fruits and veggies that you use for raw meat because of the possibility of cross contamination, so this plastic cutting board set is great! There are three different sized cutting boards to fit each and every need.What are the features?  Dishwasher safe for easy cleaning·  Will not warp or degrade·  Rubber feet so they don’t slip and slide around your counter·  Large size: 16’’x10’’ Medium: 13’’x8’’ Small: 10’’x6’’ each board is 1/3’’ thick·  Large handle which means it’s easy to transport your cutting board anywhere you need to go·  Each board has a groove on one side to collect juice from meat, fruit, veggies etcMy Opinions:I really enjoy these cutting boards because they are so versatile, the finish is very smooth so it doesn't feel like it’s dulling your knife down. You will start to see knife marks but that’s no big deal seeing as it is after all a cutting board.  I have been using these cutting boards for quite some time and they are still looking as good as they ever did, no knife marks have shown themselves as of now!I also appreciate how easy these cutting boards are to clean, all you need to do is hand wash or throw them in the dishwasher and forget about them.

"For whatever reason, my cell phone doesn’t get very good signal in my home so I had to switch back to using a land line while I’m home. This has unleashed a load of crap, solicitor, telemarketer, robo calls and it drives me absolutely nuts every single day. I find that even when I explicitly tell these people to stop calling me, they don’t listen and continue to call. The final straw was on Christmas day actually, a company called my home 4 times on Christmas day and it drove me up the wall since I had company. With the CPR Call Blocker I can now easily and effectively block these unwanted calls and not worry about them not taking me off of their list.What are the features?·  3’’ Caller display screen·  Block area codes, international, private, unavailable, or masked calls·  Has the ability to block nuisance callers by pressing #2 on DECT extension handsets·  1200 number capacity·  Line powered (no external power or batteries needed)·  Block unwanted callers at the touch of a buttonSet up:This device is very easy to set up, all you do is hook it to your already existing phone line and it’s ready to go. Once it’s hooked up you can go in to the menu and look at the different features, and if a call comes through that you want to block, simply press the big button that says block now!My Opinions:This Call Blocker is an absolute life saver! I love the fact that I can block these unwanted calls without having to speak to these people. I can’t stand when I tell them to stop calling and take me off of their list and they don’t do it, so the fact that I have the option to do it myself is worth it’s weight in gold!

"Cooking is one of my favorite things to do, however I live alone so it is very difficult to find meat packaged perfectly for just myself. I find that I wind up wasting quite a bit because I end up cooking all of it and throwing away half before I’m able to eat it, or I keep half in the packaging and it ends up with freezer burn. With the VonShef Premium Vacuum Food Saver and Sealer System I am able to vacuum seal my unused food items and keep them stored perfectly for as long as I want to. This system is so easy to use that even a kitchen novice can use it with ease!What are the features?·  Seal food in seconds retaining it’s freshness and nutrients for longer·  Allows for both a vacuum seal, or regular seal only·  Prepare meals with a Sous Vide·  Protects food from bacteria and prevents freezer burn·  Pulse function to control vacuuming in small stages which is ideal for soft food packagesUsage tips:This VonShef Food Sealer System is a breeze to use, it isn’t difficult at all, but one word of advice to people just getting started is to take your time. Don’t rush because you want this done perfectly that way you won’t mess up and possibly ruin your food. When cutting your bags, take great care to make sure the cuts are as straight and uniform as possible; this will make for a better seal as well as a better aesthetic look when storing the sealed foods. Also, be sure to make you bags long enough especially when using the vacuum seal function. The bags should be a couple (at least 2) inches longer than whatever food item you are placing in them, this is a great rule of thumb. It’s better to have too long of bags than too short. As the final tip, make sure that you always have the lid properly closed; you should hear a click from both sides when closing, if you don’t hear that click open the lid and try again.My Opinions:I truly don’t know how I lived without this VonShef Food Sealer System all of these years. I feel like I am able to keep my food much longer and even grocery shopping is much simpler because I no longer have to search high and low to find “single person” packaged food items. This sounds so sad but it’s true! The Food Sealer System works like a charm! I love the fact that I can not only vacuum seal foods like meats, cheeses, fish etc, but I can also seal food items that could easily be crushed like cookies or chips.The machine itself isn’t the quietest thing ever, but that is never an issue for me. This product does the job and does it well and that’s all that matters to me. I have been a sealing fool I actually went through my entire freezer and sealed products that I had in different packaging. One of the things I really enjoy is having all of your food sealed because then it looks nice and uniform in your freezer and you can actually fit more in there when you don’t have the big bulky packaging on it any longer.This VonShef Food Sealer System would be great for anyone from a single person such as me to a large family! If you want to save your food you need this food sealer system. I received this product for evaluation, but these are my own opinions.

"I live in an apartment, so I don’t have a doorbell but I find if I’m in a far back room it’s too difficult to hear someone knocking on my door. I ran across the Tenswall Wireless doorbell Kit, and I just had to have it. This doorbell kit is completely wireless and comes equipped with an adjustable sound level as well as 52 different chime tones to choose from.What are the features?·  Kit comes with 1 transmitter (push button) and 1 door chime (receiver)·  Supports a wireless range of up to 1,000 ft.·  Over 52 chime tones from the traditional Ding Dong, to various well known melodies·  4 levels of adjustable sound volume·  Can be plugged in to an electrical outlet in your home·  Push button can be affixed to the door frame with the screws provided or using double sided stick tabs also included·  Blue LED flashes when someone is ringing the doorbell·  Sleek design won’t take away from the aesthetic of your homeThe set up:This wireless doorbell was ridiculously easy to set up, I was actually surprised how easy it was. I thought I would have to charge something and I didn't at all. I simply popped the cover off of the transmitter and put in the included battery and popped the cover back on. I then plugged the receiver in to an unused wall outlet and chose my selected chime. I adjusted the level of the chime and I was ready to go. I affixed the transmitter to my door frame using the included 3M strip and that was that. I was ready to go. I was so shocked that it went so smoothly I actually tested the doorbell myself a few times to make sure it worked, and it did.I love that it’s now an option to have a wireless doorbell since as I said before I do live in an apartment. The range of this doorbell is excellent, and the fact that you can adjust the level of sound is great as well. I can be in the back room of my apartment and hear perfectly when someone rings this doorbell.

This burner is completely induction so you do need special pots and pans, but it is well worth it! Induction cooktops cook your food much faster, more evenly, and without emitting tons of heat into your home.What are the features?·  Uses 120 Volts, 15 Amps of electricity·  Lightweight and compact for easy travel·  Digital control panel makes for no guesswork·  Built in count down digital timer for up to 170 minutes·  10 temperature ranges from 140 degrees to 460 degrees Fahrenheit·  6 foot cord·  Auto pan detection will automatically shut the unit down after 60 seconds if no cookware is detected on the burnerMy opinions on the product:I am an avid cook, and I would consider myself to be a very good cook as well. I am very used to using my electric stove, which admittedly isn't very fast when it comes to boiling water for example. This Induction cooktop by Duxtop was so fast at boiling water I couldn't even believe it! This cooktop boiled water in well under three minutes  and was super easy to use. I appreciate the fact that this cooktop has a timer built right in, I’m used to having a timer on my oven but not my stove, I find this a very handy feature. I use this mainly when making things like rice or boiling eggs where timing is key.The digital controls are very user friendly and make using this cooktop a breeze. There is no guesswork at all. With my traditional electric stove there are 6 temperature settings, but I never know exactly what temperature they are set at, with this induction cooktop I don’t have to worry about that.I am so sold on this cooktop I want to recommend it to everyone in my family. I think I will buy a (super) early Christmas present for my mom and get her one! I believe I will now be using this more than my traditional stove. I received this product for evaluation, but these are my own opinions.

"I have naturally very curly, frizzy hair that is unruly unless I straighten it. I normally use a straightener on my hair every couple days or so, but I find that certain straighteners work better than others. The ISA Professional 1 Step Victorya Tourmaline Flat Iron works perfectly for my hair. It leaves it soft and smooth, and shiny as ever!What are the features?·  SMART automatic temperature adjusts to your hair without you having to set a temperature·  100% Solid Tourmaline Ceramic pivoting plates·  Universal voltage so that you can easily travel with it·  360 degree swivel and no tangle cord·  Full 2 year warranty·  Emits negative ions to smooth and protect hair·  You can also give your hair soft bouncy curls or wavesHow to use a straightener:·  Make sure your hair is thoroughly combed out·  Dry your hair completely·  Apply heat protectant·  Section your hair across your head length wise·  Work in one inch sections and comb out each section before straightening·  Place the iron at the root of your hair and close the plates, slowly pull the iron down the length of your hair·  Repeat the previous step one more time·  Continue for your entire headMy Opinions:The ISA Professional Victorya Flat Iron has been absolutely wonderful for my hair. I find that my favorite feature of this straightener is the SMART technology that allows it to automatically adjust to your hair’s ideal temperature. This technology senses the thickness and texture of your hair and adjusts the iron’s temperature accordingly. This has really helped me save my hair because with other irons I would turn the iron way up to the max thinking that if it wasn't up that high it wouldn't do anything for my hair, which was of course false.The Victorya Flat iron makes it extremely easy to straighten my hair, and the fact that it has pivoting plates means it doesn't miss even one single strand. This iron is also a relatively thin iron, so it’s also very easy to create beautiful bouncy curls if you wish.The Victorya Flat Iron heats up almost instantaneously. It doesn't take long at all for this iron to be ready to go, I plugged it in and in well under 3 minutes it was hot and ready to use. As I said before my hair is extremely curly and unruly, but after using this iron it looks soft, sleek, and beautiful.I would even recommend this iron to those of you that have short hair. It is a thin flat iron, so it’s perfect to get even the shortest pieces of hair up at the root and could be a very handy tool to use when styling your hair.

"Winter is upon us and during the cold months of the year my lips get outrageously dry, chapped, and, yes, flaky. I hate having dry lips and sometimes it gets so bad that they crack especially at night while I’m sleeping  so I have become somewhat of a lip balm connoisseur. I find that most lip balms wear off of my lips within a few short minutes after applying and then it renders it useless to me. This Buzz Balm All Natural Peppermint Lip Balm by Beessential moisturizes my lips without leaving them feel greasy, and it sinks in to my lips immediately, making it last all day.What are the features?·  Made in the USA·  Invigorating·  Has vitamin EMy Opinions:I  absolutely love this lip balm, I have found my holy grail and I will never switch to another lip balm. I appreciate the fact that when I apply this balm it doesn't render my lips greasy feeling so the point that it’s slipping off of my lips, it actually doesn't leave them feeling like they have much of a residue at all, and I enjoy that. It takes just a second for my lips to benefit from this moisturizer, and once they do they feel completely changed. My lips can be chapped and flaking, but once I apply this balm and rub my lips together a few times they feel fresh and soft. I even enjoy applying this balm after my lips have already cracked, and it helps stop them from cracking any further.The scent of this balm is great also, I love minty smelling lip products, and this one does not disappoint! The Peppermint is uplifting and invigorating and feels wonderful on your lips. I would recommend this lip balm by Beessential to anyone, it would also make a great gift!

"It is my dream that within my lifetime, we will make contact with intelligent alien life.  (Or more likely, they will make contact with us.)  Sure, I’d like for them to treat us nicely and go easy on the anal probes, but all things considered, death by alien invasion wouldn’t be a bad way to go.  I’m happy to read any author’s take on what human interaction with aliens might look like, and Michel Faber presents a story that is incredibly unique.  In The Book of Strange New Things, there is no alien invasion.  Instead, when the story opens, we have already made contact with aliens on a planet we’ve named Oasis.  A  U.S. corporation has set up a settlement and and engages in trade with the aliens: our drugs for their food.  But the aliens now have a new request.  They want a Christian minister to replace the one who mysteriously disappeared.  Yes, these aliens are Christians.  Peter accepts the mission, even though it will mean leaving his wife, Bea, behind on Earth.I read this book about two weeks after Faber’s earlier book, Under the Skin.  Because of my experience with that book, I kept waiting for something “Under the Skin-ish” to happen.  (If you’ve read the book, you’ll know what I mean.  If you haven’t, I won’t spoil you.)  I labeled the book as science fiction, because with a setting on another planet populated by aliens, it seemed unavoidable.  But this story is really more about Peter’s marriage, his faith, and his desire to share his faith with the aliens, who happen to be very eager sponges.  This is one of the most religion-heavy books I’ve read, but as someone who is not at all religious, it managed to not be off-putting.But as Peter becomes more focused, and possibly obsessive, on his mission, his marriage to Bea is faltering.  Their only method of communication is via a form of email, and as Bea becomes increasingly distressed by things that are happening in her world, Peter is finding it harder to tear himself away from his alien congregation.  I found so much beauty, at least initially, in Peter’s relationships with some of the individual aliens.  They are gentle and kind, and for a minister, they are perfect pupils.  But I began to question whether Peter’s dedication to his mission had more to do with serving his congregation or with something a little less altruistic.  And even if he is not self-serving, how can I respect this man when he seems to content to sit back while his wife’s life seems to be falling apart?  Peter struggles with these questions, too, and even if he doesn’t always do the right thing, he at least has the ability to ask himself the difficult questions.I didn’t get nearly as many answers as I would have liked, but the story was written so beautifully, it was hard to mind.Note: This review is based on a finished copy provided by the publisher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WAFLR4IIJXGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K4C3QWS#wasThisHelpful","R2WAFLR4IIJXGW","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wasn't sure how my two cats (one short-hair and one medium-hair) would take to this brush. I had only used one of those ""brush mitts,"" and this particular brush could not have been any more different. But after they both gave it an initial skeptical glare, they are now hooked. I thought the mitt had been doing an adequate job, but now that I see how much hair this brush removes, I know that the mitt just wasn't doing enough. The needles on the brush are quite sharp, so the first two times I used it, I applied just a tiny bit of pressure. Even then, the brush removed a great deal of hair. I've been gradually increasing the pressure (the instructions stating to watch out for redness and irritation made me cautious), and the results have been increasing, too.

"I had not used a dehdyrator before I was sent a sample of this one to review, but I had been considering trying one.  I buy lots of sundried tomatoes, and the premium you have to pay gets to be a bit much.  So, I was excited to get a chance to start drying food on my own.I did a bit of research after I received the dehydrator to understand the main differences between the two primary types of dehydrators.  (If you are already educated on this topic, skip on down to the next paragraph.)  Dehydrators typically come in one of two forms: 1) A higher-end type with a fan and a side-mounted or top-mounted heating element; or 2) a lower-end type with no fan and the heating element on the bottom.  This Homeleader dehydrator is the latter.Having no fan means that food takes much longer to dry.  I first experimented with one tray of cherry tomatoes sliced in half, and they took about 20 hours to dry. From what I researched, a fan could cut that time down to about 4-6 hours.  I've since started cutting my cherry tomatoes down to thirds and quarters, and I've got the drying time down to about about 12 hours.The other drawback I mentioned is the bottom-mounted heating element.  Food and juices will always drip to the bottom, and as a result, this base is very difficult to keep clean.  The base is not dishwasher-safe, and it can't be immersed in water, so you have to reach in to try to clean around the coils.  (The trays ARE dishwasher-safe, but because they are so large, I can only get two in my dishwasher at a time.)The dehydrator is 13 inches in diameter, and with the five trays and the lid placed on top, the entire appliance is 12.5 inches tall.  In other words, it's very large.  While you can, of course, store the base, the trays, and the lid separately, none of the pieces nest, so you don't have the opportunity to save any space.  The 13 inch diameter means that I can't store any of the pieces in my wall cabinets.  Instead, I take it apart and store the pieces in a couple of deeper base cabinetsBottom line - if you are looking for a lower-end dehydrator, this works well.  Just keep in mind what you are giving up in order to get those savings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RSGJJ3MHNU9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXEW2AA#wasThisHelpful","R2RSGJJ3MHNU9H","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2.5 starsNote: I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.WARNING: Contains some spoilers regarding events that occurred during Mia's kidnapping.I’ve mentioned before in a couple of reviews of new adult novels how much I hate when the female main character falls in love with with a stalker-ish, obsessive dbag. The Good Girl takes it to another level by having Mia fall in love with Colin, her kidnapper who abuses her and regularly threatens to kill her. It’s made clear that this is not an example of Stockholm Syndrome, and that Mia is genuinely in love with Colin. I hate these abuser/abusee “romances,” and had I known that The Good Girl featured one, I would never have read it.I know that not every reader feels as strongly as I do about this topic, and I can set aside my feelings to appreciate the positive aspects of the story. There are three POV's and three timelines in the story, and this works. They all help to tell Mia’s story before, during, and after her kidnapping. We can never fully get into Mia’s mind, but these characters help us to chip away at Mia’s barriers.The only character I really had any sympathy for was Mia’s mother. She was a neglectful parent to her two children and the very definition of trophy wife to her obnoxious, domineering, uncaring husband. I absolutely bought that her daughter’s kidnapping transformed her and made her determined to make up for her past mistakes. She has a lot to atone for, and she begins to do so with her relentless search to find out what happened to Mia.On the other end of the spectrum is Colin, the kidnapper. Even though his actions are despicable, we are supposed to begin to care for him, just as Mia does. Sorry, but it didn’t work for me. We are giving an incredibly lame and cliched excuse for his decision to engage in kidnapping and terrorizing people. Even though he abuses Mia, we are supposed to forgive him when he begins to treat her not quite so terribly. The relationship between the two is impossible to accept, and I thought it was more than a little disgusting.The Good Girl ends on a high note, though. If you’ve heard anything about this book, you’ve heard about its ending.

The cord with the 3.5 mm jack is 32 inches long, and the cord connecting the two speakers is 28 inches.I love the design and function of Arctic's products, and these speakers are no exception.  These little cubes look great on a shelf or on a desk.  I've used them with my laptop, my iPhone 5, and my iPad Air, and these speakers provide a great enhancement to the sound versus my devices' included speakers.  No, the sound is not exceptional, but with the price and portability of the speakers, you can't expect that.Finally, I love the carrying case.

"I loved the beginning of The Girl in the Well, which introduced us to Okiku,a young girl who was thrown in a well and murdered. The story is based on popular Japanese folklore, and Okiku's spirit now roams Earth, avenging the murders of other children. Okiku can see the spirits of the dead children clinging to the backs of the people who murdered them. That's quite an image.We enter the world of the living when Tarquin and his cousin, Callie, come on the scene. Tarquin is haunted by another spirit, much more malevolent than Okiku. When it becomes clear that Tark's life is in danger, Callie is determined to learn the origins of his haunting, and even Okiku takes an interest in him.As much as I enjoyed the beginning of this story, as it progressed, it became more a recitation of Japanese folklore and less of a story. It's not that it wasn't interesting, but so much information was thrown at me that it was hard to keep up.While there was a decent amount of creepy imagery, I didn't find anything frightening, and that was a disappointment.Note: I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34A2R49NPVU3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IJEVNCS#wasThisHelpful","R34A2R49NPVU3S","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have only tested this grinder set with pepper, due to many of the reviews noting that salt causes this to rust badly.  When I first took these out of the box, I noted how sturdy this felt, despite the size, with the exception of the spring.  The spring seems a bit flimsy and liable to get bent.When I tested the plunger without pepper, it depressed easily, with very little effort.  I thought: This is going to be a breeze to use.  The first problems occurred when I tried to put the pepper in.  Because these grinders are so small, more pepper was falling into my hand than going into the grinder.  I almost think you need to use a funnel.  And then, as more peppercorns are dropped in, the grinder piece kept getting shifted to the side, and I had to pour the pepper out and start over.  After several attempts, I finally got it sufficiently full.Now, the next problem.  It's not that easy to use this with just a thumb, as shown in the pictures.  Sometimes, it works.  Other times, the grinder piece gets stuck, and I have to hold it in one hand and press down hard with my other palm.  There is no way to adjust the coarseness (this produces very fine pieces), and each push produces just a bit of pepper.These aren't ideal for me, because I like coarse pepper, and I use quite a bit of it.  But if you use just a little pepper, you will probably like the look of these grinders on your table.Note: I received a sample of the product in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ9R6K3OHDCZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009G1RTX0#wasThisHelpful","RZ9R6K3OHDCZG","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s impossible to read The Last Policeman and not think about what you would do in the event of an impending, doomsday-level asteroid strike on earth.  I have to admit that I find the idea exciting, in the same way that I find the ideas of a zombie apocalypse or an alien invasion exciting.  (Yeah, I’m weird like that.)  While I’ve read and watched my share of post-apocalyptic books and films, pre-apocalyptic stories seem to be a bit harder to find.  The first book that comes to mind is The Age of Miracles by Karen Thompson Walker, which is about what happens when the speed of the Earth’s rotation begins to gradually slow down.  Answer – bad things.  As for films, we have the atrocious Armageddon, the somewhat better Deep Impact,  and the amazing Melancholia, which is on Netflix, if you haven’t seen it yet.  All three of those films depict versions of what happens in the last days leading up to an asteroid strike.The Last Policeman explores this topic in more depth.  The world has about six months left, and Earth’s inhabitants, who may be the last ones left before humans go extinct, respond in very different ways.  Some flee their families to fulfill their bucket lists.  Some spend their days hoarding guns, food, and building shelters that will likely prove useless.  Some commit suicide.  Some resolve to carry on as normally as possible until the end.  This is where we find Hank Palace.Hank is a newly promoted detective.  He was promoted out of necessity, since so much of the police force has abandoned their jobs.  Police departments around the country are not very interested in investigating crimes, focusing their attention instead on maintaining order.  When Hank comes upon what looks like one of the increasingly common suicides, it’s expected that he will rubber stamp it and move on to more important things.  But Hank sees some things that don’t fit a suicide.  Against the pressure and ridicule of his colleagues, he presses forward, determined to find out what happened to this man, even as Earth’s remaining days wind down.Hank has a quiet thoughtfulness about his job.  His doggedness under any other circumstances would be admirable, but when humanity has only a few months left, I think it’s fair to ask: Does this one man’s death matter?  Perhaps even more important: Is Hank making the best use of his remaining days?  At times, Hank seems blind to the impending apocalypse.  I can kind of appreciate someone who goes about his life with a business as usual attitude, but at the same time, I can’t understand why he’s not out fulfilling his bucket list, like many of the other characters in the book.  But…even as I write that, I have to question whether the dead man deserves some sort of justice, if he was, in fact, murdered.I love the questions The Last Policeman raises.  The mystery that runs throughout the book held my interest, but more compelling is to think about what I would do in this situation.  I might try to do some bucket list things, but I’d probably try to spend my remaining time with my family.  And I would definitely make time to finally read A Song of Ice and Fire. :)Note: I received a copy of the book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH230W9S1IC0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0076Q1GW2#wasThisHelpful","RH230W9S1IC0O","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used a couple of ice ball makers in the past, and they were significantly easier to use than this.  First, those molds were clear and marked with a fill line, and it was easy to see the appropriate amount to fill.  With this product, since there were no instructions included, I had to try to figure it out on my own.  I tried to pour water through the openings, but the openings are so small that more water went around the outside than inside.  And because I couldn't see through, I had no idea how much water to put in.I then read several reviews that included some filling tips.  (Note to the manufacturer - customers should not have to rely upon other reviewers for instructions.)  I followed those tips, and the results were somewhat better, but far from perfect.  (I've posted a photo to show you the best I was able to do.)Because of the opaque color and the way this mold is constructed, I don't believe you will be able to make ice balls from bottled water or from a filter in the fridge.  A very slowly running faucet seems to be the only choice.Note: I received a sample of the product in exchange for an honest review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DBJ4Q7ZJPZ2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KCFDB4U#wasThisHelpful","R1DBJ4Q7ZJPZ2L","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I cook frequently with garlic, and I usually use one of the rocker mincers.  This press is far superior, in both construction and in the mincing performance.  The first thing you'll notice is how surprisingly heavy and sturdy it feels.  This is not a piece of cheap metal 0 it's quality stainless steel.So far, I have only used this with peeled cloves, but based on some of the reviews, I'm going to try it with unpeeled cloves.  Once you place the clove in the chamber, one easy squeeze minces the garlic into very small pieces.  Most of the garlic falls out onto my chopping board, but I do need to use a knife to scrape off the rest.  I don't think there is any way to get around that.Before washing in the dishwasher, you will probably want to remove any garlic film that is left inside the chamber.  The first time I washed it, I wanted to see if the dishwasher could remove the film, but that didn't work.

"I'm a tea drinker, and I've been using this French press on a near-daily basis since I got it.  (I'll save it for coffee for when I have visitors.)  The press itself is very nice-looking.  The carafe has a Pyrex feel, and it's surrounded in places by plastic to protect your hands from heat.  With the exception of the flimsy plastic lid, the plunger is made of stainless parts, and it glides easily down the carafe.  My tea tastes fantastic when brewed in this French press.The only thing I don't care for is the awkward feel of the handle.  I assume it's curved like that to protect the user's fingers from the glass, but the result is that the carafe becomes top heavy.

"I do yoga barefoot when I'm at home, and I thought these socks seemed like a great idea.  Going barefoot is not my choice, but the combination of regular socks and hardwood floors and yoga is not a good one.My feet are size ten (women's). and I selected the large size of these socks.  I had never worn full toe socks before, and both the putting on and the wearing takes a bit of getting used to.  The large fit my feet well, but my long toes seemed to be a problem.  As soon as I took a step, the nubs on the bottom of the socks did what exactly what they were supposed to do - they stuck my foot in place and prevented it from sliding.  However, this caused toe portion of the socks to pull tightly and quite uncomfortably on the skin between my toes.  It was uncomfortable enough that if I had worn these socks for a full yoga session, I likely would have rubbed that skin raw.  I tried to pull the toes of the socks forward to give some slack, but that didn't work.  My foot just slid forward in the sock, and it was still uncomfortable.There are so many good reviews for these socks, so I'm assuming the problem might be related to my feet.  My toes are quite long, and perhaps there is just not enough material in the toe area of the socks to accommodate them.  I had to take the socks off after just a couple of minutes.  I'll see if I can stretch out the toes by hand to make the socks more comfortable to wear.

"Note: I received a copy of the book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.After finishing Bittersweet, I’m wondering if I was supposed to love the MC, Mabel, or to hate her. I suspect we’re supposed to regard her as plucky and resourceful, but she’s really quite awful. When we meet her, she’s in the midst of what looks like a Single White Female type of obsession with (or possibly a crush on) her beautiful roommate, Ev Winslow. I thought that this had the potential to be fun, but that angle is quickly discarded for a ho-hum murder mystery involving Ev’s family.But first, we need to get Mabel to Ev’s family’s summer compound, known as Winloch. It seems that Ev has only the most minimal amount of tolerance for Mabel, so I was as shocked as Mabel was when Ev invited Mabel to visit her family for the summer. Mabel leaps at the opportunity – anything to be close to Ev and to win her affection. When the girls arrive at Winloch, Mabel is surprised to see it consists of somewhat shabby houses. Aren’t these people supposed to be rich??? Ev then tells Mabel that she needs help cleaning up one of the houses so that her mother and father would transfer ownership to her. No, it didn’t make much sense when I was reading it, either.Quite suddenly, unbelievably, and without provocation, Mabel transforms from Ev’s lapdog into an overbearing, scheming villain. With a tiny bit of coaxing from one of the Winslows, Mabel begins to spy on all of the family members. She’s instructed to “take them all down,” and her reward will be one of the Winslow’s houses. She inserts herself into the middle of the family drama and pries into their financial affairs. She spies on them while they’re having sex. She feels perfectly entitled to ownership of a house that has been in the family for generations. If that’s not enough, here’s a few more of Mabel’s not-so-shining moments:- When someone reveals a pregnancy to Mabel, Mabel’s first thought is, “How is this going to disturb MY life?”- She bursts into tears at a restaurant because she’s under-dressed.- She’s upset at the gift of a friendship bracelet from a younger girl, because rich people are supposed to give extravagant gifts.- She feigns sympathy with a mother bereaved over the loss of her son in order to pump the woman for Winslow family secrets.- She’s informed that a family member to whom she’s grown close is dying of brain cancer, but moments later, Mabel is laughing and continuing on her quest to take down the Winslows.- She resents a dog for not properly thanking her after she rescued it.The Winslows aren’t any better than Mabel, but at least their wickedness is (unintentionally) cartoonish. What’s the point of Bittersweet? That rich people are evil, twisted, and sick? Even the few “good” ones in this family are characterized mostly by their cluelessness and their total lack of regard for their family members.Bittersweet would have worked better as a telenovela.

"Adam is a normal enough guy; he’s trying to figure out his place in life, he’s hanging onto the fringes of the popular crowd, and he desperately wants to get laid.  His plan?  He will leave the safety of his home in California and stay with his older sister in NYC for the summer.  He wants to get a hot girlfriend so that he can impress his friends back home.  Unfortunately, his plans have a major flaw.  His sister is gay, her circle consists of lesbians and transgender women, and her social life is focused on lesbian clubs and parties.  His chances of meeting a straight girl are not that great.And here is where it starts to get crazy.  At one of these parties, Adam meets a beautiful lesbian named Gillian.  She assumes he’s a transgender guy, he goes along with it, and they start dating.  This is not even the tiniest bit acceptable or excusable, but Schrag’s writing makes it work.  I don’t believe she is approving of Adam’s behavior, but she tells the story in such a way that you HAVE to figure out what happens to Adam and Gillian, even if you find his actions abhorrent.  Will she discover his lies?  Will he confess?  It seems a certainty that she will find out SOME way, how will she react?Because Adam was a jerk for nearly all of the story, I wanted him to have a major comeuppance in the end.  I wanted his lies to blow up in his face.  *****SPOILER ALERT****** Unfortunately, this isn’t what happened.  Gillian does discover the truth, but rather than exploding on him, she basically turns straight.  Does this actually happen?  This is the one part of the book that I just don’t understand, and I don’t know what point the author was trying to make.  Maybe she was trying to take an unexpected route, but Gillian’s acceptance of Adam’s deception just didn’t work for me.  Also, when is having sex with someone under TOTALLY false pretenses ever OK?  Gillian made it very clear that she had no attraction for and no desire to have sex with “bio guys,” and Adam completely violated that. ******END SPOILER******  Despite that, and despite my general dislike of Adam, this book challenged me, it made me laugh, and it shocked me, sometimes all at once.Note: I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R190ZA79CS3YWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544142934#wasThisHelpful","R190ZA79CS3YWJ","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wouldn't have needed this little bluetooth device if I didn't have such an objection to Apple forcing long-time customers to buy adapters for 30-pin devices.  My car is equipped with an iPod player, but it has the 30-pin connection, and I can't bring myself to buy the adapter.  (Sorry, rant over.)  But this little device nicely fills that role. I plugged it into my car using the male to male adapted, paired it with my iPhone, and I was good to go.  The music sounded just as good as I as remember my old iPod sounding in my car.My car has  bluetooth for phone, so I don't expect to use this receiver much to make calls.  I did test out the feature, and the call quality is similar to my car's bluetooth, but it's easier to use the controls on my steering wheel.This receiver is tiny and very, very lightweight.  I can barely feel it when I hold it in my hand.  I hope it can hold it up to normal use.  Ideally, I would put it in my car and leave it there, but the instructions state that it should not be kept in high temperatures.  (Which rules out leaving it in my parked car for much of the year.

"With the teapot's pretty and delicate design, this style won't be for everyone.  But I love it.  Right in the product title, it's listed as having a 24 ounce capacity, but I was still a bit surprised by the small size.  Somehow, the photo gives it a heftier look, in my eyes.  I've posted a picture up top showing the teapot beside a Pyrex measuring cup, to give some perspective.  (The warmer is in the background.)  The size is fine for me, since I typically drink tea by myself.  But if you're looking for a teapot to use with more than a few people, this might not be the best choice.This teapot works as well as any other I've used, but the look adds to experience.  The thin glass means that it must be handled with care.  Even though I was a bit nervous, I did wash the teapot in the dishwasher since the details promise it's dishwasher-safe on the top shelf.

"Complicit is Stephanie Kuehn’s excellent follow-up to her excellent debut, Charm & Strange.  Both novels feature some similar characteristics: a male POV exhibiting some psychological issues, past physical and/or emotional trauma, a big twist, a gut-punch of an ending, and Kuehn’s beautiful writing style.  This time, though, I was not surprised by the twist.  I thought it was telegraphed quite clearly at several points, and because I’d read Charm & Strange, I was already on the lookout.  But figuring out the twist in no way hindered my enjoyment of the book, because it is about so much more than just trying to shock the reader.  It also in no way prepared me for the shocking ending.Jamie has a rags to riches story that is nothing to be envied.  He and his sister were adopted by a wealthy, caring couple, but not before they suffered through witnessing the shooting murder of their mother.  When they were very young, Jamie was the odd, misbehaving child, and his sister, Cate, was the adorable angel.  When they become teenagers, the roles switch: Cate is a convicted arsonist, and Jamie is the golden child.  Complicit takes us back in time to unravel how Jamie and Cate became the people they are today.Jamie’s world is upended when Cate is released from her jail term and begins to contact him.  Her communications are mysterious, ominous, and vaguely threatening.  We don’t know what Cate ‘s goals are any more than Jamie does.  Is she just trying to torment Jamie, or does she want to cause him physical harm?  Even if you figure some things out early on, you’re still going to be affected by the full reveal.  When I compare this ending to that in Charm & Strange, I’d say that Charm & Strange is the more heart-breaking one.  Complicit, on the other hand, is eerie and more than a little frightening.  I WANTED to read more to help me wrap my head around what had just happened, but I cannot argue that Kuehn did not leave her story in exactly the right place.Note: I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HWNRM0KXHMBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HBQ2D1A#wasThisHelpful","R1HWNRM0KXHMBE","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update on June 27, 2014: My original 2 star review is below, and I'm revising it down to 1 star today, five days after the original review.  After using this mouse for less than two weeks, it has become nearly useless.  The mouse stops working and freezes every few seconds.  I tested it with two laptops with the same results.  Unfortunately, this mouse is going into the garbage.Original Review: This is a decent mouse, but not one I'd use for gaming.  It seems like more of a novelty item with the shifting, light-up colors.  It was fun to watch for a few minutes, but I could see it getting distracting after a while, especially if you use it in a darkened room.  And it does not appear that there is any way to turn it out.  (A manual might help, but that's not included.) The styling on the top of the mouse is also a bit gaudy-looking.I use a Razer Death Adder for gaming, which I believe could be considered a mid-range gaming mouse.  Comparing the Klorts to that mouse, it's lacking.  It's made entirely of hard plastic, and it gets uncomfortable quite quickly, which is compounded by all of the sharp edges.  The scroll button doesn't move very easily, and when I try to scroll upward, my finger can just slide right across the surface of the button if I don't push hard enough.  The side buttons are also impractical.  They're quite narrow and are positioned near the top of the mouse and are hard to get to if you're trying to act quickly during a game.If this was marketed as an everyday mouse, I might give it three stars.  But as a gaming mouse, two stars seem fair.Note: I received a sample of this product for review.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7A54K5A35E58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXW6GE0#wasThisHelpful","R7A54K5A35E58","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 stars.I really enjoyed the first book in this series, I Am the Weapon, although I read it under its previous title, Boy Nobody. In this story, the assassin, Boy Nobody, is sent on a new mission, using the name, Daniel. My main problem with the story is that this felt so similar to the previous book - he is to assassinate a powerful man, but allows himself to get too close to the target's child(ren), a major violation of his training. It also seemed that in this book, much emphasis was placed on having characters tell Boy Nobody how fantastic his skills are. I don't remember this from the first book; it seemed we were shown these kills, and it wasn't necessary for other characters to hammer the point home by talking about it.What I did love was how we get to see a more human, vulnerable side to Boy Nobody, and this side is revealed in a very interesting way. As for the ending - Allen Zadoff already proved he has a way with endings - and this one is exciting and intense, if not more than a little far-fetched. It plays out like a Tom Cruise scene from one of his many action films.Despite a couple of reservations, I Am the Mission is a very good thriller, and a few last minute surprises at the end make me think that third book will be eve better.Note: I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30WMRYL20BL4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316199699#wasThisHelpful","R30WMRYL20BL4K","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best part about The Here and Now is this quote by Stephen Hawking at the beginning of the book, “If time travel were possible, we’d be inundated by tourists from the future.” I had never heard that quote before, but after reading it, I thought, “Of course!” It’s heard to argue with this logic. But it’s also a bit depressing to think that time travel will never be possible. So, we will have to be content with books and films about time travel.I’ve read some very good time travel stories, but The Here and Now is not one of them. In the late 21st century, a mosquito-borne plague has wreaked havoc, killing off many people and bringing some very unpleasant changes to society. Some people from this time are sent into the past, to our current time, with strict instructions to do nothing to alter the future. Say what? Why wouldn’t they want to stamp out this plague before it could occur?Prenna is one of these time travelers, and she immediately begins to violate the twelve, seemingly arbitrary, rules. One of the rules forbids travelers from becoming “intimate” with anyone from the present time, but Prenna seems intent to do exactly that. Her target is Ethan, and they immediately embark upon a silly insta-love romance, marked mostly by Ethan’s constant pleading to have sex and Prenna’s half-hearted refusals. This is all in the midst of a looming crisis, and whenever Prenna and Ethan are not talking about sex, they are playing cards. (If you’ve ever wanted to learn to play war or hearts, this is a good instruction manual.) Since I already know how to play those games, I’ll look elsewhere for an enjoyable time travel story.Note: I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U7YDUQWHD2EA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ERTDJKS#wasThisHelpful","R3U7YDUQWHD2EA","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Girl with All the Gifts might be my favorite book of 2014 (so far).  It’s certainly in my top 5.  Before I discuss the book, I have to discuss the synopsis.  I feel like I’ve been complaining about synopses a lot recently, usually because they don’t reflect the tone of the book.  This is probably the most egregious example.  The synopsis is written as though a very young child with a very limited vocabulary is speaking.  You would rightfully assume that the book would be written in this same manner, but you would be wrong.  WHY do marketers do this?  Are they intentionally trying to turn off readers?  I heard about this book from somewhere other than Goodreads, and I’m sure I would never had chosen to read it if he synopsis was all I had to go on.  The main character is a 10 year old girl named Melanie, and I could understand the desire to write the synopsis in a young voice IF the MC had that same voice in a first person narrative.  But that is not the case here.  Melanie is a very intelligent girl, and the narrative is written with an intelligent tone in the third person and doesn’t reflect her voice at all.Sorry to go on and on about this, but I don’t want the odd choice for the synopsis to discourage anyone from reading the book.  Because ALL of you should want to read The Girl with All the Gifts, and I’m going to do my best to tell you why.  I’m going to keep it vague, because you need to discover the secrets of the book for yourself.The story is set in a post-apocalyptic society in the U.K.  Melanie and other children attend school classes, which seems normal enough on the surface, but it soon become apparent that something is not quite right, both with the children and with this school.  We get hints of the nature of these differences early on, but it takes some time to learn what caused the apocalypse and how Melanie’s world reached this point.Melanie has what could be called a childhood crush on her favorite teacher, Miss Justineau.  Miss Justineau sees something in Melanie that stands out from the other children, and she can’t help responding to Melanie’s adoration, even though she tries to keep an emotional distance.  Miss Justineau differs greatly from the other adults in Melanie’s life who treat her with apathy, at best, and shocking cruelty, at worst.  It’s not hard to see why Melanie feels such affection for her teacher.  The scenes between Melanie and Miss Justineau are heat-breaking.  Melanie craves physical and emotional affection, just like every child deserves.  But Miss Justineau can only do so much without risking her life and Melanie’s.The Girl with All the Gifts starts out so strongly, and I thought that there was no way the story could maintain this pace.  I was wrong, because the latter part of the book was even better.  Melanie makes a decision at the end that has enormous implications.  It affected me so much that it took a little while before I could even pick up another book.  But was it the right decision?  I think so, but that doesn’t mean that I was emotionally prepared for it.Public service announcement: The Girl with All the Gifts is published by Orbit, a division of Hachette, the publisher that Amazon is battling.  If you choose to buy this book (and you should!). think twice about buying from Amazon.  Aside from the obvious reasons, Amazon is selling this at list price.  B&N, Powells, and possibly your local indie, too, are selling it for significantly less.Note: I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33T9ULJNVWPKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CO7FLFG#wasThisHelpful","R33T9ULJNVWPKX","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking forward to trying a new iPad cover, because the clasp on my Moko case ceased functioning.  For me, a case that securely closes is a necessity.  Unfortunately, my UAG case does not close, and this seems like the rule, rather than the exception, based on the other reviews.  Magnets are supposed to keep the cover closed, but they must be extremely weak, because I can't feel the slightest bit of magnetic hold, as the cover easily flops open as soon as it passes a 90 degree angle.The other problem, albeit less severe, is the protective cover over the volume buttons makes them difficult to use, and you need to push down quite to hard to use them.Some other qualities might or not be appealing to you, based on what you're looking for.  The case has a utilitarian look, and it has a rubbery feel.  It provides full coverage around the edges and corners of the iPad, but the downside of that is that it's very difficult to remove the case.  I had to struggle with it, and I was worried that my iPad was going to go flying across the room.  My fingers were sore by the time I finally got it out.There are only two standing landscape positions for the case, and one is in a nearly 90 degree position.

"The Gameboard of the Gods was my least favorite of Richelle Mead’s books.  I’ll admit that I didn’t always understand what was going on in Gameboard, and I didn’t understand the heavy emphasis on physical appearance.  I haven’t read any of her other adult books yet, but I loved all of the Vampire Academy and Bloodlines books.  But still, I have such faith in her work that even though the first book in this series didn’t really click with me, I still wanted to check out the sequel.  SCORE!  It was great, and all is right and proper in the world again.  And now that the world and the characters of the Age of X series have been established, we can sit back and enjoy the continuation of the story.Several themes from Gameboard continue here.  First and foremost, we have the relationship between Justin, the investigator of religious extremism, and the Praetorian, Mae, who is essentially his kick-a-- bodyguard.  They had their moment of intimacy in Gameboard, but they are now back to keeping their emotional distance from each other, walls fully in the up position.  Of course, there is the continuing religious mistrust, and as the various gods make their presence more and more conspicuous, we wonder: Can they be trusted?  What is their endgame?Most of The Immortal Crown plot involves a supposedly friendly, diplomatic visit by Mae, Justin, and several other government officials and Praetorians to Arcadia, the RUNA’s southern neighbor.  But both sides have their own separate (and possibly very dangerous) agendas.  The people of the RUNA view Arcadia like a pesky, troublesome little bother.  There are skirmishes, there is the need to keep the little guys appeased, but there is never any question in the eyes of the people of the RUNA that THEY are the big dogs, and THEY are running this joint.  That made me even more shocked to see what life in Arcadia is really like.  Think of some of the awful cults we have had here in America where women are valued only for their ability to breed, where men may have a dozen wives, where women are constantly covered head to toe, and where it’s acceptable and encouraged to rape young girls.  This is Arcadia.As despicable as they are, they still must be dealt with.  And even while both sides are devising various plots and schemes, Mae has one of her own.  She learned (in a VERY interesting way) that her niece was kidnapped and being held in Arcadia.  I loved Mae’s resourcefulness and cleverness in these scenes.  I especially loved seeing her kick a-- all over Arcadia.  She wiggles out of some very close calls in ways that are both jaw-droppingly fantastic, but also believable.  Because, you know, it’s Mae.I’m feeling all sorts of enthused again just writing this review.  If you didn’t really care for Gameboard, or if you’re only familiar with Mead’s YA books, I encourage you to give the Age of X a shot.  While it’s written in a style very different from The Vampire Academy and Bloodlines, it’s got all of the elements that make those books so fun to read.  The ending of The Immortal Crown pretty much knocked my socks off, and it sets Mae and Justin up for some major changes in the third book.On a totally superficial note, I much preferred the design of the Gameboard cover.  It had a very distinctive look, and I loved the icy look of the blue and white.  This one is just so generic.Note: I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W2X4WWSQQ5Y7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3L6JZA#wasThisHelpful","R2W2X4WWSQQ5Y7","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Attachments is my second book by Rainbow Rowell, after Fangirl.  I listened to it on audiobook, which is the perfect format for this story.  Attachments is all about…attachments – those that currently exist, those that have shattered, and those that have yet to be formed.  It’s set in 1999, so we’re able to travel back in time to when the Internet was still the somewhat new world of the World Wide Web and when access to an email account at work wasn’t necessarily a given.  Jennifer and Beth are friends and colleagues at a small newspaper in Nebraska.  When their employer decides to give everyone an email account, Jennifer and Beth abuse the heck out of it, sending long, personal emails back and forth.  We get to know them solely through these email exchanges.  This is where the audiobook really shines, because it added life and personality to the people behind the emails.  We quickly learn that Jennifer is married and stressing about whether or not she should have a baby.  Beth is in a relationship with a musician, but she’s not completely content.In comes Lincoln to spice things up.  While Beth and Jennifer’s chapters are comprised solely of emails, the alternating chapters feature Lincoln’s third person POV.  He works the night shift in the technology department at the paper.  What he thought would be an interesting job in information security turned out to be glorified email checker.  The email filters catch the emails with the designated naughty words, and Lincoln’s job is to read them to see if they warrant further attention.  His job is a joke, and what’s worse is that he knows it.  His only bright spot is the emails from Beth and Jennifer which frequently get forwarded to him since they decided to ignore the company policy and have a little fun.Lincoln doesn’t need to do more than scan the emails, but he is soon engrossed in the personal lives of the women.  He’s captivated by their kindness, their humor, and their openness.  I realize that the way I typed this might make Lincoln seem like a creepy stalker but he is not.  He knows (and we know) that what he’s doing isn’t totally ethical, but we forgive him for it.  He’s too decent and good-hearted to blame him.  And if I was reading those emails, I don’t think I’d be able to stop either.  I’d be thinking, “I want to be friends with these women!”  They are so supportive of each other, there’s no jealousy, and they call each other out when necessary.Lincoln is particularly drawn to Beth, which is a good thing, since she’s the non-married one.  But he has no idea what she looks like, and even though they work at the same company, they’ve never met.  Beth, on the other hand, has no reason to know Lincoln exists, and she certainly has no idea that he’s reading all of her personal emails.  One day, she sees Lincoln in the office and is immediately attracted to him, but she doesn’t know his name.  And soon, Lincoln is reading Beth’s emails about “my cute guy,” and he realizes they’re about him.  So we wait and wait for them to meet.  There are a series of close calls, but it seems like it may never happen.  Of course, we know it will, and the only thing left to wonder is if Lincoln will reveal his secret, or even if he should.  I was on the fence about this.  One the one hand, I’d be completely creeped out if I was Beth, and I learned that this stranger knew intimate details about my life, even if (or especially if) I was attracted to him.  But on the other hand, I wanted them to get together so badly, and I didn’t want Lincoln to spoil it.  Arrrgh!  Moral dilemma alert!No matter what happens, Rainbow Rowell has written another sharp, funny, emotion-filled story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNDWW01IQWK3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004WHT8P0#wasThisHelpful","RNDWW01IQWK3U","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wouldn't normally review a non-Apple USB cable immediately after trying it out for the first time, but the problems with this cable occurred immediately. Here's the dealbreaker: this charges extremely slowly. Unacceptably slowly. I first tried it with my iPhone 5 by connecting this cable to my laptop, which is how I almost always charge my phone. Results: In 20 minutes, it charged 2 percentage points. Yes, 2. Also, when I first connected it, I got the ""This accessory might not be supported."" That's never a good sign, because in my experience, that's a good indication that the cable will completely fail in a month or less.I then tried it with my iPad Air, and the results were even worse. This time, I connected the cable to the iPad Air wall charger (again, this is how I typically charge this device with other cables), and after 12 minutes, it had not charged at all.The lightning connector also has a worryingly tight fit. It takes a bit of force to get the connector into my phone and my iPad, but disconnecting it is even harder. I have to pull quite hard, and I'm genuinely concerned that the force that I have to use could cause the connector to break off in my device.When I look closely at the tip of the lightning connector, I can see some very small scratches and one gouge. Could that be causing the problems? My Apple cable, which I've had for more than six months and use on a daily basis, doesn't have a single visible scratch.This is a shame, because this cable could have been uniquely useful. I was looking forward to having a cable that I could keep stashed in my bag, without worrying that it would get damaged.Note: I received a sample of the product in exchange for an honest review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRX04607W9Y1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JLQU9QO#wasThisHelpful","RRX04607W9Y1","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Think of a film like The Blair Witch Project.  It would have been a much different (and much shorter) film if the characters had been able to whip out their phones to call for help or to open up their GPS.Phones play a big role in After the End, and I can't help wondering if the author wishes we were back in the olden days of no cell phones, because the constant mention of phones throughout the story, combined with one character's inexplicable failure to use one when it would have benefited him, was hard to understand.But before we get to those problems, you should know that After the End gets off to a fine start.  We're introduced to Juneau who lives in seclusion with her ""clan"" in Alaska following the devastating effects of WWIII thirty years before.  They live a wilderness life, with no electricity and no connection with the outside world.  Juneau's only knowledge of the world prior to the war comes from old history books and the tales of the clan's elders.  While hunting one day, she returns to find her village deserted and showing the signs of a battle.  When Juneau sets off to attempt to rescue her family, she finds herself in the bustling little city of Anchorage, and she learns a shocking truth.  There was no war.  Her clan had been lying to her for her entire life, and Juneau is even determined to find them and to learn why.This set-up gave the author a lot to work with, and I wish she had kept her focus solely on Juneau's gradual discovery of this new world.  Instead, the POV alternates between Juneau and Miles, the son of a pharmaceutical bigwig who is trying to find Juneau.  We don't know what he wants with Juneau, but we know he's up to no good.  Miles overhears his father making plans to capture this unknown girl, and with the flimsiest of excuses, Miles sets off to find her on his own.This is just the first of many unrealistic behaviors and coincidences that strains belief.  When I read these kinds of stories, I must make a conscience decision to overlook these problems, or I risk ruining the experience of the book.  After the End skates by, but barely.  I liked Juneau, but I had problems with the fact that she adapted almost immediately to the ""new"" world.  Miles was annoying, at best, and he seemed stuffed into the story just to give Juneau some romance and a road trip sidekick.  At one point, Miles and Juneau separate, and the story became much more enjoyable as a result.Considering that this is the first in a series, I was surprised by how many questions were answered and mysteries were solved.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but since I wasn't exactly thrilled with this story, I'm probably less likely to feel the need to pick up the sequel.  If we can somehow boot Miles from the sequel, I'd be more interested in giving it a chance.Note: I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4GQBICDUTCFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJ34XQU#wasThisHelpful","R4GQBICDUTCFA","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If I could change one thing about this travel pillow, I would make it tighter, so that I got more out of the massage function.  Of course, that could render it unusable for people with larger necks, so I assume this size is a compromise.  As it stands, I need to manually press it against my neck to get the full effect, and that is not practical for long.Still, this pillow's massage function is comparable to others, and I like that it provides a range of massage types.  For me, this is more about relaxation than therapeutic.A drawback to the pillow that is easily fixable is the fact that it does not come with a removable cover.  Even if I used this solely at home, I would want to clean the cover regularly.  But if used for travel, I would need to wash it EVERY time.  The solution is to use a pillowcase made of jersey/t-shirt material, which can be purchased cheaply at Target and other stores.  In a pinch, you could even wrap a regular t-shirt around it.Note: I received a sample of the product in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHJSOCZTB3J5G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IY0J536#wasThisHelpful","RHJSOCZTB3J5G","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, I should mention that at the time of my review, this page is combining listings for two completely different products.  One is for a detached keyboard compatible with various Apple products, and the other is for a bluetooth keyboard case for the iPad Air.  My review is for the keyboard case; the other 10 reviews written prior to mine appear to be for the detached keyboard.Pairing with my iPad Air was a cinch.  For those unfamiliar with bluetooth pairing, the detailed instructions should eliminate any problems.  The top of the case rotates a full 360 degrees, and when turned backwards and laid flat, you can cover up the keyboard if you'd like to use this as a traditional, non-keyboard case.  The top of the case is set back far enough to provide easy access to the top row of the keyboard - about 2 inches back.  (My last case was set nearly on top of that first row, making it very difficult to use.)  The top can be tilted back approximately 50 degrees before it must lie flat due to the weight of the iPad.The keys have a nice, soft feel to them, and the clicking noise is minimal.  The sleep function works very well, and when the charge is running low, there is a flashing red indicator.  The product description advertises 80 hours between charges; I get closer to 90 hours.Note: I received a sample of the product in exchange for an honest review.I have the case in silver, and I love the look of it.  It has a bit of a brushed metallic appearance.  The top of the case has a thin, very light-weight, plastic feel, and the keyboard has a more substantial look and feel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPUILLI1ZFXU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HJXEWVY#wasThisHelpful","RPUILLI1ZFXU0","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I keep most of my scarves either folded up on my shelf in my closet or on hooks I installed in the interior of my closet.  This hanger allowed me to hang up ten of my scarves, thereby freeing up some space.  This hanger isn't designed for very bulky wool or acrylic-type scarves - the openings are too small for that - but for thinner, more delicate scarves, it's perfect.Two additional notes: it's made in China, and there was a strong chemical smell to the wood when I first opened the packaging, but that dissipated after about two days.Note: I received a sample of the product in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UN1YXYIZTK7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GMLTC6Y#wasThisHelpful","R1UN1YXYIZTK7E","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Imagine that you’re about to be crowned Homecoming Queen, and as you do a few last-minutes preparations in the school restroom, the janitor bursts in.  He’s mortally wounded, he makes some bizarre comments, and as he’s dying, he presses his mouth to yours, and a strange…energy fills your body.  You now have superhuman strength and the ability to kick some major butt.This is the awesome opening of Rebel Belle, the new series by Rachel Hawkins.  I’ve only previously read her book, School Spirits.  Rebel Belle has all of the humor and excitement that made that story so much fun.  Harper Price makes for a very interesting protagonist.  She’s the queen of her school, and she has her eyes firmly focused on her future.  She studies hard, and she participates in every activity humanly possible in order to get herself into the college of her choice.  Sharing that odd moment with the janitor was definitely not on Harper’s to do list, and her life is in turmoil when she discovers her new powers and the responsibilities that they entail.  She’s a Paladin, tasked with protecting an Oracle, and if that has you scratching your head as much as I did mine, rest assured that Hawkins shares this mythology in a way that is interesting and does not feel like a Wikipedia entry.Harper’s struggle to accept her new identity was the best aspect of the story.  Sure, she’s thrilled by her new powers.  But when she learns what she has to do with them, she rightfully asks, “Why me?”  It would not have been realistic to expect Harper to immediately leap into action, because it would have been a major contradiction of her carefully constructed persona.  She slowly comes to terms with what she must do, and we can sympathize with her and the fact that this will throw her off her path.There’s a love triangle between Harper and two guys – her good-on-paper boyfriend and David, the quirky reporter for the school paper who loves to torment Harper.  It plays out exactly as you would expect, but this is a case where the love triangle mostly works.  I could believe that Harper would be conflicted by her feelings when having the perfect boyfriend is part of the image she constructed for herself.  So when she starts to have feelings for David, it makes sense that she would struggle to accept them because he does not fit so easily into her Homecoming Queen image.The ending is equal parts silly and raucous and potentially fatal to everyone involved.  Harper Price, the perfect Southern belle, is a little less perfect by the end, but she becomes infinitely more interesting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25M9DX7LAAI78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009VMBK5C#wasThisHelpful","R25M9DX7LAAI78","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"3.5 starsWhen I read the synopsis of To All the Boys I've Loved Before, I felt so much sympathy for Lara Jean, the main character.  Lara Jean has written letters to a number of her crushes over the years, never intending to actually send them.  She pours her heart out in the letters, telling each guy what she loves about him and what she hates.  She recounts events in painstaking detail.  And then, horror of horrors, those letters are somehow taken from her room and mailed.  Lara Jean first learns of this when one of the guys approaches her, puzzled as to why she wrote him this letter.The story wasn't what I expected, based on the synopsis.  I thought Lara Jean would be mortified over the mailing of her secret letters and that she would spend a significant amount of time recovering from the embarrassment.  Perhaps she would even be ridiculed.  When I think how I would have felt if something like that had happened to me in high school, I'm sure I would have been afraid to show my face.  Hell, I'd be embarrassed today if something like that happened!  But all of the guys who received Lara Jean's letters were flattered, if a tad confused.  That was a bit hard to believe.  I would think that at least one of them would have shown it to his friends and had a good laugh over it.  Harder to believe was the fact that Lara Jean somehow seemed empowered, and her social life immediately picks up steam.  Just to be clear, I wasn't wishing the story would consist of Lara Jean hibernating in her room and weeping over the embarrassment, but I didn't find her actual actions to be very realistic.One more criticism, and it's a big one, and then I'll tell you about the things I liked about this story.  There's a love triangle, which is not the end of the world, except...one side of this triangle involves the very recent ex-boyfriend of her beloved older sister.  I've given a hard time to books that involved a girl involved in a love triangle with two brothers, and I think that an MC pursuing her sister's ex is even less endearing.On to the good stuff: - Lara Jean's relationships with her two sisters are so warm and loving (minus the whole ""I'm going after your ex"" thing).  This book made me wish that I had a sister.  Nine-year-old Kitty manages to be precocious without being annoying, and Margot is a wonderfully supportive older sister. - It's easy to see what attracts Lara Jean to both guys.  Neither is perfect, and neither is ridiculously and obsessively in love with her, unlike some less successful YA romances.  They both behave like typical high school guys, with all of the good and bad that that entails. - The ending was what I wanted, even though it still took me by surprise.  It's not all roses, but it's very sweet and very clever.I can't wait to hear what other readers think of the ending.  I think it will be one that divides people, but I thought it was perfect.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28U178SOH6ZJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DA9PX0A#wasThisHelpful","R28U178SOH6ZJR","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you hear the title, Dorothy Must Die, and you picture pretty Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz with her cute pigtails and sweet gingham dress, you know you are in for a twisted ride. In Dorothy Must Die, the characters and the world we know and love are flipped upside down and turned inside out. This Dorothy is a power-hungry, murderous psychopath. She does still have the cute pigtails and the gingham dress, though. The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion, and even Toto bear little resemblance to their more famous counterparts. Let's just say that you would not want to cross their paths in Kansas, in Oz, or anywhere.Amy Gumm is the ""new"" Dorothy. She's a poor girl from Kansas, friendless, picked on, and burdened with a mess of a mother. She's alone in her trailer when a tornado strikes, and she finds herself transported to Oz. Amy knows the story, and she recognizes the yellow brick road, the Munchkins, and the flying monkeys. But something seems...off. This Oz is completely devoid of the brightness and wondrous magic of the other Oz. Instead, Amy immediately finds her life threatened, and she's forced to decide if she should trust the witches she identifies as ""wicked."" There are no easy choices here, and the wrong one will likely result in Amy's death.I loved Amy's introduction to Oz and her gradual realizations of the horrors in this world. Dorothy is a gleeful sadist, and her henchmen - the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Lion - are every bit as terrifying. They are clearly the bad guys, but most of the other characters are difficult to pin down. There are those who want to overthrow Dorothy, but are their motivations purely selfless? It's critical that Amy's instincts are on point, but we don't know whom she should trust any more than she does.The only weak part in the story was when Amy begins training to take on Dorothy. Up until that point, I was having so much fun exploring all the horrors of Oz, and I was disappointed when the plot slowed down. But when Amy is finally sent on her cloak and dagger mission, everything kicks back into high gear.Don't get too comfortable while reading this story, because Danielle Paige has lots of tricks up her sleeve. Just as I was starting to enjoy one character - one who I assumed would play a major role in the story - the character is melted into a gooey pile of blood and skin and bones. Did I mention Dorothy Must Die is dark? And bloody? And violent? And seriously imaginative? I'm already hooked on this twisted world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZOXZU7N7XME9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062280678#wasThisHelpful","R1ZOXZU7N7XME9","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you've been craving a novel that depicts Adolf Hitler in all of his teenager-creeping glory, Prisoner of Night and Fog might be for you. I can usually count on having good luck with historical fiction, particularly novels set during WWI or WWII. (This story takes place in the period between the two wars.) But unfortunately, this book was mostly a miss for me, primarily due to problems with the protagonist.Gretchen is a teenager in Munich, fiercely loyal to the Nazi party. She's known as the ""martyr's daughter"" as a result of events that occurred nearly a decade ago, when her father jumped in front of a bullet intended for Hitler. Since then, her family was taken under Hitler's wing, and Gretchen became a kind of pet to her ""Uncle Dolf."" WWII and the Holocaust are still years away, but Hitler and the Nazis are already sowing the seeds of Jewish hatred. Gretchen has no reason to question these beliefs. If Uncle Dolf says Jews are subhuman, he must be right. She may not possess the same level of hatred, but she does her best to avoid contact with Jews.So far, so good. Many people are raised with prejudices and biases, and Gretchen's beliefs were commonplace at that time. However, when a Jewish boy whispers to her from an alley that he has information on her father's death, it's like a flip is switched, and all of Gretchen's biases quickly disappear. Why would she trust anyone in an alley who is behaving suspiciously, let alone someone she has been raised her entire life to hate? I was excited to read a YA novel set in this period from the German point of view, but unfortunately, the opportunity to explore how someone can overcome deep biases was squandered here. I know that it can happen, but I don't think it happens the way it's portrayed here, when Gretchen so quickly converts from Jew hater to sympathizer.I was also looking forward to seeing how Hitler would be portrayed, with all of his grotesquely fascinating angles. Again, I was disappointed. We view Hitler almost solely through his interactions with Gretchen. Uncle Dolf was a doting father figure to Gretchen ever since her father's death, and she looks up to him in an almost worshipful way. I didn't find it believable when Gretchen quickly turns on him, based on the whispers from a Jewish boy. And loving Uncle Dolf inexplicably turns on Gretchen just as quickly when she seeks him out for help after a vicious beating from her brother. This book is part of a series, so it's not a lack of time that resulted in these abrupt and hard to believe shifts. We all already know how horrible Hitler was, and I think this story would have benefited more from letting us see exactly what made Gretchen adore him so much. It would also have been realistic to show how devastated Gretchen should have been to have her illusions about her dear uncle shattered, but that doesn't happen here.Several times, various enemies of Hitler seek Gretchen out for help in thwarting him. This is even before her ""conversion."" These people stand to lose a great deal from being exposed, so why do they approach Gretchen, of all people? Why do they tell her she's remarkable? These questions are even more mysterious than the meaning of Hitler's mustache.The writing style in Prisoner of Night and Fog is very young. Yes, this is YA, but I'm used to reading YA that has a more sophisticated style. At times, this reads more like a junior-high level history textbook.Despite my misgivings about the first book in this series, I will likely check out the sequel. Now that Gretchen has found her mission, I hope I can sit back and enjoy it, and not be bothered by the unrealistic way in which she reached this point.Note: I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24DH7445M0ZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062278819#wasThisHelpful","R24DH7445M0ZW","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is not my first encounter with a book narrated by a 5-year-old – I read and loved Room by Emma Donoghue.  But with The Bear, the narration was awkward and frustrating.  Perhaps the problem is that I don’t know many (or any) 5-year-olds, and perhaps this book accurately depicts how they think and speak, but after 200 pages of: “I am crying and there is a lake in my body that all the tears come from and it is getting smaller and the lake at my feet is getting bigger at the same time so my inside lake will be dry and I will be die and it will be Momma’s fault because she let me keep crying all day and it feels like a long time,” I had had enough.Both The Bear and Room feature very disturbing plots, especially when you consider that the events are swirling around very young children.  In The Bear, a little girl, Anna, hears her parents being mauled by a bear while the family is camping.  In Room, a little boy is born to a young woman who was kidnapped, raped, and held captive for years.  Both plots are likely more disturbing to the reader than to the children, because the children are too young to grasp the horror of their situations.While both books are told in the voices of young children, Room benefited from having dialogue between the young boy and his mother.  It was refreshing to read words spoken by an adult from time to time.  But in The Bear, both parents are quickly knocked out of commission, and we are left in the head of little Anna.  I was also struck by the fact that Anna had little sense that anything was wrong, even when she saw and briefly spoke to her mother who was mauled badly enough that she was unable to move and presumably visibly injured.  To the parents out there, please feel free to correct if I’m wrong, but wouldn’t a 5-year-old have a sense of danger if she witnessed her mother in terrible shape after a mauling?  Anna’s mother did her best to not frighten her daughter, and she was focused on urging Anna to get herself and her 2-year-old brother to safety.  Even so, I kept wondering why this child had no sense that anything was wrong.OK, so maybe I did want Anna to demonstrate some fear and some awareness of her surroundings, but I’m not totally heartless!  I was also hoping that she and her brother would escape the the hungry bear, and I’m glad that it only took a bit over 200 pages to find out if she was successful.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G1QLC0DFG6IS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CO7FIQ8#wasThisHelpful","R2G1QLC0DFG6IS","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few years ago, I replaced all of my plastic hangers with slim, velvet hangers purchased at Target and Marshall's. From an organizational perspective, it was a great decision. I'd heard that these kind of hangers were great space-savers, but I didn't really believe it until I saw the evidence for myself. Not only do they save space, but they seem to stay in place better, so your closet even looks better-organized, and the velvet helps to prevent clothes from sliding off.The one trade-off with these hangers is that the slimness means that hanging something very heavy might cause the hanger to snap. For that reason, you probably want to hang onto a few of your traditional hangers.These hangers seem very sturdy. I bent the hanger back and forth and squeezed it from top to bottom, and it didn't snap, even though there's a good bit of flexibility. The hangers have notches at the top and a bar across the bottom (unlike some of the cheaper velvet hangers I've purchased), which increases the versatility.On a final note, I hate to describe certain products as being specifically for men or for women, but do note that there is a large heart designed into the hanger. I don't mind this, but I suspect it won't be for everyone.Note: I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCZAUHE6GGCWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GMIKB4O#wasThisHelpful","RCZAUHE6GGCWB","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The last time I had a flu shot, back in 2009, something went wrong, and I had a good deal of pain in my arm for about six months, and I was unable to lift it more than 90 degrees.  (This also explains why I have not had a flu shot in nearly five years.)  The characters in Don’t Even Think About It have a much odder reaction to their flu shots.  Approximately twenty students in one high school class suddenly find that they are able to read each other’s minds, as well as the minds of the unknowing people around them.  This sounded like a compelling idea when I read the synopsis, but the actual story quickly became an exercise in silliness.I imagined there might be government conspiracies or perhaps some attempt to turn the students into valuable weapons.  Really, wouldn’t any government kill to get their hands on someone who can read minds?  If we think the NSA is out of control now, just imagine the havoc they could wreak with a group of mind-readers.  Sadly, the reveal in Don’t Even Think About It is not only an uninteresting letdown, but it’s also nonsensical.  I won’t give it away, but I will tell you that it felt like a wasted opportunity.The majority of the book consists of student after student learning that he/she is suddenly able to read minds.  It becomes tedious very quickly to read various takes on, “What’s happening to me?  Oh, wow, I can read minds.”  Someone who has not ever met a high school student might assume they’re all borderline moronic, because in all of this mind-reading, there is nary an intelligent thought to be had.  When the students realize how many of them have been acquired the ability to read minds, they put their skills to work…in a gym class volleyball game.  Snooze.I’ve wondered what it would be like if people could read others’ minds.  I imagine it would be a nearly useless skill, because most people probably think with a combination of images, words, and half-formed ideas.  How would someone get inside another’s head to interpret what is probably a jumbled mess?  In this book, all thoughts are in coherent, fully-formed sentences, like: “Maybe she wants to talk to Lazar.  Should I stay and facilitate?  She might need my help.”  Does anyone actually think like that?Before deciding to read this book, I should have paid more attention to the awful cover.

"I read Hopeless after seeing many glowing reviews, and I was left feeling disgusted by the behavior of the main characters. I can only believe that people who love books featuring stalkers have never been stalked themselves, and that is a wonderful thing. However, it distresses me whenever stalking and violence are portrayed to girls and women as some kind of manly ideal. I, unfortunately, was the victim of a stalker (threats to kill me, chasing me down a highway, hitting my car, staking out my parents’ house, and on and on) and so when I unknowingly pick up a book that glorifies this behavior, it makes me sick to my stomach.Hopeless follows the same basic recipe for this New Adult genre: insta-lust, a cocky guy who is disturbingly possessive, and a girl who feels unworthy of such glorious attention. Immediately after Sky meets Holder, he slams his fist into the hood of a car. It only gets better. Watch Holder as he repeatedly invades Sky’s personal space and puts his hands on her within a day of meeting her. Watch her love it. On the second day after meeting Holder, Sky tells him, “You’ve scared the s*** out of me at least three times.” He demands to know if Sky is dating anyone, and when she gives an unsatisfactory answer, he punches a locker. Then he “takes a challenging step towards” Sky, and stares at her with “hard and cold” eyes. ”He curls his fingers up into a fist and drops his hand to his side.” We are still on day two, folks. Next, he admits to beating “someone within an inch of his life” and vows to do it again. And still, this romantic twosome argues and fights. According to Sky, “I met the guy a couple of days ago, yet I’ve never argued more with anyone in my entire life.” Don’t you just love it?The hits keep coming. During the next couple of days, Holder goes through Sky’s phone without permission. When she asks him to leave her house, he refuses, and lays down on her bed instead and grabs her and pins her underneath him. So he’s a trespasser, too. Of course, Sky is tickled pink by this behavior. Then, he roughly grabs her wrist in the middle of the cafeteria and demands to know where she got her bracelet. Sky is intimidated and doesn’t reply quickly enough, and his expression “grows even colder. He leans forward a few inches and lowers his voice when he speaks. ’Who gave you the damn bracelet, Sky?’” After slamming his way out of the cafeteria, Holder ignores Sky for a month, with no explanation for his behavior. Please, someone tell me that this is as reprehensible as I think it is. How is any of this romantic? I truly do not understand. For the record, violent, intimidating behavior is not the sign of a powerful man and his deep love for you. It is the sign of an insecure little prick who will behave this way with any woman who will tolerate it.So, do you feel like you’ve got a good idea of the kind of character Holder possesses? What possible explanation could be offered for this behavior? We’re not going to get it just yet. Remember, the last contact between these two lovebirds featured a violent wrist-grabbing and an unexplained brush-off by our hero, Holder. If he doesn’t sound like enough of a creep yet, he pulls out all of the crazy and sneaks into Sky’s bedroom through her window in the middle of the night and climbs into her bed. It’s presented as romantic rather than completely insane and frightening. Our dear Sky views his behavior as “passionate,” and there is so, so much wrong with that.This jackass always offers a “good” reason for his behavior. Reasons, it should be noted, that would be scoffed at by anyone but darling Sky. Sky constantly professes to be scared/annoyed/disgusted with his behavior, but she’s appeased and forgives him when he buys her gifts. Sheesh. What a message for girls and young women. And hey! The great news is that this book features equal opportunity violence when Sky slaps Holder in the face. Violence is fun, kids! Everyone join in, and prove your love and passion with a smack!We’re rolling along wonderfully with the stalking and violent behavior when suddenly, at the 50% mark, Holder pulls a cheap trick. BIIIG secrets are revealed. I want to believe that Hoover had good intentions with a sensitive approach to a difficult topic that affects far too many people. However, with the sensationalized, manipulative, and over the top way she presents the second half of the book, I’m afraid I must conclude: she did it for shock value; she did it as a cheap, convenient way to excuse away Holder’s horrible behavior; and finally, she does not respect her readers. As the unbelievable coincidences counted to mount, my eyes practically rolled out of my head.I have read other books focused on *this* topic, but I never experienced the feelings of heavy-handed manipulation that I felt with Hopeless. It seems like Hoover attempted to wring every last drop of emotion out of her readers, but the entire thing left me cold. This is in stark contrast to two other recent books featuring this topic, both of which tore me apart emotionally because the characters felt like real people to me. I never got lost in Hopeless, in large part because the story felt so phony, and the main characters were awful.I am still trying to wrap my mind around this New Adult genre. If Hopeless, Ten Tiny Breaths, and Fifty Shades of Grey are representative of what the genre has to offer, count me out.Note – I was provided with a copy of the book by the publisher for review.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TG1CEUYYGI79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQ3K8IU#wasThisHelpful","R1TG1CEUYYGI79","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Breath of Frost turned out quite a bit better than I expected, based on what seemed to be a beginning that featured a confusing jumble of characters. But the characters are eventually sorted out, and we have a group of cousins who have recently learned that they're witches. Mayhem ensues, and the girls find themselves facing increasing danger at every turn. The battle scenes were exciting and well-written, and the murder mystery that drives the plot kept me interested.

"I want to hug this book. If you like historical fiction, you need to read A Mad, Wicked Folly. Even if you don’t, I’m going to order you to read it anyway. I’ll even say that it would be a mad, wicked folly for you to skip this book. Heh heh. I’m sorry. That was terrible. I’ll try to make it up to you by sharing all of the reasons I loved this book.A Mad, Wicked Folly is set in London at the beginning of the twentieth century. For Vicky’s family, class is everything. They are members of the upper class, but they are not blue bloods. Vicky’s father earned his fortune in toilets. Yes, toilets. It might not have been the most glamorous way to climb society’s rungs, but it secured their position in London society. Vicky enjoys all of the benefits of her parent’s wealth: a beautiful home, a household of servants, gorgeous clothes, and the ability to mingle with royalty. But along with the glamour comes a life in a “golden cage,” especially for women. Women are to be seen and not heard, wives are expected to be subservient and submissive to their husbands, and to many people, the idea of giving women the right to vote is ludicrous.This is Vicky’s soon-to-be life. Her options, however, were more promising before she impulsively makes the decision to pose as a nude model in her art class. She expects this to remain a secret – she is attending a school in France, after all. But when administrators at her school find out, she is expelled and sent back home to London in shame. Vicky becomes a subject of nasty gossip among the upper class, and her parents are mortified. Her prospects for marriage are severely diminished, and her parents set to work trying to salvage her reputation.Vicky wants to please her parents, but art is her passion, and she can’t do both. It’s considered an inappropriate hobby for a young woman like Vicky, and the thought that she would try to do it professionally is scandalous. So Vicky practices in secret, and thus begins a series of rebellious acts against her parents and society, each of whom has her trapped. She agrees to a marriage arranged by her parents, to a young man from the right family, but who also has his own tainted past. Vicky sees the marriage as a means to an end – the freedom from her parents will allow her to continue with her artwork.But life gets a bit more complicated when Vicky witnesses the first stirrings of the suffragette movement. She recognizes the parallels to her own oppression, and as she sees these women fighting so passionately for the right to vote, she finally begins to question all of the restrictions placed upon her.Every character, even the secondary ones, has layers that are peeled back as the story progresses. Vicky herself , seems like a very realistic depiction of a young, upper-class woman of her time. She is not a clear-cut heroine, but she has moments of heroism. She also has many moments of weakness. She constantly questions herself as she battles with whether to follow the path her parents laid out for her or whether to blaze her own path. Either option will require great strength and great sacrifice.I LOVED the ending to this story. I can’t stop myself from thinking of how I will rate a book as I’m reading it. This was 5 stars all the way, and as I approached the ending, I started worrying that it would end on a false note, and that would likely have destroyed this reading experience. But I should not have worried, because it was perfect, and it was true to all of the characters. Don’t you love when that happens?","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H522MUK9QZTD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DGZKZCY#wasThisHelpful","R2H522MUK9QZTD","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Winter People asks readers to imagine how they'd far go to try to connect to a loved one who has died.  If you think you might do anything to make that happen, The Winter People might make you reconsider.  This is a good old-fashioned ghost story that is alternately spooky and scary and eerie and heartbreaking.The story is told from different view points and in different eras, beginning with the diary of Sara Harrison Shea, written in 1908.  As a young girl, Sara saw her first ""sleeper,"" the ghostly form of a dead child.  Sara asks her dear Auntie about the sleepers, and Auntie tells her that it's possible for grieving people to call a deceased loved one back from the dead.  She promises to pass this information on to Sara when Sara is ready.  As the adult Sara writes her diary, she is distraught over the death of her young daughter, Gertie.  Her husband, Martin, while also distraught, is concerned by Sara's odd behavior.  We readers know that Auntie's promise to the young Sara must be weighing heavily on her mind.In the present day, Ruthie lives in Sara's house with her mother and her young sister, Fawn.  Ruthie wants to escape her small town of West Hall, Vermont, known as The West Hall Triangle due to the large number of unexplained deaths and murders over the years.  There are rumors of Satanism and a doorway to another dimension, which Ruthie dismisses as nonsense.  When Ruthie's own mother disappears, however, she can no longer brush aside the stories.  In the present day, we also learn that Sara was brutally murdered, and this knowledge lends an ominous tone to Sara's diary, as we wonder about the circumstances leading to her death.Aside from the fact that they both inhabit/inhabited the same house, the connections between Ruthie and Sara are not immediately clear.  As the story switches between Sara and Ruthie (as well as a third, slightly less important narrator), we slowly work towards the truth of what happened to Gertie and to Ruthie's mother.  There's a constant feeling of danger of dread throughout both stories, and the supernatural element that appears early on helps to maintain the eerie atmosphere.  One of the biggest questions is whether the supernatural aspect is real or if it was conjured up in the minds of the characters.  We don't get that answer until late in the story, and that was one of my favorite reveals.Note: I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUHVFHXEJTKFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EMXBD4S#wasThisHelpful","RUHVFHXEJTKFC","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fairy tale retellings probably work best when you have a familiarity with the source material. Unfortunately, I’ve only read a few of Brothers Grimm’s original fairy tales on which the short stories in this anthology are based, so I missed out on the experience of making the connections between the stories while I read. Still, several of these were quite enjoyable.The Key by Rachel Hawkins: ★★★★Lana’s mother is a psychic (an ACTUAL psychic) who does readings out of their run-down trailer. Lana also has psychic abilities, and she assists her mother with her customers. One day, two of Lana’s classmates come in for a reading, seeking information on their missing friend. The outcome was somewhat predictable, but it was still exciting and frightening and full of tension.The Twelfth Girl by Malinda Lo: ★★★I generally love stories set in boarding school, and this one features the cliques and the snobs and the trouble-making that makes these so much fun. Liv is desperate to belong to a group of cool girls , no matter what the cost. These beautiful girls who coast through school, unchallenged by the faculty and administrators. But what are these girls hiding? When one of the twelve girls disappears, Liv is given an invitation to take her place. She joins the girls in mysterious midnight excursions to a secret, seductive club. Liv is given one rule to follow, and when she uncovers the secrets of the club, she must decide whether she should break it. The ending is the best part.The Raven Princess by Jon Skovron: ★★★A queen is frustrated by the incessant crying of her baby daughter, and she has a fleeting wish that the girl would fly away with a flock of ravens just outside the window. In an instant, her daughter transforms into a raven and flies out the window. The queen kept this horrible secret from everyone and eventually fled her castle in shame. Sixteen years later, a hunter attempts to kill the girl-raven. He misses his shot, and he’s shocked when the raven speaks and ridicules his hunting prowess. The hunter agrees to help the princess to break the curse that keeps her imprisoned as a raven, and the task he must perform is deceptively simple. Sweet and romantic.Thinner Than Water by Saundra Mitchell: ★★★★What’s worse than a princess who has been transformed into a raven? A princess who is being raped by her deranged father who views her as a replacement for his dead wife. It’s quite beautifully written, but obviously, the subject matter is not for everyone. Augusta, the princess, is heartbreaking as she tries to escape from her father, while no one around her will help, and she hatches a very clever plot to get revenge.Beast/Beast by Tessa Gratton: ★★I might have enjoyed this retelling of Beauty and the Beat more if I had not recently read the lovely Cruel Beauty by Rosamund Hodge.The Brothers Piggett by Julie Kagawa: ★★★★Ah, finally a fairy tale I know well! In this take on The Three Little Pigs, Percival Piggett is a chubby, insecure boy with a crush on a beautiful girl named Maya. He finally gets up the nerve to talk to her, even though his brothers warn him that her grandmother is a witch. It seems that Maya might be starting to share Percival’s feelings, but when he sees her with another boy, he sets off a chain of events that leads to wicked act of revenge.Better by Shaun David Hutchinson: ★★★★Pip is an artificial being, created in the hopes that he could help scientists to cure a deadly disease. Pip believes that he’s real, but the rest of society in this space ship setting believes that he’s disposable. Pip makes a bargain to save his own life, and he fulfills it in a heart-breaking way.Beauty and the Chad by Sarah Rees Brennan: ★★★This Beauty and the Beast retelling was completely ridiculous but had lots of humor. Imagine the Beast as Chad, a low IQ frat boy, and Beauty as a girl posing as a boy. The Beast, who declares himself “no homo,” can’t understand his attraction to the “boy.” And Beauty doesn’t understand 90% of the strange lingo that comes out of Beast’s mouth, but she can see the sweetness underneath the Beast’s exterior. The quirkiness of this story made it stand out from the rest, but whether that’s a good or bad thing will depend on the reader’s taste for this kind of humor.The Pink by Amanda Hocking: ★★This was a bit too happily ever after for my taste, but the story was decent.OTHER STORIESFigment by Jeri-Smith Ready: ★★Before the Rose Bloomed by Ellen Hopkins: DNFLight It Up by Kimberly Derting: ★★Sharper Than a Serpent’s Tongue by Christine Johnson: ★A Real Boy by Claudia Gray: ★Untethered by Sonia Gensler: DNFSkin Trade by Myra McEntire: ★★Sell Out by Jackson Pearce: ★Note: I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3COFFA98USS4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FBZL2P6#wasThisHelpful","R3COFFA98USS4S","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There were several times during Cruel Beauty when I felt hopelessly confused.  I know very little about the tale of Beauty and the Beast, and also woven into this fairy-tale retelling was a good deal of Greek mythology and the supernatural.  But even when I was left scratching my head and trying to figure out what I’d missed, I was captivated by this story.  Hodge tried to cover a great deal of territory in Cruel Beauty, and she did it wonderfully.For all of her nearly seventeen years, Nyx was raised with the knowledge that she had one mission life: she would marry Ignifex, a 900 year old demon lord, on her seventeenth birthday.  Before Nxy and her twin sister were conceived. their father struck a disastrous deal with Ignifex.  His wife was desperate for children, and he went to Ignifex for help.  Ignifex granted the wish in exchange for a very high price, one unknown that was at the time.  Nyx’s mother would give birth, but she would lose her own life.  Nyx not only had to marry this monster, but she was tasked with murdering him to avenge her mother’s death and to save the other people of Arcadia from the evil demon lord.This burden weighs heavily on Nyx, and she has the added knowledge that she is the throwaway daughter.  While her sister receives all of the affection of their father, he keeps Nyx at arm’s length, treating her as little more than a bothersome employee.  Nyx badly wants her father’s love, and she resents her sister who sails through life with a smile.  When Nyx, with all of her insecurities, is shipped off to become Ignifex’s wife, she is prepared to meet a man who embodies evil.  Of course, the reality is a bit different.  He’s spectacular-looking, and despite all of the horrible things he has done. he treats Nyx with kindness.  Yes, he frequently lets her know that her life is imperil, but at least he’s humorous about it.Nyx isn’t one to take any of this without a fight, and she prowls around Ignifex’s mansion, determined to learn his secrets.  And this home has so many secrets, it’s practically a character unto itself.  As Nyx grows closer to Ignifex, she begins to question her mission.  Can she really murder her husband?  Should her loyalty lie with her family, her husband, or perhaps, with herself?  I loved to watch Nyx struggle with this, and she grew as a character as she fought to assert herself.  The ending of this story is one of my favorites in quite some time.  It’s full of surprises and revelations, and even though Nyx’s actions were unpredictable (to me, anyway), they were true to the character she had become.Note: I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33AAICYAY15ZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB365MK#wasThisHelpful","R33AAICYAY15ZC","A2WHV0YLBOK0I0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WHV0YLBOK0I0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like countless millions of people of my generation (and the one before and the one after), I grew up reading Peanuts. I loved reading stories and gags based on Charlie Brown and his gang. Charles Schulz had a gift for creating lovable characters and for communicating real ideas through the simplest medium—three or four small squares on newsprint. One thing that always fascinated me about Schulz was his references to the Christian faith. Hundreds of his strips and many of his television specials included subtle and sometimes blatant quotes from the Bible and musings on faith. Why did he include these? Was he a Christian attempting to share his beliefs through his medium or did he just find the Bible an interesting and inspiring work of literature?Like me, Stephen J. Lind grew up in a Christian home, reading and enjoying Peanuts. He, too, had an interest in Schulz’s religious beliefs. And he has just released A Charlie Brown Religion, a fascinating spiritual biography of Charles Schulz.""This book concerns the thematic thread of religion in Sparky’s life and work. It does not have much to say about his love for hockey, golf, or chocolate chip cookies (all of which were important in various ways to him), but the book has plenty to say about the importance of Charles Schulz’s faith. The reader of this book should not see such a focus to be an indication that Schulz’s life was entirely consumed and driven by religious thought. It wasn’t. Yet such thought was deeply interesting and personally important to him, with a breadth and depth of context and performance that more than justifies a complete volume devoted to its history.""This work tells the story of Schulz’s life and times while keeping the focus on his faith. His faith was as complicated as the man himself and developed a great deal over the course of his life. Lind says, “One might see this book as weaving together answers to two primary questions—‘Was Charles Schulz a religious man?’ and ‘Is there really much religion in Peanuts?’ The simple answer to both of those questions is ‘Yes.’ But the simple answer is rarely the truest answer in history, and you may find that the questions themselves need challenging as we search for thicker answers.”Schultz was raised in a family that put little stock in religion. As a young adult he came into contact with members of a Church of God in Minnesota and eventually professed faith in Jesus Christ. “He was fully committed to his spiritual beliefs, having developed what others in the church might describe as a ‘personal relationship’ with God through his faith in Christ, but Schulz had not yet developed his own personal spiritual voice. Instead, the language of the Church of God would provide the structure for his thought.” He came to love the Bible and rose to a leadership position within his church, often leading Bible studies, preaching, and doing street evangelism. “Over the years, Sparky [his nickname] would mark nearly every page of his Bible with a pencil or pen, underlining meaningful passages, transcribing timelines, and circling key words, so much that he would naturally forget what had inspired him to do so for certain passages. He filled the margins with explanations drawn from his commentaries and scrawled out personal insights in the blank space left at the end of an Old or New Testament book.” He later moved to California where he joined a United Methodist Church and became active as a Sunday school teacher.Through this time he was gaining fame as the creator of Peanuts, quickly rising to become the world’s most popular cartoonist. From the beginning, he incorporated spiritual themes into his comics, sometimes quoting the Bible directly. Most famously, he had Linus quote an extended passage from the Bible in A Charlie Brown Christmas.But sometimes things are not as simple as they seem. Schulz married Joyce Halverson who had no interest in religion and who refused to attend church with him. By their twentieth anniversary their marriage was in trouble and Schulz was engaged in an extra-marital affair. His marriage and affair both ended, and he soon re-married, this time to Jeannie Clyde to whom he would remain married until his death. Like Joyce, Jeannie had no interest in the Christian faith. By this time Schulz was no longer attending church and had lost much of his early enthusiasm for the Bible. Lind speculates “that within the tumult of a failing marriage and while in the midst of a private romantic affair, he no longer felt comfortable leading a study of the Bible.” He soon began describing himself as a “secular humanist,” though Lind points out that “Schulz’s statements reflected something more like a biblical humanism—merely a loosening of the already open, thoughtful faith that he had held since before leaving Minnesota. It was not a reversal of his faith, nor was it a signal of a personal religious crisis.” But it was also a clear sign that he did not hold to orthodox Christian beliefs. Over time, he came to hold to something closer to universalism, believing “there were others who were part of that Kingdom without even knowing it, without believing in Jesus. They were worshipping God through their heart attitudes and their merciful actions, regardless of their theological beliefs.” He died in perplexity and despair, grieving that he had not been given more years to live.And yet through all of this evolution of his beliefs, or perhaps the clarifying of his existing beliefs, Schulz continued to share parts of the Bible through his work. At a time when culture, and especially entertainment culture, were openly hostile to Christianity, Schulz would include references to the Bible and have Linus boldly recite the meaning of Christmas. Even today, millions gather around their television sets to hear this monologue. While Schulz personally turned away from many core Christian beliefs, he at the same time brought Christian ideas back into the cultural mainstream.A Charlie Brown Religion is as interesting a biography as I have read this year. It is just long enough to do justice to its subject without adding too much detail, and it moves at just the right pace. It describes a man who found joy and comfort in Christian beliefs, but who never fully appropriated those beliefs—not to the fullest degree. Attempting to understand his faith and its place in his life is equal parts perplexing and fascinating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCMBLMH36L6IW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1496804686#wasThisHelpful","RCMBLMH36L6IW","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have often expressed my love of biography. It’s not only that I enjoy peering into people’s lives, but also that there is so much to learn about life and faith by reading about other people. Biography, and Christian biography in particular, shows Christianity lived, realized in God’s people.New from Leland Ryken is J.I. Packer: An Evangelical Life. The publisher’s description does a good job of describing what you’ll encounter in the book’s pages: “Over the last sixty years, J. I. Packer has exerted a steady and remarkable influence on evangelicalism. In this biography, well-known scholar Leland Ryken acquaints us with Packer’s life, heart, and mind, tracing the outworking of God’s sovereign plan through his childhood, intellectual pursuits, and professional life. Filled with personal anecdotes and little-known facts, this appreciative volume sheds light on the key themes that have given shape to Packer’s life and thought, highlighting his enduring significance for Christians today.”This is, as the description says, an appreciative biography, written by someone who knows Packer and who has long been an admirer. In that way it is quite typical of other biographies of still-living individuals—it describes the subject’s life and influence, but without much emphasis on his weaknesses.Ryken dedicates the book’s opening pages to explaining why he wrote this book and why he did so in the way he did. ""My goal in writing this biography was to enable my readers to know J.I. Packer and to get a picture of his varied roles and accomplishments. It is the man that I wanted my readers to encounter. I therefore rejected the model of the documentary history, which so overwhelms readers with factual data about events and people that the subject of the biography disappears from sight. I have not written a history, but a biography.""With this goal in mind, he pursues a unique format that tells Packer’s life through three different themes, each of which has its own section. In the first section Ryken offers an overview of Packer’s life in standard biographical format. In the second section he describes Packer as a man, telling about his personality and passions and offering up some interesting anecdotes. In the third section he traces some of the themes that have dominated Packer’s life and career: the Bible, the Puritans, Anglicanism, and so on.I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know J.I. Packer through this account of his life. Packer’s books have been influential in my life, but I knew very little about his life and career. This biography put his books in their right context and greatly increased my admiration for their author. I came to see that Packer had an outsized influence on modern-day Evangelicalism, and for good reason. He is a remarkably gifted man who has maintained a lifelong commitment to understanding, defending, and explaining the Christian faith.My favorite parts of the biography are the ones that simply tell little facts about his life. I loved hearing about his first meeting with Kit, the woman who would eventually become his wife. Packer went for a Sunday afternoon walk with a church group and watched as Kit kicked off her shoes and walked barefoot. This free-spirited gesture intrigued and attracted Packer who very quickly realized he was drawn to her. Isn’t that exactly the stuff life is made of?For all the biography’s strengths, there are also some significant holes, and I am not sure if they are intentional or unintentional. Is there a reason that we never learn anything about Packer’s children apart from the briefly-mentioned fact that they were adopted? Why is nothing said about J.I. Packer the father? And whatever happened to Kit? Ryken tells of their courtship and marriage, but then she almost disappears from the narrative. Is she still living? Is there nothing to say about Packer the husband? Did he manage to be an effective husband and father even with his rigorous travel schedule and all his other responsibilities? Surely if there are several pages dedicated to his love of jazz music there could have been some discussion of his family life.It has long been my observation that the best biographies are written after the subject has died and the story of his life has been completed. There will be time enough to provide a deeper analysis of Packer’s life and influence. For now, J.I. Packer: An Evangelical Life gives us a glimpse into the mind, heart, and life of one of modern-day Evangelicalism’s most formative figures. My few frustrations aside, I was still glad to read it and glad to have encountered its subject within its pages. I thank God for J.I.

"I do it three times every week: Every Sunday morning, every Sunday evening, and every Wednesday evening I walk into church. Sometimes I walk into church eager and full of expectation; sometimes I walk into church grudgingly and grumpy; sometimes I walk into church sick or sorrowful. But week after week I do it. And I attach very little significance to it.In the opening pages of his little book How To Walk Into Church, Tony Payne describes the common experience:""I suppose it must have happened upwards of 2000 times by now. I exit the car, usually with a wife and various kids in tow, and amble in the front door, tossing off a quick greeting to whomever is handing out the folded sheets of paper that in church-speak are called ‘bulletins’. After a quick scan of the seating situation—who has already parked themselves where, who I might want to avoid and so on—I choose a spot not too near the front and sidle into the chosen row, smiling feebly at the person sitting on the other side of the seat that I’ve politely left vacant between us. And there it is. I’ve walked into church. Not exactly a taxing or impressive feat, and hardly worthy of having a book written about it, even a very short book like this.""But things are rarely as simple as they seem.No, things are rarely that simple. Many of the mundane and repetitive tasks that fill our lives have outsized importance: Walking into your home at the end of a long day’s work, saying goodnight to your children, participating in family devotions—these are little things but significant things, just like walking into church. After all, ""How you walk into church will be determined by what you think church is, and what you think you’re doing there. If you think church is a bit like going to the movies, you might walk in expecting to be entertained or inspired. If you think church is an opportunity for personal devotion and worship, you’ll probably walk in not wanting to interact too much with anyone else. If you think church is something you have to do in order to ‘do the right thing’ or stay on God’s good side, you’ll walk in with a determination to do what needs to be done (and then leave as soon as possible).""So how should we walk into church? Here is what Payne asks you to consider: Walk into church praying about where you should sit. Yes, it is that simple. And it has that much significance.Of course, he doesn’t just say that you should consider praying as you walk into church, he also proves its value. He does this first by asking and answering a pair of foundational questions: What is this thing we call ‘church’? and Why am I walking into church? Church is God’s gathering of God’s people and we walk into this gathering week after week because we need mutual encouragement and exhortation. Each one of us has a role to play in church and each one of us is a necessary part of the gathering. We do not go first to be served by others, but to serve. “Church is not about me. It’s not about the experience I have or what I get out of it. Church is a classic opportunity to love my brothers and sisters who are there, by seeking to build them up in Christ.”With the questions answered, Payne goes on to offer counsel on how to approach church and how to make the most of the experience both during and after the worship service.This is a short and simple book—less than 70 pages long—but one that could make a profound difference in the life and worship of your church. I would like to see it make that difference in the life of my church. If I and the other members at Grace Fellowship Church would read, understand, and implement the basic teaching of this book, I believe we would think very differently about how we walk into church and I believe we would do it a lot better. What Payne describes here is exactly what I long for my church to be.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QREL2E9QSOBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1922206725#wasThisHelpful","R1QREL2E9QSOBI","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John MacArthur is a study in consistency. Through more than forty-five years of public ministry he has simply taught the Bible. And the more he simply teaches the Bible, the more his audience and his influence grow and expand. In those years he has taught (and written commentaries) on every book of the New Testament while publishing dozens of bestselling books. His most recent book, Parables, is vintage John MacArthur.This new book shows how Jesus used parables to reveal the unfolding mystery of God’s kingdom. MacArthur does this by teaching through a series of Jesus’ most prominent and powerful parables (though, because he has already written an entire book on Jesus’ best-known parable, he passes over The Prodigal Son). In each case he describes the context in which Jesus delivered the parable, he explains what Jesus meant to accomplish, and he shows what it teaches about God and his kingdom. It is just what MacArthur does—sound, helpful, quality Bible teaching.But before he does any of this, he invests some up-front effort in helping the reader understand the very literary form of the parable. What is a parable? We probably know one when we see one, especially in the gospels. But how many can define it?The most distinct marker of a parable is that it uses illustration and comparison to teach a spiritual lesson. MacArthur says, “A parable is an ingeniously simple word picture illuminating a profound spiritual lesson.” A parable always makes a comparison between something commonplace and some truth in the spritual realm. Jesus did not invent the form, though certainly he mastered it like no one else before or since.MacArthur goes on to address two important and controversial questions: Why did Jesus teach in parables, and how can we interpet his parables rightly? After looking at some examples of sloppy thinking when it comes to parables, MacArthur shows that “Jesus’ parables had a clear twofold purpose: They hid the truth from self-righteous or self-satisfied people who fancied themselves too sophisticated to learn from Jesus, while the same parables revealed truth to eager souls with childlike faith—those who were hungering and thirsting for righteousness.” And, according to Matthew 11:25-26, Jesus considered both of these results successful and gave thanks to his Father for each of them.As for the matter of interpretation, MacArthur insists that each parable has a clear and objective meaning Jesus meant to convey. “If it seems the stories Jesus told are capable of endless interpretations and therefore devoid of any discernible objective meaning, that’s because truly understanding them requires faith, diligence, careful exegesis, and a genuine desire to hear what Christ is saying.” He also teaches the helpful and often-abused principle that “the symbolism in Jesus’ parables is never thickly layered, and rarely even multidimensional. Trying to find meaning in every story element is an exercise in bad hermeneutics. Even the most detailed parables (like the good Samaritan and the prodigal son) usually teach fairly straightforward, uncomplicated lessons. Minor elements in the story are not to be laden with spiritual meaning.” The reality is that “Jesus was the master storyteller. There is not a truism so familiar or a doctrine so complex that He could not give it new depth and insight through the telling of a simple story. His narratives epitomize the plain, powerful profundity of His message and His teaching style.”Having explained how to interpret and teach parables, MacArthur goes on to do that very thing. Parables shines a light on Jesus’ stories and, through them, to the Savior who told them. It’s a helpful, enjoyable, powerful bo","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YIKCCO3LAX5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400203481#wasThisHelpful","R1YIKCCO3LAX5L","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What do we do about that pesky star? Inseparable from the narrative of Jesus’ birth is the “star of wonder, star of night / Star with royal beauty bright” that we sing about in our Christmas carols (and, of course, read about in the book of Matthew). What was that star? Where did it come from? If it was so unusual and magnificent that it could lead wise men from the East all the way to Bethlehem, why don’t we read about it in other sources? That star is the subject of Colin Nicholl’s new book The Great Christ Comet. And, as you may surmise from the title, he does not believe it was a star at all.Before I discuss the content of the book, let me say a few words about the volume itself. The Great Christ Comet is a beautiful work. It is a slightly oversized hardcover that is well-illustrated, holds all kinds of fascinating charts and drawings, and is a joy to read. It will prove a popular choice for a Christmas gift this year, I am sure, and deservedly so.Over the years, the star of Bethlehem has been the subject of endless speculation. The most prevalent views have been that the star was the triple conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in Pisces; that it was Jupiter; that it was a nova or supernova; or that it was a miraculous star created by God for the purpose. Colin Nicholl, a Bible scholar, determined that he would get to the bottom of this star, and found all of those options unsatisfying.""As a Biblical scholar with a high regard for the historical credentials of the Scripture text, I have felt constrained to leave my comfort zone and wade into the field of astronomy in order to follow up Biblical leads concerning the Star. Doing so has been stretching and uncomfortable at times, but has also been incredibly rewarding and invigorating. In this book I present the fruits of my research—what I believe is a decisive breakthrough in the quest for the historical Star of Bethlehem.""His desire to solve the mystery of the star led him deeper and deeper into the field of astronomy until he was able to satisfactorily reconcile it with the biblical account. “In this book I offer what I am convinced is the solution to the age-old mystery of the Star of Bethlehem. What I propose is rooted in careful consideration of the relevant Biblical material and is, I believe, able to explain everything said about the Star in a natural and compelling way and in harmony with current astronomical knowledge.”His conclusion is that the Star of Bethlehem was actually a comet. The Bible allows such a position, as the word for “star” is wide enough to account for a comet; astronomy demands such a position, as there is no other satisfactory way to account for the phenomena the Bible describes. This conclusion comes only with painstaking work in both Bible scholarship and astronomy. Nicholl slowly and methodically makes his case, beginning with the biblical evidence, and then looking to the heavens. He describes what comets are, shows how ancient people interpreted them, gives examples of great comets through history, and tells how and why they are sometimes visible from earth. He ultimately shows how a comet could have been a sign to Babylonian wise men, how it could have alerted them to the birth of a Messiah, and how it could have led them first to the city of Jerusalem and then to a single home in Bethlehem. But he goes further than that. He also ties in passages like Numbers 24:17, Isaiah 7:14 and 9:2, and Revelation 12:1–5 to show how they may just have predicted this very phenomenon.Speaking personally, I found Nicholl’s evidence and conclusions quite compelling. He makes a strong case and provides abundant evidence. He makes it clear that he is not a mere enthusiast in either of his fields of expertise, but someone who has dedicated his life to careful research.Yet I also came away with a slight sense of caution. I have only the most rudimentary knowledge of astronomy (I can find the moon on a clear night, but not much more than that) and am under-equipped to pass judgment on his conclusions. However, because he so carefully charts his journey and the evidence he has collected, I know it will not be long before others take up the challenge. I will be interested to see how his work is interpreted by those with more knowledge in the field.With all that said, I found The Great Christ Comet a unique and uniquely interesting book. I am glad I read it, and freely recommend it to you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SR1B0WSOCGIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWDR07I#wasThisHelpful","R2SR1B0WSOCGIX","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It takes no courage to write a book that simply drifts and bobs along in the cultural mainstream. It takes no courage to say the things that are already popular in the world around us. But to stand firm on ideas, on truths, that people despise—now, that takes courage. In that way Albert Mohler’s We Cannot Be Silent is a genuinely courageous work. It closely and critically examines the defining moral issues of our day—sex, gender, and sexuality—and stands firm on the unpopular, traditional, biblical viewpoints.Mohler begins by positing “The Christian church in the West now faces a set of challenges that exceeds anything it has experienced in the past. … This is a revolution of ideas—one that is transforming the entire moral structure of meaning and life that human beings have recognized for millennia.” Some might accuse him of exaggeration, but I believe he is exactly right. We are caught up in a full-out moral revolution that is changing everything. “This new revolution presents a particular challenge to Christianity, for a commitment to the authority of Scripture and to revealed truths runs into direct conflict with the central thrust of this revolution.” As Christians come into conflict with the revolution, they will inevitably come into deep conflict with those who are swept up in it. “The moral revolution is now so complete that those who will not join it are understood to be deficient, intolerant, and harmful to society. What was previously understood to be immoral is now celebrated as a moral good.”We Cannot Be Silent is Mohler’s attempt to speak truth into this moment of crisis. He does so with boldness and conviction. He looks first at the cultural shifts that preceded and birthed this revolution. Then he shows what the Bible says about sex, gender, and sexuality. He lays out the current and future challenges to the church. He concludes with brief answers to thirty challenging questions: The biblical authors did not have the category of orientation, so aren’t they talking about something different than we are? Is homosexual sin worse than other sins? Are people born gay? Should a Christian attend a same-sex wedding ceremony? Can a person with same-sex attraction change his or her orientation? If so, how?The chapters that may bring the most unique value are the ones that trace the history and growth of this revolution. Most of us see how it is playing out around us today, but few understand how we got to this point. Mohler proves that any consideration of the rise of same-sex marriage must first look to other developments that have rocked society and set the stage: birth control and contraception, divorce, advanced reproductive technologies, and cohabitation. Marriage, gender, and sexuality would not be up for redefinition today without these four prior developments. And then he shows how there really was a gay agenda that was very successful in transforming society’s understanding of sex and sexuality. He explains the rise of transgenderism and shows that redefining marriage is actually obliterating marriage. Only when he has explained this revolution in the light of history does he advance to the present and future.While the book’s subject matter is unsettling and even discouraging, Mohler leaves the reader with hope. “As a historian and theologian, I submit that the church has often been most faithful during times of exile and cultural marginalization.” The Bible promises that Christians will be strangers and exiles on this earth, so we should not be surprised at the current and coming state of affairs. Rather, we should see it all as an opportunity in which the gospel will shine brighter than ever in contrast to the darkness around us.We Cannot Be Silent is an important and timely work that addresses urgent matters, and Mohler serves as a trusted guide to many of our deepest, most difficult, and most perplexing questions. The book will equip you to better understand this world and to live as a Christian in it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QGI26H4I1K8F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718032489#wasThisHelpful","R3QGI26H4I1K8F","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Never have I had a quicker opportunity to apply the book I’ve been reading. I read most of Ronnie Martin’s Stop Your Complaining on the morning of a holiday Monday, then when to a polling station to cast my vote for next week’s election. (Yes, the advance polls are open on the holiday; I will be away on Election Day and decided to make sure I cast my ballot.) I walked into the community center and saw a lineup—a very big lineup that was going nowhere fast. I had the choice: Would I be grateful for a free country and peaceful, democratic elections? Or would I join the crowd in grumbling about the incompetence of Elections Canada (before heading home to finish the book, of course)? Would I turn this into an opportunity for grumbling or gratitude?Gratitude does not come easily to me. It should. I live an easy, convenient, first-world life. I have been given innumerable blessings, not the least of which is the gift of salvation. But still, I like to complain. I like to apply my powers of perception and discernment to the people and situations around me and to discuss their inevitable shortcomings. It’s not complaining, right? It’s just honesty. It’s just observation. Somehow I always feel like I am justified in it. It’s like the book says: “Complaining is more than just a cute adjective to describe us on our bad days. In all of its various forms and functions it’s become a lifestyle, a way of existence and a daily routine that is as natural to us as breathing, walking and eating. It’s built into the foundation of our communication, bridging cultures together as one of the few ways we know how to relate to one another.”That’s exactly why I pulled this book out of the pile that showed up this month. I know I have a bit of a problem here. I’ve been aware of it for some time and have been working on it. But I was eager for a bit more guidance. And I’m glad to say that Martin’s book delivered admirably.I found two significant ways that this book shifted and sharpened my understanding of complaining. First, Martin emphasizes the sheer evil of complaining—at least, the kind of grumbling, self-centered complaining that I am prone to. He says rightly that “complaining is a slow, subtle poison that builds in our systems and usually goes undetected. It may be one of the least discussed sins in churches today.” It’s sheer prevalence may make it an acceptable sin, but that does not diminish its ugliness or seriousness. At heart, complaining is casting blame on God, suggesting that he has not provided what I am sure I need. That is a serious charge, a serious offence.Second, Martin emphasizes that complaining is not so much something I do as something I am. Complaining goes far deeper than words. Words, after all, are simply an overflow of the heart. In that way, complaining exposes an inward dissatisfaction and an inner conviction that I deserve better than what God has provided in this moment (or in that moment when I walked into the voting station.)But, of course, Martin does not simply describe and define the problem. He also offers a solution—the Bible’s own solution. He points to repentance and gratitude, both flowing from and related to the gospel, as the keys that can overcome this ugly problem.If you read a book like this one and come away with two simple things—a deeper disgust of complaining and a heightened desire for gratitude—your time has been well-spent. And I think that is what you will find if you read it. Stop Your Complaining is short but not trite, light but still significant. It’s exactly the book I needed today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAPTZ7GQUP0Y8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619582058#wasThisHelpful","RAPTZ7GQUP0Y8","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read all of Donald Whitney’s books because they invariably cause me to grow in my appreciation for the simplest but most important spiritual disciplines. As with so many other Christians, Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life proved foundational in my understanding and practice of the spiritual disciplines. Simplify Your Spiritual Life was an important wake-up call to the beautiful simplicity of the Christian life. I was excited, therefore, to dive into his new work Praying the Bible.This book is premised on the existence of a very common problem: That prayer is difficult. “I maintain that people—truly born-again, genuinely Christian people—often do not pray simply because they do not feel like it. And the reason they don’t feel like praying is that when they do pray, they tend to say the same old things about the same old things.” I would guess that this resonates with you and that many of your prayers feel just like that. The repetition in your prayers can lead you to assume that your prayers are meaningless and having no effect. When you are bored with your prayers you stop praying. When you stop praying you feel like a spiritual failure and count yourself a second-rate Christians. It’s a familiar downward cycle.The problem is not that we pray about the same old things; rather, it’s that we say the same old things about the same old things.TweetNow the problem here is not with praying about the same old things. We have to pray regularly and repetitively about certain matters—personal holiness, family members, our church families, our unsaved neighbors and relatives, financial care and provision, health and safety, and so on. “The problem is not that we pray about the same old things; rather, it’s that we say the same old things about the same old things.” The problem, then, is one of method.The heart of Praying the Bible is Whitney’s instruction on a particular method that is meant to address the lack of variety in our prayers: “When you pray, pray through a passage of Scripture, particularly a psalm.” That’s it. “Simply go through the passage line by line, talking to God about whatever comes to mind as you read the text. See how easy that is? Anyone can do that.”He describes this method and then teaches it with very practical instructions. The book’s tone is of a wise, older Christian coming alongside a young one and saying, “Let me teach you what I have learned. Let me teach you how to pray.” It is warm, conversational, and very encouraging. Whitney’s long experience with this method, coupled with his enthusiasm for it, makes it seem both good and do-able. If you read the book, you will walk away knowing and being able to practice his method. I think I can just about guarantee that much. I also think you will walk away excited to try it out and confident that it will bring new life to your prayers.Now, as I come to the end of this review I feel the need to point out that this method is just one among many. While the method is roughly modeled in Scripture, and while many Christians practice it, it is nowhere demanded of us. Praying through Scripture as Dr. Whitney teaches is a powerful method of praying, but not a necessary one. There are other ways to bring new life and strength to your prayers.On a personal note, I have never made this kind of prayer a regular part of my prayer life. However, because of my respect for Donald Whitney and because of his enthusiasm for it, I am inclined to try it over an extended period. My only concern is that I am not quite sure how to integrate the method with my prayer list to ensure that I am praying for the wide variety of concerns (including, of course, all family members, church members, friends and neighbors, ministries I love, and so on). I think the book might have benefited from a little more guidance on how to do this.Knowing the Word of God and the character of God, Whitney concludes “It must be possible for every Christian, including every Christian reading this book, to have a meaningful, satisfying prayer life.” If you read it and implement its method, I am sure you will find this is true.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7NHRL6T1OV86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWDR2JO#wasThisHelpful","R7NHRL6T1OV86","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"He promised himself that he would not write a book about apologetics. Not yet. Instead, he would do apologetics. I appreciate that. I appreciate Os Guinness’ concern that he would not become a professional apologist and along the way neglect the actual work of apologetics. But now, after many years of doing such work, he has written a book. And it’s a very good one.Fool’s Talk introduces the reader to the art of Christian persuasion. Persuasion—that is a word I don’t hear too often. That is a word I don’t think I have ever heard within the walls of the church. Yet apologetics, and the persuasion that lies at its heart, is more important today than ever.""We are all apologists now, and we stand at the dawn of the grand age of human apologetics, or so some are saying because our wired world and our global era are a time when expressing, presenting, sharing, defending and selling ourselves have become a staple of everyday life for countless millions of people around the world, both Christians and others. The age of the Internet, it is said, is the age of the self and the selfie. The world is full of people full of themselves. In such an age, “I post, therefore I am.” To put the point more plainly, human interconnectedness in the global era has been raised to a truly global level, with unprecedented speed and on an unprecedented scale. Everyone is now everywhere, and everyone can communicate with everyone else from anywhere and at any time, instantly and cheaply.""Guinness considers our time and our context the greatest opportunity for Christians and Christianity since Jesus and his apostles walked the earth. But what are we doing about it? “Many of us have yet to rise to the challenge of a way of apologetics that is as profound as the good news we announce, as deep as the human heart, as subtle as the human mind, as powerful and flexible as the range of people and issues that we meet every day in our extraordinary world in which ‘everyone is now everywhere’.”What we have lost, he believes, is the art of persuasion—the kind of persuasion we see modelled in Jesus, in Paul, and in the Old Testament prophets before them. Jesus is the best example of course. He had a remarkable ability to communicate to people disposed to reject him, and yet to do so in such a way that they had to see his point despite themselves. Thus, persuasion is “the art of speaking to people who, for whatever reason, are indifferent or resistant to what we have to say.” It is the difficult and intimidating work of speaking to people who do not agree with us and are simply not open to what we have to say. And yet the Great Commission calls us to speak to them and to give them the opportunity to respond to the gospel.One of Guinness’ great concerns about life in a digital world—and this may be a remnant of modernism—is the focus on victory. We want to win arguments and don’t care a whole lot for patient, gentle persuasion. “Our urgent need today is to reunite evangelism and apologetics, to make sure that our best arguments are directed toward winning people and not just winning arguments, and to seek to do all this in a manner that is true to the gospel itself.” That rings true in a Facebook world, doesn’t it?It must be said that this is not a book about technique. While I believe there is a time and place for such books (my favorite is Greg Koukl’s Tactics), Guinness goes so far as to say that “Technique is the devil’s bait for the Christian persuader today, and at point after point we must turn down its seductions point blank, just as Jesus refused the tempter in the desert.” This book, then, is not technique, but persuasion. Guinness means to persuade you of the value of persuasion. And, by my assessment, he succeeds admirably.Of all the book’s many strengths, one of the foremost must be the author’s suspicion of technique. Again, it’s not that technique is necessarily wrong, but that it can become a crutch. It can become the lazy man’s apologetics and, in that way, be very ineffective. “The desire for a surefire, foolproof approach to sharing faith is understandable—if only because there are people whom we love so much that we wish them to come to faith decisively, people we love, for whom anything short of success will seem a heartbreaking failure. That is only natural. But as we shall see repeatedly, we live in a fallen world in which any thoughts are thinkable, any arguments are arguable and any doubts are dubitable.” When we admit technique, we admit expertise. And there is a subtle danger here: “One danger of our specialized times is that apologetics will become the art of apologists talking to other apologists about apologetics, but never doing it.”A second strength is the focus on apologetics as a lover’s defense of his beloved. We, the ones who love God, rise to his defense. “Christian advocacy is a lover’s defense, a matter of speaking out and standing up when God is framed unjustly and attacked wrongly.” It is not that God needs us, of course, but that he chooses to use us. “We therefore speak only on behalf of God, we speak under God, and we have no authority or power apart from God. The prophet’s formula is always ‘Thus says the LORD,’ and the worst indictment against the false prophets was for their presumption in claiming to speak for God when their words were entirely their own. In short, the major work in the defense of the faith is about God and by God. It is not about us, and it is not up to us.”A fair assessment of the book will evaluate its weaknesses. But I see few beyond, perhaps, Guinness’ ecumenism. He is considerably more inclined to ecumenism than I am, and tends to draw from a wider stream of Christianity. Still, what he says is helpful and, in many cases, brilliant.Eminently quotable and packed full of helpful insights, Fool’s Talk is a thoroughly enjoyable and remarkably helpful book. It is well-written, well-structured, and well-argued. I enthusiastically recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BA7I9P1T72OE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830836993#wasThisHelpful","R2BA7I9P1T72OE","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the positive side, I think [William] Paul Young has become a markedly better writer since The Shack. On the negative side, he continues to use his writing to undermine and redefine Christian theology. By my reckoning, that’s a net loss. Where The Shack was meant to revolutionize our understanding of God, his new novel Eve is meant to revolutionize and rescue our understanding of the relationship between men and women. And it is no less troubling.Now, obviously Eve is fiction, which means it can be tricky to determine exactly what the author actually means to teach through his story. There is a lot in the novel that is complex and symbolic and that awaits the author’s authoritative interpretation. But what is clear is that Young’s novel is a retelling of the creation narrative through which he means to right a great wrong.The story begins when a shipping container washes ashore on an island that exists somewhere between our world and the next. John the Collector finds a young woman named Lilly trapped inside. She is beaten, bruised, broken, and only barely alive. With the help of others—Scholars and Healers—he helps her to recover, to remember who she is, and to understand her importance in history. Lilly, it turns out, is a Witness, one who has the privilege of watching past events unfold so they can be properly understood and interpreted in the present time. Her privilege is to witness creation and the fall into sin, and in that way to provide an account that corrects all our false understandings.What she witnesses varies significantly from the account we are accustomed to hearing. A sampling of the differences includes:-She sees that the world began with a big bang and that this involved the passing of billions of years (“I can’t believe all I saw happened in six days.” … “What you witnessed, especially the Days of Creation, likely took billions of years.”). (Note: In the book’s acknowledgements section Young thanks Hugh Ross and Reasons to Believe for helping him “craft the days of creation in a way respectful to both the text and to science,” suggesting he may hold to the day-age view and, perhaps, the existence of an historical Adam.)-She sees Jesus create Adam as an infant from the dust of the ground, and sees God personally nurse Adam from his breasts (“Here in my arms and nursing at my breast is the highest expression of my creation.” “Mythology is responsible for many odd ideas. … Did your Storytellers think that Adam was created as a young man with no capacity, a brute ready to be programmed?”).-She sees that Adam falls into sin before Eve was even created, and that the naming of the animals is an infuriating kind of penance for Adam (“Spinning away, the young man raised his fists and screamed fury into the sky, one word. It reverberated and echoed back as time and place and beast stood still. ‘Alone!’”).-She sees that Eve is not taken out of Adam as much as she grows within Adam and is birthed from him (“Adam’s belly grew, expanding with a pregnancy. … In nine months God fashioned the feminine side of Adam’s humanity, the female who slept within…”).-She sees that Adam and Satan (in the guise of a snake) conspire together to take advantage of Eve’s naveté, so that Eve is an innocent party in her own downfall (“She had been betrayed and now was being blamed by Adam for what he had conceived in his own heart.”).-She sees that God is triune and genderless and, therefore, best referred to with gender-neutral, third-person pronouns (“God turned Their face to the woman and gently spoke with words of sorrow…”).In short, she sees a whole new and “corrected” view of humanity’s origins and depravity. Through this character, Young means to show that the story of humanity’s fall into sin has been co-opted and perverted by men in order to gain power over women. Eve’s role in offering Adam the forbidden fruit is a fable men use to dominate and control women.“But it’s all just a story,” you say. True, but in this case, Young insists that his story, and the truth it contains, is the result of decades of thought and research. He insists that the truth embedded in this story has the power to free us from faulty interpretations of the Bible that have long corrupted human relationships. In an interview with Publishers Weekly he says, “Ultimately, the inspiration for Eve is the Scriptures themselves. The more I studied and pondered and conversed, the more I was driven back to Genesis and the iconic saga of Beginnings, and it was there I began to find answers to the big, system-shaking questions I was asking. Eve is my attempt to express some of what I discovered.” In that way he plays a character within his own work—the character(s) he calls the Scholar.Now, it’s not like the book is all bad. In fact, there are points where it is downright moving. Young’s descriptions of God’s joy over his creation, and especially his joy in the creation of man, is powerful and stirring. Man’s response to God’s love is equally sweet. Young’s compassion in describing the agonizing abuse endured by Lilly can only come out of the heart of an author who has himself suffered. And the story, while perhaps too complicated at times, is well-written and well-told.And yet it is, in the final assessment, a troubling, faulty, and even dangerous story. There is much I could say here, but for the sake of brevity, let me target the book’s big point.Whatever else Young means to accomplish in his work, it is clear that he means to undermine the traditional accounts of creation and human depravity. As he reinterprets those two doctrines, he then reinterprets the relationship between the sexes, teaching that any pattern of authority or submission is necessarily a product of sin. Even Adam naming Eve is, in Young’s retelling, a display of his longing for power and dominance over woman. Young goes so far in his desire to show the sinful dominance of man that he eventually elevates woman over man, femininity over masculinity, as if one is the antidote to the other. “[Women] is Adonai’s invitation to embrace frailty and softness, to be whole and unashamed, to return fully from his turning.” In this way man’s solution for sin is not only the promised offspring of the woman, but woman herself.Ironically, Young’s insistence on complete egalitarianism is inconsistent with his own story. His Witnesses, Scholars, and Collectors are all equals, yet each with his (or her) own role. Young’s world and his story only work when each of his characters freely and joyfully plays his or her role. In the same way God, in his creative work, assigned separate roles to men and women. In God’s world no role is better or greater or higher than another, but each is critical to the story he is telling.God tells us that God created men to take positions of leadership within the church and family, and for women to joyfully submit themselves to this leadership. In this way God provides a much fuller display of who he is and what he is like. His image is shown not in uniformity but in complementarity. After all, the relationships within the Trinity display this very same pattern of leadership and submission. What is ultimately at stake here is not the relationship of man to woman, but our understanding of God as he displays himself in our relationships.Behind Young’s retelling of this portion of the Bible is the question of the Bible’s authority. The only way he can teach what he teaches is by radically altering the biblical narrative. So has the Bible been wrong all along? Is the Bible only a figurative count and Eve a faithful interpretation? Were the authors such a product of their time, place, and culture that they biased their work with chauvinist ideas? As the dust settles, what exactly is true anyway? Read Eve and you won’t have much certainty.In that same interview with Publishers Weekly Young says, “There are also some who will read it and won’t ‘see’ her, sometimes because the timing isn’t right and their life’s journey has not granted the gifts inherent in suffering, or because their assumptions are too overwhelming and powerful to allow them to hear.” More condescending words have rarely been uttered. He seems unwilling to consider that perhaps it’s not that our assumptions are too overwhelming, but that God’s Word is too clear.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SQFHIX59M6KW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SDPKAKE#wasThisHelpful","R1SQFHIX59M6KW","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nancy Pearcey’s bestselling and award-winning book ""Total Truth"" made quite a mark on my life. It was, to my memory, the first book I had ever read on worldview, and its explanation of the way our world divides the sacred and the secular has not only stuck with me, but has helped me better understand and explain the culture around me. Though Pearcey has written another book between then and now, I consider her new work, ""Finding Truth,"" the true sequel to ""Total Truth.""In ""Finding Truth,"" Pearcey offers 5 principles meant to unmask our culture’s endless worldview alternatives to Christianity—secularism, atheism, and the like. There are all kinds of books that make a similar promise, but this one has a noteworthy difference: Pearcey looks to Romans 1 to find a kind of apologetics training manual for identifying and challenging any other worldview.At the start of Paul’s letter to the church in Rome, he claims that all humanity has access to evidence for God’s existence, and then describes what happens when people refuse to acknowledge him. As people turn away from God, they suppress the truth that God makes known to them through creation and through human nature. People hide from God by creating idols, God substitutes. These are not merely idols of wood and stone, but also ideas, any idea that provides an alternate explanation for the meaning and purpose of life. Idols have consequences, and God gives up those who worship them to a debased mind, so that they become futile in their thinking and dishonorable in their behavior. While most explanations of this text dwell on behavior, Pearcey focuses on the mind, showing the ways in which the unbelieving mind is affected by sin so that an entire worldview becomes completely opposed to God.In Romans 1 she finds five strategic principles that “provide a basic game plan for making sense of any worldview across the board—even the cutting edge ideas of our day—and then to craft a compelling positive case for Christianity.” Here is a brief explanation of each.Principle 1. Identify the Idol. Every non-biblical worldview begins with some kind of a God substitute—an idol. If human beings will not worship the God who created them, they will still worship something—something that provides an alternate explanation of the world’s origins or that provides an understanding of the meaning of life.Principle 2. Identify the Idol’s Reductionism. Once we identify the idol, we need to look for its reductionism, the way in which it leads to a low view of human life. When one part of the creation is deified or idolized, every other part will necessarily be denigrated. Why? Because one part is always far too small to explain the whole thing. Reductionism is always dehumanizing.Principle 3. Test the Worldview: Does It Contradict What We Know About the World? The third step is to test the worldview against the facts of experience, which is to say, the truths of general revelation. Though people will continue to suppress the evidence of God’s existence, what God has created continues to challenge them, because physical nature and human nature constantly provide evidence of a Creator. Therefore every idolatrous worldview will fail to fit the evidence and will, instead, contradict the facts of general revelation.Principle 4. Test the Idol: Does it Contradict Itself? Every reductionistic worldview is, on some level, self-defeating. It commits suicide by reducing reason to something less than what is reasonable. We need to look for the way in which it contradicts itself and collapses internally. (An example is the relativistic claim that there is no universal truth even though this statement is, itself, meant to be a universal truth.)Principle 5. Replace the Idol: Make the Case for Christianity. By focusing on the points where reductionistic worldviews fail, we can offer a better and more compelling alternative. We can do this by finding those inevitable places where other worldviews borrow from the Christian worldview and expose themselves to critique.""Finding Truth"" has many commendable strengths. For one, Pearcey shows again and again just how far people will go to suppress the knowledge of God. They will go to any length to deny what is right in front of their noses and—even closer—right within their own hearts and minds. She shows this in a broad range of alternative religions and philosophies, pointing always to the consistency of the Christian faith.While she shows that all other worldviews are insufficient and illogical, she does not discard them altogether. Instead, she shows how they do contain some genuine insights, and then shows how their best insights are inevitably and illogically stolen from the Christian worldview.She also provides a compelling intellectual argument for the Christian faith. I appreciate what Gregory Koukl says in his endorsement: “This is one of those books that not only challenges the critics; it also gives a huge dose of confidence to the Christian who will catch himself walking away from its pages saying, ‘Gosh, this stuff really is true.’”Pearcey promises that the principles she lays out will “provide you with the tools to recognize what’s right and wrong with any worldview—and then to craft a biblically informed perspective that is both true and humane.” She makes the promise and she delivers on it. ""Finding Truth"" is, all-in-all, a worthy successor to ""Total Truth.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KDX678WTZBR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QN345NG#wasThisHelpful","R1KDX678WTZBR7","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The pushback against the radical Christian life is in full swing. It was inevitable, I think, and healthy. Books like Radical and Don’t Waste Your Life were meant to battle Christian complacency, but in some ways they over-corrected, giving less than a holistic and realistic view of the Christian life. And now authors like Michael Wittmer are attempting to recover some balance.In his new book Becoming Worldly Saints, Wittmer means to answer this question: Can you serve Jesus and still enjoy your life? Is it possible for you to be fully committed to the Lord and still find time to enjoy life’s pleasures? Or, as some seem to feel, do we need to live lives of utter frugality, sending all our money to the mission field? Are we responsible to share the gospel with absolutely every person we encounter? Should we really feel that constant low-grade guilt that accuses us that we are not doing enough for the Lord? In short, how do we resolve the tension between the pleasures of earth and the purpose of heaven?Wittmer’s answers are as compelling as any I’ve read. His concern is that in all the good things we do for the Lord, we forget the importance of being human and enjoying God’s good creation. “Our lives will shrivel if we allow our passion for redemption to smother the pleasures of creation. Being a Christian must not become an obstacle to being human. But the problem is even worse in reverse: When we eliminate our earthly pleasures, we inevitably limit the reach of our heavenly purpose. If we want to attract people to Jesus, our lives must be attractive.” We, of all people, ought to enjoy this world and display our love of life.Our temptation is to make a harsh distinction between loving the Lord and loving the world he has made. However, “Our love for Jesus and his world is not a zero sum game. Attention given to creation is not stolen from its Creator. The more we enjoy God’s gifts for their own sake, the more we can appreciate him. And thank him for, and love with him. … Thank God for the privilege of being human and of being here. Then go have some fun.” God and have some fun and trust that God enjoys your fun as much as you do.Wittmer structures the book around the story of Scripture—the great work God is doing in this world, which proceeds under the familar headings of Creation, Fall, and Redemption. He shows that God created this world so we could enjoy it and that he still expects that we will find enjoyment in it. He corrects those people who live only for tomorrow, as if the pleasures of this world are meaningless. He shows that our responsibility in this world is to love God, serve our neighbor, cultivate the earth, and rest, and that we need to maintain a balance between these. He shows that the tension we feel is an inevitable result of man’s fall into sin, and he attempts to bring peace between the urgency of the gospel and the demands of being human. In every case he succeeds well.Can you serve Jesus and still enjoy life? “It starts with your call and ends with it too. Do whatever God is calling you to do, no more and no less. Do it with all your might; then go to bed. Your life will count for eternity, and you’ll probably even like it.”Becoming Worldly Saints was a joy and a relief to read. Grounded firmly in Scripture and in the best of Christian tradition, it offers a powerful and compelling vision of the Christian life that is equally exciting and attainable. This isn’t settling for a lesser vision of the Christian life—this is living out what the Bible says.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVT3MH6EUAQLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L0SPQCS#wasThisHelpful","RVT3MH6EUAQLX","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are witnesses today to a massive culture shift. Things we used to hold sacred are now subject to mockery; evils we would never even have dreamed of are now regarded as normal and beautiful. And everywhere we look, Christians are on the front lines—whether they like it or not, they are on the front lines. They are on the front lines of the battle between traditional marriage and same-sex marriage; they are on the front lines of the battle for life in the womb; they are on the front lines of the battle against sex trafficking and pornography. Wherever our culture delights in evil, Christians are attempting to speak with clarity and authority.David Platt has observed this culture shift and in his new book calls upon Christians to ensure they will not stand idly by. Counter Culture is, according to the subtitle, a “A Compassionate Call to Counter Culture in a World of Poverty, Same-Sex Marriage, Racism, Sex Slavery, Immigration, Abortion, Persecution, Orphans and Pornography.” Platt calls on Christians to wade into the cultural battlefield and to represent Jesus.He begins with the gospel. He believes that the gospel is meant to compel the Christian to take action, saying “the gospel is the lifeblood of Christianity, and it provides the foundation for countering culture. For when we truly believe the gospel, we begin to realize that the gospel not only compels Christians to confront social issues in the culture around us. The gospel actually creates confrontation with the culture around—and within—us.” The gospel creates confrontation through its most outlandish and offensive claim:""[T]the most offensive and countercultural claim in Christianity is not what Christians believe about homosexuality or abortion, marriage or religious liberty. Instead, the most offensive claim in Christianity is that God is the Creator, Owner, and Judge of every person on the planet. Every one of us stands before him guilty of sin, and the only way to be reconciled to him is through faith in Jesus, the crucified Savior and risen King. All who trust in his love will experience everlasting life while all who turn from his lordship will suffer everlasting death.""With the gospel foundation in place, Platt sets out to draw attention to some of the most pressing issues of our day, and to show “how the gospel moves Christians to counter all of these issues in our culture with conviction, compassion, and courage.”The heart of the book is a chapter-length examination of several major culture concerns: Poverty, same-sex marriage, racism, sex slavery, immigration, abortion, persecution, orphans and widows, and pornography. In every case Platt outlines the issue, shows how the gospel speaks to it, and then calls the Christian to action. He is a gifted writer and storyteller and often interweaves the chapters with tales of people he has met and situations he has encountered in his many travels. He is also a gifted theologian, and draws both deeply and accurately from the wells of Scripture. Inevitably some will wonder how this book compares to his bestselling book Radical, and I would say it has all the passion and intensity, but with far more nuance.In the end, his call is both strong and convicting. Early in the book he lauds Christians for the ways they have already countered culture, but expresses this concern: “On popular issues like poverty and slavery, where Christians are likely to be applauded for our social action, we are quick to stand up and speak out. Yet on controversial issues like homosexuality and abortion, where Christians are likely to be criticized for our involvement, we are content to sit down and stay quiet. It’s as if we’ve decided to pick and choose which social issues we’ll contest and which we’ll concede. And our picking and choosing normally revolves around what is most comfortable—and least costly—for us in our culture.” He is exactly right, and in this book he brings needed balance, dwelling not only on issues that will earn applause, but also the issues that will earn criticism or even persecution.Platt believes that “[t]he greatest way to achieve social and cultural transformation is not by focusing on social and cultural transformation, but by giving our lives to gospel proclamation.” I agree entirely. His hope for our generation is this: “May it be said of us that we not only held firm to the gospel, but that we spoke clearly with the gospel to the most pressing issues of our day.” Counter Culture will equip you to do that very thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R326YTFOW41CBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J37GQCC#wasThisHelpful","R326YTFOW41CBT","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn’t actually intend to review this book. It showed up at my door and a brief glance turned into a quick skim turned into a full read turned into a review. As a committed reader always looking for something new and interesting, I just love it when that happens.There is a new religious movement alive today that is gaining momentum and claiming followers. Like so many movements before it, it began in the United States and has since spread around the world. I have seen many manifestations of it right here in Canada. It is called the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) and it is the subject of God’s Super-Apostles, where it receives some well-deserved scrutiny.The New Apostolic Reformation is a movement that is set on returning apostles and prophets to the church. Its adherents believe “that God always intended for apostles and prophets to govern the church, not only the early church, but the church during each generation. Yet their rightful place of rule has been neglected by Christians for centuries,” replaced, in most cases, by pastors and elders. This movement is apostolic because it restores apostles and prophets to the church, and it is a reformation because its leaders hold that, like the Protestant Reformation before it, it will transform the church.NAR is associated with well-known leaders like C. Peter Wagner, Rich Joyner, Mike Bickle, Bill Johnson, and Cindy Jacobs, and organizations such as The International House of Prayer, The Call, GOD TV, Trinity Broadcasting Network, and Charisma magazine. You may know you have encountered it when you hear buzzwords like activation, dominionism, generational curse, prayerwalking, soaking, or spiritual mapping. There are currently something like 3 million people in America who are actively associated with NAR, and hundreds of thousands or even millions more who would be loosely associated or who have been influenced by its teachings and teachers. It is, in short, a powerful and growing movement.In God’s Super-Apostles R. Douglas Gievett, professor of philosophy in the Talbot School of Theology at Biola University, and Holly Pivec, a researcher and journalist, combine forces to examine and respond to the NAR movement. Modeling their work after the Bereans of Acts 17, they look at this new movement and then simply turn to God’s Word to see if it can be supported by the Bible. And, not surprisingly, they find that many of the movement’s boldest and most distinct claims are not only missing from Scripture, but completely opposed to it.They first look to the NAR teaching about apostles, then go to the New Testament examples and descriptions of Apostles, and compare the two. NAR’s beliefs and leadership do not hold up well under such examination. The authors do the same with prophets, and again find that NAR offers something very different from what the Bible holds out. Then they look at some of NAR’s distinct teachings about spiritual warfare and the promise (which often becomes a threat) of apostolic unity. They close with an examination of miracles and miracle workers, disputing NAR’s understanding of miracles and casting doubt on the many of the claims of miracles.This book may draw some comparisons to John MacArthur’s Strange Fire, but even while it reaches many of the same conclusions, it is a very different work in that it focuses far less on individual manifestations of the movement’s flaws and foibles, and more on a framework meant to understand and interpret it. It may be tempting to immediately write off the authors as people who have a deeper agenda than exposing the worst of the movement, but they anticipate and answer this: ""Some readers may suspect that the authors are anti-charismatic. They may expect us to argue that the miraculous gifts described in 1 Corinthians 12—including the gifts of prophesying, healing, and speaking in tongues—are no longer active in the church today. This is not our objective. Many Christians around the world, including charismatics and classic Pentecostals, believe that the miraculous gifts are still active, and we do not dispute their belief. We’ve tried to show that NAR teachings do not represent the views of most charismatics or classic Pentecostals, but are, rather, entirely different.""If I have a concern with the book it is its logical and methodical style. Of course I found this very helpful, but I am not sure how many of NAR’s adherents will be convinced. You have heard it said that you cannot reason someone out of an irrational position and, sadly, many people who are swept up in NAR may be almost immune to the kind of reason the authors bring to bear here. They have been trained to look past the Bible to signs and wonders and prophecies; many have tacitly or even outright denied that the Bible is their norming norm, their sole final authority. Yet the authors have done the right thing and simply held up NAR to the light of Scripture; it is my hope that many people within the movement will read the book and at least consider it.God’s Super-Apostles is a clear and winsome work that provides just the right depth of examination, and that comes to clear and biblical conclusions. It is worth reading whether you wish to better understand NAR or if you wish to evaluate its claims.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I3M41FFF25I1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PHKUVIY#wasThisHelpful","R1I3M41FFF25I1","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If I could mandate that at least one leader from every church had to read a single book, I don’t think there are too many I would choose ahead of On Guard: Preventing and Responding to Child Abuse at Church. It’s not that it is the best book I have ever read (though it is plenty good) or that it contains the deepest theology (though there is plenty of good doctrine within its pages). It’s that too many times the purpose and witness of the church has been tarnished by her failure to offer safety and protection to children. This book offers assistance where so many churches have failed.Deepak Reju is a Pastor of Biblical Counseling and Family Ministry at (Mark Dever’s) Capitol Hill Baptist Church and father to five young children. From that vantage point he sees the danger and the devastation of abuse and its prevalence within the church. And from that vantage point he provides an excellent resource that is meant to help.On Guard has three broad purposes: to protect children from the horrors of child abuse, to fill a gap in Christian publishing and resourcing, and to provide a comprehensive approach to preventing and responding to child abuse at church. In all three areas Reju succeeds well.In the book’s first few chapters Reju describes and defines the problem of child abuse in the church and deals with some too-common misperceptions. He shows how and why child predators often hide in plain sight within the church, knowing that it may be the safest and easiest place to prey upon children. The heart of the book is eight chapters that each describe a strategy for protecting against abuse; these range from creating and implementing a child protection policy, to screening staff members, to getting familiar with people and resources in your local community. The final three chapters provide strategies for responding when someone has made an allegation of abuse or when a known child abuser professes faith and asks to come into church membership. Several appendices provide helpful supplemental information such as case studies and sample child protection policies.Of all that Reju teaches in this book, the most important may be the parts dealing with the profile of the abuser. We tend to caricature pedophiles, trusting that our instinct and intuition would alert us to their presence. The fact is, though, that predators fit many different profiles and we are easily fooled. Predators are adept at grooming a church community and then grooming individual children; when and if the abuser is discovered, churches often react with shame and guilt, trying to cover up instead of bring to light. Not only that, but even though false reports of abuse are rare, people often assume innocence and fail to take seriously the possibility of abuse. It is a horrible mess, but just a little authoritative guidance through a book like this can go a long way.“Protecting the children under your care is a way to preserve your gospel witness in your community.” Not only that, but “Our ethical and moral responsibility as Christians is to protect the children whom God has entrusted to us.” I became convicted of these facts a few years ago and helped implement an Abuse Prevention Policy that is now in effect in our church. This book has both solidified my belief in the importance of such a policy, and given me many ideas for making it better.Please, read this book, or at least ensure that someone in your church reads it. I plan to hand it to all those who oversee children’s ministries within our church and to discuss it with them. I hope you will do the same. Do it for the sake of the children and do it for the sake of the gospel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R78MFFYWH6E97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1939946514#wasThisHelpful","R78MFFYWH6E97","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me tell you: It’s not easy being filthy rich. You would know, wouldn’t you? Most of us feel like we live in poverty, but that’s only because we restrict our comparisons to the people closest to us. When we elevate our gaze a little, we see that most of us qualify as being among the richest people in the world. Compared to the mass of humanity, we have fantastic wealth.For many years Dave Ramsey has taught people how to manage their money well, and countless thousands of people can testify to his impact on their lives. While much of his effort has gone into helping people climb out of debt and live financially sustainable lives, he is now turning his attention to the matter of leaving a legacy.In his new book The Legacy Journey he deals head-on with first-world wealth and a host of related issues. He builds this legacy journey around a 4-part framework: Now, Then, Us, Them. In the Now stage he wants you to focus on the most immediate issues like getting out of debt, living on a budget, and preparing for emergencies. The Then stage begins to look down the road a little, preparing for retirement, saving for college funds, and setting a future vision. When it comes to Us, it is time to begin to accumulate a generational legacy which will build wealth to leave to children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren. And then, with those other pieces in place, comes Them, where you can look around the world and use your wealth to make a major impact on other people’s lives and well-being.There is much in this book that is good and helpful. On the positive side, Ramsey pushes hard against simplistic financial thinking that owes more to latent socialism than to the Bible. He deals very well with the spiritual side of money, showing how money can be the best of servants or the worst of masters. He teaches that all money is God’s money and that we are to think of ourselves as stewards rather than owners of our wealth. He shows how building wealth and building a legacy of wealth is, and is meant to be, hard work, and proves the importance of properly training our children to understand money. And he provides sound counsel on thinking about the future and planning for it while avoiding the most common pitfalls. These are all the things he is known for and the things he does so well—they represent genuine strengths. But there are some weaknesses as well.My most significant concern is Ramsey’s sloppy use of the Bible. Much of what he teaches is wise, but then he makes the unfortunate choice to back it with out-of-context Scripture. Here is an example: “Your goals must be in writing. Habakkuk 2:2 says, ‘Write the vision and make it plain.’ There is spiritual power in writing down your goals.” If there is, we certainly don’t learn that in Habakkuk 2:2! His misuse of Scripture weakens rather than strengthens his book.In a similar vein, this entire book, and even the idea of the legacy journey, is premised on Proverbs 13:22 which says, “A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children…” Ramsey takes this Proverb literally and universally and makes it God’s instruction to each of us, saying that as Christians we are to accumulate enough wealth that we can leave a substantial inheritance to our children and their children. But I am not convinced. Proverbs was written in a specific culture where land and inheritance had a very different meaning than they do today. While it may be good and generous to leave wealth to our children, I am not convinced it is a biblical mandate. This is especially the case today when lifespans are increasing and we now inherit our parent’s money in our 60s or 70s, typically long after we really need it. And even then, what is the purpose of stockpiling millions so I can leave it to my kids and they can leave it to their kids who can leave it to their kids? Why not put that money to work right here and right now? Ramsey counters this by looking at people like Bill Gates who mean to give away their fortunes: “On the surface, that may sound like a good or generous thing—and it is. The problem is, though, one of the biggest personal fortunes in the history of the world will totally vanish within one generation. Even though the money will be spent in wonderful ways, it will still be gone forever.” But that money is not gone—it has been converted to good purposes. If anything it has been elevated, not lost!Ramsey also comes across as a little defensive about wealth. Much of the book deals with accumulating wealth and rewarding hard work with a comfortable lifestyle. That is a tension we all feel, I think, but I’m not sure that he does much to resolve it. His counsel generally leads away from generosity and toward comfort—perhaps not the Bible’s consistent emphasis. I understand the tension and understand his emphasis, but it may be too simplistic to say, “Our ability to build wealth, use wealth for the kingdom, and enjoy the wealth God gives us all boils down to whether or not we can keep that wealth in perspective. And that’s a matter of contentment.” Yes and no. But at some point we need to feel and deal with that difficult relationship between our comfort and the poverty of so many others.And then there is my concern that this legacy journey essentially calls on people to spend almost all of their lives giving ten percent of their income to the Lord’s work, and to only really crank up the generosity in that fourth and final stage. Yes, we need to learn to live free from debt and prioritize caring for our families, but with the Bible’s constant calls for sacrifice and generosity, it seems odd that lavish generosity would be left to the end. Planning to be generous and accumulating wealth in order to be generous is not the same thing as actually being generous.All-in-all, The Legacy Journey is a helpful book with many strengths, but it still left me unsatisfied. As an overall strategy for faithfully stewarding God’s money, I am just not convinced. I think there must be stronger, more biblical, and more satisfying answers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16XKWCMBUYM1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937077713#wasThisHelpful","R16XKWCMBUYM1Y","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I get a little nervous when I see an artist jump mediums. Not all artists make that transition from one medium to another—good authors have written awful songs and great songwriters have written really bad books. But Matt Papa has made it work. He has recorded some excellent songs (e.g. Come Behold The Wondrous Mystery) and has now also written a fantastic book. In Look and Live he wants you to behold the soul-thrilling, sin-destroying glory of Christ. Even better, he will help you do it.The book begins with the assumption—the biblically safe assumption—that we are worshippers. The question is not if, but what we will worship. If it is really true that it takes ten thousand hours of practice to become an expert on anything, well, we all become expert worshippers at fourteen months of age. We were created to worship and we will worship. “As human beings we are plagued with inordinate affections. We love green pieces of paper more than God. We love balls made out of pigskin more than God. We’ve shown we even love apples more than God. We, like Esau, have traded our birthright—the dignity of our shameless, joy-filled, glory-beholding, glory-reflecting existence—for a bowl of beans.”What is the solution to this misplaced worship?""We don’t need more willpower. We don’t need to get ourselves together. We need a greater thrill … a more captivating beauty. What we need is a vision of God. We need to see glory.""And for that reason Papa’s goal here is “to help you overcome idolatry and certain sadness by pointing you to the all-satisfying, sin-destroying glory of Jesus.”He does that by reflecting on the glory of God, and then seeing the glory of God as it is displayed in creation, mission, obedience, suffering, and, especially, the cross of Christ.He draws deeply from the wells of church history and also from the best of today’s writers. Papa’s strength is not so much in saying new things, but in distilling the best of the Christian thinkers of yesterday and today. He writes meditatively and reflectively. His joy and delight is contagious. He may be at his best in chapter 4, “The Blazing Center,” where what he writes is deep and beautiful and brilliant. It covers familiar territory but in a fresh and free way. It may be one of the best chapters of any book I’ve read this year and it will bear repeated readings.When I preach I always try to share the gospel differently—to use fresh words and fresh ways of saying those same old truths. It’s not that there is new content to the gospel message, but there are ways of saying it that restore and recover some of that excitement. And that is what Papa does here.By way of critique, I do wish had had focused a little more attention to the resurrection. We love to behold the cross, and need to behold it, but we also need to behold the empty tomb. Without the empty tomb, the gospel is incomplete.When an artist is successful in one medium, he may well be offered opportunities to participate in another, and that’s exactly where some too many bad books come from. But this, this was the book Papa was meant to write. It’s a good one and I can’t recommend it too highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R114HYNEL69NJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KDN8AJC#wasThisHelpful","R114HYNEL69NJK","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here’s a new book that combines two things I love: Books that come from off the beaten path, and ones that deal with interesting but ordinary people. As it happens, John Stott’s Right Hand was privately published after being turned down by trade publishers, and it tells the life of a fascinating but relatively unknown individual.John Stott’s name is known around the world. For decades he was one of Evangelicalism’s most prominent voices. His ministry impacted millions and his legacy will endure for generations. What most people do not know is that for 55 years Frances Whitehead served alongside him as his secretary. But she was more than that. She was his gatekeeper, stenographer, typist, encourager, and enabler. Fittingly, before he died he also made her executor of his estate. This book tells her story.Whitehead first encountered Stott when she, as an unbeliever, began attending his church. She was a young woman working for the BBC and would sometimes walk across the road to visit his church on her lunch break. Going into that church she would hear Stott preach, and over time the words he preached began to take root, and she came to faith. It was not too long after her conversion that Stott asked her to serve as his secretary. She accepted the position, little knowing that she would hold it for more than five decades.For all those years Stott and Whitehead labored side-by-side, both of them remaining single and both of them remaining singularly focused. She typed his books, she kept people from interfering with his rigid schedule, she organized his life, she drove him to and from the airport, and she even traveled with him on many occasions. She sat beside him in the nursing home when he went to glory, and eulogized him at his funeral. She was his helper and right hand through almost his entire ministry.Of course people will naturally wonder about the nature of the relationship. Was it romantic? Did they ever struggle with feelings for one another? Is it even possible that they could work together so closely and for so long while maintaining a platonic relationship? Indeed, it is.""John’s and Frances’s ability to work together so closely for so long was a mark of grace. Two single people of similar age working long hours, under pressure, in pursuit of the same goal, would, for most mission agencies or churches now be avoided. It is a tribute to both of them that for twenty years, before the study assistants arrived, they succeeding in working so closely as a team of two. They both had a high level of inner discipline, partly innately and perhaps partly the product of their upbringing and education. While unspoken to one another, they resolutely did not allow for romantic hopes to take root; embarrassment and awkwardness would have undermined a remarkable working friendship.""""It was a unique partnership, and one for which the English language perhaps has no word.In an age which underplays the dignity of serving, it is hard to understand that aspect alone of Frances’s make-up, a woman so able in her own right. Her role was texture, layered, diverse. It has been described as a kind of “marriage without the marriage.”What kept them from transgression, or even true and godly romance, was their shared sense of calling. Stott believed God had called him to a life of singleness so he could give himself to writing, teaching, and raising up leaders. Whitehead believed God had called her to a life of singleness so she could serve Stott. Mark Labberton says, “It was a relationship of mutual honor and love, respect and affection, playfulness and partnership, independence and interdependence. John was able to do what he did because Frances was able to do what she did.”Whitehead’s life is interesting because she is an interesting person, but it is interesting as well because it intersected the life of such an important figure. She allowed him to be who he was, and she allowed him to do what he did. Those of us who have benefitted from Stott’s books and commentaries and other efforts have unknowingly benefitted from Whitehead’s long service. She is one of those unsung and unknown Christians who faithfully served her Savior by serving one of his servants. I am thankful that we can now know her story as well as Stott’s, because it is, really, just one story in two parts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I3A4ZX2M4TD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NRBM71O#wasThisHelpful","R3I3A4ZX2M4TD5","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hold on! Is it a book about prayer? Another book about prayer? Is there any possible way we can benefit from yet another book on the subject of prayer? Tim Keller’s Prayer: Experiencing Awe and Intimacy with God answers with a decisive yes.Now here’s the interesting thing. There is not much new in this new book. As Keller says, the best books on prayer have already been written. So instead of pursuing novelty (see The Prayer of Jabez or The Circle Maker or a thousand other books) Keller looks to the past, to the deep wells of Christian history, and draws heavily from Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Owen, and Edwards (and, in more recent history, Edmund Clowney). He understands that any new insights on prayer tend to go farther from rather than closer to biblical truth. Instead of looking for new secrets to discover or keys to unlock, Keller looks for fresh ways of saying those old things. Again, there is nothing profoundly new in this new book, but that is its strength, not its weakness.Keller begins his book in an interesting place—the tension between two kinds of prayer. Christians tend to describe prayer in one of two ways: communion-centered or kingdom-centered. Communion-centered prayer is “a means to experience God’s love and to know oneness with him. [Such authors] promise a life of peace and of continual resting in God. [They] often give radiant testimonies of feeling regularly surrounded by the divine presence.” Kingdom-centered prayer “sees the essence of prayer not as inward resting but as calling on God to bring in his kingdom. Prayer is viewed as a wrestling match, often—or perhaps ordinarily—without a clear sense of God’s immediate presence.” He opts to discard the either-or view and will not drive a wedge between the two. Prayer is both conversation and encounter with God.This is not to say he advocates the kind of prayer you might find among the Roman Catholic mystics whose books remain so popular today. In fact, he pushes firmly against mysticism, against meditation as being an emptying of the mind rather than a filling of it, or against rapturous but mindless prayers. But still he leaves plenty of room for true communion with God, and for the illuminating work of the Holy Spirit who may bring Scripture to mind and cause us to understand it better in those times we are prayerfully meditative. Even as he teaches these things, he leans on the Reformers and Puritans.As I began to read, I had thought that Keller’s purpose in the book might be to try to resolve the mysteries of prayer. Over time, though, I came to see that this is not the case. There is much about prayer we cannot understand and may never understand on this side of eternity (and perhaps even after). Keller peers into these mysteries, but he does not attempt to resolve them. He understands that prayer will always be difficult and never over-promises, never lays out a plan that, if followed, will supposedly bring guaranteed or overwhelming results. We can grow in our understanding of prayer and our skill at prayer, but we will never solve it, and will never pray perfectly.One particularly interesting aspect of the book is Keller’s definition of prayer. Few books on prayer pause to actually define prayer, but Keller gives it his best shot. Prayer, he says, is a personal, communicative response to the knowledge of God. This accounts for the universality of prayer—all religions, and very nearly all human beings, pray. They pray because they have some knowledge of God through his creation. But as God awakens the hardened hearts of his people, Christians are now able to pray on the basis of much greater and much more specific knowledge. Thus, for the Christian, “praying is continuing a conversation that God has started through his Word and his grace, which eventually becomes a full encounter with him.”Early in his book Keller critiques most books on prayer as being “primarily theological or devotional or practical, but seldom do they combine the theological, experiential, and methodological all under one cover.” This is what he has attempted to do, and it is exactly what he has done, as displayed in the book’s five parts: Desiring Prayer, Understanding Prayer, Learning Prayer, Deepening Prayer, Doing Prayer. He has written a winsome, well-rounded book that leads through theory and into practice. It is one of the strongest books on prayer I have ever read and it receives my highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12XYRAFWMRT1L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INIXGIO#wasThisHelpful","R12XYRAFWMRT1L","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What is a man’s greatest challenge? Of all the virtues described in the Bible, which is the one that causes men the most pronounced struggle as they seek to exemplify it? Many will be tempted to look straight to sexual purity and the allure of sexual sin, but in his book A Man’s Greatest Challenge Dai Hankey looks at another virtue: Self-control. I am inclined to agree with him. I have often described self-control as “the lost virtue” and can think of no other book that deals with that virtue and nothing else. Here is what Hankey says:The battle for self-control has been the greatest challenge of my life. The faces of the issues I have sought to gain control over may have changed over the years, but the roots have remained and the struggle has never subsided. Looking back, my deepest regrets have come from losing control in one way or another. And my greatest frustrations have come from believing that I’d finally conquered certain sins, only to find my self-control failing as I messed up once again.Perhaps you can identify. Perhaps you have a history of blowing up in anger, or drinking to excess, or being unable and unwilling to look up from your mobile phone, or dedicating so much time and attention to online pornography. The specifics may change, but the heart of it is the same: a lack of self-control. Says Hankey, “I want to tell you that building a life of lasting self-control is possible, though it is a challenge that requires honesty, sweat, tears, humility and faith. I’m praying that the gospel truths in this book would change your life as you read it as much as they have changed mine as I’ve written it.”A Man’s Greatest Challenge uses an extended metaphor to instruct the reader about self-control. The author looks to the Old Testament and the many kings who were instructed by God to build walls around their cities. These walls functioned like self-control functions in our lives, keeping the enemy at bay. When the walls fell or when the walls were untended, the enemy was quick to take advantage. King Solomon himself said, “Like a city whose walls are broken down is a man who lacks self-control” (Prov 25:28).This metaphor extends through the book, and Hankey invests a great deal of effort in properly equipping the reader to understand self-control. There are no quick-fixes here. While the book is practical and provides clear and specific guidance on self-control, it first takes long looks at building a plan of action, understand the consequences of past sin, rightly putting sin to death, and laying a proper foundation through identifying with Christ. With these building blocks in place, he is finally able to instruct the reader in putting on the great virtue of self-control.Written with winsome honesty and refreshing candor, this is a book that will benefit any man who chooses to read it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JQL9L4NTAHWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2AMNLI#wasThisHelpful","R1JQL9L4NTAHWX","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am often asked where the Christian book market is lacking. While there are certain topics that have been addressed by a multitude of good books (e.g. prayer, marriage, evangelism) there must be a few that have yet to receive substantial attention. For a long time I have pointed to the lack of good books on sexual purity that are targeted at women. Thankfully, Christian publishers are beginning to address the issue, and to address it well.We all know that we live in an increasingly pornified culture, where what was once shockingly pornographic is now considered humdrum and hardly worthy of comment. We all know that pornography is a plague that has effected an entire generation of young men. But all the attention focused on men may mask the fact that many women struggle as well. Some studies suggest as many as one in five women regularly access pornography; The Fifty Shades of Grey phenomenon showed that women are eager to buy and read erotica. Yet, while lust is an equal-opportunity sin, the great majority of resources are directed at men.New from author Helen Thorne is Purity Is Possible: How to Live Free of the Fantasy Trap. This book addresses fantasy, erotica and pornography, and does so from a female perspective. Thorne is transparent (but not vulgar) in describing her own struggles with lust and in sharing how she has gained increased victory over the sin. She writes in a friendly and conversational tone, inviting the readers to join her arm-in-arm as they pursue purity together.There is a rumor going around that women don’t watch online sex. There’s a school of thought that says that our fantasies are romantic rather than explicit. Some argue that we don’t think as visually as men, so pornography is rarely appealing. A few believe that we are, by nature, more pure and innocent.I wish the rumors were right. They’re not. Not in my experience, and not in the experience of most women I know.But there’s another rumor going around… That there is a way out. That, in Jesus, God offers forgiveness and change.I’m so glad that rumor is true; that it can be the experience of any and everyone.Eternity is open.Purity is possible.Purity is possible, and Thorne shows from God’s Word just how it is possible.One strength of Thorne’s work is that she carefully addresses the heart and not merely the outward behavior. When it comes to sexual sin or any other sin that is manifested outwardly, it is so easy to fixate on behavior modification. But she coaches the reader in examining her heart, and learning the deeper sin problem that is causing her to act out lustfully. She deals well with true repentance, pointing out the difference between tears that flow out of shame and tears that flow out of a true desire to repent. “You can’t cry guilt away. You need to give it away.”For one reason or another there continues to be far more stigma attached to a woman’s struggle with purity than a man’s. Because the social cost is higher, admitting the struggle and crying out for help becomes that much more difficult. I trust that through this book and others we will be able to admit together that lust is not only an issue that men struggle with. I trust that this book can help many women admit their struggle, battle their sin, and find true victory over it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VOHFNXJXX997/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2AZLWG#wasThisHelpful","R1VOHFNXJXX997","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most churches in America have fewer than 75 members. My guess is that most churches in Canada are even smaller. Small churches are necessarily limited in much of what they can do and what they can offer in local and international missions. Is there a solution? Is there a way that small churches can have a big impact? Chris Bruno and Matt Dirks think there is and their new book Churches Partnering Together offers their solution.Bruno and Dirks pastor in Hawaii and there they face unique challenges, and challenges that sound quite similar to the ones we face here in Canada. People leave Hawaii to pursue theological education in the continental U.S., but then never come back, and the same thing happens here. The churches in Hawaii (or the solid ones, at least) tend to be fairly small, just like in Canada. And so these pastors and others like them have had to come up with creative solutions, and, even better Bible-based solutions.In Churches Partnering Together, the two pastors share their vision for churches partnering together for the sake of the gospel. And it’s not just small churches either. As the authors say,In this book we will explore how churches, big and small, can partner together for the sake of the kingdom. We want to help smaller-church leaders see possibilities for kingdom impact they might not have envisioned before, and we want to help bigger-church leaders see the blessing of working alongside smaller churches. We will encourage smaller churches to stop passively coveting megachurches and larger churches to stop trying to go it alone. Instead, we will urge large and small churches to start dreaming big dreams for the kingdom together. We’ll also give lots of practical guidance from our own experience and the experience of others that will help bring these dreams to reality.Their dream is to see what they call kingdom partnerships. “A kingdom partnership is a gospel-driven relationship between interdependent local churches that pray, work, and share resources together strategically to glorify God through kingdom-advancing goals they could not accomplish alone.”The authors structure the book around three themes: the biblical and theological basis for kingdom partnerships (which they draw largely from Paul’s Jerusalem collection), the actual process of beginning a partnership, and the goal of expanding and multiplying such partnerships. And I have to say, they present a vision that is both exciting and compelling. They present the vision and offer a lot of practical help in actually bringing it about.What I see here in Canada is that denominations tend to be less important than in days past. It may be that denominations are yesterday’s means of collaboration. Today, churches band together on the basis of shared passions and shared theological emphases. Over the past couple of years I have had the opportunity to see the struggles and drawbacks of churches that try to go it alone. I have also seen the blessings that can come to and through churches that forge gospel partnerships. I have been blessed to see churches in my area begin to form strategic partnerships, and to begin to work together. And I pray for more of it.Churches Partnering Together is a helpful guide to the importance and the practicalities of forging meaningful relationships between whole congregations. It is my hope that many churches—especially smaller churches—will read it and implement it, to the glory of God.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39JAIPEDETNZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQGLWXU#wasThisHelpful","R39JAIPEDETNZ4","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a simple rule with books by William Farley: If he writes it, I read it. The common element in all of his books it easy to spot: the gospel. Outrageous Mercy is a long look at the cross, Gospel-Powered Parenting is a personal favorite that describes the centrality of the gospel in parenting; Gospel-Powered Humility looks at the cardinal virtue of the Christian life and how we can have it through the power of the gospel. And now, in Hidden in the Gospel he teaches why you ought to preach the gospel to yourself every day. Even better, he models how to do it.Over the past few years we have been indundated with books about the gospel. Don’t think I am complaining about the trend, though. It would be difficult to find anything wrong with a corporate obsession with the good news of what Christ has done. I have read many of these books, and find myself especially drawn to those that advance the discussion a notch or two. Hidden in the Gospel is just such a book.Here is what he says in the opening chapter:The book you are holding is a tutorial on how to preach the gospel to yourself. I am shamelessly and unapologetically building on the ideas of men like [Martyn] Lloyd-Jones, [Jack] Miller, and [Jerry] Bridges. But I am also speaking from personal experience. I have discovered the benefit of continually preaching the gospel to myself. It has melted the fog of depression, repulsed the demons of despair, and displaced feelings of unworthiness and failure with the love of God. When I have been discouraged, it has motivated me to keep plodding. It has humbled me before the wonder of God’s glorious grace. It has encouraged me to love God and others. It has prompted me to be patient with the failings of others. It has urged me to forgive seventy times seven times.He goes on to offer seven benefits of cultivating the discipline of preaching the gospel to yourself:Those who preach the gospel to themselves are regularly and repetitively exposed to the glory of God.Those who preach the gospel to themselves grow in humility.Those who preach the gospel to themselves are most likely to gain deliverance from that three-headed monster of guilt, inferiority, and low self-image.Those who preach the gospel to themselves accelerate their sanctification.Those who preach the gospel to themselves are increasingly “abounding in thanksgiving” (Col. 2:6).Those who preach the gospel to themselves are increasingly hopeful.Those who preach the gospel to themselves are repeatedly led to worship.Farley teaches the importance of understanding and celebrating a very broad view of the gospel, one that extends from God’s electing love all the way to the sure hope of eternity. And then he shows how those truths, when rightly understood, can be preached to yourself day by day, all throughout your life. The strength and uniqueness of the book is its practicality. Where other books may discuss the practice of preaching the gospel to yourself, and while they may give brief examples, this is a whole book on the subject. Each chapter culminates with pointers on the practice and even a sample prayer that celebrates the truth taught.All through the book, Farley displays and proclaims an indebtedness to Jack Miller (who first taught the importance of preaching the gospel to yourself every day) and to Jerry Bridges (who popularized the practice). He also draws from other recent and popular books on the subject. But, as I said, he advances the discussion by providing a sweeping view of the gospel and by showing how each gospel truth perfectly lends itself to both teaching and encouragement.If you have been wondering about what it means to preach the gospel to yourself, or if you have been struggling with the practice, you’ll find no better guide than Hidden in the Gospel. It is short, it is practical, and it is rich.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19D28SPUUO8WJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NNZ19LS#wasThisHelpful","R19D28SPUUO8WJ","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Habits are tricky things. We are more than our habits, but certainly not less. We live so much of our lives according to our habits, but still remain responsible for what we do and what we do not do. Some habits emerge without any thought and through mindless, repetitive actions, while others are formed only through deliberate effort. As Christians we work to build godly habits and put aside ungodly habits, but learn not to depend on habits for our salvation or lean too heavily upon them for sanctification.Habits are the subject of the bestselling The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do In Life and Business by Charles Duhigg. It is a fascinating book, and especially so when it focuses in on the habits that make our lives what they are.We are creatures of habit, and I have to assume that God designed us this way. He designed us so we form neurological pathways that condition us to do certain things in a kind of routine. “When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making. It stops working so hard, or diverts focus to other tasks. So unless you deliberately fight a habit—unless you find new routines—the pattern will unfold automatically.”Here we see both the beauty and the horror of habits, the beauty of habits as they would exist in a perfect world and the horror of habits as they exist in a sin-stained world. Habits allow behavior to unfold automatically and without thinking, so that once we set them in motion, they unfold along established pathways. “The problem is that your brain can’t tell the difference between bad and good habits, and so if you have a bad one, it’s always lurking there, waiting for the right cues and rewards.” Both virtue and vice can be packaged within habits so that, to some degree, both positive and negative actions can be done on a near-subconscious level.This is why we teach ourselves to form habits like reading the Bible at the very beginning of the day or to have family worship immediately after dinner—once the habit is established, we will obey its summons to do those things that are so important to our lives. And this is why we have such trouble battling those long-established habits of sin—once the habit is established, we will battle to disobey its summons to do those things that are so destructive. It seems like it should be so easy to stop looking at pornography, to stop drinking to excess, or to stop gorging ourselves on food, but our habits drive and cajole us into old patterns.At heart, habits are quite simple. “This is how new habits are created: by putting together a cue, a routine, and a reward, and then cultivating a craving that drives the loop.” The craving is the key: The things we crave are the things that power our habits. If we are to form good habits, we need to crave the right things, and if we are to break bad habits, we need to learn to control the bad cravings. Duhigg says, “Cravings are what drive habits. And figuring out how to spark a craving makes creating a new habit easier.”Duhigg looks at habits from a decidedly non-Christian and evolutionary perspective, but still offers a great deal of wisdom that will be of great interest to Christians. I was especially interested to see Duhigg enforce the importance of community in overcoming negative habits. “The evidence is clear: If you want to change a habit, you must find an alternative routine, and your odds of success go up dramatically when you commit to changing as part of a group. Belief is essential, and it grows out of a communal experience, even if that community is only as large as two people.” This sounds completely consistent with a Christian ethic which calls upon Christians to confess their sin to one another, to pray for one another, and to bear one another’s burdens. This is never more important than when trying to overcome old and sinful patterns of behavior.When Paul told us to be transformed by the renewing of our minds (see Romans 12:2), I am sure he was referring not only to thoughts, but also to habits because habits, too, emerge from the mind. Duhigg shows us the power of habits, but also the importance of overcoming and replacing bad habits. After all, “once you know a [bad] habit exists, you have the responsibility to change it.” As Christians acknowledging the existence of God, we have a heightened responsibility to use the power of habit with the greatest care and the greatest wisdom.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13R27K25LPFME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055PGUYU#wasThisHelpful","R13R27K25LPFME","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is a question I often receive: What books do you recommend for new Christians? There is a short list of books I would love for every Christian to read shortly after they put their faith in Christ: Jerry Bridge’s The Discipline of Grace and R.C. Sproul’s The Holiness of God, to name just a couple. Another one I recommend widely is Donald Whitney’s Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life. First published in 1991, the book has finally been expanded and updated in a second edition. It is better than ever.Whitney bases the book around a simple command from 1 Timothy 4:7: “Discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness.” Whitney explains, “If your purpose is godliness—and godliness is your purpose if you are indwelled by the Holy Spirit, for He makes godliness your purpose—then how do you pursue that purpose? According to this verse, you “discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness.” It is absolutely crucial that the Christian discipline himself to live a distinctly Christian life.In the first chapter Whitney dives right into the concept of spiritual disciplines, explaining that they exist for the purpose of godliness. They do not save us and do not make God love us more; rather, they are the means God uses to conform us to Christ’s image. “The Spiritual Disciplines are those personal and interpersonal activities given by God in the Bible as the sufficient means believers in Jesus Christ are to use in the Spirit-filled, gospel-driven pursuit of godliness, that is, closeness to Christ and conformity to Christ.”Through eleven chapters Whitney explains and unpacks ten important disciplines. He covers the disciplines of Bible intake (which receives two chapters), prayer, worship, evangelism, serving, stewardship, fasting, silence and solitude, journaling, and learning. As he does this, he provides a framework for living a God-glorifying Christian life.The book has several notable strengths.First, it is bounded by Scripture. It would be easy to go far beyond the limits of Scripture, and to make every good idea a biblical discipline. Whitney allows Scripture to speak and always submits to its authority. This is especially noteworthy since so many similar books tend to tip into mysticism or to advocate practices that are unbiblical. Whitney teaches nothing but what is modeled in Scripture. He advocates a sola scriptura spirituality.Second, the book draws deeply from the Puritans and other Christians who have been committed to lives of godliness. Whitney pulls out many powerful quotes and illustrations drawn from days gone by.Third, the book is broad, covering ten important disciplines ranging from those done in quiet and secrecy (fasting and solitude) to those done in public view (worship and evangelism). Through the eleven chapters, the reader will receive Bible-based guidance that will impact every area of life.Fourth, the final chapter is a powerful call to persevere in these disciplines. If you are like me, you find it simple enough to maintain a discipline for a week or two, but then find your self-control lapsing and your old habits returning. These disciplines may bear some fruit if practiced for a week, but they will bear much better and much more lasting fruit if practiced over an entire lifetime.Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life was a book I read almost a decade ago—the first book I ever read on the subject of the spiritual disciplines. It proved foundational to my life and faith, and its lessons remain with me to this day. I am thrilled that there is now a second edition that has been both improved and expanded. I cannot commend it too highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2INB3M9R9IUKO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDHWG2M#wasThisHelpful","R2INB3M9R9IUKO","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once bitten, twice shy. That pretty much describes my response to most major marketing campaigns by Christian publishers. So often I’ve found that the best books are the ones that appear with the least fuss, and that the ones carried in on the back of a major marketing wave prove to be disappointing. But not always.Jen Wilkin’s Women of the Word has been the beneficiary of some major marketing efforts. It was the talk of this year’s Gospel Coalition National Conference for Women and has been pushed heavily in the blogosphere. And I’m glad to say that it proved my skepticism wrong—it is an excellent little book.Wilkin loves God’s Word and she loves to teach others to love it as well. Her book is designed to awaken that same love in others, and especially in other women. It is, after all, meant to call women to the Word so they can be women of the Word.She opens biographically, telling about her growing passion for the Bible—for reading it, for knowing it, for teaching it to others. She explains that the book’s purpose is “to teach you not merely a doctrine, concept, or story line, but a study method that will allow you to open up the Bible on your own. It intends to challenge you to think and to grow, using tools accessible to all of us, whether we hold a high school diploma or a seminary degree, whether we have minutes or hours to give to it each day.”Before she gets to a method of studying the Bible, she tells about two turnarounds she had to make in her life, where she replaced backward approaches to Bible study with better ones. The first was to allow the Bible to speak of God. She had been approaching the Bible as a book about her, a book answering the question “Who am I?” more than “Who is God?” The second turnaround was thinking that she should allow her heart, rather than her mind, to guide her study of the Bible. She let her feelings dictate what she read and how she read it instead of first allowing it to transform her mind. She wants her readers to know that they cannot love what their minds do not know.With those foundations in place, she makes a plea for biblical literacy and follows it with a five-part method meant to bring it about. Her description of this method, along with examples of it in action, consume the bulk of the book. She teachers her readers to study with purpose, perspective, patience, process and prayer. This method is simple enough to be practical, but significant enough to lead to deep understanding, reflection, and application. She closes with some guidance for teachers and a final call to a commitment to the Word.While I am not the target audience for the book (I don’t ever anticipate being a woman of the Word), I found it very enjoyable nonetheless. I read it at a good time in life—a time in which I am thoroughly enjoying reading God’s Word—and it fired up my love for God, and his Word, all the more.While Wilkin’s method is sound, I also enjoyed her emphases on approaching the Bible intellectually ahead of emotionally, of training the mind to train the heart. This is a missing emphasis in too many books on reading the Scriptures and, in particular, books targeted at women. The point is not that everyone who reads the Bible ought to be an outright intellectual, but that Bible-reading cannot bypass the mind.Women of the Word is a helpful little book that I cheerfully commend. (And, I should add, one Aileen read before I did and enjoyed every bit as much.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ASRLVL4J5ZWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFG0844#wasThisHelpful","R1ASRLVL4J5ZWC","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Life is complicated. Life is full of responsibilities and opportunities, planned duties and serendipitous possibilities. There is so much we could do, but so little we can do. Many of us battle our whole lives to focus on those few, significant items that we should do must do, and yet so few of us ever feel like we are even nearly succeeding.Help is here in the form of Greg McKeown’s book Essentialism. While it is not a perfect book, and while it benefits tremendously from adding a good dose of Christian thinking, it is one of the most helpful I’ve read on that constant battle to focus my time and energy on the right things.McKeown believes in what he calls Essentialism and describes the basic value proposition in this way: “only once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter.” The Essentialist pursues fewer but better opportunities and is rigidly disciplined in rejecting the many to devote himself to the few. It is “not about how to get more things done; it’s about how to get the right things done.”The way of the Essentialist means living by design, not by default. Instead of making choices reactively, the Essentialist deliberately distinguishes the vital few from the trivial many, eliminates the nonessentials, and then removes obstacles so the essential things have clear, smooth passage. In other words, Essentialism is a disciplined, systematic approach for determining where our highest point of contribution lies, then making execution of those things almost effortless.Now that sounds good! That sounds like what we all want—a clear design to our lives that simplifies decision-making and amplifies each of the opportunities we pursue.McKeown leads the reader to Essentialism in four parts:Essence. He begins by looking to the essence of Essentialism and the realities that make Essentialism a necessary but difficult practice today.Explore. Here he describes the way an Essentialist needs to think so he can pursue the highest possible contribution toward the best goals.Eliminate. Having determined the best goals, the Essentialist now needs to begin eliminating anything that will compete with the pursuit of those goals. “It’s not enough to simply determine which activities and efforts don’t make the highest possible contribution; you still have to actively eliminate those that do not.”Execute. And then comes the heart of it all—living in such a way that you now execute on those few goals, and continuing to follow the discipline of it.McKeown promises his book “will teach you a method for being more efficient, productive, and effective in both personal and professional realms. It will teach you a systematic way to discern what is important, eliminate what is not, and make doing the essential as effortless as possible. In short, it will teach you how to apply the disciplined pursuit of less to every area of your life.”And I think it can do that. It is chock-full of excellent insights and quoteable phrases. It is the kind of book you can use to implement systems in your life, or the kind of book you can plunder for its big and important ideas.Yet the Christian reader will want to read it with some discernment. This is a book that benefits from an infusion of the biblical ethos. As the book reaches its end, McKeown expands Essentialism to all of life and here he stops quoting business gurus and begins quoting religious gurus; the last chapter is easily the weakest and one that can be skipped without any great loss.Reading the book through a Christian lens improves it significantly. McKeown writes about people who always say “yes” and are afraid to say “no.” That sounds like a classic diagnosis of fear of man, a person so motivated by the praise of man that he takes on too much and says no to too little so he can win the praise of other people.Not only that, but God has a way of diverting us from what we believe are our most important tasks. He diverts us to tasks he determines are even more important, and a too-rigid adherence to Essentialism may keep a Christian from allowing and embracing those divine interruptions. Read the gospels and the book of Acts and you will see how Jesus and the Apostles were extremely focused, but also very willing to depart from their plans. Implementing Essentialism too rigidly may just lead to a self-centered life rather than a life of service to others.Reading through that Christian lens also allows us to see that Essentialism can be a means through which we honor and glorify God. It propels us to consider where God has specially gifted and equipped us to serve him and his people. Again, “Essentialism is not about how to get more things done; it’s about how to get the right things done. It doesn’t mean just doing less for the sake of less either. It is about making the wisest possible investment of your time and energy in order to operate at our highest point of contribution by doing only what is essential.” The principles of Essentialism, read and applied through the Bible, will help us understand how we are uniquely created and burdened by God to meet specific needs. And, equally helpfully, it will steer us away from those areas where we cannot contribute nearly as well.I heartily recommend the book, provided you read with Essentialism in one hand, and the Bible in the other.Let me close with a few of my favorite quotes:In many cases we can learn to make one-time decisions that make a thousand future decisions so we don’t exhaust ourselves asking the same questions again and again.If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will.We can either make our choices deliberately or allow other people’s agendas to control our lives.There are three deeply entrenched assumptions we must conquer to live the way of the Essentialist: “I have to,” “It’s all important,” and “I can do both.”If … people are too busy to think, then they’re too busy, period.Making our criteria both selective and explicit affords us a systematic tool for discerning what is essential and filtering out the things that are not.Motivation and cooperation deteriorate when there is a lack of purpose.Half of the troubles of this life can be traced to saying yes too quickly and not saying no soon enough.“We need to learn the slow ‘yes’ and the quick ‘no.’ ”","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22YOCGY56O6HC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G1J1D28#wasThisHelpful","R22YOCGY56O6HC","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It starts like this: “My name is Nate, but you can call me Samson. That’s the code name my friends have given me, and for reasons you’ll eventually understand, I’ve given the same symbolic name to each of them. We are the Samson Society.” It’s an intriguing start to the book Samson and the Pirate Monks and I, for one, wanted to know more.Nate Larkin is founder of the Samson Society, a group for men who are looking for male friendship, (dare I say it?) accountability, and authentic brotherhood. It is a group for men who have tried to do the Christian life on their own and have found it impossible. It is a group that anyone can begin, without cost, without contracts, without hassle.I have long observed that men tend to do pretty poorly with friendship. I don’t know if we are really bad at friendship or if most of us have just never given it a fair try. In either case, I think it’s clear that too few men have genuinely significant friendships.Larkin was there. From the early days of his marriage he developed bad habits which, in time, grew into outright addiction. Before long he was hooked on pornography, visiting the seedy parts of town and, eventually, visiting prostitutes. Despite being raised in a Christian environment, despite being a pastor himself, he gave in to his habits, gave in to his lusts, and found his life and marriage crumbling around him. And he dealt with it all in isolation, without men around him who could help him and guide him. Even when he saw his sin and was desperate to overcome it, his life was devoid of meaningful relationships that could make a difference. For too long he wallowed in his sin.It was only when he got other men deeply involved in his life that he was able to gain real victory over his sin. He came to realize that Christian friendship—men befriending men—is a precious gift. As he emerged from the mess of his addiction he says “I was willing to trust Christ, but I was not ready to trust the body of Christ. … What I did not yet understand was that while Jesus does offer a personal relationship to every one of his disciples, he never promises any of us a private one. … The church, according to the New Testament, is not a loose confederation of individuals. The church is a body—a living, breathing organism whose members are so intimately connected that they can only move together. On any given day, every member of that body needs help, and every member has some help to give.”Samson and the Pirate Monks is partly Larkin’s biography and partly an account of the founding of the first Samson Society. It is also a call for men to put aside their pride and inhibitions and to find meaningful relationships with one another. And it provides more than a call—it provides a defense and a structure.The book is full of helpful insights about life and faith. Things like this: “I have found that for short stretches of time I can convince myself that I am being faithful to God if I define faithfulness in terms of only one behavior.” That resonates, and so does this: “Self-righteousness … is a doubled-edged sword. If I have reduced holiness to a single behavior, then I am standing on one leg. One slip and I am nothing again, absolutely useless.” And this: “God, in his grace, has used addiction to shatter my moralistic understanding of the Christian faith and force me to accept the gospel. I am not a faithful man. That’s why I need a Savior. I cannot live victoriously on my own. That’s why I need a Helper and brothers. I cannot keep my promises to God—the very act of making them is delusional—but God will keep his promises to me.”I find books like this easy to dismiss, perhaps especially because so many of us have tried accountability relationships and found them wanting. That and we have had so many calls to relationship, to accountability, to Eldredge-style openness. But then I think about men I know and wonder how they would receive this book and, even better, the kind of relationships it models. And then I realize that men are desperate for exactly what Larkin describes here. The book may be easy to dismiss, but to dismiss it too quickly and too easily would probably say more about me than about the book and its ideas.I enjoyed Samson and the Pirate Monks thoroughly and would commend it to any Christian man. Read it, pillage it for ideas, and start pursuing true brotherhood.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JU6DVZMPY9SC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002H3MRS6#wasThisHelpful","R2JU6DVZMPY9SC","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every era of church history is dominated by a handful of towering figures. While most of the work of ministry in any age is completed by the many and the unseen, there are always the few and the fascinating who continue to capture our attention even generations later. One of the towering figures of the second half of the nineteenth century was the great American evangelist D.L. Moody, the subject of a new biography from Kevin Belmonte: D.L. Moody — A Life.Born in Northfield, Massachusetts in 1837, Moody lost his father at only four years of age and had to dedicate his younger years to supporting his family instead of to receiving an education. At seventeen he moved to Boston to pursue his fortune and began working in a store owned by his uncle. It was here, in Boston, that Moody heard and believed the gospel and became a Christian. Soon after his conversion Moody moved to Chicago where he became actively involved in ministry to children, gathering hundreds of children each week and teaching them about Jesus. This ministry led to the founding of a church—Illinois Street Church.But Moody would soon find that his greatest strength lay not in pastoring but in evangelism. In the 1870s he began to travel through North America and Europe. Collaborating with gospel singer Ira Sankey, he held massive services where thousands or tens of thousands would attend and countless people were converted. Such crusades continued for three decades until his death in 1899. In his own way he was one of the most significant figures of his time in both the United States in Great Britain. Consider this write-up in the New York Times that followed a series of New York gatherings:Whatever philosophical skeptics may say, the work accomplished this winter by Mr. Moody in this city for private and public morals will live. The drunken have become sober, the vicious virtuous, the worldly and self-seeking unselfish, the ignoble noble, the impure pure … The youth have started with more generous aims, the old have been stirred from grossness. A new hope has lifted up hundreds of human beings, a new consolation has come to the sorrowful, and a better principle has entered the sordid life of the day, through the labors of these plain men. Whatever the prejudiced may say against them, the honest-minded and just will not forget their labors of love.D.L. Moody — A Life is the first substantial biography of Moody I’ve read and I enjoyed it tremendously. One thing that appeals about Moody is his normalcy. Where a man like his contemporary Charles Spurgeon was extraordinarily naturally gifted, Moody was not—at least, not to nearly the same degree. Belmonte portrays him as a normal person who was extraordinary mainly for the ways God chose to bless his ministry. If he did have amazing natural gifts, Belmonte does not dwell on them.I was challenged by Moody’s passion and obedience. He believed the Lord had called him to preach the gospel, so that is exactly what he did. He preached it far and wide and preached it with great faith that the Lord would bring results. I was challenged by his love for people and his fervor in reaching them. I was challenged by the wide range of projects he founded and invested in.With that said, the book left me a little bit dissatisfied. I wanted to know more of Moody and to know him better. I wanted to learn more about his friendship with Spurgeon, I wanted to know more about his marriage, I wanted to know him as a father, I wanted to know more about his sins and foibles. While Belmonte briefly mentions Moody’s overbearing leadership and the way he would sometimes hurt the people around him through force of personality and sharp words, he could have given us a more complete picture of the man by showing where he was prone to sin, where he led poorly, where his faith waned. With Belmonte’s skill as a biographer, the book could easily have been another sixty or eighty pages and I am convinced that the extra length would not have been wasted.If I have a concern with the book, it is that Belmonte goes out of his way to prove Moody’s commitment to “mere Christianity”—a Christianity focused on the primary tenets of Christianity rather than being distracted by the minor and distinguishing points of doctrine. While this may be true, I tend to take the cautious approach when importing a popular and attractive modern term into an earlier period of history. While it is clear that Moody’s ministry transcended denominational boundaries, I am not as convinced that he had such a substantial focus on the “mere” and that his goal was ecumenism. It is possible, but I am not convinced.Overall, D.L. Moody — A Life is a tremendous biography and a vivid, compelling look at a life lived for the glory of God. It is a powerful introduction to a man who was greatly used and whose legacy survives to this day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BD92PXYZP1EK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H3V4X70#wasThisHelpful","R1BD92PXYZP1EK","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mariano Rivera has never been one of my favorite people. After all, for many years he was a fixture for the New York Yankees, divisional rivals of my own Toronto Blue Jays. When a game came to the final inning and the Jays were down by a run or two, Rivera would jog onto the field and shut it down. Once he came onto the field, the outcome was rarely in doubt.But he has retired now, and I like him a lot better. No sooner did he retire than he got to work penning his memoir, The Closer. It’s quite a story. Born in abject poverty in Panama, Rivera grew up in, on and around fishing boats, working with his father to scrape together a living. When the tides were out, he and his friends would play baseball on the beach, improvising the equipment they needed: wadded up fishing nets for balls, rocks for bases, tree branches for bats, and milk cartons for gloves. It was an unlikely start to one of the great baseball careers.When he was in his late teens, Rivera began playing shortstop for a nearby amateur baseball team. One day the pitcher played so badly that Rivera was asked to take over for a couple of innings. The results were so impressive that friends contacted a scout for the New York Yankees. Rivera gained a try-out, then a minor league contract. And the rest, as they say, is history. He went on to become the most dominant closer in the history of the game, earning 652 saves in the biggest baseball market in the world. He was an All-Star 13 times, won 5 World Series, and was once the World Series MVP. He had a storybook career and through it became world famous and fantastically wealthy, with his earnings topping $150 million. He has come a long way from that fishing boat in Panama.But there is more to his story than baseball. In his early twenties Rivera was exposed to the gospel and became a Christian—an unashamedly outspoken Christian. While the book describes his life, it also describes his faith and, to borrow a sport’s metaphor, he leaves it all on the field. He tells how important his faith has been, how it has sustained him, and how the Bible has given him guidance throughout his life.The Bible can’t tell you the story of my walk with the Lord, but it can tell you everything about how I try to live, and why the love of the Lord is the foundation of my whole life. For me, the Bible is not just the word of God, but a life road map that is packed with wisdom that you cannot beat even if you spent the next hundred years reading spiritual books and self-help books. It is the best kind of wisdom: Simple wisdom. This sort of wisdom, from the twenty-third chapter of Matthew, verse twelve: Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.When it comes to his faith, Rivera describes just what he believes and why he believes it. While it becomes clear that he loves the Lord, it also becomes clear that he is not a theologian. Unfortunately, a few of the things he says are unclear or confusing and probably owe more to Pentecostalism than to the historic Christian faith. And yet, again, it is clear that he is passionate about the Lord and the spread of the gospel. In the aftermath of his storied career he has both moved on and stayed just the same. “For the last nineteen seasons, the Lord has blessed me with the opportunity to play professional baseball for the New York Yankees. My job was to save games, and I loved every part of it. Now I have a new job—probably better described as a calling—and that is to glorify the Lord and praise His name, and show the wonders that await those who seek Him and want to experience His grace and peace and mercy.” To do this, he and his wife have co-founded a church where they serve as pastors.As is the case with most sports memoirs, this one is dominated by descriptions of games and plays. Those who love sports, and who love the Yankees in particular, will find it riveting. Those who are a little less enthusiastic about sports may find themselves skimming over certain sections. And if you’re like me, you may find yourself silently finding yourself hoping he’ll lose the games, just because he’s pitching for New York. In any case, Rivera’s story is a good one and well worth reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W5UWJ6D41CPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EXTQVKM#wasThisHelpful","R2W5UWJ6D41CPB","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Kevin DeYoung is quickly becoming one of my go-to authors. One of his strengths as an author is taking difficult concepts out of the academy and bringing it to those of us who do better reading at a more popular level. He did this in Why We’re Not Emergent, the book that introduced us to him, and has done it in most of the books he has written since. His newest book, Taking God at His Word, is all about the Bible and about loving the Bible and, once again, it is targeted at the general reader.He begins in Psalm 119, David’s long love song dedicated to the Bible. He begins here because David’s love for God’s Word, and David’s awe of that Word, is exactly where DeYoung wants the reader to be by the time he has finished this book. This means he starts with the application, so to speak, and then works to the information and the defense—an interesting and rather helpful way of going about things. He wants us, like David, to believe the Bible, to feel love for the Bible, and to do what the Bible says.In the second chapter DeYoung turns to 2 Peter 1 to look at the nature of the Bible as God’s inerrant revelation of himself, given through the agency of human beings who received and transmitted those words. There is nothing more steady and sure than this Word. “You do not need another special revelation from God outside the Bible. You can listen to the voice of God every day. Christ still speaks, because the Spirit has already spoken. If you want to hear from God, go to the book that records only what he has said. Immerse yourself in the word of God. You will not find anything more sure.”Over the next four chapters he uses the acronym SCAN to highlight four essential characteristics of the Bible: Sufficiency, Clarity, Authority, and Necessity.Sufficiency. The Scriptures contain everything we need for knowledge of salvation and godly living. We don’t need any new revelation from heaven.Clarity. The saving message of Jesus Christ is plainly taught in the Scriptures and can be understood by all who have ears to hear it. We don’t need an official magisterium to tell us what the Bible means.Authority. The last word always goes to the word of God. We must never allow the teachings of science, of human experience, or of church councils to take precedence over Scripture.Necessary. General revelation is not enough to save us. We cannot know God savingly by means of personal experience and human reason. We need God’s word to tell us how to live, who Christ is, and how to be saved.This is to say that God’s Word is enough, clear, final, and necessary.Having put each of these pieces in place, he looks at how Jesus understood the Bible. As Christians we necessarily wish to imitate Christ and this ought to include imitating him in his understanding of the Bible. DeYoung turns to several passages to show that Christ who was the Word, loved and honored the Word. “It is impossible to revere the Scriptures more deeply or affirm them more completely than Jesus did.”Finally, he concludes with a call to stick with the Scriptures—not to move on and not to pursue something else. And really, if we agree with anything he has taught in the previous seven chapters, we would be crazy to do anything else but to stand with and stand upon God’s Word.Taking God at His Word isn’t a book that teaches a method for studying the Bible; it doesn’t teach how to interpret or apply Scripture during personal devotions. It does something more foundational: It teaches why and how we ought to honor and respect God’s Word. DeYoung does not rely on flashy defenses or apologetics. Instead, “my conviction, born out of experience and derived from the teaching of Scripture itself, is that the most effective means for bolstering our confidence in the Bible is to spend time in the Bible.” This is just what he does. “My aim is to be simple, uncluttered, straightforward, and manifestly biblical. I make no pretenses about offering you anything other than a doctrine of Scripture derived from Scripture itself.”There are many books that do roughly the same thing Taking God at His Word does, but they tend to do it on a technical or academic level. DeYoung’s book is written for a very different audience and is meant to be entry-level and reader-friendly. It succeeds well.At Grace Fellowship Church we like to stock up on books when we can get them at great prices and give them away at strategic times. This is just the kind of book we love to buy and distribute. Every Christian needs to be anchored in the Scriptures and needs to grow in his love for Scripture. Taking God at His Word will help in both respects.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35F0WDMF74HDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFG0EPM#wasThisHelpful","R35F0WDMF74HDO","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the past few years I have found myself thinking often about beauty. I suppose my interest in the subject may relate to the fact that I am the father of two girls. Though they are still young, they are already being exposed to so many messages about the importance of beauty and the kind of beauty society expects from them. They already know they will be judged on the basis of it. For this reason I want to equip them with a knowledge of what the Bible says about beauty. But what does it say? What should I be teaching them?Beauty is the subject of a new book from mother-daughter team Carolyn Mahaney and Nicole Whitacre. In True Beauty they go looking beyond society’s perceptions and misperceptions of beauty and attempt to bring the Bible to bear. They do it well.Before I had two daughters I had three younger sisters, and for years I heard them grapple with being beautiful, looking beautiful, feeling beautiful. I heard them as they asked questions about the appropriate standards for beauty and as they doubted all we tried to tell them. I saw them try to deal with the false gospel of beauty: that beauty equals happiness, that more beauty brings more happiness, and that to be without beauty is to be without hope and fulfillment. What they didn’t want to hear is the too-easy message that outer beauty is meaningless while inner beauty is everything.They could have used this book. Speaking for both authors, Mahaney says, “My hope is that you too will be encouraged to bring every question about beauty and every struggle with your appearance to God’s Word. My prayer is that you will trust in his Word and submit to his Word, finding hope, freedom, and delight in the beauty of his truth.” It is only God’s Word that can direct us to the deepest and sweetest beauty.The authors begin by grounding beauty in the image of God. Because we are all made in God’s image, we all have inherent beauty. If God is beautiful, then so too are we, having been made in his image. “We are not beautiful because we fit the popular ideal of beauty, and we are not ugly or unattractive because we don’t measure up. Our beauty as human beings is not derived from ourselves. It comes from a beautiful God.” From Creation they go to the Fall and then to the gospel, showing that the gospel lays a double claim to our taste for beauty, first through creation and then through redemption. True beauty, they say, is to behold and reflect the beauty of God.From the source of beauty, they go to the heart, showing that human beings are glory thieves, eager to steal the glory that is rightly God’s. A woman who wishes to use beauty to draw attention to herself, is robbing God of the glory that is his. From the heart they move to the body and deal with common issues—body image, weight, and the like. They speak here of stewardship, they encourage women to care for their bodies in ways that serve the Lord, and they warn against grumbling and dissatisfaction. They move outward again from the body to the clothing, discussing the importance of modest dress and rightly showing that clothing is simply an outer reflection of the inner woman.As the book begins to draw to a close, they look at two important New Testament texts that speak to inner beauty and outer beauty. A helpful appendix provides guidance to parents who want to help their children understand God’s perspective on the subject.What you will not find in True Beauty is the all-too-common attitude that frumpiness is next to godliness. You will not find the authors trying to convince you that beauty is a problem, that Christian women ought to be ashamed of the beauty God has given them, that they’d better not do anything to enhance it. You won’t find them saying that character is all that matters. What you will find is simple, clear, practical teaching on the nature of beauty and the sheer goodness of beauty.Society gets beauty all wrong. As we examine the messages we see and hear all around us, we quickly spot the presence of idolatry. The beautiful are worshiped, while the plain are ignored or even reviled. Beauty is a cultural god. Mahaney and Whitacre do an exemplary job of going to Scripture to bring God’s wisdom to bear. And, as we would expect, his perspective is infinitely better. This is a book for any woman—an especially any young woman—to read and absorb.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HH0S9MCZRQS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFG076S#wasThisHelpful","R3HH0S9MCZRQS7","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"do not read a lot of books that make me nauseous—full out sick to my stomach. But this one did. I’ll have to grant that I have an unusually weak stomach (something that often delights my wife as we watch movies together and I have to turn away from the screen while anything medical takes place), but still, this book is disgusting. Yet in saying this, I do not mean to suggest it is a bad book. Far from it.Sex & Violence in the Bible is a survey of explicit content in God’s Word. It is just over 200 pages of examining those parts of the Bible that we so often pass over and so rarely hear from the pulpit. While such a book could so easily prove base and puerile, Joseph W. Smith wrote this one for noble purposes and with a deep desire honor God. What caught my eye and convinced me to read it was Carl Trueman’s little blurb on the cover in which he describes the work as “A needed antidote to the crudity of the schoolboy culture.” Indeed.The book is divided into three parts. In the first part Smith examines what the Bible says about sex and sexuality, from the good and beautiful to the dark and ugly. He looks at the laws and regulations that guarded sexuality, he looks at the many euphemisms used to describe sex and sexual body parts, and he looks at biblical stories where sexuality was badly misused in adultery, prostitution, voyeurism, homosexuality, and the like. The very fact that the Old Testament contains prohibitions against sex with animals shows that there is no point too low in depraved man’s descent into base and animalistic behavior. This whole section proves it again and again.In the second part Smith turns to violence. I read most of this part in a single extended reading and it was here that my stomach began to turn. The biblical descriptions of violence are blessedly spread out through the Bible, but here they are compacted into only 80 or 90 pages. It makes for a grueling glimpse into human depravity as the Bible describes beatings and attacks, disemboweling and beheading, cannibalism and rape (which Smith includes in the section on violence rather than sexuality). There is no sin, no violence, that is beyond the capacity of human beings who have turned their backs on their Creator.The final section, much shorter than the others, turns to “any unclean thing”—other blunt and unsavory material. Here Smith examines specifically the discharges, illnesses and diseases that could render a person unclean in that Old Testament context.All-in-all, it makes for a reading experience that is both awful and fascinating. Smith closes his book with a call to ponder the fact that all Scripture—not just some, but all—is profitable for teaching, as Paul insists in 2 Timothy 3:16. At the same time we are to fill our minds with whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, and so on. The call here is to fill our minds with God’s Word. The blunt reality is that all of this sex, gore and otherwise unsavory material is right there in the Word of God. So aren’t these, too, things worth pondering? If these, too, are God’s words, then why do we so often pass over them, almost as if they ended up in the Bible by mistake?As Smith makes clear, the Bible’s “approach to indecent matters is not that of a twenty-first-century schoolboy, nor is it that of a nineteenth-century Victorian housewife.” It deals bluntly with real people in the real world. It is surprisingly discreet and sweet in many of its descriptions of God’s design for sex and sexuality, and then so harsh in its descriptions of what happens outside of God’s design. “The Bible … wants to make sin seem as bad—as repulsive, disgusting, and abhorrent—as it really is. Sadly, there is often no other way to do this than by using repulsive, disgusting, and abhorrent language.” Sin’s badness is discussed frankly and, at times, graphically, because this is how God means to bring home its pure depravity.As Christians living in a world marred by human sin and depravity, by sexual sin and violence and even sexual violence, we have in Scripture descriptions of all of these. God has given us these accounts to equip us for real life in the real world. We overlook or ignore them at our own peril. Leland Ryken’s endorsement says it well: “This book serves the very useful purpose of showing us exactly how much sex and violence there is in the Bible, as well as the precise nature of the references to the human body. If the concentration of examples makes for uncomfortable reading, it is nonetheless important that we confront the subject. We need to know what kind of book the Bible is, and additionally we can assume that the references to sex and violence in the Bible tell us something that God wants us to know.”","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RGUCE0UKTO2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INGDB40#wasThisHelpful","R3RGUCE0UKTO2E","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes the form is as important as the function. This is common when it comes to art or to certain kinds of technology, but rare when it comes to books. But here’s an exception: James Anderson’s What’s Your Worldview? employs a unique form to address a common function, making this an unusual and unusually creative work.Let’s talk function first. This is a book about worldview, your “all-encompassing perspective on everything that exists and matters to us.” Whether we know it or not, we all have a worldview which accounts for our most important beliefs and the assumptions we have about this world. “It reflects how you would answer all the ‘big questions’ of human existence, the fundamental questions we ask about life, the universe, and everything.” Is there a God? Is there objective truth? Is there life after death? Is there a purpose to existence? These are all questions that pertain to and are answered by worldview.Worldviews are like cerebellums: everyone has one and we can’t live without them, but not every knows that he has one.TweetAnderson says “Worldviews are like cerebellums: everyone has one and we can’t live without them, but not every knows that he has one.” This, then, is not merely a book about worldview—we already have plenty of those—but a book meant to lead a reader to understand and evaluate the various options so he can identify his worldview. He may be deist or theist, materialist or mystic, pantheist or polytheist, or just about anything rational or irrational combination.This is the function of the book: identifying that worldview. But the form merits special mention. Do you remember those old Choose Your Own Adventure books? My brother loved those books when he was a boy and he accumulated quite a collection. Instead of telling a story in a linear way, beginning at the first page and ending at the last page, the Choose Your Own Adventure books allowed the reader to make decisions and, based on those decisions, to turn to one page or another, to move the story in this direction or that. In this way the reader was fully involved in the story and took on the role of a character. There were a variety of possible outcomes to the book, and the outcomes were determined by the reader’s choices.What’s Your Worldview? is structured in much the same way. It is not meant to be read in a linear fashion. Instead, the reader is asked questions at the end of each page, and the answer to each of those questions will lead him along different paths and to different conclusions. “Is there a Supreme Being that deserves our worship and gives meaning, purpose, and direction to the universe and to human life?” If you believe there is, you will turn to page 45; if you believe there is not, you will turn to page 43. Your choices determine your outcome, which is to say, your choices define your worldview.While the subject matter of What’s Your Worldview? is not novel, the form is, and that makes this an interesting and enjoyable book to read. It offers a uniquely interactive approach to finding answers to life’s biggest and most important questions. It makes identifying your worldview, and perhaps replacing it with a better one, just a bit of an adventure. I like it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V6LZVFLRTJ5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HDHUU12#wasThisHelpful","R1V6LZVFLRTJ5X","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife became a Christian the first time she heard the gospel. It didn't take years, or even months or weeks of soul-searching. It didn't take a great pilgrimage or a critical analysis of the Bible's trustworthiness or inerrancy. A very practical person who had been raised without reference to religion, she heard the gospel at the age of eighteen, understood that it made sense of the world and her life, and responded in faith. Since that time she hasn't seriously considered reconsidering.But not everyone's journey is quite so simple or straightforward. We are all different people with a very different make up. Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus is Nabeel Qureshi's story of how he became a Christian, and his story could not be more different from my wife's.Qureshi was born the eldest son of Pakistani immigrants and he grew up in America and the U.K.—wherever the U.S. Navy assigned his father. His parents were devout Muslims and wherever they went, they attached themselves to a mosque and to the local Islamic community. Qureshi grew up studying, understanding and loving the Koran; he performed his prayers just like every other good Muslim. His father was an amateur apologist for Islam, so he, too, grew up with an interest in defending his faith. He loved his religion in both its theology and its practice.While Qureshi was in college he met David Wood, a young Christian man who, like him, was studying toward a career in medicine. The two became fast and dedicated friends, who loved and respected one another despite adhering to very different faiths. As their relationship continued, they became religious sparring partners, each testing and challenging the other.It was through these conversations that Qureshi began to grapple with the claims of Christianity that countered his Islamic faith. He grappled with the authority and reliability of the Bible contra the authority and reliability of the Koran; he grappled with salvation by faith in Jesus Christ contra salvation by accruing good deeds; he grappled with the deity of Jesus Christ contra the prophecies of Mohammad.Eventually, through years of debates, through interacting with some of the most significant Christian apologists, and through deep soul-searching, Qureshi began to doubt everything he had ever believed about Islam. In Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus he essentially tells two stories: his crumbling Islamic faith and his newfound Christian faith. He came to the conviction that Islam simply could not withstand careful scrutiny, because he believed its scriptures are unreliable and its prophet neither admirable nor prophetic. At the same time, he came to the conviction that Christianity could withstand the most careful scrutiny, because he believed its scriptures are completely reliable and its central figure not only admirable but the very Son of God.His story is especially interesting and important in a few ways. First, he gives an insider's perspective of the Muslim mindset. There are some unique challenges to reaching Muslims, especially in their understanding of authority and the difficulties they face in rejecting the faith of their families. Those who have the opportunity to share the gospel with Muslims will do well to read and consider these. He also discusses the vast difference between the mindset of first-generation immigrant Muslims and their children. Though the children are usually practicing Muslims, they are also Westernized and less tied to the tenets of the parents' faith. Finally, he dispels some of the fear about radical Islam. His parents were devout, but not radical. In the aftermath of 9/11 they faced some measure of persecution despite despising and disavowing what the terrorists had done. Qureshi portrays his family as loving, kind and close rather than cold and domineering. This is very consistent with the Muslim families I know and admire today.If I have hesitations about the book, it is largely in the area of extra-biblical encounters with the Lord. Qureshi describes several dreams or visions that played into his conversion and, while such tales are very common among former Muslims (Muslims, after all, regard dreams as especially important) it does seem to clash with his belief in the authority and even the sufficiency of Scripture. One could read this book and almost assume that the Lord may or will owe us dreams to help convince us of truth; yet God promises nothing more and nothing less than the Holy Spirit illuminating the Bible.Every few years the Christian world receives another important apologetic work. Lee Strobel brought us The Case for Christ where he, as a reporter, applied his reporting skills to the Christian faith and emerged a Christian. J. Warner Wallace brought us Cold-Case Christianity where he, as a crime scene investigator, applied his investigation skills to the Christian faith and emerged a Christian. Qureshi's book is similar in that he is a careful, logical, analytical thinker who unexpectedly finds himself coming to the Christian faith. With over a billion Muslims in the world today, Christians need to be equipped to share their faith with those who love and honor Islam. Qureshi has given us a valuable tool to read and to share.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGCYD8M95SRDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DL18FMU#wasThisHelpful","RGCYD8M95SRDL","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I believe there is a Christian way to think about everything. Yes, everything. What the Bible does not address explicitly, it addresses implicitly; what it does not address directly, it address in principle. But in the end, the Bible has something to say about everything. One of the joys of reading Christian books is to see author after author address Christian thinking and Christian living in their area of passion of expertise. Over the past few years we’ve seen books on Christians and technology (by yours truly), Christians and work (by, among others, Greg Gilbert and Sebastian Traeger), Christians and marriage (Tim & Kathy Keller) and on and on.New to the market is Matt Perman’s What’s Best Next: How the Gospel Transforms the Way You Get Things Done. This is a book on productivity, on getting things done. But it’s more than that. It’s not only about getting things done, but about getting the best things done, and doing it all in the right way.I have read widely in the area of productivity and best practices, and over the past years have developed systems that allow me to get a lot of things done without any part of my life crumbling under the pressure (so far, at least). Many of the systems I have adopted were inspired by the writings of unbelievers and I had to find ways of applying Christian thinking to them. And this is exactly what Perman does in What’s Best Next. Even though I have read many of these books and thought deeply about these issues, I still learned a lot from him. Perman takes the work of men like Peter Drucker, David Allen, Stephen Covey, Tim Ferris and many others, and examines them through the lens of Scripture. What is good he accepts, what is bad he rejects, and what is somewhere in-between he adapts.At heart the book is about “getting things done and making ideas happen, with less friction and frustration, from a biblical perspective.” Perman aims to change the way we think about productivity and then to present a practical approach that will allow us to become more effective in life and to live with less stress and less frustration. This makes it a book for anyone who needs to get things done, but especially for those involved in knowledge work and the realm of ideas.Perman begins by explaining that making God supreme in our productivity is of utmost importance. This is the foundation upon which everything else is built. He then introduces his concept of “gospel-driven productivity,” which is getting the right things done—the good works we are called to as believers.The heart of the book is four parts, each composed of several chapters, in which Perman explains his DARE model of productivity: Define, Architect, Reduce, Execute. In the define step you will look at mission and vision to determine your roles and responsibilities and which should be prioritized. In the architect step you will create structure and routine that will allow you to properly balance each of these responsibilities. In the reduce step you will learn to get rid of those things that only distract from your core mission and will also learn the importance of delegation and automation. In the execute step you will learn the importance of planning your week, of managing workflow, and even of dealing with the never-ending deluge of email. The book closes with a couple of chapters on actually living out all of this.On the negative side, the book is probably 60 or 80 pages longer than it needs to be, a fact that is tinged with irony since the book deals with productivity. Of course this length is a product of Perman’s logical step-by-step progression through the topic, something I find difficult to criticize. Still, I think the steps are a little bit smaller than they really need to be, making the book a little more intimidating and time-consuming than it ought to be.On the plus side, there is nothing quite like this book. Perman teaches that true productivity is not getting more done, but getting the right things done—the things that serve others to the glory of God. He does not leave this as an idea for us to execute as we see fit, but provides a thoughtful, logical, do-able way of living so those first things really do remain first. This makes What’s Best Next a worthy investment of your money and, that most precious of resources, your time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QJRF0TYC3N74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006FP4PVY#wasThisHelpful","R3QJRF0TYC3N74","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I met Ben Zobrist at the first conference I ever spoke at. I was in Nashville, at Community Bible Church, to speak on discernment, and someone introduced the two of us, telling me that Ben was a major league baseball player with the Tampa Bay Rays. I think he was manning the book table at the time. We talked for a few minutes and he told me that the next time the Rays came through Toronto, I should look him up. I did that, and it has become something of a tradition, so that once or twice a year I spend a few hours rooting against him, and then, after the game, we get together to spend some time catching up. It has been fun to watch his rise from a utility player and pinch hitter bouncing between the majors and minors, to a two-time All Star who is undoubtedly one of the most under-rated players in Major League Baseball.What I appreciate about Ben is that he seems unchanged by the fame and the fortune that have come his way through being a professional athlete. He is as down-to-earth today as the day I met him, still a small-town pastor’s son unimpressed with his own success. He is a humble guy who sees his career as a unique opportunity to speak about Christ. As he has established himself as a great player, he has seen those opportunities grow.Ben and his wife Julianna have teamed up with Mike Yorkey to write ""Double Play."" This is really four different stories woven into one: Ben’s long climb to the major leagues, Julianna’s growth as a professional singer, their spiritual journey as individuals and then as a couple, and the tale of two people falling in love. Each of the stories is enjoyable and well-told. They open up their lives with honesty, yet without exhibitionism. You won’t have to be a hopeless or sheepish romantic to enjoy reading about how they met and fell in love and (finally!) married. You won’t have to be a baseball fan to enjoy reading about Ben’s struggles and successes at the plate.A few aspects of the book merit special mention.Ben tells about his early career as a major leaguer where he struggled and found himself demoted. He went through an excruciating depression where he blamed God for his failure and just wanted to give up. Yet through this time, and with the help of his pastor Byron Yawn, he came to see that he had made baseball into his idol, the one thing in all the world he felt he needed to succeed at in order to experience joy and fulfillment. It was only when he was able to identify this as idolatry that he was able to recover his joy in the Lord.Julianna shares that as a young girl she was sexually assaulted. She describes how this affected her and how the weight of it has carried into her adult life and even into her marriage. She describes Ben’s kindness and patience in helping her come to terms with what happened to her. Those who have experienced similar grief will be helped, I think, by her openness and honesty.Finally, the Zobrists make no attempt in ""Double Play"" to hide or disguise who they are and what they believe. From the first page to the last, the book is soaked in their Christian faith. Both Ben and Julianna grew up in Christian homes as the children of pastors and both of them have a deep and mature commitment to the Lord. They go to a great church today and, despite the difficulties of a career that involves seven months a year of near-constant travel, they celebrate it and are committed to it. They get the gospel and are eager to share their faith with those who read their story.Sports memoirs vary greatly in their quality, and, though I admit my bias, I can say confidently that this is one of the good ones, up there with the likes of R.A. Dickey’s ""Wherever I Wind Up."" Zobrist is one of baseball’s best players and one of the sport’s men of true character. His story—and Julianna’s—are worth knowing. If you like baseball or if you like memoir, you’ll enjoy this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N2VIGKAEYVWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433683318#wasThisHelpful","R2N2VIGKAEYVWA","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew Aileen was a keeper from the first day we met (in high school) and from the first words she ever spoke to me (“I’m going to kill you!”). I can’t quite say it was love at first sight, but it wasn’t too far from it. I appreciated that she was feisty and not the least bit boring. The more I got to know her, the more intrigued I was by her strength and the more I wanted to take hold of that strength, and the woman behind it.There are rumors out there, perhaps deliberately sown or perhaps just based on a misunderstanding, that men who hold to complementarian theology want their women weak. There are some who state that those who believe God has created men and women to fulfill different functions and to take on different roles in life and marriage want women to be pushovers or doormats. Stuff and nonsense, I say.Recently Aileen bought Fierce Women: The Power of a Soft Warrior by Kimberly Wagner, and after she read it, she asked me if I would do the same. She had enjoyed it so thoroughly, and felt it spoke to her so deeply, she wanted to get my take as well. I was glad she asked.Fierce Women is part biography and part theology. Kimberly Wagner is a strong woman. She has a strong personality, a strong faith in Jesus Christ, an extensive knowledge of Scripture, and a lot of natural ability. And yet for much of her life and marriage she had misused this strength. She tells the story behind her own marriage, what almost destroyed it, and what began to rebuild it. “Often marriages are caught in a destructive relationship dynamic that I call the Fierce Woman/Fearful Man cycle.” This was exactly the case in the early years of her marriage, where she had used her strength against her husband rather than using it to bless him. She had exacerbated his weaknesses instead of complementing them with her strength.I often tell men that while “fear of man” may be the theological category, “fear of wife” is the way it commonly plays out. Men who may lead hundreds or thousands in the workplace are terrified to lead in their own homes. This reflects lack of character on a man’s part, but it may also be a result of the way his wife relates to him. Wagner nails it when she says, “Your husband may never admit this to you, but he may fear you. He may be terrified to make decisions because he feels he never does anything right, is unable to please you, or could never measure up to your expectations. Or he may be intimidated by your fierceness or passion.”""The Fierce Woman can be a living inspiration but her ferocity can also morph into her husband’s worst nightmare. He may respond to her fierceness by shutting down, running, responding in harsh anger, or passively retreating to his own silent world. Rather than experiencing joy and companionship, the couple caught in this miserable cycle relate to each other more like alienated roommates than passionate lovers and friends.""She is not saying that every wimpy man is a wimp because of his wife. Neither is she saying that all of a man’s problems are really his wife’s. Not at all. She is simply saying that many women misuse what God has given them. Their greatest strength may be their greatest weakness.There is hope, but the hope is not for women to become weak and wimpy.""The good news is that this destructive cycle can be reversed. But a strong woman doesn’t need to take on a wimpy persona or undergo a personality transplant in order to be the ideal wife. As a Fierce Woman, you can develop a fresh and intimate relationship with your husband. In fact, God desires for your fierceness to play an integral role in His plan for your marriage.""This book is about the beauty of fierceness, about women who use their strength to honor the Lord by honoring their husbands. “When you’re told the hurdle is higher than you can jump, fierceness is what gets your blood going and takes you flying over the top. It’s the passion that motivates you to leave the cozy comfort of safety for the dangerous adventure of the unknown. It’s that element of determination that holds you in place when weak soldiers flee. It’s loyalty and doing what’s right; brilliant intensity and going the long haul. Fierceness is fervent faith and lonely stands; solitary boldness and trying one more time.”Men are drawn to this kind of fierceness because it reflects godly character. The purpose of Wagner’s book is to identify that fierceness, to celebrate it, and to direct it toward the best and highest ends. Used wrongly it can be so destructive, but used well it can be an incredible blessing.Though this is not a book written for me, it is one I enjoyed all the way through. Wagner describes the kind of character I so admire in Aileen and the kind of character I want to instill in my daughters. She alternates seamlessly between Bible and life as she shows fierceness at its best and its worst.Fierce Women is the kind of book a feminist will hate because it affirms God-ordained differences between men and women and because it pushes women to live for the good of others, to esteem others higher than themselves. It affirms a woman’s strength, but shows the biblical way to use that strength is to direct it in love toward others.

"Pastoral ministry is a fascinating and fascinatingly unique vocation, one of peaks and valleys, one of honor and dishonor, respect and disrespect. It can swing from brutal to beautiful and back again in a single day, or a single sermon.Jared Wilson writes,The pastoral fraternity is an interesting one. We are a motley bunch of fools. Different personalities and tribes, different methodologies and styles, not to mention denominations and traditions and, of course, theologies. But there is something both lay elders and career elders have in common, something I’ve seen in the thirty-year senior pastor of a southern megachurch as well as the bivocational shepherd of a little, rural New England parish, the laid-back fauxhawked church planter and the fancy mousse-haired charismatic, and in nearly every pastor in between: a profound sense of insecurity for which the only antidote is the gospel.The Pastor’s Justification is Wilson’s response to this great vulnerability and this great need. He writes as a pastor to and for other pastors. He writes to and for those who desperately need to understand, ponder and apply the gospel, which is to say, he writes for himself first, and the rest of us only subsequently.The book’s format is simple. In Part 1: The Pastor’s Heart, he explores 1 Peter 5:1-11, an admonition to church leaders. Then, in Part 2: The Pastor’s Glory, he turns to the five solas of the Reformation to see how pastors can take more of themselves out of their ministry in order to better and more fully apply Christ and his gospel. It turns out to be a powerful one-two punch.As Wilson turns to 1 Peter he says, “My prayer is that you will find this book helpful not primarily to your pastoral ‘toolkit’ but to your heart.” And, indeed, this is exactly the book he has written. This is a book for a pastor to read, to savor, and to apply. I think there are many of us who are wary that “gospel-centered” may be the buzzword of the day, but one that will soon fade and be forgotten in favor of the next big thing. But Wilson carefully avoids cliches and easy solutions. He shows that whatever we call this thing, we absolutely must be grounded firmly and permanently in the good news of what Christ has accomplished.Wilson carefully examines and exposits this passage from Peter to speak of the pastor’s freedom in Christ, to call the pastor to personal holiness, to call him to humility, to explain the confidence he needs to have in his calling, to exhort him to be watchful, and to remind him again and again that he is already justified, already accepted by a kind and loving Father.Written from the trenches of pastoral ministry, The Pastor’s Justification is not the least bit self-pitying, self-loathing, or self-focused. It is real, but not exhibitionist; it is practical, but not legalistic; it is simple in some places and deep in others; it is gentle when it ought to be gentle, and blunt when bluntness is required. It is drenched in the gospel and drenched in the Bible. It is a book any pastor can read, enjoy and apply.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A9QDR7T6QX3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DOG44RC#wasThisHelpful","R2A9QDR7T6QX3I","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has been a few years now since I began serving as one of the pastors at Grace Fellowship Church here in Toronto. When I was first ordained, and when I first accepted a full-time position, we had a list of functions we anticipated I would fill. Yet very quickly the church entered a time of transition where we went from church planting to a time of growth and rebuilding, and my role inevitably changed. I found myself taking on new responsibilities, many of which were executive in nature: tightening and formalizing structures and procedures, and caring for many of the “trellis” functions necessary to maintain a healthy “vine” (to borrow the helpful metaphor laid out in The Trellis & the Vine). I still preach and teach regularly, counsel, oversee the weekly prayer meeting, and run the young adults ministry, so I spend plenty of time pastoring people. But that executive work still has a substantial claim on my time.Because of the nature of this work, I was excited when I learned about Invest: Your Gifts for His Mission by Sutton Turner, a book written about and for executive pastors. Turner serves as executive pastor at Mars Hill Church in Seattle, but prior to this he was in the business world for many years, working in Texas and the Middle East. The skills he gained there are skills he has now brought into the church.There are three parts to the book. In Part One, Turner defends the very idea of the executive pastor and offers an “invitation for business professionals to invest in the church—not only with their money, but also with their time, energy, and experience.” He says, “The church needs men who are willing to walk away from their careers and work as paid executive pastors, and the church needs men who will keep working their day jobs and serve as volunteer executive pastors.” The big question for this first section is simply this: Are you called to be an executive pastor?Part Two explores the role of the executive pastor. When Turner refers to this position, he refers to the second-in-charge function within the church, the person who serves as the lead pastor’s right-hand man.Early in the book, he shows that in the Old Testament there are three offices of human leadership: prophets, priests, and kings and these roles carry to the New Testament through Jesus Christ. He believes these divisions can also explain how pastors with different skill sets and capacities can function within a local church:""To a prophet goes the work of proclaiming the news of the kingdom, so that more people can receive it and be baptized. He is the primary leader, the main Bible preacher, and the visionary. If a church has any paid employees, it’s the prophet. To a priest goes the work of caring for the people of the kingdom, making disciples, and teaching the family of God how to enjoy new life in Jesus. The priest is a counselor, a midweek class teacher, or a small groups leader. A church typically has more than one priest, usually serving as unpaid volunteers. To a king goes the work of managing the kingdom, wisely stewarding the resources God has provided so that the church can grow until eventually the good news reaches all nations. The king administrates all or some of church business and operations. At a small church, the king is probably a volunteer, while a larger church might employ multiple staff to cover kingly functions.""While he admits that he may be pushing the prophet, priest and king terminology a little too far, he does believe it is helpful in understanding how God equips men to carry out different ministries.It is important to note that he defines the executive role in relation to the lead position. He compares “the lead pastor and the executive pastor to the CEO and COO of a company; the captain and first mate of a ship; the owner and coach of a football team; the president and provost of a university; and the ‘dreamer’ and the ‘schemer’ in an entrepreneurial partnership.”What does this partnership between lead pastor and executive pastor actually look like? Through the book he offers many glimpses into his relationship with Mark Driscoll and with the pastors, staff, and congregation at Mars Hill.- His role is to do things the lead pastor can’t, won’t, or doesn’t have time to do.- His role is to implement the lead pastor’s vision. “The general sense is that one leader charts the course and sets the vision while another works behind the scenes to make it happen.”- His role is to do some of the lead pastor’s “dirty work” by playing the bad guy. He describes a role he had prior to Mars Hill: “When I was working with Pastor Joe, we had an understanding: If somebody came to him with a request, he would either say ‘yes,’ or he would direct them to me. ‘Ask Pastor Sutton’ was our code for ‘no.’ If somebody came up to me after talking to Pastor Joe, I knew that my job was to graciously decline whatever it was they were asking for. In this way, I helped guard my lead pastor’s time and energy. The nos drain a lot more than the yeses.”- His role is to be the one who allows the lead pastor to “dump his bucket,” or blow off steam, since “otherwise, he’s likely to pour down on the congregation from the pulpit, which can be devastating for a church and harmful to the mission.”- His role is to provide strengths that complement the lead pastor’s weaknesses: “Wherever the lead pastor struggles—be it with fundraising, management, leadership development, guest services, or marketing—that’s where the executive pastor must be strong.”- His role is to do or to oversee the executive work in the church, which may involve real estate, policies, hiring and firing, being the “steward-in-chief,” and on and on.Part Three is given to extended interviews with several executive pastors Turner admires and is eager to learn from. A few practical appendices close out the book.I found Invest both helpful and troubling.I found Invest helpful in its call to successful, trained and called businessmen to consider bringing their skills from the world of business to the local church. While men can certainly honor and glorify God in the workforce, their skills can also be very helpful within the local church. We are accustomed to telling successful businessmen like this that God wants their money, but maybe he wants more than that.I found Invest helpful in the way it deals honestly and forthrightly with the fact that the executive function within a church truly is important and that as a church grows, it becomes a critical role. Many churches grow to a certain extent and then collapse because the “trellis” structures have not been built to withstand the weight of the “vine.” This may reflect poor stewardship, and I appreciate Turner’s emphasis on the behind-the-scenes work that allows the church to thrive. While this kind of role may reflect pragmatism or the direct assimilation of unbiblical practices from the business world, it does not have to.I found Invest helpful in the way Turner shows that the executive role is a serving role. This may be a difficult pill to swallow for men who are coming from the dog-eat-dog world of big business, but it is exactly what God calls pastors to.I found Invest unhelpful in several ways as well.I found Invest unhelpful in Mark Driscoll’s foreword where he anticipates the inevitable critiques of this book and immediately cuts them off. “Dear Bible Guy, please don’t be yet another nerd who proof texts verses on lovers of money, lording it over like the Gentiles with curse words like ‘pragmatism’ and ‘it’s all about the numbers’ criticisms. Stop using God’s word as a defense to keep working the upper body and ignoring the legs. Your church body needs some legs just like ours.”I found Invest unhelpful in that it deals exclusively with the most mega- of the mega-churches, making it difficult to apply to a smaller setting. The list of people Turner interviews and quotes are second-in-commands to Andy Stanley, Ed Young, James MacDonald, Rick Warren, Perry Noble, Bill Hybels, and so on. These are men whose churches are attended by thousands or tens of thousands and whose annual budgets are in the millions or tens of millions. It is difficult to know how the executive role may function in a church just a fraction of that size.I found Invest unhelpful in that it tacitly suggests that big churches are better than smaller churches, that numerical growth is intrinsically good, and that the primary mission of every church is to grow from big to bigger. As I mentioned earlier, Driscoll anticipates this and immediately attempts to take it out of play, but I believe he is unfair in doing this.I found Invest unhelpful in that I am not convinced that this model can function well in a church that practices eldership as I understand it—as a plurality of men with equal authority. Yes, there may be one man who is “greater among equals” through his role as the one who preaches and who offers vision and direction, but ultimately, Turner’s model presupposes a kind of leadership that places one man at the head and that builds itself around that one big personality.I anticipate three groups of people who may wish to read this book: businessmen who are considering taking their skills from the corporation to the church, executive pastors who wish to gain new perspective on their work, and lead pastors who are interested in learning how an executive pastor could serve them and their church. Each of these people will find much to learn, but I would caution them to think carefully before adopting all of what Turner offers. There are plenty of good elements in this book, but they are mixed with quite a lot that is troubling as well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI8VZFI45W69M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HDOZ2QI#wasThisHelpful","RI8VZFI45W69M","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You may love him, you may hate him, but you’ve definitely heard of him and you’ve undoubtedly got an opinion about him. Mark Driscoll is pastor of Mars Hill Church in Seattle, co-founder of the Acts 29 Network, and the author of several bestselling books. The newest of these books may well prove the most controversial. A Call to Resurgence poses this question: Will Christianity have a funeral or a future? This is a book about the past, the present and the future of the Christian faith, particularly in the United States of America.The fact is, Christendom is dead. The Christian faith that once existed in the background of American life and culture has diminished to such an extent that America is now a post-Christian nation. “Christians are ostracized. Gay marriage is celebrated. Abortion is literally destroying an entire generation. The bandwagon has stopped carrying us and has started running over us.” This is happening all around us, yet many Christians remain oblivious. “The church is dying, and no one is noticing because we’re wasting time criticizing rather than evangelizing.”But, says Driscoll, this is not the time to debate. This is not a time for retreat but for resurgence. “We’ve got work to do. There are lost people to reach, churches to plant, and nations to evangelize. Hell is hot, forever is a long time, and it’s our turn to stop making a dent and start making a difference. This is no time to trade in boots for flip-flops. The days are darker, which means our resolve must be stronger and our convictions clearer.” “This book is an unflinching look at what we’re up against and what it will take to not just survive but to thrive and accomplish the mission God has given us to extend a hand of rescue to those drowning all around us.”Driscoll believes he has been providentially situated to help the church in this time. He has spent the last twenty years of his life pastoring a church in the mission field of Seattle and believes that what was once unique to that city is now true of the entire nation. “I am convinced,” he says, “that what my church has seen become normative in our city will soon become normative elsewhere. The tsunami of cultural change hit our beach first, which puts us in a position to help others learn from our fruit and our failure. Maybe our little church plant was like Noah’s dove, sent to explore the landscape of a new world.” Thus he regards A Call to Resurgence as a kind of prophetic book through which he can lead the church in her response to these new realities.AN OVERVIEWLet me give a flying overview of the book to show how he builds his case and what he proposes as a solution. I will then share a few of my observations.In chapter two, titled “Standing Knockout: How We Got Our Bell Rung,” he provides a brief history of evangelicalism. He traces its decline to Christians happily existing by themselves in their own little enclaves without seriously engaging the world, without earnestly evangelizing, and with far too much bickering with other Christians. He looks at some of the cultural forces that have pummelled Christianity with a series of hits: New Paganism, homosexuality, pornography, intolerant tolerance, bad dads, and cheap Christians.Chapter three is titled “A New Reality: From Modernism to Everythingism to Tribalism.” With a nod to Seth Godin, he shows how tribalism is now more prominent than denominationalism and describes some of the common tribal commitments within Christianity. He highlights four questions and shows how Christian tribes may be distinguished by their answers to these questions.Are you Reformed or Arminian?Are you complementarian or egalitarian?Are you continuationist or cessationist?Are you missional or fundamental?He then builds profiles based on the possible answers. So, if you are Reformed, complementarian, cessationist and fundamentalist, “you probably like Together for the Gospel, the Gospel Coalition, Nine Marks, R.C. Sproul, reading books by dead guys, expository preachers who wear suits and have bad bands at their services, and wish this book had more footnotes and fewer jokes.” Driscoll himself is a tribal chief within the Reformed, complementarian, continuationist and missional tribe. “You probably have an occasional bad attitude, tattoo, impressive theological library and liquor cabinet, ESV Study Bible, entire collection of the latest indie rock, flannel shorts, and boots for no reason as you do zero logging.”While tribalism is an unfortunate reality to life in a sinful world, it also represents a great danger to the church because it tempts us to fight one another instead of fighting for gospel advance. For Christians to continue to make a mark in this world, we need to avoid the extremes of “theological hard conservatism (which fights for too much) and theological hard liberalism (which fights for too little).”Chapter 4 explores how tribes can hold to their convictions and still work together. He provides a picture based on geography.- Your local church is your home;- churches you partner with are your neighborhood;- the tribe you identify with most closely is your state;- the tribes most like yours are regions within a nation;- and “Bible-believing, Jesus-loving, sin-repenting, Kingdom-serving Christianity” is the nation.So for Driscoll, Mars Hill is his home; like-minded churches are his neighborhood; the distinctives of Reformed, complementarian, continuationist and missional form the borders of his state; his region is other evangelical churches that love Jesus, believe the Bible and are led by Bible preaching; and Protestant Christianity is his nation. He can and will work with anyone inside that nation, even when there is loving disagreement on issues like Arminianism, egalitarianism, cessationism, and/or fundamentalism.Of course for this to be effective, there needs to be agreement on the “national boundaries,” the doctrines that unite us by separating true believers and true churches from those that are fraudulent or outright heretical. Here Driscoll puts forth thirteen theses, each of which has to do with a specific doctrine.Chapter 5 is titled “The Holy Spirit: Empowering the Church For Mission.” Driscoll is convicted about maintaining the unity of the Spirit and believes that unity of the Spirit requires unity about the Spirit. He provides a brief theology of the Holy Spirit that is consistent with his continuationist convictions. He affirms the existence of the miraculous gifts and gives a fair bit of attention to speaking in tongues, acknowledging the validity of this gift, but saying he does not have it. The main focus of the chapter, though, is giving attention to the Spirit’s role in empowering evangelism and bringing about conversion. He says, “Any truly Spirit-empowered ministry is not marked primarily by private spiritual experience but rather by the public proclamation of the gospel that leads to the salvation of sinners.”Chapter 6 deals with “Repentance: A Biblical Response.” Here he revisits the cultural issues that have rung the church’s bell (see chapter two) and suggests how we can repent of these, not simply admitting our faults, but making real and lasting changes. In every case, Christians can go to the Bible and learn how we can stand out from the world around us.The seventh and final chapter, “Mission,” offers seven principles for resurgence. “As we seek to encourage the preaching of the gospel for, the planting of churches by, and the discipling of the Gentiles of our day, there are some missiological principles that have proved helpful in Seattle.” He warns that these are principles, not methods, and provides a stern warning against “methodolatry.” They are:1) Preach the Word. The primacy of preaching.2) Love the Church. The centrality of the local church and the special importance of cities.3) Contend and contextualize. Be willing to contextualize the Christian faith without tampering with it.4) Be attractional and missional. Every church needs to be cautiously attractional with a commitment to being missional.5) Receive, reject, redeem. Cultural engagement involves three options: receiving some, rejecting some, redeeming the rest.6) Consider the common good. Do good to the people around you and not only the Christians and not only to those who receive your acts of love with immediate joy.7) Evangelize through suffering. The cultural shift away from Christianity necessarily entails future suffering; be prepared to use such suffering as a platform to share the gospel.He closes the book with one more call to see before us an unprecedented opportunity for mission. “Christendom may have died, but in that death there is a real opportunity for a resurgence of biblically faithful, personally humble, evangelistically fruitful, missional Christianity.”OBSERVATIONSThere is much to agree with and to commend in A Call to Resurgence.I appreciate his desire to waken a slumbering church. We are, indeed, in a new age and Christianity’s influence has clearly waned. What we once took for granted, what we once assumed, we no longer can. Too many Christians have missed this great shift in society as they’ve remained safe inside their holy huddles. Driscoll’s desire to see the saved awakened so we can see the lost saved is commendable. I appreciate his clear and bold calls to action.I appreciate his emphasis on tribalism. While I hope we eventually come up with better terminology than “tribe,” I agree that denominations are fading in favor of less formal and more fluid relationships built on common commitments to secondary matters. I believe this tribalism is a product of this new, digital world. Whether it is a good or bad development will have to be a topic for another day.I appreciate his desire to promote gospel agreement and gospel advance between tribes. We are bound by Scripture and conscience to hold to our convictions, but we also need to understand that secondary convictions must never become primary. We are always fighting the tendency to flee into our safe little enclaves and to be defined more by what separates us than what unites us. There are ways in which we can and must cross boundaries in order to help one another as we carry out our God-given mission.These are just a handful of the many commendable qualities of A Call to Resurgence. I also have a few concerns, but will dwell on the two most prominent.I am concerned about his criteria. Driscoll calls for Christians to work together despite their tribal loyalties. Because there are tribes that are opposed to the gospel, we need to consider the ones we can work with and the ones we cannot. Here Driscoll provides seven black-and-white issues that must be in place for a tribe to be considered evangelical:- the Bible as God’s perfect and authoritative Word;- one God in three persons (Trinity);- human sinfulness by nature and by choice;- Jesus as fully God and fully man who lived without sin, died in our place for our sins, and rose from the dead;- salvation bestowed by the grace of God when a sinner turns from sin and trusts in Jesus alone through faith alone;- new birth through the Holy Spirit;- eternal heaven for believers and eternal hell for unbelievers.I believe these criteria are too broad. Sound theology demands nuance, and that nuance is missing in these broad descriptions. Defining Trinity as “one God in three persons” still permits error and outright heresy. It is noteworthy that Driscoll’s list of Christian tribal leaders includes Joel Osteen, Joyce Meyer, Paula White, Joseph Prince, and T.D. Jakes (whom he has met and commends as a humble, Christian leader). I am not familiar with all of these people, but am comfortable stating that at least Joel Osteen and T.D. Jakes are false teachers who teach blatant, damnable error. Yet they would also, I believe, affirm the criteria he sets. T.D. Jakes can adhere to the heresy of modalism and still affirm that he believes in one God in three persons.The criteria Driscoll uses to distinguish true from false Christians are simply insufficient. Either they need to be expanded, or we need an accompanying list of denials to go along with the affirmations. Any methodology that rates the difference between John MacArthur and Joel Osteen or R.C. Sproul and T.D. Jakes as a secondary issue between brothers is more than a little troublesome.I am concerned with too little emphasis on discernment. I am concerned that A Call to Resurgence quietly commends those who run quickly to the pursuit of unity and quietly condemns those who hold back in an attempt to exercise cautious discernment. I have often observed that we are prone to criticize those who are careful and cautious discerners far more than we criticize those who pursue a reckless unity. Unity is a glorious quality and one we need to pursue, but we must not do so at the expense of discernment. And maybe we saw a glimpse of this in Driscoll’s appearing at the Strange Fire conference—sponsored by John MacArthur and opposing charismatic theology—and passing out his own book there before commenting on social media that his books had been confiscated (something the evidence seemingly contradicts). His calls for maturity and unity appear to clash with his own actions.Holding these two concerns together, I genuinely appreciate Driscoll’s desire to have Christians work with others beyond their tribe, but I believe he errs too far in the other direction and neglects to call out some false teachers and neglects to give clear criteria that will allow us to do so. His desire for unity is commendable, but even while we reach across the aisle to some we will need to be willing to unflinchingly reject and condemn others. I can hardly overemphasize the danger that may come here. I believe wholly in the value and necessity of working across tribal lines, but we must never do this at the expense of the primary doctrinal issues of the Christian faith.CONCLUSIONA Call to Resurgence appears to find Mark Driscoll in a kind of transition. He has gained a lot of authority and notoriety in a relatively thin slice of the Christian world. It seems that he is now assuming leadership of a different kind, widening his scope to speak to all evangelicals. If they listen, they will hear much that is good and valuable and much that will spur them to greater action. Unfortunately, A Call to Resurgence could have been a much stronger book had Driscoll given more attention to careful discernment and the necessity of committing equally to truth and love.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S78RHLTGXQVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CH7IMYK#wasThisHelpful","R3S78RHLTGXQVZ","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jefferson Bethke is a YouTube sensation who exploded onto the scene in January 2012 when he released a spoken word poem titled “Why I Hate Religion, But Love Jesus.” Within three days it had been viewed 6 million times and as of today it has been viewed 25 million times. He went from unknown to celebrity in the blink of an eye. Now, nearly two years later, he has added “author” to his portfolio with Jesus > Religion: Why He Is So Much Better Than Trying Harder, Doing More, and Being Good Enough.Bethke’s concern, then and now, is with what passes for Christianity in so many Evangelical contexts. While he does not use the term, he describes what Christian Smith labeled moralistic therapeutic deism, and he holds up Jesus—the Jesus of the Bible, rather than the Jesus of our imaginations—as a far better alternative. “We’ve lost the real Jesus—or at least exchanged him for a newer, safer, sanitized, ineffectual one. We’ve created a Christian subculture that comes with its own set of customs, rules, rituals, paradigms, and products that are nowhere near the rugged, revolutionary faith of biblical Christianity. In our subculture Jesus would never have been crucified—he’s too nice.”Two years ago, a handful of notable Christians, Kevin DeYoung among them, expressed legitimate concerns with some of the content and the emphases of Bethke’s video, and it was an encouragement then to see Bethke respond with consideration and genuine humility. Since that time he has sharpened his ideas a fair bit. Yes, he still makes a forced contrast between Christianity and religion, as if the two are incompatible, but this time he carefully explains what he means. When he calls people away from religion, he calls them away from a system of thought or belief about “what one must do, or behave like, in order to gain right standing with God.” Where this kind of religion centers on our own attempts to prove our righteousness, Christianity centers on Jesus’ righteousness, offered to us. Where this kind of religion generates apathy, Bethke points to Jesus as a radical and a revolutionary whose message is scandalous and outrageous.All through the book, then, Bethke contrasts this counterfeit Christianity with the real deal. He calls his readers away from the trappings of gospel-free Christianity and shows them that what Jesus offers is so much greater. Where religion makes enemies, Jesus makes friends; where with religion there are good and bad people, with Jesus there are only bad people who need grace; where religion is the means to get things from God, if we seek Jesus, we get God himself; where with religion if you are suffering, God must be punishing you, the biblical truth is that God has already punished Jesus on your behalf, so suffering cannot be separated from God’s mercy. In every chapter he sets up a contrast between religion and true Christianity and answers it with Scripture. All throughout he relates his own story of growing up in that moralistic culture, of abandoning this kind of religion in order to walk away from the church, and of finally being saved by the grace of God.This is hardly the first book to contrast Christianity with religion, but of all the ones I have read, this is the first where the author understands and affirms the gospel of Jesus Christ’s substitutionary death and his atoning work. He offers many excellent insights into the joy and freedom of Christianity. He identifies sin as treason against God, he marvels at grace, he celebrates forgiveness, he anticipates future glory.By way of critique, I would point out that Jesus > Religion grows notably weaker in the last couple of chapters, leaving it to end with more of a pop than a bang. I am glad Bethke calls his readers to love the church just like Jesus loves the church, but the appeal and the examples are not as strong as they could be. The book culminates in an appeal to trust in Jesus that could also have been significantly stronger (though certainly it contains the gospel). The book’s final words are taken from The Message and its translation of Matthew 11:28-30; this serves Bethke’s purpose in the book far better than it accurately translates the words or the meaning of that passage.In his videos and in this book, Bethke is a popularizer of ideas. If you have read widely, you will quickly recognize the authors and pastors who have influenced him and whose ideas he is conveying. In this book, and in the other opportunities he has been given, he is choosing to popularize good ideas, and biblically-sound ones. And for this I am grateful. He is bringing these ideas to a very different demographic than most other writers. He is a leader within that restless YouTube generation, he has written a book for them, and I am convinced it will serve them well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F3G00FNCN7VT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C4ZCZFM#wasThisHelpful","R2F3G00FNCN7VT","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"you keep even half an eye on Christian publishing, then you know that gospel-centeredness is a major theme today, and especially so for publishers targeting their books at the New Calvinists. While this is undoubtedly a trend, and one that will at some point begin to slow, the point is clear: the gospel matters, and it matters to everything. There is no area of life outside the purview of the gospel. The gospel matters in the pulpit, in the home and in the family. The gospel matters at work as well.The Gospel at Work is a new book from Greg Gilbert and Sebastian Traeger and its big idea is this: You work for the king, and this changes everything. No matter what you do, your work has value because you are doing it for the Lord and who you work for is far more important than the details of what you do. This means that there is no such thing as a meaningless job and no such thing as a job that is insignificant.Much of the book is structured around two of the ways that we can allow our work to become sinful. Each represents an extreme. For some the temptation is idleness at work while for others the temptation is idolatry of work. Some hope to find their significance and worth in the work they do so that work becomes “the primary object of our passions, our energy, and our love. We end up worshiping our job.” But then others “can slip into being idle in our work. When we fail to see God’s purposes in our work, we don’t really care much about it. We fail to give any attention to it, or we despise it and generally neglect our responsibility to serve as if we are serving the Lord.” And, sadly, both of these extremes are celebrated in our culture.The challenge of The Gospel at Work is to avoid those extremes, and the way to do that is to work out the implications of the gospel in what you do.“ If you are a Christian, we want to challenge you to begin connecting the reality of what God has done for you in Christ to your job, thinking carefully about how this applies to and changes the way you think about your work.”Now some of the gospel-focused books I have read fall a little bit short in actually connecting the gospel to the subject at hand. Thankfully, that is not the case here. The gospel tells us that we have a new master, a new assignment, a new confidence, and new rewards and in all of those ways it counters the temptation to make too much, or too little, of work. Let me provide an extended quote which helps show how carefully these authors have thought this through:""Because of Jesus’ work on the cross on our behalf, because he lives and reigns right now, we have identity, belonging, love, acceptance, forgiveness, adoption, justification, and reward. It is all ours for all eternity. Because that’s true, we are gloriously freed from having to pursue those things (or, rather, cheap imitations of them) through our work. Do you see? We don’t need our work to provide an identity for us. We already have an identity in Christ. We don’t need it to give us a place to belong. We already have been adopted by God because of Jesus, and we belong to his redeemed family. We don’t need work to make us loved or liked or accepted, nor do we need it to prove to ourselves that we’re worthwhile. Why? Because all of that has already been secured for us by Jesus! So where does that leave our work? What role does that leave for it to play in our lives? Simple. It leaves our work liberated from the impossible demand to provide something for us that it was never meant to provide and from the excuse that it doesn’t matter, and we are set free to live lives of joyful, heartfelt service to our King!""As the authors progress through their subject, they provide a brief, but sound, theology of work, and then progress to practical matters: choosing a career; finding that difficult balance between work, family and church; handling difficult bosses and co-workers; being a Christian boss; and sharing the gospel at work. In every case they work outward from the gospel into practical counsel and guidance.Where the book impacted me deepest is in its discussion of success. The authors redefine success, drawing it away from money, power, influence, change, or a respectable standard of living. From a biblical perspective, success is far simpler: it is measured in faithfulness. We are not all equally talented and we do not have equal opportunities, so we need to be very, very careful not to measure ourselves against one another. That can be a fatal mistake. Instead, we are to measure success by faithfulness to God in the things he has called us to do. That was very freeing to me and very encouraging.The Gospel at Work is a powerful and helpful book exactly because the gospel really does matter at work, just as it matters at home and in the church and everywhere else. And since we all work somewhere, sometime, this is a book we would all do well to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNJVD1QGJS2V5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DL18FKM#wasThisHelpful","RNJVD1QGJS2V5","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don’t you just love a good bit of gossip? There is nothing quite like it, though perhaps a good comparison is to a juicy and succulent bit of food. The last mouthful of steak perhaps. You put it in your mouth. You let it sit there for a few moments. You celebrate the flavor. You savor it. You chew it slowly. You enjoy it to the very last chew. Then you swallow it and go your way, content and satisfied.Gossip is like that. Gossip is every bit as enjoyable, at least in the immediate. It is only later you find that gossip bites back in feelings hurt, relationships wrecked, churches undermined.Gossip has always been a problem (didn’t that serpent in the garden gossip about God?) so it is no surprise that the Bible has a lot to say about it. Solomon warned against it, James compared it to a raging forest fire, Paul admonished those who engage in it. Today we face all kinds of new ways to encounter and to spread gossip. Facebook, Twitter, blogs, and endless electronic media simply add to the many ways we can speak wisely or speak foolishly, the ways we can relate to others in love or in spite.Gossip is the subject of Matthew Mitchell’s new book Resisting Gossip. It is a subject that has been begging a book and Mitchell covers the subject well. He says, “This book is an attempt to arm followers of Christ with the biblical weapons we need to resist gossip in all its forms.” Yes, all its forms. Gossip is a wider and trickier problem than we may suspect as indicated by the definition he provides: “the sin of gossip is bearing bad news behind someone’s back out of a bad heart.” A bad heart takes bad news and spreads it behind another person’s back: it is a familiar story, isn’t it?The author goes about his task in a helpful way. After a chapter explaining why we are so drawn to gossip, he lays out five different types of gossip and gossip-er, each of which stems from a slightly different sinful heart desire. Over three chapters he offers Bible-based strategies for resisting gossip, overcoming the desire to gossip, and replacing it with something so much better. As the book works toward its conclusion, he offers help on how to respond when you have been the victim of gossip and how to respond when you have been the offender and have sinfully gossiped about someone else. An excellent appendix suggests ten ways pastors can cultivate gossip-resistance in the local church.Through it all he remains firmly grounded in Scripture and rigidly opposed to easy or moralistic or legalistic solutions. The fact is that gossip has no easy solution—it took the death and resurrection of Jesus to forgive it and it takes continually returning to the death and resurrection of Jesus to overcome it.I do not consider myself particularly prone to gossip. At least, I didn’t. But this book showed me that I may be more susceptible than I like to think. I tend to be comfortably legalistic by keeping my definitions so narrow that they exclude me. But by widening the definition of gossip—and doing so biblically, I believe—Mitchell showed me that I may be more of a gossip than I care to admit. And isn’t it interesting that I kept trying to rewrite that sentence to keep from labelling myself a gossip. I will own being drawn to it or prone to it, but I resist owning it.I enjoyed Resisting Gossip in the most lasting sense, because there were several areas in which it challenged and criticized me and then offered me hope. I was sorry to have to come face-to-face with my proneness to gossip, but in the end, grateful for the rebuke. “Faithful are the wounds of a friend…”","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34JUJQRRACVUA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EYFCDL6#wasThisHelpful","R34JUJQRRACVUA","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do not read a lot of fiction. It's not that I have anything against a good novel, but more that there is just so much I want to know and so many facts I want to learn, that time dedicated to story feels like it is taking me away from a more urgent pursuit. Or, to hear my wife tell it, I'm just a big snob. Regardless, all the experts say I need to read in a well-rounded way, so I do make way for at least the occasional novel.Speaking broadly, I see two different kinds of Christian novel. The first begins when an author has a great idea for a story, and, in a desire to make it ""Christian,"" adds Christian elements to it. In this way the story is primary and doctrine is secondary. The other kind of Christian novel begins when the author has doctrine he wants to teach, and he creates a story as a means of conveying it. Here the doctrine is primary and the story is secondary. In the hands of an especially skilled author, Marilynne Robinson for example, a story can do both of these with excellence.Trevin Wax has published several books in the past and has just made his first foray into fiction with Clear Winter Nights, a novel that falls into the second category: doctrine taught through narrative. The back cover says this: ""What happens when a young Christian dealing with disillusionment and doubt spends a weekend with an elderly, retired pastor? They talk. And no subject is off limits. Clear Winter Nights is a stirring story about faith, forgiveness, and the distinctiveness of Christianity. Through a powerful narrative and engaging dialogue, Trevin Wax shows the relevance of unchanging truth in an ever-changing world.""This is the story of Chris Walker, a young man entering into a dark night of the soul where he finds himself questioning the Christian faith he had once so joyfully professed. As he descends into doubt, he grows hard and skeptical and wanders from all he once held dear. Then he and his grandfather Gil are thrust together for a couple of days and he finds someone who will patiently listen and lovingly provide good answers. Chris' questions are the questions so many people are asking today, and Gil's responses are wise, winsome and biblical.Interestingly, the publisher classifies Clear Winter Nights as Christian living rather than fiction, which shows that this is essentially theology in story, doctrine wrapped in narrative. It succeeds well on both accounts.Wax is a good thinker and in writing this novel aptly plays both parts--the skeptic and the man of confident faith. He is able to take his readers into sound Christian doctrine but without depending upon answers that are just too neat and too easy. Readers will encounter the basics of Christian worldview and apologetics while learning how to defend Christianity against some contemporary charges. They will also come to understand some of the most important implications of Jesus' death and resurrection and learn what it means to rely on Jesus through all of life's peaks and valleys. Wax accomplishes this without being heavy-handed and without ever abandoning his story in order to hammer home a pet doctrine.Wax is also a skilled storyteller. While he writes compelling narrative, but I found him at his best when creating an atmosphere. He has a knack for simile and comparisons and other elements of writing that work together to create intriguing settings. He made me care about the characters, their stories, their beliefs, and their development. Though this is hardly a tale of intrigue or heart-pounding suspense, it contains a story compelling enough that it easily carries through 160 pages. I cared about the characters enough to be just a little bit sad to have to leave them when the story drew to a close.Theology in story is a genre that comes and goes in Christian writing and one that, in the past, has been used for good and for ill. I am grateful to see Wax both attempting it and succeeding well at it. Clear Winter Nights is a book, a story, that will encourage the Christian and provide answers to the skeptic. I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H9VBZ0UKHKWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C0AO1CQ#wasThisHelpful","R3H9VBZ0UKHKWD","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Busyness is a funny thing. We have a love/hate relationship with it, so that when we are not boasting in it we are apologizing for it, and when we are not overwhelmed by it we are wanting more of it. We hate what busyness does to us, how it keeps us from friends and families and how it skews our priorities. On the other hand, we love that it validates us, as if the fact that we are busy someone proves our significance.Kevin DeYoung's Crazy Busy: A (Mercifully) Short Book About A (Really) Big Problem attempts to diagnose our busyness and to help us find a better, more satisfying, and more sustainable way to get through life. He begins by warning of three serious dangers that busyness can cause: Busyness can ruin our joy, it can rob our hearts, and it can cover up the rot in our souls.The heart of the book is seven short chapters which offer seven diagnoses for our busyness. He shows how pride can make and keep us busy, and how pride can manifest itself in people-pleasing and in an inordinate desire for possessions. He suggests that many people do not properly order their priorities and, therefore, spend their lives busily doing things they should not be doing at all. He shows that many parents franticly run their children from one activity to the next, believing that unless they satisfy their children's every demand, they will lose them. He goes to Scripture to show the importance of both rest and rhythm, pointing out that we were created weak, we are meant to accept our weakness and, having done that, we are to make a priority of building times of rest into our lives.I especially appreciated the second-to-last chapter where DeYoung points out that life is not meant to be easy. We have many things to do and a limited amount of time to do it in. We are hampered by sin and the effects of sin on every side which means that for much of life, and perhaps even for most of life, we will be busier than we would like to be. It is one more reason to look forward to heaven. The more we expect or demand a life of ease here and now, the more difficult our busyness will become. Put simply, ""The reason we are busy is because we are supposed to be busy.""When the diagnosis is complete, just one chapter remains, and this is exactly where many readers will, I suspect, find themselves disappointed. When I speak to an author about a new book, I often like to ask him, ""Is this a book you've lived?"" In this case DeYoung gives his answer in the opening pages where he admits that he may be the best person to write the book, or the worst. ""Some books are written because the author knows something people need to know. Others because the other has seen something people should see. I'm writing this book to figure out things I don't know and to work on change I have not yet seen.""That theme of ""join me in the journey"" prevails and it ends up being both a strength and a weakness. As DeYoung looks at his own life, he does a good and helpful job of diagnosing the heart of busyness since he is living in the midst of it, just like you and me. He gives a clear call to see busyness as a choice, or an accumulation of choices, and to see it as a choice full of spiritual significance. In the final chapter he calls for Christians to maintain their relationship with Christ--to sit at Jesus' feet--primarily through times of personal devotion. He regards this as the one absolutely critical discipline in the midst of a busy life.And then the book ends. While Crazy Busy is very useful in diagnostics, it is very light in practical application, presumably because he himself has not yet lived out such applications enough to speak with authority. Now, I think there are times when it is good to allow the reader to make his own application; after all, many readers, myself among them, are prone to be lazy and want to skip all the heart work and get straight to the part that makes their lives easier. My fear here, though, is that it is usually the author (of all people!) who can say with authority, ""This theory leads to meaningful changes because I have seen this in my life and home."" In this case, DeYoung does not and cannot do that. We receive no assurance that all his research and writing has changed his own life. And if it hasn't helped the author, how can it help us? At the end, it seems he is just as busy as when he began, and this is rather a disheartening conclusion.Still, Crazy Busy is a good book for what it is. DeYoung is a talented writer and his books are always a joy to read. In this one he gives us words for what we already know--that we are busier than we ought to be and want to be. He gives us tools for diagnosing the specific heart issues that have led us here. And he gives us encouragement to begin to make the changes necessary to live a life focused on the highest and best priorities.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19QU02K0CTP9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D6IRTC0#wasThisHelpful","R19QU02K0CTP9M","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is going to be big, a near-lock for the bestseller lists. First Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard teamed up to write a book about Killing Lincoln and it sold more than a million copies. They followed it up with Killing Kennedy and it sold briskly as well. And now they turn their attention to their greatest subject: Jesus of Nazareth. Killing Jesus: A History is a short biography of Jesus, focusing on the events leading to his death.From the outset, the authors make it clear that though they are Roman Catholics, they are not writing a religious book. Rather, they are writing a historical account of a historical figure ""and are interested primarily in telling the truth about important people, not converting anyone to a spiritual cause."" They necessarily rely on the four gospels for their source material and often tell their story by directly quoting the Bible.They begin, though, by setting Jesus firmly in his historical context and skillfully telling about the rise and fall of Julius Caesar and the subsequent ascension of Caesar Augustus. They introduce a cast characters who each make an appearance in the pages of the Bible: King Herod who would hear of a potential challenger to his throne and order the slaughter of innocent children, Herod Antipas who would behead John the Baptist and later refuse to deal fairly with Jesus, and Pontius Pilate, who would cave to pressure and order the execution of an innocent man. Each of these men becomes a living and breathing character in the narrative.As the authors begin to tell about the life of Jesus, they follow the biblical accounts quite closely. They tell his life skillfully and with all the narrative tension and interest they used to tell their compelling accounts of Lincoln and Kennedy. The reader is left with no doubt that Jesus' whole life was leading to a cross and that Jesus knew he would end up there. The reader sees that the claims Jesus made about himself put him at odds with both the Jews and the Romans.As they approach Jesus' death, the authors slow the pace a little, showing the injustice of the trial, the torment of crucifixion, and the necessary conclusion that Jesus really and truly died.They take some license along the way, of course. The gospel writers were selective when they wrote about the life of Jesus and any author must at times fill in or at least imagine certain details. But even then, O'Reilly and Dugard have done their homework and refrain from taking large or irrational leaps from their source material. And because they tell the account using the Bible as their source, they are able to tell the story as if it is true and as if they believe it. They do not say, ""he supposedly did this"" or is ""reputed to have done this."" They simply tell it as the Bible tells it.As a historical account of the life of Jesus, the story, though selective, is well told, well written, and very, very interesting. This is especially true when it comes to the historical and cultural contexts, details the biblical writers were able to assume and, therefore, not describe in great detail. I am no expert on this period of history, but spotted no major missteps and felt the authors were attempting to do justice to the historical facts the Bible presents. Their list of secondary sources is quite strong, leaning more toward conservative than liberal authors.However, Jesus' life is not mere history. Yes, he was a real man who lived a real life and died a real death, but that is not all he was and all he did. He also claimed to be God's Son and his followers claimed that in his life and death he had done something unique and, literally, world-changing. The same Bible that describes Jesus' life, also interprets and explains it. And this is the story the authors do not tell.Any author who writes a narrative account of Jesus' life will find it difficult to do justice to both his humanity and his divinity (and we saw, for example, in Anne Rice's series on Jesus). These authors err far to the side of his humanity. It becomes quickly apparent they will not focus on Jesus' miracles. While they mention a few of the wonders he performed, and especially the ones involving healings, they do not commit all the way and tend to present these as events Jesus' followers believed had happened as much as events that had actually taken place.The authors primarily portray Jesus as a rebel against Rome who threatened to destabilize the region and who, therefore, suffered the inevitable wrath of the empire. They show that through his life Jesus believed he was the Son of God and even suggest this must mean he was either a liar, a lunatic, or that he really was who he said he was. As the book comes to a close they state that Jesus' followers soon claimed he had been raised from the dead and that his followers believed this to such an extent that they willingly gave up their own lives to his cause.But O'Reilly and Dugard do not ever explain what happened there at the cross between Jesus and God the Father. Of all Jesus said on the cross, each word laden with meaning and significance, they mention only two. They do not explain the cross as substitution, where Jesus went to the cross in place of people he loved; they do not explain the cross as justice, where Jesus was punished as a law-breaker; they do not explain the cross as propitiation, where Jesus faced and emptied the Father's wrath against sin; they do not explain the cross as redemption, where we now need only put our faith in Jesus in order to receive all the benefits of what he accomplished.Killing Jesus is not a bad book as much as it is an incomplete book. As history it is compelling, but of all historical events, none has greater spiritual significance than the life and death of Jesus Christ. And this is the story they miss.A brief aside before I wrap up: If you have read Killing Kennedy you may remember that the authors seem have a strange obsession with kinky sexuality. Both Kennedy and the Roman rulers give them a lot to work with in that regard, and in this account they are sure to point to the ugly sexual deviancies that marked the Roman rulers of that day. While they do not go into lurid detail and do not mean to excite lust, neither do they exercise a lot of discretion, making this a book you would probably not want to hand to a child.As O'Reilly and Dugard begin this book they claim the story of Jesus' life and death ""has never fully been told. Until now."" That's very dramatic but also ridiculous. This story has been told repeatedly over the past two millennia and it will be told again and again in the millennia to come. Killing Jesus is another account that will be here for a while and then disappear and be forgotten. In the meantime, it will take Jesus out of the realm of fantasy and place him squarely in history, but even as it does that, it will neglect to tell why his life, his crucifixion, his resurrection are of eternal significance, a matter of his life and death and our own.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R342HQZOTOGJKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BIOG1ZU#wasThisHelpful","R342HQZOTOGJKZ","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit it: I sometimes grow weary of hearing about all the challenges faced by pastors and pastors' wives and pastors' kids. Is a pastor's vocation really so different from any other? Can it really be such a challenge to the rest of his family? Could it be that pastors are just a little too sensitive about the whole thing?I haven't been a pastor long enough to speak with a whole lot of authority. But a few years into this life, I can at least vouch that a pastor's family does face a number of unique challenges, challenges that are different from those faced by a small business owner or salaried employee. (I have been both.) Pastoral ministry is a difficult calling not just for a man, but for his whole family.Brian Croft has a burden for practical matters of pastoral ministry and writes often at practicalshepherding.com. He has teamed up with his wife to Cara to write The Pastor's Family. This is a book that calls a pastor to the task of shepherding his family through the challenges of pastoral ministry.It took only a few pages for the book to help me grasp something that should be obvious but that had largely escaped me until now. Much of what makes a pastor's challenge unique as he shepherds his family does not come from the church but from his own heart. In the chapter titled simply ""The Problem,"" Croft shows that pastors face internal demands of approval, appearance, success, and much besides. These are expectations the pastor places upon himself and they can soon come to control him and to dominate his decision-making. The demands soon become idols, things that hold out the promise of satisfaction and significance. Soon a man will sacrifice his family and neglect their care in order to pursue satisfaction. ""The problem rests not in the demands and pressures we face but in how we create idols out of those demands, idols that lead us to neglect our family and dishonor God.""The solution is to better understand, appreciate and apply the good news of what Christ has accomplished, and to understand that our significance is found in him. ""Struggling pastors need to rely on two facets of the biblical gospel is they hope to experience its power: they need to own their sin, acknowledging their neglect and failure, and they need to rely on the grace Christ offers, trusting in the gifts and promises of God rather than in their own efforts to secure what they want and need.""With the foundation laid, the Crofts go on to write several chapters about the pastor's wife and the pastor's family. In most cases Brian writes the chapter with Cara adding comments here and there; in two cases, though, Cara leads the way and leaves Brian to add his comments. It is quite an effective format that accomplishes two things: it adds a woman's perspective and wisdom and it also makes the book more applicable to a pastor's wife. The Crofts strike a good balance between the descriptive and the prescriptive, between what the Bible commands and wise applications of that truth. They open up their church, their home and their family just enough to give us a glimpse of principles in action.There are a few parts of the book that were especially helpful to me: the section on serving, encouraging and discipling your wife; the section on praying with and for your wife; the practical instructions for individually discipling your children; and the two chapters written by Cara, since they helped me better understand the challenges my wife does face or may soon face.All throughout the history of the church there have been pastors--and you may well know some of them--who have sacrificed their families on the altar of ministry. Too many neglected wives and forsaken children can testify to men who time and time again chose ministry in place of family. Every pastor can testify to the power of this temptation, which is exactly why there is such an urgent need for The Pastor's Family. This book challenges pastors to care first and best for their wives and children and it carefully draws upon biblical wisdom to allow them to do that very thing. It is a book I intend to read with Aileen and one I heartily recommend to every pastor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7G750LH0H8FI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310495091#wasThisHelpful","R7G750LH0H8FI","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So what do you do, as a book reviewer, when a good friend writes a book? What would you do if a good friend wrote a not-so-good book? I think about these things sometimes. Thankfully it is not a concern with my friend David Murray and his new book Jesus On Every Page. This is a good book. An excellent book, even.I have a soft spot for books that present subjects that are generally reserved for the halls of academia in a way that is accessible to a general audience. Jesus On Every Page is just such a book. It is ""an accessible guide to the increasingly subject of Jesus in the Old Testament. Although much has been written to help pastors with preaching Jesus from the Old Testament, there is little that provides sound principles and practical help for the average Christian who wants to explore this important way of knowing Jesus through His Word.""This is a book that shows how and where Jesus is present in the Old Testament and a book that equips us all to find him and worship him there. David focuses less on the stories and more on the Story; less on the heroes and more on the Hero. Not only does this book assure us that Jesus is in the Old Testament and is, in fact, the hero of the Old Testament, it also provides a whole series of methods of discovering and, even better, knowing Jesus in the pages of the Old Testament scriptures.One of the book's unique strengths is that it is told biographically. David introduces the subject by tracing his own journey of discovery, as he walked his own road to Emmasus, and not as one who learned it all in a seminary classroom many decades ago. This takes it far out of dry academia and breathes so much life into it.He focuses on ten ways we can find Jesus in the Old Testament Scriptures and along the way manages to alliterate all ten of the chapter titles:Christ's PlanetChrist's PeopleChrist's PresenceChrist's PreceptsChrist's PastChrist's ProphetsChrist's PicturesChrist's PromisesChrist's ProverbsChrist's Poets(I have always considered Steve Lawson the master of alliteration, but David may be rivaling him in that department. I wonder if we could get David and Steve together, give them some topics, and watch them have an alliteration battle!)Jesus On Every Page is a book for all of us, an entry-level guide to the presence of Jesus in the Old Testament scriptures. It's a book you should consider reading. Parents will benefit as they grow in their ability to read those Old Testament passages--especially those tricky Old Testament passages--and find Christ there for the benefit of their children. Though it is not written specifically for pastors, they, too, will benefit from reading it as they grow in their ability to find and worship Jesus Christ in the Old Testament.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12OCHDII13GJ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400205344#wasThisHelpful","R12OCHDII13GJ2","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Catechism. Even worse, catechesis. These were words that once struck fear into my heart, or if not fear, dread at least. Whatever the emotion, I have had an uneven history with catechisms. I was catechized as a child and as a teen. This involved memorizing questions and answers from the Heidelberg Catechism, then standing before a minister and a class of fellow students to recite what I had learned. ""What is your only comfort in life and death?"" he would ask. And I would recite, ""That I am not my own, but belong in body and soul, both in life and death, to my faithful Savior, Jesus Christ...""It is only in adult life that I came to appreciate those Tuesday evenings at the church and those Tuesday afternoons on the school bus, trying desperately to cram those answers into my brain. And it is only more recently still that I came to understand that catechesis is not so much about memorization and rote recital as it is about systematic instruction. Catechizing a child does not demand memorization and recitation, though these may be helpful, but it does demand systematic instruction. The Heidelberg Catechism is not a book to be memorized as much as it is a well-rounded and systematic exposition of the Christian life that is meant to be understood so it may in turn be applied. I am convinced that somewhere, somehow, those classes from long ago are somehow manifesting themselves in my life today.Catechizing has fallen out of favor in most Christian traditions and we are undoubtedly the worse for it. Just a few years ago J.I. Packer offered this perspective, this challenge: ""Where wise catechesis has flourished, the church has flourished. Where it has been neglected, the church has floundered.""Grounded in the Faith is a new tool for catechesis, that is, for laying a consistent, systematic groundwork for the Christian life. Kenneth Erisman, its author, writes, ""The aim of this book is to see the church flourish for the glory of God. We are convinced that by designing this guide to be user-friendly but at the same time keeping Reformation depth, followers of Christ will have a transferable tool to become grounded in the faith.""Indeed, they will. In three levels (sections) and twenty-four chapters, Erisman advances from the elementary doctrines of the Christian faith (justification, sanctification, overcoming sin and temptation, and the importance of Scripture) to level two (the inspiration of Scripture, prayer, guidance and the will of God, and the Trinity) and finally to level three (the humanity and divinity of Jesus Christ, perseverance and assurance, the attributes of God and the mystery of God's sovereignty).Each chapter follows a consistent format of listen (read a short lesson), absorb (pause and think) and interact (answer questions of comprehension and application). Every chapter concludes with a section geared toward cultivating spiritual habits such as Scripture reading, praying and memorizing Scripture. It is all packaged in an attractive and contemporary paperback workbook format.But I know you have a greater concern than the format and layout. You want to know about the teaching. The author gave a hint earlier when he wrote of ""Reformation depth."" Erisman sticks very closely to the doctrine of the Reformation. You can get a good sense of where he goes from the list of sources cited and the list of endorsers. For example, in his discussion of the Trinity he relies primarily on James White with several hat tips to Wayne Grudem, while in two chapters on the sovereignty of God, he cites John Piper, Louis Berkhof, and John Flavel while tracking very closely with R.C. Sproul. Meanwhile, the book carries endorsements from Jerry Bridges (who calls it ""an outstanding tool"" for discipleship), Bruce Waltke, Sam Storms and Joni Eareckson Tada.Grounded in the Faith is a book you will find useful for one-on-one or group discipleship or, dare I say it, catechesis. It is a book parents may want to use with their children. It is a book for mature believers to go through with and beside new Christians. It is one for pastors to stock up on. It is, as Sam Storm says, ""discipleship as it was meant to be: God-centered, Christ-exalting, and solidly grounded in the authority of Holy Scripture."" I am excited about it and give it my highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G6GWIV2PBKIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801015138#wasThisHelpful","R1G6GWIV2PBKIV","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unless you have been deliberately avoiding any discussion of contemporary issues, you must know that pornography is one of the major challenges to the church today. Carl Trueman is not exaggerating when he says ""Internet pornography is probably the number one pastoral problem in the world today"" and when he speculates that it is set to become an even greater concern in the days to come. Perhaps you, like me, are growing a little weary of hearing about it and reading about it. Yet as long as Christians continue to succumb to pornography, as long as it remains so great a concern, we need to keep up our efforts to address it and to lead people out of its captivity. We simply cannot allow ourselves to grow lazy or complacent.A new weapon in our arsenal, and perhaps the strongest one yet, is Finally Free: Fighting for Purity with the Power of Grace by Heath Lambert. Lambert is Assistant Professor of Biblical Counseling at Boyce College. He also regularly teaches at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and serves as the Pastor of Biblical Living at Crossing Church in Louisville, Kentucky. In each of those positions he has had opportunity to see this monster close-up and to lead hundreds of people through and past their commitment or addiction to pornography.This is a book that approaches an ugly topic with dignity. Lambert does not crack dirty jokes or tiptoe to the edge of good taste and salacious detail. It is not really a book about pornography at all. Rather, its emphasis is ""the amazing power of Jesus Christ to free you from pornography."" In the early pages Lambert explains his purpose and offers encouragement: ""In this book, I want to share with you the amazing depth and effect of Christ's power to eradicate pornography from your life. Whether you struggle with pornography yourself or are trying to help someone who struggles, I have good news for you: no matter how intense or long-standing the struggle, it is the work of Jesus Christ to set people free from such sin.""He offers hope through eight clear strategies meant to ""help you work out your salvation and experience freedom from your desire for pornography."" At the heart of each of the strategies is grace--God's grace available to us through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.It is possible to be free from pornography. Because of his grace, God sent his Son to pay the just penalty for the sins we all commit. When you believe in God's grace toward you, you get God's righteousness. You can be forgiven and free when you trust in Christ and what he has done for you, no matter how many times you have looked at pornography and how hopeless the struggle can feel. When this seems like it isn't true, it's because you are thinking more about yourself and your porn than you are about Jesus and his grace. You can be free, but freedom requires grace.The eight strategies are: Using sorrow, using accountability, using radical measures, using confession, using your spouse or your singleness, using humility, using gratitude, and using a dynamic relationship with Jesus. Each of these is a key component to battling this sin and putting it to death. If there is any one of those strategies I want to draw your attention to, it is the use of radical measures. One great hole in many people's pursuit of holiness is the radical measures of getting rid of their computers or cell phones, of radically changing their routines in order to avoid the temptations that lead them to sin. I have often challenged men in this way and found myself cheering as Lambert did the same. Wasn't it Jesus who said, ""If your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire.""? Lambert says, ""In our high-tech age we often consider it impossible to exist without our computers, tablet devices, smartphones, or TVs. The honest truth is that you don't need any electronic device, but you do need to be holy. The inconvenience will be worth the gain in holiness.""Having read many books on this topic, I quickly identified three unique and noteworthy strengths in Finally Free. The first is its commitment to the gospel of grace. Lambert avoids using ""gospel"" or ""grace"" like buzzwords that have no real meaning. He speaks of grace as a power that we can discover, that we can use, that is available to us as we fight against sin. The second is the books sheer practicality. No other book I have read so helpfully lays out strategies--strategies you can actually do and that will actually work--in the fight against porn. The third is its encouraging tone. He encourages by focusing on Christ's power over sin and he encourages by his authority on the subject, earned in those thousands and thousands of counselling sessions.There is no porn user so enslaved that Jesus cannot set him or her free. There is no struggle for purity so intense that Jesus' grace cannot win the battle. There is no consequence so steep that Jesus' power cannot carry you through. Jesus' grace to change you is stronger than pornography's power to destroy you. Jesus' grace is stronger than your own desires to watch sex. While there is no hope for you in looking at pornography, there is all the hope in the universe when you look to God and his grace.Finally Free opens with a foreword from Josh Harris who, like me, has also written a book on sexual purity. I join him in commending this book. Porn is so significant a concern today that if you are not struggling with it yourself, you must know someone who is. In either case, this book will equip you for the fight.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHAH588BPAOQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310499232#wasThisHelpful","RHAH588BPAOQG","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pressure can be an amazingly destructive force. When pressure builds up inside the earth's crust, it can result in a devastating earthquake. But pressure can also be beneficial. We would not have running water with it; neither would be able to enjoy the beauty of diamonds. Pressure, with its possibilities of benefit or destruction, is the metaphor at the heart of a new book by J.D. Payne.Pressure Points lays out twelve of the global issues shaping the face of the church today, which is to say, twelve of the global issues that already are, and will continue to, impact the advancement of the gospel in the twenty-first century. Christians do not get to choose the issues that we must respond to or adapt to; however, we are able to choose how we will respond to them. Each of these issues represents a pressure point and with each point comes the possibility of success or failure, of responding well or responding poorly. Payne says, ""While the church does not have control over the macro-level contextual issues of each generation, her response to them is a matter of kingdom stewardship.""While we have seen many books like this in the past--books that describe contemporary challenges to Christianity's advance--Pressure Points stands out in its positive tone. This is not a lament for what was or what should be. It is not a complaint about current realities. It is simply a realistic assessment of ways the world is changing and the new realities it presents. Payne believes the church's best days are ahead and that each of these pressure points represents a great opportunity for the gospel.Here are a few of the issues he identifies:unreached people groupsthe West as a mission fieldpluralismglobalizationinternational migrationoral learnerspornification of societiesIn each case he describes the issue, explains how it challenges the church, and offers a few thoughts on how the church can face the issue well. While none of the issues will have equal urgency in every place and every context, at least a few of them will apply to your church and to mine. Here in Toronto we see massive international migration, we see the effects of globalization, we see the importance of cities, and we cannot deny the impact of the pornification of society.If there are weaknesses in the book, they may be related to the cursory examination of each of the issues. Because this is meant to be only a short book, Payne can not go into great detail on any single issue, though each could easily merit a book of its own. Also, he at times seems to blur ""professed Christians,"" of which there may be 2 billion on earth, with true disciples of Christ of which there are obviously far, far fewer. One of the greatest and most difficult mission fields of all is those who profess Christ and yet are committed to a false and unsaving gospel.I found this a helpful examination of current issues and an encouraging look at the issues that will either help or hinder gospel advance in the years to come.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGKNNM5BJ7LAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1418550744#wasThisHelpful","RGKNNM5BJ7LAZ","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It does us good to read missionary biographies. This is especially true when those missionaries served during the great age of missions in the 1700's and 1800's. This was a period when missionaries traveled overseas into uncharted and unfamiliar lands. As they left familiar shores they knew they might never return to their homelands, that they would inevitably suffer in terrible ways, that they would very likely give up their lives in service to the Lord. And still they went.Adoniram Judson is the subject of an excellent new biography from Vance Christie, who has previously written works on Hudson Taylor, David Brainerd, and John and Betty Stam. Judson was the very first foreign missionary commissioned in the United States; he proved to be one of the greatest. In 1812 he set sail from America and arrived the next year in Burma (modern day Myanmar). He would serve in Burma for almost four decades and in all that time return to America only once and only briefly.His great passions were to preach the gospel and to provide a Bible in the language of the Burmese people. Though it would take him six years to see his first convert, by the time he died there were thousands professing Christ. It would take him many more years to produce a full translation of the Bible, but today that Bible is still in use and still a pillar within the Burmese Baptist churches. He would write tracts that were produced in the millions, Burmese dictionaries and grammars that continue to influence the language today. He would shape missions all throughout the world and inspire thousands of others to dedicate their lives to missionary work.Judson suffered immensely through it all, and at times his biography is almost too painful to read.He was married three times, seeing two of his wives succumb to illness on the mission field. His grief was at times nearly overwhelming. His third wife's health was so shattered that she only barely outlived her husband, dying in great pain at only thirty-six years of age. His three marriages produced many children, at least six of whom died in infancy to the great sorrow of their parents. During a war between England and Burma he was imprisoned for 17 months and for much of this time he was kept in deplorable conditions, suffering all manner of brutality. Judson suffered intense pain in his final days, exclaiming ""How few there are who die so hard."" And in the end his body not given a proper burial, but thrown overboard in the middle of the ocean without as much as a funeral service or a prayer. His life was marked by some highs, but also many great lows. He suffered greatly for the Lord and was willing to count it joy.Let me offer a few reasons you ought to consider reading about Judson's life.Read it to see the high cost some have had to pay--and have been willing to pay--in order to advance the gospel. It is not that you and I do not make sacrifices in order to serve the Lord; but so much of what we consider hardships pale in comparison to what Judson had to offer before the Lord. And though he did not always live with full joy, he continued to serve and to trust in God. We gain important perspective on our lives by reading what he had to endure in his.Read it to see the power and centrality of the Bible in mission. Judson was driven to produce a Bible in the Burmese language knowing that access to the Scriptures was necessary in order to bring spiritual life to these people he loved. When that Bible was translated and printed it began to do its work. It does us good to see the power of the Bible!Read it to see how bad theology can creep in and derail even a great man for a time. In the midst of some of his darkest grief Judson began to read from the Roman Catholic mystics and for a time this poor theology badly hindered his ministry so that he retreated from people and stopped his Bible translation work. The Lord had to revive and reform him in order to call him back to mission.Read it to see the value of being devoted for life. This was Judson's motto: Devoted for Life. He wanted all missionaries to commit not to a year in the field, not to ten years, but all of life. He modeled this well, essentially becoming Burmese in order to reach Burma. The success of his ministry is directly related to his lifelong dedication to it.Read it to grapple with the tension between ministry and family. At that time men held mission higher than marriage and family; Judson was unwilling to leave the mission field and this cost his life, the lives of his children, the lives of his wives. That was considered the price missionaries had to pay. While he genuinely loved his wives and children, he battled to rightly prioritize them. His lifelong devotion to mission seemed at times to do battle with his devotion to family.And there are many more reasons besides.Adoniram Judson remains a fascinating individual and a missionary we do well to remember. There is a great deal we can learn from his life and ministry. Vance Christie is an excellent biographer who brings his subject to life in the pages of this book. I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY54UQ0R23B4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781911479#wasThisHelpful","RY54UQ0R23B4V","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Family worship. For some it evokes a sense of dread, memories of long, boring, tiring times sitting around a table while listening to dad drone on and on. For some it evokes a sense of guilt, false starts and failures and giving up. For a few it evokes joy, sweet times of family fellowship and memories of seeking the Lord together.Almost every book begins by describing a problem and then goes on to propose a solution. This is, after all, one very good reason to read: to find solutions to our problems. My books are no exception; I have addressed the problems of the neglect of spiritual discernment, addiction to pornography, and thoughtless dedication to digital technologies. In the opening pages of A Neglected Grace: Family Worship in the Christian Home, Jason Helopoulos says he must address the problem of family worship because it has very nearly disappeared. ""If it were an animal, it would be on the endangered species list. We have not only stopped doing it, but we have stopped talking about it.""That may be true in some contexts, but it does not describe my experience. I grew up in a home in which we read the Bible, discussed the Bible and prayed together. We tried to do it every night around the dinner table, though like most families we succeeded at times and failed at others. Meanwhile, almost every other Christian family I knew was likewise engaging in family worship, each in their own way. Though it took some time, my wife and I, after we were married, picked up and carried on the tradition. Today we see families in our church doing the same.Yet I was still eager to read this book. Why? Because family worship is like prayer and evangelism and so much else in the Christian life in that it has a way of exposing and highlighting inadequacy. I know of few families who would say they have consistently excelled in this area. I know of far more who have tried and failed, who have tried again and failed again, or who have tried and kept on, but without that sense that they are succeeding. My experience encompasses all of that.It is helpful to know that Helopoulos has the same story. ""I am not an expert on family worship. My wife and kids can testify to that. My family and I continue to learn how to do family worship better, more faithfully, more consistently, and with more joy."" He writes as a fellow traveler on this journey, not as someone who has figured it all out and who has reached the destination.Helopolous spends a few chapters explaining the importance of family worship and placing it within that triad of worship that extends from private worship to family worship to corporate worship. He shows that, though there is no direct biblical command saying ""Thou must engage in family worship,"" such worship is modeled in Scripture and is a crucial part of every parents' calling to raise their children in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. Beyond the biblical reasons he also provides a host of practical reasons, supplemental benefits that may be ours if we take advantage of this joyful responsibility.Having built his case, he gets practical. The essence of family worship is reading Scripture and praying together, but these may be augmented by many other practices including singing, Scripture memorization, the use of creeds and catechisms, and so much else. There is freedom here for each family to make their own way and to do what best suits their situation.Helopoulos is careful to show that family worship must not be seen as a burden but as a delight, as something we do because we have received God's grace rather than something we do to earn his favor. ""Family worship is not something we have to do. Our right standing before God is not impacted by whether we lead our families in worship or not. Christ has already accomplished all for our salvation. Rather, family worship, like other spiritual disciplines, becomes something we want to do.""A chapter titled ""Helps for the Journey"" provides tips and pointers about the particulars--when, where, how long, and so on--while another chapter, ""But, What If..."", addresses areas of struggles or difficult scenarios such as single-parent families, families where only one spouse is a Christian, or families who are new to the faith and lack deep biblical knowledge.A Neglected Grace strikes just the right balance between theory and practice. It is authoritative without being over-bearing, and it models humility, coaching the reader, yet without demanding a particular method. Whether the idea of family worship is new to you, whether it's familiar but neglected, or whether you have been doing it for years, this is a book you will enjoy and one that with benefit both you and your family.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CEDFA10WXGML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781912033#wasThisHelpful","R1CEDFA10WXGML","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is becoming increasingly clear that homosexuality will be a defining issue for the twenty-first century church, at least here in North America. It seems inevitable that same-sex marriage will soon be legalized across America; it has been the law in Canada for several years now. Meanwhile the acceptance and celebration of homosexuality is becoming a cultural shibboleth, a means of determining who has a voice worth hearing and who does not.In the middle of all this is the Christian church which, since time immemorial, has held that the Bible forbids homosexuality. Is it time, as so many insist, for Christians to take a second look at the Bible, to get with the times, and to embrace homosexuality as a valid lifestyle, a valid expression of love and sexuality?Many Christians feel threatened, like their backs are against the wall, and that this issue represents a major threat to their faith. But is it possible that Christians have been thinking about the issue all wrong? In his new book Love Into Light, Peter Hubbard asks, ""What if homosexuality is not a threat but an opportunity? Could God use one of the most controversial moral issues in our nation to awaken His church rather than damage it?"" Is it possible that if we continue on our current trajectory, the church will soon be defined by what we are against, whom we oppose, and all the while the gospel will be lost in the fray?Hubbard writes as a pastor, as a counselor and as a man deeply marked by the gospel of divine grace extended toward human sin. He insists that the gospel makes all the difference, for before the cross we are all the same, we are all sinners, we are all in desperate need of grace. He says, ""We need Spirit-empowered love to move toward those struggling with [same sex attraction] without despising or excusing their sin, because their sin is our sin--our hearts are no different! ... My sin always seems reasonable to me, and your sin inexcusable. Left to myself, I can find a way to justify anything I really want, and the choices I make can hurt the people I most love.""The gospel makes all the difference and the gospel is exactly what Fred Phelps and so many others have thrown away in their misguided, hate-filled attempts to address homosexuality. ""If our attitude toward a gay or lesbian person is disgust, we have forgotten the gospel. We need to remember the goodness and lovingkindness that God poured out on us. God should have looked at us and been disgusted. Instead, without condoning our sin, He loved us and saved us. And I want everyone to know that kind of love!""""The gospel penetrates to the root of the heterosexual and homosexual dilemma: Who am I? Whose am I?"" It assures us that we are all sinners who are utterly and wholly dependent upon God's grace if we are to be saved from the eternal consequences of our rebellion. Rather than focusing so much attention on a particular category of sin, we ought to concentrate on the joy of being undeserving, forgiven sinners, for ""a church characterized by a small experience of forgiveness will be characterized by a small expression of love.""The book has several notable strengths that make it a valuable and important contribution to this discussion. One strength is in Hubbard's approach to homosexuality through a biblical lens. He attempts to diagnosis it accurately using biblical categories and as he does so, he helps show what it is and, perhaps especially helpfully, shows what it is not. He eschews easy labels and easy solutions. Another strength is Hubbard's pastoral tone and his love for the people he writes for and writes to. It is always clear when a writer knows and loves people who find themselves struggling with same sex attraction and people who are unapologetically homosexual; it is equally clear when a person is writing about a caricature, about people has never met and never loved. A third strength is that the book is anchored in the gospel; from beginning to end, the gospel pervades it all.Love Into Light is a powerful, biblical, compassionate look at a moral issue that represents a great opportunity for the church. This is a book that will benefit anyone who chooses to read it. It is one leaders would do well to read; it is one pastors will want to read, especially if they are counseling someone who is struggling in this area, searching for identity, wondering what the Bible says. It will shape the Christian's thinking, it will apply the gospel, it will be a blessing. It is kind, it is biblical, it is pastoral, and it receives my highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LC2WD4UIKD4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620202220#wasThisHelpful","R1LC2WD4UIKD4O","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last weekend I made the rookie mistake of leaving my book at the office. Rather than blow time on a one-hour round-trip to fetch it, I decided instead to search for something new. Something different. Something interesting. Preferably, something moving. I spent a full hour browsing Amazon without success and then began to scour the sites of the various Christian publishers. It was at Zondervan's site that I spotted something hopeful--A Dream So Big: Our Unlikely Journey to End the Tears of Hunger by Steve Peifer. Two minutes and eight dollars and eight-nine cents later, it was on my Kindle. It was just the right book.A Dream So Big tells the story of Steve and Nancy Peifer. In the late 90's, right at the peak of the dot com boom, Steve was a corporate manager for a major software and consulting company; he was making a good living and enjoying life in America. He and his wife had two boys and all the comforts they could want. In 1997 the Peifers found, to their surprise, that they were expecting their third child. However, doctors soon brought them the heart-breaking news that their child had a chromosomal abnormality that would be ""incompatible with life."" Against the counsel of physicians, they chose to carry their son to term and spent eight blessed days with him before he died.The grief over the loss of their son made them re-examine their lives and priorities. Nancy had always dreamed of being involved in foreign missions and Steve decided the time was right to grant his wife her dream. They learned of an opportunity in Kenya at the Rift Valley Academy, a boarding school for the children of missionaries. They raised funds, packed their bags, and headed overseas as unlikely missionaries.By the time the book comes to a close, Steve is on a stage with Tyra Banks, receiving a humanitarian award from CNN for the work he has done in Kenya. While serving the students of the Academy he had also begun a program that would grow to feed 20,000 children every day; he also founded computer centers in schools, offering the children a key component of a modern education that would otherwise be denied them. The book describes this remarkable journey and the transformation of a man who left behind the American dream to pursue a much bigger, much better, much more satisfying dream.The book has much to commend it. Peifer perfectly combines pathos and humor, moving seamlessly between laughter and tears. He is able to poke fun at what is ridiculous while drawing attention to what is moving. This quote highlights his self-effacing humor:""The clip ended, the lights came back up, and it was suddenly time for me to just roll with it yet again. Because who better to present an award to a fifty-two-year-old missionary working with poor, hungry children in Kenya than a Sports Illustrated swimsuit model? In another day in some alternative universe, it might have made perfect sense. But in the here and now of New York City in front of a worldwide television audience, it was time for me to focus as Tyra Banks walked to the podium to announce, ""It is my honor to present the CNN Hero for Championing Children, Steve Peifer.""And then he stepped on her dress.The book also has important spiritual insights. Here is one that will no doubt resonate particularly with those who serve in foreign lands where getting things done nearly always depends upon theft and bribery: ""In the end, the banality of evil is what exhausts you. You can battle against an evil terrorist; how do you fight an underpaid clerk following stupid orders?"" While we often focus on the evils of the world's great leaders, evil's grasp extends all the way to the lowest and most poorly-paid bureaucrat.Peifer also shows that normal people, otherwise unremarkable people, can pursue a dream and make a difference. He is a very normal man with a very normal family who has touched the lives of tens of thousands of people, and all for the glory of God.A Dream So Big is not a theology of missions or a deep, doctrinal examination of the need the methods of mission. Neither is it meant to be. Instead, it's a ground-level look at one family's work in a needy place. It is real and honest: ""As a missionary, I am ashamed to admit I don't like living by faith; I'd much rather have the money in hand than to know I'm going to have to trust God for it. But when I see him move, and know it could only be him, that is perhaps the sweetest experience on earth."" It is wonderfully-written and thoroughly enjoyable; I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R53K1FRM97KHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310326095#wasThisHelpful","R53K1FRM97KHE","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few weeks ago a reporter from Macleans magazine got in touch to ask if I would be willing to talk about a whole new genre of books--books that claim the author has journeyed to heaven. He had been assigned the story and was baffled by their popularity. I am baffled too. He saw as well that even as authors are insisting that heaven is real and that they have seen it, hell is on the downgrade. He understood readers want the assurance that heaven exists and they want to believe that hell does not.These books crowd bookstore shelves (as evidenced by this snapshot I took at a local bookstore). Every couple of months there is another book telling the story of a near death experience followed by a journey to the afterlife. Every couple of months one of these books hits the list of bestsellers. 90 Minutes in Heaven, Heaven Is For Real, Proof of Heaven, To Heaven and Back...it just goes on and on. While bookstores are now full of these books, there have been very few responses to them.Enter the second edition of John MacArthur's The Glory of Heaven. The first edition was written to combat New Age themes that were pervading the church in the early to mid-90's. The second edition is angled specifically at exposing this genre of heaven tourism. While much of the content is the same, there is also much that is new, refreshed and updated.In some ways this is two books: a look at what the Bible says about heaven and the afterlife, and a pointed critique of the many heaven tourism books cluttering bookshelves. In both ways it is successful.As MacArthur sketches out a brief a theology of heaven, he is in his element, looking to Scripture and simply teaching about the glory that awaits us there. His views are traditional, orthodox and at times very literal. He shows again and again that the greatest promise of heaven is not meeting those who have gone before or being free from sickness and pain, but being in the presence of the Savior. He is equally strong in exposing and critiquing heaven tourism books. He pulls no punches as he points out the massive contradictions between the various books in this genre and as he draws attention to just how often they contradict not only the facts of what the Bible says about heaven, but also the Bible's whole theme and tenor. This is classic MacArthur, looking to the Bible, showing contradictions, and saying, ""No way!""While there are many excellent books on heaven, this may be the only one that specifically addresses the heaven tourism books.

"I am sure that almost every homemaker, every mother, every woman, has experienced the disconnect between what she knows and what she feels, between knowing that her calling is good and the reality that it can be exasperating and so often feels unfulfilling. In Glimpses of Grace Gloria Furman brings the gospel to bear on a woman's distinct calling and calls her to treasure the gospel in her home. Speaking on behalf of Christian women she says,""We need to know: What does the gospel have to do with our everyday lives in the home? How does the gospel impact our dish washing, floor mopping, bill paying, friend making, guest hosting, and dinner cooking? How does the fact that Jesus himself bore our sins in his body on the tree so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness make a difference in my mundane life today?""The big question she explores is simply this: How does the gospel change the way a woman lives out her calling as a homemaker?In the first section of the book she looks at the gospel, saying ""Theology is for homemakers who need to know who God is, who they are, and what this mundane life is all about."" My favorite chapter here is ""Don't Smurf the Gospel."" Furman is both amusing and convicting as she writes about the importance of properly defining the gospel and properly distinguishing between the gospel itself and its many implications and applications. If ""smurf"" is a word the Smurfs used when they didn't know what else to say, ""gospel"" is a word many Christians use whether they really meant it or not. It's a word that may mean very different things to different people, so Furman calls for clarity and precision in its use.The second section, the bulk of the book, looks at a homemaker's many callings and shows how the gospel speaks to each of them. The chapter titles give a sense of the subjects and the tone: ""Divine Power and Precious Promises for the 2 a.m. Feeding,"" ""All Grace and All Sufficiency for Every Dinner Guest,"" ""Treasures In Jars of Clay, Not in Fine Bone China."" One of the stronger chapters in this section is ""The Idol of a Picture-Perfect Home."" I appreciated this chapter because there is such a clear gospel remedy and gospel application to the kind of heart idolatry that desires and demands the illusion of a picture-perfect home.I will turn it over to Kristie Anyabwile to provide her perspective on the book since she writes as a member of the core audience:""We need gospel fuel to joyfully serve our families, and that's what Glimpses of Grace provides. Many days I unload a barrage of law upon my family, when what they need from me is grace, encouragement, and reminders of God's faithfulness. I thank the Lord for using Gloria to point me to the glorious gospel of his grace so that I might extend the same grace to my husband and children. As homemakers we can be smothered by the ordinary, blinded by the mundane, living in a fog of routine and fatigue, unable to see how to clean messy noses or break up sibling squabbles for the glory of God. In Glimpses of Grace Gloria helps to lift the fog by showing us how the gospel can change our perspective as we serve and love our families.""Aileen and I both read this book and both enjoyed it a lot. We saw that Gloria uses both precision and grace as she shows that the good news, when properly understood and carefully applied, must transform the way a woman carries out the task the Lord has given her.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ1LDKD1V1VSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433536056#wasThisHelpful","RZ1LDKD1V1VSW","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"wish this book had not been written, or more properly, I wish there was no need for this book to be written. I wish there was no such monstrosity in the world as sexual assault. Yet the ugly truth is that sexual assault not only exists, but is all too common. The statistics are shocking, alarming. And therefore, because sexual assault exists and because of its prevalence, I am grateful that Justin and Lindsey Holcomb wrote Rid of My Disgrace. He is a pastor at Mars Hill Church and adjunct professor of theology at Reformed Theological Seminary while she is a deacon who counsels victims of sexual assault; together they are compassionate and theologically-sound, able to provide hope and healing for those who have been victimized.I do not understand the consequences of sexual assault upon its victims. There were times as a child I came perilously close to being victimized--that school janitor, that older boy. But each time someone or something intervened. I am grateful for my ignorance here. I do not understand how and why this kind of assault impacts its victims at such a deep level and how those consequences can extend through an entire lifetime. But I want to understand as much as I am able. I know so many people who have fallen prey to predators, so many who bear the marks on their bodies and souls. And I want to be able to love them well, to walk with them through their healing. And this is why I read Rid of My Disgrace. This is a book meant to equip all Christians, those who have been hurt and those who know people who have been hurt.I found the book extremely enlightening. The Holcombs write with care, precision and wisdom. Best of all, they write with Bible in hand. They write about this subject in three parts: Disgrace, Grace Applied and Grace Accomplished.They begin by defining sexual assault and describing its effects. Both of these steps are necessary because some people do not understand that they have been sexually assaulted while others believe their experience is unusual or the effects they've suffered irrational. The authors' definition is as follows: Sexual assault is ""any type of sexual behavior or contact where consent is not freely given or obtained and is accomplished through force, intimidation, violence, coercion, manipulation, threat, deception, or abuse of authority. Such a definition goes beyond a too-narrow view common in our society while also expanding the spectrum of actions that can be considered assault.Having written of the disgrace of sexual assault, they begin to apply grace, and they do this by looking to the effects of sexual assault. ""The beliefs that accompany the development, maintenance, and increase of disgrace and distress are directly responsible for generating dysfunctional emotions and their effects for victims."" God's grace, applied to the deep wound, offers the victim ""the gift of refuting distortions and faulty thinking and replacing their condemning, counterfactual beliefs with more accurate ones that reflect the truths about God, yourself, and God's grace-filled response to your disgrace."" The authors describe and then apply God's grace to six common consequences of sexual assault: denial, distorted self-image, shame, guilt, anger and despair. In each case they go straight to the cross to show how the gospel provides an answer and antidote and to show how Jesus Christ can both sympathize and heal. Alternating with the chapters are the stories of victims who describe the abuse they faced, the consequences it brought, and the hope and healing they have found in Jesus.If there is one area I might challenge the authors it would be in their brief discussion of forgiveness. They advocate extending forgiveness to an offender, even if that offender is unwilling and even if communication is impossible. In this case forgiveness is a transaction between a victim and God. Based on what I understand from the Bible, I prefer to define forgiveness in such a way that it requires the participation of both offender and offended; in this way forgiveness must include reconciliation, even if the consequences of the offense are not removed. That being the case, I would be hesitant to encourage a person who has been sexually abused to forgive someone who has sinned against them unless that person desires to be forgiven. (See this article for more on this subject.) I would instead encourage them to maintain that posture and desire for forgiveness. However, this is but a minor point in the book.The only other comment I would make relates to the tone of the book. If we could draw an admittedly artificial line and label one end ""pastoral"" with the other ""academic,"" I'd suggest that this book falls a little past the center-point and into academic territory. This makes it very helpful on the one hand as it covers ground slowly, methodically, and biblically. But it may also be a little too academic for certain readers. I suppose my concern is that some people may read a review like this one, buy a few copies of the book, and then hand them out. I don't ever advocate handing a book to someone that you haven't read yourself, so at the very least read it yourself before determining how you would use it as a supplemental resource pastorally, in discipleship or in counseling. For some readers this will be exactly the book they need to draw out important truths; for others it may prove too long or too dense. In such a case Bob Kellemen's Sexual Abuse may be a good alternative.Rid of My Disgrace is a frank and powerful book that is completely drenched in Scripture. It interprets the ugliness of sexual assault in light of the Bible and offers the deepest healing and restoration through the gospel of Christ's completed work. I read it so I could better understand and, I hope, better serve people I love. I believe it will help me do that very thing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20P6NF99UR7KY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433515989#wasThisHelpful","R20P6NF99UR7KY","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't know what The Circle Maker was about until I began to read it. Neither did I know anything about Mark Batterson, its author. I knew the book only as a Christian bestseller and its author only as a name that often appears in my inbox as people ask if I know anything about him or have read his books. ""My pastor gave everyone in the church a copy of this book. Have you reviewed it?"" Finally I read it.Mark Batterson is lead pastor of National Community Church in Washington, D.C., a church regarded as one of the most innovative and influential in the country. He made his debut in Christian publishing with In a Pit with a Lion on a Snowy Day and followed that up with several other titles, including The Circle Maker.The Circle Maker finds its title and inspiration in Honi Ha-Ma'agel, a Jewish scholar who lived in the first century B.C. and who is described in the Talmud. He is remembered as a miracle-worker in the tradition of Elijah and Elisha. Wikipedia provides a condensed version of his most famous miracle:On one occasion when God did not send rain well into the winter (in the geographic regions of Israel, it rains mainly in the winter), he drew a circle in the dust, stood inside it, and informed God that he would not move until it rained. When it began to drizzle, Honi told God that he was not satisfied and expected more rain; it then began to pour. He explained that he wanted a calm rain, at which point the rain calmed to a normal rain.Batterson says, ""The prayer that saved a generation was deemed one of the most significant prayers in the history of Israel. The circle he drew in the sand became a sacred symbol. And the legend of Honi the circle maker stands forever as a testament to the power of a single prayer to change the course of history."" From Honi he has learned the value of big, bold, audacious prayers. On a very practical level, he has learned the value of drawing figurative (and sometimes literal) circles. The promise of his book is that it ""will show you how to claim God-given promises, pursue God-sized dreams, and seize God-ordained opportunities. You'll learn how to draw prayer circles around your family, your job, your problems, and your goals.""The book has been widely-praised and has received hundreds of positive reviews, but surely people have simply failed to understand that Batterson has committed a grave error. He begins with Honi, an character who appears in books that are not (and have never been) regarded as inspired by God. He takes Honi as an authentic character who performed an authentic, God-ordained miracle indistinguishable from the characters and miracles of the Bible, and then reads what he learned from Honi back into the Bible. Rather than interpreting Honi through the lens of Scripture, he interprets Scripture through Honi so that from drawing circles he inevitably moves to marching circles and goes to Jericho, asking questions like ""What is your Jericho? What promise are you praying around? What miracle are you marching around? What dream does your life revolve around?"" He even reads Honi back into church history, looking to Christians of days past and saying that they were drawing Honi-like prayer circles.The book's examples and illustrations are largely drawn from his own life, from the dreams, goals and desires that he has seen fulfilled. He speaks of drawing a large circle around an area of Washington by walking around it while praying; before long he had a successful and growing church within that circle. He writes about circling a building he wanted for his church, marching around it, laying hands on it, even going barefoot on its holy ground, until it was his. Occasionally he shares examples from others so that he speaks of a friend who desperately wanted to be general manager at a certain golf course; he describes how his friend marched around the club house with his family seven times and then received the desire of his heart.He anticipates the critique that what he advocates is a kind of ""name it, claim it"" theology and insists it is not. He says, for example, ""Before you write this off as some `name it, claim it' scheme, let me remind you that God cannot be bribed or blackmailed. God doesn't do miracles to satisfy our selfish whims. God does miracles for one reason and one reason alone: to spell His glory. We just happen to be the beneficiaries."" I think he doth protest too much for what he teaches is very nearly indistinguishable. While he may not suggest praying for a bundle of cash or a fancy new car, there is no reason in the book why we would not do this. ""I have no idea what your financial situation is, but I do know this. If you give beyond your ability, God will bless you beyond your ability. God wants to bless you thirty-, sixty-, hundredfold."" That sounds just too familiar.When I had finished reading The Circle Maker I found myself reflecting on why a book like this one is so attractive. Why do people love it so much more than a more realistic, biblical book on prayer? What makes it resonate so deeply? Let me share a few suggestions.First, Batterson describes the Christian life as one of constantly witnessing miracles. He must use the word ""miracle"" hundreds of times and writes often of all the miracles he has witnessed. I think there are times when every Christian longs to see God work in miraculous ways, yet the challenge for the Christian is simply this: Will you believe God at his Word or will you demand more?  Batterson promises miracles, yet as he does this he defines down miracles, making a miracle any answer to prayer. We prayed for a building and got it. Miracle! I needed a bill paid and found money. Miracle! In this way every answer to prayer is a miracle.Second, he makes direct communication from God the normative experience for the Christian. He speaks often of God whispering to our spirits and encourages Christians to follow inner impressions, what he describes as ""the promptings of the Spirit."" ""Let me spell it out: If you want to see crazy miracles, obey the crazy promptings of the Holy Spirit."" I believe that every Christian longs for that unmediated, face-to-face contact with God; and yet again, the challenge for the Christian is whether we will be content with being indwelled by the Holy Spirit who illumines the words of Scripture so that God speaks to us through his Word.Third, he often takes Scripture far beyond its context which allows him to make promises the Bible does not actually make. He regularly claims Old Testament promises that were clearly meant for a particular people at a particular time as if they were written specifically for him. He looks to Revelation 3:8 and uses it to speak of opened and closed doors as they relate to knowing and doing the will of God. He writes about the spiritual value of the Daniel diet. To be frank, he utterly and consistently butchers Scripture; the Christian reading with an open Bible will soon have to see that so many of Batterson's claims cannot be supported.Finally, he speaks confidently of things the Bible simply does not say and again, this allows him to claim more than the Bible allows. For example he says, ""Sometimes physical contact creates a spiritual conduit. Proximity creates intimacy. Proximity proclaims authority. Drawing a prayer circle is one way of marking territory -- God's territory."" He trumpets the value of visualizing what you want as a means to obtaining it: ""When you dream, your mind forms a mental image that becomes both a picture of and a map to your destiny. That picture of the future is one dimension of faith, and the way you frame it is by circling it in prayer."" The Bible gives us no reason to believe that God consistently relates proximity to power or that there is value in visualization (though you may note that New Age teachers often make both of those claims).The Circle Maker is a mess. I admire Batterson's desire to pray boldly and love his call to more prayer, better prayer, more audacious prayer. Yet so much of what he teaches is sub-biblical, extra-biblical or just plain unbiblical. With hundreds of good books on prayer available to us there is absolutely no reason to spend as much as one minute or one dime on this one.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QXPOS8H4CANQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310330734#wasThisHelpful","R1QXPOS8H4CANQ","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You may be one of those Christians who serves. And serves. And serves some more. When you head to church on Sunday you are preparing yourself to serve and when you return home you are exhausted. And if you are one of those servant-hearted Christians it may just be that the more you serve, the more you see how so many other Christians serve sparingly and half-heartedly. You may find that it is a challenge to serve Christ and to keep your joy.Enter Serving Without Sinking by John Hindley. This is a book about happens inside our minds and hearts as we do our acts of Christian service. It is a call away from weariness, discouragement, bitterness and joylessness as we serve. And it does that by pointing us to the greatest Servant of all--the one who came to us not to be served but to serve. ""This book isn't primarily about our service. It's mainly about Jesus Christ, and about His service. ... Jesus does not want you to measure your life by your service of Him. He does not want your service to get in the way of your love for Him. He did not come to be served by you--He came to serve you."" This one truth is remarkably freeing. It frees us from service done to earn or impress or compare and instead allows us to enjoy the ways in which he serves us. But, of course, when we are so loved and so served, we will long to joyfully serve in return.""When it comes to Christian service, the first place to look is at what is going on in our hearts, not what we are doing with our hands."" For this reason Hindley invests some time in exploring heart motivations that guide our service. He encourages the reader to see that God cares far more about the love behind our deeds than the deeds themselves. And yet we can so often serve out of a wrong view of God or a wrong view of people. We can serve to win God's favor or we can serve to be seen and praised by men.Perhaps the book's most unusual but most helpful application is for the servant-hearted Christian to consider serving less. Some of us serve as if our service is a pillar that holds up the church and as if God's kingdom is dependent upon our shift in the nursery or our crock pot full of meatballs.As he explains service, Hindley sets our relationship to God in three contexts: we are friends of the Boss, we are the bride of the King and we are sons of the Father. Each of these relationships helps us understand how we relate to God and how we ought to relate to him through our means of service.This book is not a call away from service, but a call to the best kind of service--service done with the best of our abilities for the highest of motives.If your service of Christ has grown grudging (or stopped happening), you don't need to try to obey more. You need to love more. This means that you don't need to try harder; you need to ask your Father to send His Spirit to work in your heart to make you more loving. You need Him to work in you so that you can increasingly enjoy the goodness of Jesus, appreciate the service of Jesus, and let Jesus recapture your heart with His love.As I was reading Serving Without Sinking I found myself in conversations with some of the very people it addresses--people who serve their church and who love to serve, but who are also growing weary. It was a joy to recommend the book to them and I anticipate that it will be a great blessing to them. And to you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26SZGKQ03T0E9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1908762357#wasThisHelpful","R26SZGKQ03T0E9","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last night my wife and I sat and did a rough tally of the number of couples we have known as they have gone through dating and engagement. It's a pretty good number of friends, family, and fellow church members. Then we thought about how many of them maintained healthy and God-glorifying physical boundaries and how many had confessed that they had not. The numbers were suddenly not looking nearly so good. This is one of those areas where contemporary Christians so often do very poorly and this is exactly why there have been so many recent books on dating, courtship, purity and all the rest. Christians are failing and desperately looking for a better way.It has been some time since I have read a book on dating and relationships, probably because it has been some time since the subject has seemed urgent to me. But recently a local pastor told me that as he pastors young adults toward marriage, he has been helped by Sex, Dating, and Relationships by Gerald Hiestand and Jay Thomas. I decided to check it out and I am glad I did so.Hiestand and Thomas call their approach to relationships ""a fresh approach"" and this is an accurate way of describing it. They don't kiss dating goodbye and they don't advocate a return to the courtship of years gone by. Instead they encourage Christians to form ""dating friendships."" In this little phrase ""dating"" is the activity and ""friendship"" is the relational category. You are not boyfriend and girlfriend, but friends, and you spend time together (i.e. date) as friends for the purpose of seeing if there is mutual interest and compatibility. Romance and sexual activity and commitment can wait; for now, it is simply ""two friends getting to know each other with a view toward marriage.""Think of a dating friendship as a precursor to a marriage proposal but without all the romantic, sexual overtones that so often accompany a dating relationship. A couple in a dating friendship, regardless of their attraction to each other, doesn't pretend there is more to the relationship than is warranted. They consciously refrain from sexual and overtly romantic activity and don't become naively optimistic about the commitment level of their friendship. Thus, the main goal of a dating friendship is to explore the viability of marriage while preserving the guidelines of sexual and romantic purity required by the neighbor relationship.Integral to the argument is an understanding of how the Bible guides and restricts sexual activity. God gives us clear sexual boundaries to guide marriage relationships (sex is required), neighbor relationships (sex is forbidden) and family relationships (sex is forbidden). The authors want dating couples to understand that until they are married, their relationship to the person they are pursuing is a neighbor relationship in which any sexual activity or even the awakening of sexual desire is inappropriate. What is conspicuously absent from the Bible is a category that falls between neighbor and spouse. Yet this is where so much of our relationship confusion comes from--an invented category that is more than one but less than the other and lacking any clear biblical guidelines.Even more foundationally, the authors want the Christian to understand that the marriage relationship, and sex within marriage, has been given by God for the specific purpose of serving ""as a living witness of the spiritual oneness between Christ and the church."" When we get marriage wrong, and when we tear sex and sexual activity from marriage, we serve as a false image of the very thing we are meant to model. ""We tend to believe that God's commands are given to us merely for our own sake. But this is not true. As those created in the image of God, our very nature as image bearers explains the reasons behind God's commands. Not only is sex a divinely appointed image of the gospel, but also man himself is an image of God. We are walking sermon illustrations, if you will."" In this way the book's greatest strength and greatest desire is not in avoiding sexual transmitted diseases and unplanned pregnancy, but in preserving holiness and the purity of this powerful image of the gospel.At a time where there is so much confusion about sex, dating and relationships, this book provides helpful, timely counsel. It offers clarity to the nature of relationships and encouragement that purity is not out of reach. Kevin DeYoung's endorsement nicely summarizes my take: ""This is a straightforward, yet provocative little book. You'll find a lot of practical, sane, biblical wisdom that will explode a number of our cultural assumptions about dating. If you are single or care about someone who is, you really should read this book. The result may just be a simpler, more God-honoring approach to dating than you thought possible.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH73AQH0FRWFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433527111#wasThisHelpful","RH73AQH0FRWFP","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are some books on preaching that are meant for preachers. These are books that teach the nuts and bolts of preaching, that are full of practical tips and illustration. There is a place for such works. There are other books on preaching that are meant for all Christians. These are books that describe the power and priority of preaching in the Christian church and in the Christian life. Steven Lawson's The Kind of Preaching God Blesses falls squarely in the second category. This is a book for all of us whether we preach weekly, preach occasionally or never preach at all.The book has an interesting story behind it. In May of 2011, Lawson was to speak at the annual Pastors' Conference at Moody Bible Institute. He decided to do an exposition of 1 Corinthians 2:1-9 and titled it ""The Kind of Preaching God Blesses."" That message resounded with the men who attended the conference and Lawson himself experienced an unusually tangible sense of the Lord's assistance and pleasure in preaching it. He carried that message with him to Russia, to California and Orlando, and when he preached it, the Lord stirred his people. After all, every Christian knows, or ought to know, that ""as the pulpit goes, so goes the church. Never has this been more true than it is in this present hour. The fact remains, no church can rise any higher than its pulpit. The spiritual life of any congregation and its growth in grace will never exceed the high-water mark set by its pulpit."" That message is at the very heart of this book.In classic Lawson fashion, he writes with a clear and alliterated structure. Drawing from 1 Corinthians 2:1-9 he looks to the poverty of modern teaching, the prohibition of worldly preaching, the preeminence of Christ in preaching, the power of the Spirit in preaching, the predestination of the Father in preaching, and the parade of faithful preachers. He writes not only to pastors, but to all Christians, to those who preach and to those who listen to preaching.The week-to-week carrying out of the preaching ministry is the responsibility of the pastor. He is the one who must dedicate himself to studying and understanding and explaining the Word of God. Lawson is right that ""as the pulpit goes, so goes the church."" A pastor must understand what preaching is and why it matters and how to do it to the best of his ability. Lawson has penned a book that will challenge the pastor anew to dedicate himself to this most urgent of callings.Yet the pastor is not the only person in a church who should understand the importance of preaching God's Word. Every Christian bears the responsibility to place himself in a church where God's Word is preached faithfully, for where the pulpit goes, so goes the Christian. Shallow preaching leads to shallow Christians; gospel-free preaching leads inevitably to gospel-free hearers. It is every Christian's responsibility to understand the power and necessity of preaching and every Christian's responsibility to be able to distinguish the kind of preaching the Bible demands from its many counterfeits. The Kind of Preaching God Blesses is exactly the kind of book a Christian should read to understand what kind of preaching it is that will best feed his soul and to understand his responsibility in planting himself under that kind of teaching.I have read several other books by Steve Lawson and have often heard him preach. But what stood out to me in this book was that he loves preaching because he loves Jesus. His desire for powerful, expository preaching is first a desire to see his Savior proclaimed in power. He loves preaching not for its own sake, but because preaching exalts Christ, glorifies God, and calls God's people out of darkness and into light. He values good preaching--the best preaching--because it is in this kind of preaching that God is most glorified. Lawson's earnestness is contagious, his passion almost irresistible.The Kind of Preaching God Blesses is an urgent call for pastors to preach God's Word in God's way, and an equally urgent call for all of us to demand and expect nothing less.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVZQ3NQLX5ZT9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0736953558#wasThisHelpful","RVZQ3NQLX5ZT9","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As is the case with so many Christians I speak to, my theology of prayer is much stronger than my practice of prayer. I know so much of what the Bible says about the privilege, priority and practice of prayer, yet struggle mightily to pray fervently and consistently. Putting that theology into practice remains a daily battle.For this reason I make books on prayer a regular part of my reading diet. While I have read enough books on the subject that I do not always find new ground, I always benefit from an author's excitement and always learn from his experiences. Reading a book on prayer renews my confidence in prayer and sparks a renewed desire to do the hard work of praying.I first encountered H.B. Charles Jr. through his blog and quickly became a regular reader. I have since benefited from many of his articles and especially those that deal with preaching. In a recent post he mentioned the publication of a new book, his first book, and I quickly grabbed a copy. It Happens After Prayer is (obviously) a book on prayer. Another book on prayer. It is one I enjoyed. In fact, I sat down on my day off to read a chapter or two and a few hours later had read to the end, pausing only to throw together a quick lunch.The book's great strength is in drawing upon the passages in Scripture that show God's people praying. Charles throws down a major challenge right from the earliest pages:""Prayer is our Christian duty. It is an expression of submission to God and dependence upon Him. For that matter, prayer is arguably the most objective measurement of our dependence upon God. Think of it this way. The things you pray about are the things you trust God to handle. The things you neglect to pray about are the things you trust you can handle on your own.""If this is true, and I believe it is, he has just exposed a lot of self-dependence in me. Not only that, but where I continually slip into the mode of viewing prayer as a duty, a necessity, Charles allowed me to see it again as a privilege and an honor.""Only a good and wise and sovereign God like ours would make prayer a duty and a privilege at the same time. Let me say that again. Prayer is a privilege. It is not a burdensome duty. It is a wonderful privilege. Even though Scripture commands us to pray, we should not view prayer as something we have to do. We should view it is as something we get to do.""Charles looks at some of the perplexing questions that surround prayer. Questions like why we should even bother praying. ""`Why should I pray?' you ask. Answer: Prayer works! More accurately, God works when we pray. When we work, we work. When we pray, God works."" He looks at unanswered prayer and shows that prayer is effective even when it doesn't work quite the way we want it to; not one of the Christian's prayers is unheard or ignored. ""God is a wise Father who sometimes refuses what you want to give you what you need."" He addresses the way I can sometimes approach God in this too-busy always-on world saying, ""Prayer is not a scheduled appointment with a busy executive. It is quality time with a loving Father.""He answers common objections to prayer and also subtly chips away at the always-dangerous prosperity theology that shifts the focus of prayer from God's good purposes to my self-centered desires. This is a book that succeeds on the macro level but one that succeeds equally on the small scale, in quotable lines and thought-provoking paragraphs.There are a few areas where I wish the book was stronger. Most importantly, it would have benefited from another round of editing to tighten up some of the ideas and to catch a few typos. For a book published by Moody Publishers, or one of Moody's imprints at least, it is unusually rough in places and especially as it progresses; the best of the book comes early. There are a couple of places where an application does not flow naturally out of the text, Charles' use of Jeremiah 29:11 being a prime example. It is a wonderful passage, but one that demands attention to context. Finally, I would have liked stronger illustrations. Many of the illustrations are a little too generic, as if they are drawn from a book of sermon illustrations rather than from the author's own life and experiences. None of these undo the book's strengths, but addressing them would have allowed this to be a stronger and more consistent work.Nevertheless, It Happens After Prayer was a timely book for me. It has renewed my confidence in prayer and challenged me to continue to dedicate myself to it. The fact that I read the book in a sitting on my day off speaks to its value in my life. If I apply even a small part of its wisdom I will be a more faithful husband, father, pastor and friend. I will ""Pray when I feel like it. Pray when I don't feel like it. Pray until I feel like it."" I echo Ray Pritchard who, in the book's foreword, writes, ""I can't think of a higher compliment than to say that a book on prayer made me want to pray.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSML2MLUKYMLL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802407250#wasThisHelpful","RSML2MLUKYMLL","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No one could possibly claim that the Beatitudes (see Matthew 5:1-12) are overlooked or underappreciated. They have been the subject of countless books and sermon series. But this is not to say that the Beatitudes have been widely understood and properly taught. As often as not they have suffered from moralization, reduced to the level of the fortune cookie and with all the spiritual power of a fortune cookie.In Crucifying Morality, R.W. Glenn takes a new look at the Beatitudes saying, Maybe you ""were taught that the Beatitudes were the highest form of morality that anyone could live by, and you know now how impossible they are. Or maybe you experienced the flannelgraph version of the Beatitudes."" If that is the case, ""maybe it is time to get unfamiliar. Maybe you need to read these verses with fresh eyes for the first time. Whatever your exposure to the Beatitudes has been, you probably think of them as less powerful and captivating and helpful than they are. Take a step back to see how breathtakingly radical their real message is.""The fact is thatthe flannelgraph and the saccharine tone of those reductionist Sunday school lessons can't get the job done. Jesus' teaching is too radical to be stuck on felt. He uses counterintuitive gospel logic to show us that life in the kingdom of God is completely contrary to what we expect. In fact, we could not have predicted it. Kingdom blessing looks like the opposite of everything we value. So don't moralize the Beatitudes, sterilizing the gospel as though it is primarily or even only a rule book for nicer living. You cannot put the mind-altering, world-shattering nature of the Beatitudes into neat categories. Jesus won't let you.Glenn wants the reader to contemplate this: ""It is no accident that the Beatitudes contain no imperatives whatsoever. Because we are wired for performance and have an insatiable hunger to turn Christianity into a system of dos and don'ts to earn a spot at the table of grace, we feel almost irresistibly inclined to turn them into commandments. Instead, they are the qualities that begin to characterize sinners who encounter God's grace in the gospel."" We need to be careful not to read the Beatitudes as a series of commandments because when we do that we empty them of their true power.After all, ""the Beatitudes are a profile of the Christian. They are a description of people who would never dream of turning the characteristics God has given them by grace into a list of moral commands because they know that Jesus has crucified even their best attempts at self-centered, self-propelled morality on the cross."" The Beatitudes are not a list of dos and don'ts that get you into God's kingdom, but a list of declarations of what a child of the kingdom looks like. Where too many people reduce Christianity into a system of achievement in which you do certain things in order to gain life, the Beatitudes instead show Jesus saying, ""I have done this, so you can live.""With all of that in place, Glenn proceeds through the Beatitudes pausing to explain and apply each one. He shows that perfect conformity to the Beatitudes is absolutely essential to our salvation and then points to Jesus Christ as the one who has perfectly kept them on our behalf. In fact, Jesus is the Beatitudes. And now, through the work of Jesus Christ, they are character traits that mark the person who has encountered the gospel of God's amazing grace.Crucifying Morality is an antidote to performance-based religion, a temptation that is always near to each one of us. It is an antidote to a grave misunderstanding of the Beatitudes that eviscerates them, reducing them to an impossible to-do list. It is a powerful call to live out of the joy and freedom of the gospel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JJ9PNU3ARCMR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936908530#wasThisHelpful","R1JJ9PNU3ARCMR","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Poor Eutychus. He had an opportunity and privilege we've all wished for at one time or another: an evening with the world's foremost theologian. But it didn't go exactly the way he had imagined (or, to be fair, how the theologian had imagined). Eutychus perched himself in the coolest part of the room--right up there in the window--and listened as this man preached about Jesus Christ. And preached. And preached some more. The evening turned to night. His eyes got heavy. He drifted to sleep. He slipped right out of that window. The next thing he knew he was all dead and it was only some well-timed apostolic first aid that let him see the sunrise.Of course we've all wished death upon ourselves somewhere in the second hour of a particularly disjointed and interminable sermon. The occasional bad sermon is an inevitability to all of us who attend church week after week. The occasional dud is equally inevitable to those of us called to preach. Gary Millar and Phil Campbell are concerned with boring preaching, or just plain bad preaching, and to war against it they teamed up to write Saving Eutychus. An Aussie and an Irishman, each lifelong preachers, they have written book on preaching that is uniquely practical and uniquely quirky. It's a great combination.While they position the book as an antidote to boring and ineffective sermons, it is actually far more positive than defensive in its tone. Their great desire is to equip men for the kind of preaching that changes the heart. They say,We all know good preaching when we hear it. We may not be able to explain why it is so good. We may not know why the sermon enthralled and challenged us this Sunday, or why this time last week we were counting the bricks in the wall behind the pulpit. But we know there is a difference, and all of us can feel that difference.I hope you've heard the Bible taught in such a way that you simply could not miss the fact that God was in the room addressing his people through his word. I hope you've felt that strange combination of fear and comfort as you suspect that the preacher wrote the sermon just for you (and as you wonder whether the speaker has been secretly interviewing your parents, spouse, children, workmates and neighbors again). That's the kind of preaching that changes the heart...Indeed. We may not be able to easily define that kind of preaching, but we can all remember occasions when we have experienced it, whether we were in the pews or the pulpit at the time. And whether we deliver a sermon or hear a sermon, this is our desire, to experience preaching that changes us from the inside out. But how do we do that? What are the characteristics of this preaching?Saving Eutychus offers powerful insights into the very nature of preaching and combines these with very practical tips and pointers. Helpfully, the authors keep careful boundaries between what must be true of preaching and the specifics of their own habits and patterns. Because much of what they teach about the nature of preaching is downstream from other books on the subject, it is the tips and pointers that set this book apart. Millar and Campbell allow the reader to see exactly how they prepare their sermons, how they ensure that these are sermons and not essays, how they work on their delivery and even how they solicit and process feedback.Speaking personally, the parts I found most helpful were the discussions of the earliest parts of sermon preparation, including the role of prayer and the usefulness of transcribing the passage by hand. The section on delivery and the roles of pitch, pace and volume was also extremely useful. I read the book just a day before beginning a future sermon series and have found many areas of immediate application.D.A. Carson, a man who knows far more about preaching than I ever will, describes Saving Eutychus a ""must"" and says that if he could he would make it mandatory reading for seminarians; he would also force them read it a couple of times during the course of their ministry. Alistair Begg also puts it in the ""must read"" category and compares it with the classic works by John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones.  This is high praise, but praise that is well-deserved. It is an excellent book and one any preacher or public speaker would do well to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6CG2AUIZYF08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1922206253#wasThisHelpful","R6CG2AUIZYF08","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many years ago my grandmother succumbed to cancer and went to be with Jesus. Among the things she left behind, buried among other personal effects, was a long, handwritten letter from Joni Eareckson Tada. My grandmother had experienced excruciating pain in her life, losing both a daughter and her husband to suicide. As a new Christian she had written to Joni to share her grief, believing that perhaps in Joni there would be someone who might understand and who might give her hope. And she did. In this letter she mourned with one who was mourning and shared hope grounded in the gospel.Joni is one of those entirely unique Christian personalities and one who is universally loved and admired. Her ministry has continued for decades, and through conferences and radio and music and books and every other media she has been sharing encouragement and hope. I have seen Joni speak a few times and off to the side I've always spotted her husband, Ken. So much has been said about her, but so little about him. He is content to love and serve his wife and to allow her to be center-stage. But I've wondered who he is and what his role has been in Joni's life and ministry. Their story is finally being told in Joni & Ken: An Untold Love Story.This is an honest book that tells the story of what has not always been an easy marriage. Though Ken married Joni after her accident and after she had become a renowned Christian personality, neither of them was prepared for all the challenges that marriage would bring. What started as a great love story soon began to lose some of its lustre. While the love remained, the romance and respect faded. But the Lord was not done with them and sparked a great renewal of love and romance. Their story is not one of unfading, unattainable marital bliss, but one that is so very real, and one that went through difficult valleys. Though it is unique in many of its particulars, in other ways it looks like so many other marriages.As I read about Joni and Ken I found myself growing in my love for Aileen. Isn't it funny that reading about another couple's marriage can do this? Yet their love for one another is contagious, the way they pray and laugh and sing together is admirable, and the way Ken has sacrificed so much for Joni is Ephesians 5:25 in action. I learned about love and sacrifice and deep intimacy from this portrait of their marriage.While I enjoyed the book, there was at least one element that surprised me. Joni and Ken met at John MacArthur's Grace Community Church and, to my knowledge, have been members there through their entire marriage [Update: according to this article, they are, or at that time were, members of a local PCA church]. His influence in their lives has been profound. In Joni & Ken we are told that another great influence on Ken's life has been John Eldredge and his book Wild at Heart. This leads to some strange encounters with Ken finding his real name (Eldredge teaches that a man may be given a name by his father and more names by other people, but only God can give him his real name), hearing God's voice speaking to him in the wilderness, and other elements of Eldredge's philosophy/theology of manliness. What Eldredge teaches is in so many ways completely at odds with what MacArthur teaches, but this contradiction is never resolved.Certain other elements were frustrating. For example, the book asked several questions that it did not answer, perhaps because some of those things would have been too probing or too exposing. Still, why introduce questions that will go unanswered? Additionally, the book's timeline is at times very difficult to follow, jumping often between past and present.Joni & Ken truly does tell an untold love story and one that merits being told. The Tadas have had a great and enduring ministry; they are a great gift to the church, and for that reason the book is well worth reading. It allows us to see into their marriage, to learn from their highs and lows, and to praise God for allowing them to work together to his glory. But all the while it feels like a book that is not quite as excellent as the story, and the marriage, deserves.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV6MTTEO8HMOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310314690#wasThisHelpful","RV6MTTEO8HMOZ","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 2010 Josh Harris released Dug Down Deep, a book concerned with sound doctrine. He encouraged the reader to unashamedly embrace that much-maligned word theology and to ""dig deep into a faith so solid you can build your life on it."" In the final chaper he called Christians to a ""humble orthodoxy"" and many considered this the book's greatest strength.Today's marks the release of Harris' new book Humble Orthodoxy. This is a short volume that takes the content of that final chapter and expands on it. Though there is a good bit of overlap between the two, Humble Orthodoxy stands on its own merit.Harris' desire in this book is to encourage Christians to hold the truth high without putting people down. He calls for Christians to be guided by both truth and love, to be guided in equal measure by orthodoxy and humility, qualities that are complementary, not in opposition to one another. As J.D. Greear says in his foreword, ""Getting doctrine right is a matter of life and dead, but holding that doctrine in the right spirit is essential too. A great deal of damage is done by those who hold the truth of Christ with the spirit of Satan.""The book begins by setting the context and explaining the dilemma. ""One of the problems with the word orthodoxy is that it is usually brought up when someone is being reprimanded. So it has gotten a bad reputation, like an older sibling who is always peeking around the corner, trying to catch you doing something wrong. ... I don't know any other way to say this: it seems like a lot of the people who care about orthdoxy are jerks."" And here he begins to suggest the solution: a humble orthodoxy, caring deeply about truth, but defending and sharing this truth with compassion and humility. ""Whether our theological knowledge is great or small, we all need to ask a vital question: What will we do with the knowledge of God that we have?"" The Bible does not allow us to choose between orthodoxy and humility, but insists that we need both in equal measure, and assures us that through the Holy Spirit we can be humbly orthodox. I have always loved this quote from John Stott which speaks to this very thing:Thank God there are those in the contemporary church who are determined at all costs to defend and uphold God's revealed truth. But sometimes they are conspicuously lacking in love. When they think they smell heresy, their nose begins to twitch, their muscles ripple, and the light of battle enters their eye. They seem to enjoy nothing more than a fight. Others make the opposite mistake. They are determined at all costs to maintain and exhibit brotherly love, but in order to do so are prepared even to sacrifice the central truths of revelation. Both these tendencies are unbalanced and unbiblical. Truth becomes hard if it is not softened by love; love becomes soft if it is not strengthened by truth. The apostle calls us to hold the two together, which should not be difficult for Spirit-filled believers, since the Holy Spirit is himself `the spirit of truth,' and his first fruit is `love."" There is no other route than this to a fully mature Christian unity.Harris lays out two alternatives to humble orthodoxy. The first is arrogant orthodoxy, where our doctrine is correct but we are unkind and unloving, where we are self-righteous and spiteful in our words, attitudes and behaviors. ""If anyone thinks arrogant orthodoxy doesn't exist, he's never read the comments section of a Christian blog."" Touche. The other alternative is humble heterodoxy where a person abandons orthodox Christianity but does it very nicely. The temptation for Harris, for myself, and for most of those who will read this review is toward the first of these alternatives, to pursue orthodoxy at the expense of love. ""You and I need to contend for the truth. But there's a fine line between contending for truth and being contentious.""The driving passion behind our pursuit of biblical orthdoxy is ""not to prove ourselves more right or better than someone else but to better worship the holy God, the one who forgives and accepts us for Christ's sake alone."" He looks to Tim Keller and says ""if we make a good thing like correct theology the ultimate end--if being right becomes more important to us than worshiping God--then our theology is not really about God anymore. It's about us. It becomes the source of our sense of worth and identity. And if theology becomes about us, then we'll despise and demonize those who oppose us.""Thus the solution to arrogant orthodoxy is not less orthodoxy, but more. The more we know of God, the more we love and trust him, the more humble we will be before him.This is a book that I would love to put in the hands of a lot of people I have encountered over the years. First and foremost, though, it is a book I needed to read. It is a book I need to read again. It is a book I plan to read regularly. It rebuked, encouraged and challenged me in very helpful ways. If you have a blog or you regularly peruse blogs (especially if you comment on them), if you just plain love theology and desire to believe what is right and true, then do yourself a favor and read it as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T6QGUJVX3DRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601424752#wasThisHelpful","R2T6QGUJVX3DRX","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Christianity is a bloody faith. It is a bloody faith because it is the faith of sinful people and the Bible tells us that sin requires blood. For sin to be forgiven, for sinful people to be made right with God, there must be a payment of blood. That payment was made by Jesus Christ on a blood-soaked cross and through the centuries Christians have been praising God for providing the one thing they need most that they cannot do themselves. So Christians speak of the blood of Jesus Christ, they thank God for accepting the bloody sacrifice of Jesus Christ, they sing of that blood, they praise God for it. This is an unashamedly bloody faith.We can see the significance of blood in the pages of the Old Testament, where from the earliest verses there are bloody footprints leading away from the perfection of the Garden of Eden. The blood of millions of animals brings temporary peace between sinful people and a sinned-against God. We see the significance of blood in how frequently the New Testament mentions it--nearly three times as often as ""the cross"" of Christ and five times as often as the ""death"" of Christ. Says Richard Phillips, ""At the very heart of our Christian faith is a precious red substance; the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.""In his new book Blood Work, Anthony Carter, pastor of East Point Church in East Point, Georgia, describes how the blood of Christ accomplishes the Christian's salvation. Through 140 pages that are equally descriptive and meditative, he traces the New Testament's blood motif and finds that blood is necessary for purchasing, propitiating, justifying, redeeming, cleansing, sanctifying, electing, freeing and so much else. Almost every benefit that is ours in Christ Jesus is explicitly connected to us through this trail of blood.The reason for all this talk of blood becomes clear in the pages of Scripture. ""In Genesis 9:4 we are told that life is in the blood. If life is in the blood and the blood represents life, then the loss or shedding of blood represents death."" Thus the blood of Jesus is a metaphor for the life and death of Jesus. ""His precious blood signified His precious life and His precious death. Consequently, the redeemed do not receive a blood transfusion from God. We receive a life transfusion--His death for our death, His life for our life. It is all according to His precious blood, which satisfies God's righteous requirements for life and justice.""If blood is so central to our great problem and God's great solution, ""It should not be surprising that as recipients of God's gracious salvation through the person and work of Christ we preach, pray, and even sing of the wonderful power of the blood, as the popular hymn by William Cowper (""There Is a Foundation Filled with Blood"") demonstrates."" In fact, every chapter of Blood Work is marked by Christian hymns that, in both sorrow and joy, speak of Christ's blood. ""And can it be that I should gain / An interest in the Savior's blood?"" ""I'll wash my garments white / In the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb."" ""Sealed my pardon with his blood / Hallelujah! What a Savior!"" ""Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood / Shall never lose its power.""All this talk of blood and all these bloody songs called me to ponder why the Old Testament and all its blood-soaked history had to come before the cross. All the blood of all those animals was preparing us to understand the blood of the perfect and final sacrifice. The bloody doorposts in Egypt made death pass over the homes of God's people; the bloody cross of Calvary makes death pass over the souls of God's people.Blood Work is a powerful book that calls the reader to better understand why blood is such a integral, vile, beautiful necessity to the Christian faith. It is a book that calls the reader not only to understand, but also to marvel and to worship.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15E4Q5MDH7IZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1567693148#wasThisHelpful","R15E4Q5MDH7IZ7","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most people who read this review will be like me in that they live in a culture of radical individualism. Where our identities were once inexorably wrapped up in a local community, today we are what one sociologist has referred to as networked individuals, people who are loosely bound together by interests, but each convinced that we are answerable ultimately, or perhaps only, to ourselves. Individualism reigns, solidarity is passe.Contra this individualism comes Chris Brauns' Bound Together: How We Are Tied to Others in Good and Bad Choices. Brauns wants Christians to understand that in God's economy we are tied together through what he calls the ""principle of the rope."" He holds that corporate solidarity is a key aspect of life as taught in the Bible. We are not meant to exist apart from fellowship and community.Brauns looks to man's fall into sin as the ultimate negative example of this principle and then looks to Christ's work on the cross as the ultimate positive example. In the first case one man sinned and saw the effects of his action extend to all who would come after him. In the second case one Man died and now offers the benefits of his death and resurrection to all who will take hold of the grace he offers and, in so doing, be united to him. In this way Brauns provides a uniquely interesting take on two foundational but often misunderstood Christian doctrines: original sin and union with Christ. And as he does this he shows the beautiful gospel truth that this second rope is infinitely stronger than the first.The principle of the rope finds application in all areas of life, but Brauns focuses on just a few:Christian Community. The truest and highest joys are found not in selfishness, but in selfless investment in Christ-centered community. If you want to pursue joy--and God's desire for you is that you would pursue joy--you will need to pursue it by investing in others.Marriage. The principle of the rope illustrates both the beauty of marriage and the devastation of divorce which represents the destruction of a tie meant to last to death.Family. Families experience the ""bound together"" nature of relationships in a unique way in both joys and trials. Brauns focuses specifically and pastorally on families that have been grieved by a family member who has turned his back on the people who love him.Death. Christians can face death without fear because of their solidarity with the One who has already conquered death's power.The Local Church. Brauns insists that the local church is uniquely qualified to counter the radical individualism that is unraveling the very fabric of Western culture. The church offers both the theology and the structure that reinforces the values that are necessary to hold a society together. It is, after all, God's plan a (and plan b) to reach a lost and dying world.Jerry Bridges, who has often spoken and written about how few Christians understand the doctrine of union with Christ (and what a difference it would make if they did understand it), says this about Bound Together: ""Chris Brauns has done a masterful job of explaining the truth and its implications of the principle of solidarity ... His treatment of all humanity's solidarity with Adam in his sin and the solidarity of all believers with Christ is especially helpful, but the entire book is a masterpiece that will help us understand some of the interpersonal relationships we deal with every day.""It is, indeed, a book that is both enjoyable and insightful in understanding not only that we are bound together in both Adam's and Christ's redemption, but that we are bound to one another in all areas of life. My actions affect those around me and their actions affect me. We are not isolated individuals, but people connected together in so many different ways.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX3LEHCVZMQTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310495113#wasThisHelpful","RX3LEHCVZMQTS","AEYEAH3C78BBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEYEAH3C78BBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"That’s not what these liners cost. That’s what your refrigerator cost (or more, or maybe a little less) if you’ve bought a decent fridge in the last few years, as we have.  If you spend that much on a fridge, you want it to smell nice, keep your food clean and fresh, and not cause you a cleaning headache. That’s where these liners come in.These are fashionable, relatively thin, washable woven fabric sheets that you cut to size to line your drawers and shelves inside your refrigerator. They look wonderful, are super absorbent, and when they get dirty or dingy, you just pull them out, wash them, and put them back (or put in a new one). The precut size is one by two feet, which worked out great, to give me three sheets from one for each of our 12”x 8” drawers. I also used one cut to shape to put under my soda boxes so that if they get damp, they don’t leave pieces of carton behind on the shelf. They are such a simple thing, yet truly wonderful. I especially like the decorative dimension they give to our largely clear drawers (see before and after photos), which makes it easier to see what is inside and easier to notice when they are dirty.It’s just a clever, useful thing, and I would probably have given them five stars in the first place, but for protecting my investment in my refrigerator and the food I put in it, it’s easy to give them such a high rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OINYPKRGGGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRHB11M#wasThisHelpful","R3OINYPKRGGGG","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Truth be told, I drink alcohol. It’s enjoyable, relaxing, and I’ve experienced much of the culture of the world both with and without drinks in hand. So when Tropicooland offered me the opportunity to try their cocktail shaker set in exchange for a review, I cleared some space at the bar and said yes. And I’m glad I did.This set stacks up well with my current set. (See photo of the two sitting on my piano bar.) It is about the same size, maybe a little taller and thinner, and it has the same sleek, stainless steel finish. The included jigger doesn’t have a handle like my existing set, which is fine, but what I do like is the Tropicooland jigger is in a one ounce and half ounce size. Compared to my 1/1.5 ounce jigger, it is much easier to precisely mix drinks with. The shaker itself is big enough to easily mix about four drinks at a time, great for larger cocktail parties. The strainer top stays on and doesn’t leak while mixing, but it comes right off for cleaning and mixing the next batch. The same is true for the top above the strainer. The walls of the mixer and strainer are a little thinner than my current set, but it doesn’t noticeably detract from the performance. (I still have to use a towel to hold either mixer, as they send shivers up to the tendonitis in my elbow if I don’t.)Whether mixing some Sidecars for me and the wife on a quiet weekend, or a batch of Negronis when a group comes over for cards or whatever, if it makes me a decent drink without making a mess, I have no complaints, so of course I rate it at five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SYRCNC88ZFO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0138JMO1M#wasThisHelpful","R3SYRCNC88ZFO5","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This past summer I started smelling strange odors where nobody else could. Strange, strange odors, mostly like smoke, sometimes in my car, sometimes at work, sometimes at home. I’d asked people around me if they could smell it, but no. I was alone. A cursory web search indicated something called phantosmia, and during my regular checkup at my doctor’s, I asked about it. He said my nose probably needed a good, regular cleaning and he suggested a saline nasal spray. About that time, I picked up this product.The best thing about this is how easy it is to use. You just fill it up, dump in a solution packet, shake, and then spray up your nose. Your body will try to keep the fluid out, so you basically end up shooting solution up one nostril that streams out the other. Give a good blow, spray the other side, and repeat until you’re out of solution. Then you can breathe easy. I was amazed at how easy this is to use, but I wouldn’t call it comfortable. (It made me recall a number of uncomfortable dunks in the neighbors swimming pool while growing up.). I can’t argue with the results: fresh feeling sinuses, probably healthier mucus membranes, and since I’ve been using it, no more phantosmia.This is a simple thing that does what it says. It’s easy to use, easy to maintain, reusable, refillable, and it solves a small problem. I want to give it a less than perfect rating because it is such a simple device, but I can’t find a thing to complain about it, so I did give it five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31JWS6PLUP72Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AFR3N0C#wasThisHelpful","R31JWS6PLUP72Y","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I spent two days in Brooklyn once, looking for an apartment. We ended up living in Queens, so I’m certainly no expert on Brooklyn, but this book can make anyone an authority in short order, The design for this Brooklyn guidebook is totally different from the traditional complete guidebook that Fodor is famous for. (Fodor’s publishes a 544 page full color travel guide for New York City, which also includes Brooklyn.) Although this is a small, lightweight book, it thoroughly covers 18 neighborhoods in its 264 pages. Each neighborhood starts with a sort of whimsical map (first photo) to visually highlight the reasons to visit. Fort Greene and Clinton Hill (for example) is for “tree-lined streets, historic homes and sophisticated dining” while Carroll Gardens features “top restaurants, Italian-American culture, hip shopping"". I found this especially useful to understand the allure of each neighborhood to casual visitors.The section for each neighborhood contains detailed illustrated maps (second photo), a brief description, and information on sights, shopping, dining, nightlife and hotels. It’s a format that makes it easy to find specific information. Another unique feature is “Local Q&A”, where Fodor asked Brooklynites questions like “Describe Brooklyn in three words”. Replies vary from the expected, such as “Diverse, vibrant, creative”, to the definitive “Just One: Amazing”. They all make me curious to go there again.The bottom line is this guidebook is informative, very stylish and fun to read. It is more like reading a weekend magazine and gives a truly representative overview of this vibrant area of New York City. I did deduct one star, however, as there isn’t a single photograph in the entire book, but it’s still a valuable four star guide.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31AB7BU4LFA3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101878231#wasThisHelpful","R31AB7BU4LFA3B","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This stuff is not very good. I followed the instructions for mixing: two capfuls (which is confusing to start, because the cap has a spout) per gallon of water. It mixed up really well, formed a great lather and smelled wonderful. I washed as normal, rinsed and waited. What I was left with was surfaces that were not clean at all. They were very streaky and not all the dirt was removed. A sort of filmy, streaky glare settled and curiously highlighted every scratch and ding. I had to go back and buff with a dry cotton towel while spot cleaning where the dirt was left behind. It was a lot of extra work.While I liked the smell and the promise of “wash-n-wax” in one was appealing, the results were far from desirable. Maybe if you have a really dirty project, you can wash once with something else and finish with this. That might leave your boat or car nice and shiny, but for me, that’s asking too much. If Meguiar's puts out a men’s cologne, I might buy it, but I will never use this two star stuff again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VS7V09ITP87Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00355GPQA#wasThisHelpful","R3VS7V09ITP87Y","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am an amateur chef who many years ago made a heavy investment in a set of serious German knives from Zwilling Henckels. They’ve never let me down and they’re the set I keep going back to. But this hasn’t stopped me from trying other knives over the years, from off brand Chinese fruit knives to Japanese sushi knives, and everything in between. This is the first time I’ve tried Sabatier.Although the brand is French, these one piece knives are made in China. They are individually wrapped and protected by cardboard sleeves and silicone tip guards, a number of which were missing or fallen completely off. The look is very sleek, as the handles and blades are all one piece, and the space age round block looks like a satellite orbiting our cook top, completely different from a traditional wooden knife block (see photo). A cursory inspection of the cutting edges revealed some noticeable areas of uneven edges and slight discoloration. It’s easy to tell these are machine sharpened in mass quantities. That said, they are decidedly sharp, and I’ve cut vegetables, fish, and meat and haven’t had anything give any of these knives any difficulty. They feel firm in the hand and have a decent heft, but aren’t what I would call “heavy”. For an all metal handle, they are remarkably comfortable once seated in the palm.But to return to their sharpness, here’s where I have a problem. The handle proceeds into the blade without much delineation. Sure, the pattern on the handle is different from the blade, but the shift is subtle and because the material is the same, it is impossible to have any feel for where the handle stops and the blade begins. This is completely different from my Zwilling knives which have a wood or composite handle on a metal blade. It is easy and natural to know when one needs to adjust one’s grip to not cut your hand, but this is not possible with the Sabatier. Sure enough, the first time I washed these, I got careless and did, in fact, cut a finger. I didn’t even feel it until I was done washing. I think the modern design is good looking, but I think it causes the functionality to suffer a bit. (I will note also that the cut was a lot rougher than the cut of the Zwilling, which cuts so straight and cleanly, an overnight bandage can seal up the wound. Two days on with the Sabatier cut, which is not deep at all, and I’m still struggling just to keep it closed. Ouch!)I’m not sure how these knives will stand up to steady use, nor am I even sure I’m going to steadily use them. I’m definitely going to have to learn to handle these knives differently from what I am used to. For someone looking for a good starter knife set at a decent price, who doesn’t have a bias from any previous knives, this is a perfectly useful and versatile set. For someone who’s been using quality knives for as long as thirty years, these probably won’t measure up. At least, I didn’t think they did, which is why I’m putting them at only four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO2UBZZZU652K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016WFNRGU#wasThisHelpful","RO2UBZZZU652K","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a musician, I am, by default an audiophile. I have multiple Bose systems, two Yamaha receiver amps, Bluetooth speaker systems from Bang and Olufson and Devialet, and recently, a system similar to this Logitech from HP. I’ve even had a larger Logitech system that we used with our iPad until some of the more advanced equipment came along. So to be honest, I did not have high expectations for this system, especially as the HP AV system for computer audio was, at best, unimpressive. But as it turns out, Logitech has a winner here.One of the best things about this system is how easy it is to set up: plug it in, connect the speakers (standard RCA style), turn it on and connect a sound source, and you’re ready to jam. I tried mine out with some Freddie Hubbard jazz quintet stuff and was amazed at the clarity of the bass and drums. The bass adjusts individually as well and you can control the volume (and on/off) from a little rotating pod that is connected to the sub-woofer. The sound is very good, but not scintillating. The high end tends to get lost a little, and though you can turn up the bass, it doesn’t EQ the other sounds, so you really end up with either too much low end or a smidgen of distortion in the mid-range. But don’t get me wrong, the 80 watts puts out a lot of robust sound, and for video games, casual listening while working on the computer, or watching music videos and listening to downloads, this system has enough depth and power to satisfy even demanding music lovers. It held up well with electronica and classical music, and any of my favorite 80's hits sounded crisp enough to transport me back to high school.The worst I can do for a complaint is the power cord is really short, and I hate using these things with extension cords, as it often introduces some buzz that defeats the purpose of a unit with separate speakers. But if you make a few considerations for the device’s location and the speaker location, it isn’t hard to get good, three dimensional sound with exceptional depth and vibrancy. Of course, larger systems from companies that are audio experts put out more and better sound, but at this price point, size, and power level, you will have to look long and hard to improve on this Logitech. It’s a five star piece of equipment, well worth adding to your computer sound system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DM3F3RVP71LG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151K2AB0#wasThisHelpful","R3DM3F3RVP71LG","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When the manufacturer of this device – what I’ll call a “mood light” – offered me a sample in exchange for an honest review, I went to Amazon to check out what I was getting myself into. As soon as I realized what it was I would be getting, I eagerly accepted the manufacturer’s offer. The item arrived very quickly in secure packaging, and it was simple to set up (just plug it in and turn it on). Then the fun began.The device couldn’t be simpler. It just a bunch of LED lights set into a frame that has a multi-faceted lens that spins above the LED’s. As it catches the individual LED’s, it creates patterns of colored light on the ceiling above. There are different color modes that you can mix and match to a party theme or your own mood, or you can cycle through all the color schemes in a preset order. If you don’t want the colors plying their way all over the ceiling, you can mute the whole effect with a diffuser dome, which puts much softer patterns on the ceiling. I got our mood light set up in the living room where we have 16 foot tall vaulted ceilings, and although the light dissipated some and the ceiling fan was in the way, the effect was still broad, large, and very dynamic. Both the wife and I absolutely loved it. I noticed that in a few of the modes that use the red LED’s, the crystals are cut in such a way that the red beam seems to snake around the ceiling in a continuous motion, which is an even more dramatic effect. When we put it in a room with nine foot ceilings, the light was very bright and dense and much more colorful.The device also can play music, and although I haven’t tried it, I’m pretty sure that’s not going to be its forte. Here, it is all about the light show. If this could be dimmed enough to still fall asleep in a bedroom, that would be a great soothing feature, but honestly, I don’t have any real complaints about this device. The lighting effects are stunning, the thing is priced well, and it is small and built well, so it should last for a while. I’m only too happy to give this fun, flexible, fabulous product five full stars. It’s just fantastic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPEY64KHDKA30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7LPG6Y#wasThisHelpful","RPEY64KHDKA30","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those things that is nice to have but which is completely possible to live without. If I still lived in Japan and made regular onsen trips, I’d get a lot more use out of it. Just around the house, I might use it occasionally when getting ready in the morning, or I might not, depending on how I feel. I probably will never go out in public with this.The fabric is nice, as is the look. It isn’t terribly absorbent, but I wouldn’t use it like a towel, anyway. It’s just a nice wrap for getting from one bathing destination to another. The Velcro closure is not comfortable and difficult to align to avoid irritation. The size is adjustable, but my 36” waist is pretty much at the limit for this thing, at least, if you want to avoid “overexposure”. I do like the pocket and the overall feel, but again, I don’t really need to be carrying things to the shower, so I’m vague on the whole concept of utility here.I just don’t know what to make of this. It isn’t perfect, but it isn’t bad. It isn’t useful, but it isn’t without some functionality. It’s comfortable, but lacks a clear fashion purpose. I’ll probably keep it around for a little while, use it on occasion (especially if I go to visit the in-laws in Japan), and when I get tired of it, I’ll wash the car with it. Until then, I give it three stars for being an average piece of bath gear.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IY3H3GYUKZT9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011EBNB40#wasThisHelpful","R3IY3H3GYUKZT9","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The manufacturer of these gloves offered me a pair for free in exchange for an honest review. As a jazz pianist, I have a number of different gloves that I use on a regular basis, from cut proof, puncture proof garden gloves, to chemical resistant latex gloves, running gloves, and even driving gloves. I wasn’t sure what I was going to do with “tactical gloves”, but I figured I’d find a use for them.I ordered the large based on the size chart on Amazon, and they fit perfectly. (I like them snug.) The protective knuckle pads were right over the knuckles and the dimensions of the palm and locations of the creases matched my hand exactly. The wrist band adjusts with a hook and loop strap for an even tighter fit, and there’s also a hook and loop adjuster on the back of the glove above the back of the hand. The fabric has a lot of give, but it feels thick and protective. The palm fabric is subtly textured and provides very solid grip. There are a couple of plastic inserts on the backs of the fingers for added support and protection. I still don’t really have a clear idea where I’m going to use them, but for starters, I’m going to keep them with my tool box and use them for projects anytime I’m using tools and don’t require cut protection. I’m thinking I’ll also use one of them for unloading the washer, as I often bump my hand on the agitator when pulling the clothes out, right where I suffered a broken bone four years ago.I’m not a firearms fanatic, but I did show these to one at work and he said he could see where the plastic supports would come in handy. I just think they are good, well-constructed, comfortable gloves that I’m sure to get some good use out of, and that’s why I give them five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J14H89TBXDOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PBK9SL6#wasThisHelpful","R1J14H89TBXDOH","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you’re like me and work in factory, probably a number of your coworkers with iPhones already have Otterboxes and you’ve been jonesing after one of your own. At least, I was. But I have to say in all honesty after I received this one, I was quite happy at first, but I became a little disillusioned after a while. Make no mistake: If your phone is prone to be bumped, dropped, or otherwise handled around concrete surfaces, heavy machinery, or dirty environments, a Defender like this is one of the best cases you can put your phone in to prevent damage. The trade off, however, is, it turns your sleek, slim, light, easy to handle phone into a huge brick of acrylic, plastic and metal. You will never slip your phone into another pocket again, and it’s a good thing you’ve given it plenty of drop protection, because you’re going to be dropping it all over the place as you get used to your clumsy brute of a phone case.Once I figured out how to open the case (that took me a while), it was simple to get the phone in and to close up the case. I even was able to leave on the screen protector in case I go back to my other case (read on). There are access ports all around the case for charging, taking pictures and whatnot, so the phone stays eminently usable and functional. I can’t hear the button clicks like I could before, but that is easily fixed by just turning up the volume on the phone. I like the two tone look of the plastic inside the silicone, but the phone really feels heavy to me. I hate the belt clip. Loaded with the phone, it’s like attaching a small dumbbell to your waist, and I never get the phone to sit quite right without fumbling with the whole thing for a few extra seconds. At least twice on the first day of use, I dropped the phone while trying to put it in the clip. (I guess that was as good a way to test the drop protection as any – the phone survived.)The bottom line for me is I handle the phone more easily without all the protection, and that becomes a sort of protection in and of itself. Same thing for using a Defender: Your phone will be out and about, and dropped and bumped, a lot more inside a Defender, so thank God it’s in a Defender. I prefer slim and light and protected by careful use to bulky and heavy and protected by bulk and weight, so I’m going back to my original, slim Spigen case. Still, I see the value of this iPhone protector, so I’m comfortable giving it four stars, even though it’s just not for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1COPXJ7UMNG5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7SXR0K#wasThisHelpful","R1COPXJ7UMNG5H","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second Burei watch, and like my first, I received this as a sample in exchange for an honest review. There are two big differences between this watch and the first one I received. Number one is the black dial, which gives a sleeker, sharper impression than my first watch with a white dial face. And number two is, this comes with a stainless steel metal bracelet instead of my preferred comfortable, adjustable leather band. When I opened the box and first saw this watch though, I was immediately struck by how sophisticated it looked. I wanted to wear it to work the next day, but the band was too big and would need adjusting. As it happened, I had two new Invicta watches with metal bands that needed adjusting as well, so I took the whole bunch to a local store to have them serviced. What follows is a true story.I started with the most expensive Invicta. The technician looked at it, said we’ll take out five links, took them out, and I was fitted with a nice Invicta men’s chronograph with a black textured face and stainless steel band. Next came a two-toned metal Invicta that I think actually looks sharper than the first Invicta, being less bulky and more snappy looking because of the two tone coloring. It was adjusted and placed back in the box. Then I pulled out this Burei. The technician took one look at it and said, “Wow. What a nice looking watch!” Here’s a guy who looks at fine watches and jewelry all day long, just finished servicing two Invicta watches that cost ten times more than this one, but this one was the one that made him ooh and aah. Phenomenal.Both my Burei watches have been standouts, whether at the watch shop, at work, or out on the town. This is a classy looking, inexpensive, perfectly functioning watch, more than worth a five star rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DGC2X3YUJXY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153IMOZW#wasThisHelpful","R3DGC2X3YUJXY4","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When the manufacturer of this portable rechargeable light offered me a sample in exchange for a review, I was excited because I have been looking for a music stand lamp for a while and still haven’t found one that works the way I want. This one, too, works to a degree for that purpose, but it’s a really outstanding light.First off, it is well built and feels really solid. I can see this being used as a task light in a workshop, or as a hobby light, reading light, or any number of applications. Once it is charged (with a USB cable) it can go anywhere. The handle swivels out to form a base, and then the light portion can be set to any angle, all the way up to a straight 180 degrees. The head itself also swivels around for a more focused beam, and can itself go 180 degrees, giving a full range of lighting coverage. It didn’t quite work on my music stand because the stand is tilted, but I used a pen to compensate for the height difference and got it to work (see photos). Probably, I will use this in the living room to serve as a reading lamp on those cloudy weekend afternoons where I might doze off, as long as I can keep the overhead lights off. This lamp has three brightness levels, so it can also be used as a sort of “mood” lamp. The matte silver finish blends with any décor.This is a really outstanding light (did I say that already?). It didn’t quite work out as my music stand lamp, but that just means I’ll get plenty of use out of it in other locations around the house, which is why I rate it at five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NO8F6I43BKF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016AEDPC4#wasThisHelpful","R2NO8F6I43BKF7","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The manufacturer of this light string offered me this product as a free sample in exchange for an honest review. This is actually the third string of this type I have tried, but this is the first multi-colored light string, and the first from this manufacturer.Because these lights are solar powered, you can put them anywhere you get sunshine without worrying about finding an electrical outlet. The solar collector panel comes with a detachable stake so you can shove it in the ground at the best angle to collect the most amount of light possible. I’m using these on the northern (front) side of my house, so I used the provided stake to set the solar collector above my gutters. Hopefully it will get enough power to keep the lights on through the dark, long winter nights. (The string is very long, providing more than enough length to do that and still decorate the bushes thoroughly.) The LEDs come in four colors, and the controller has eight different patterns for providing sparkle and movement. Of course, if you just want everything “on”, it does that too. The lights go off automatically when there is enough light from the sky and then come on again when it gets dark, so you can “set and forget” them.The makers of these lights really thought of everything, making them easy to use, fun, and very pretty.

"This is one of the biggest and best Fodor books I have ever seen, and having been to 52 different countries, usually with a guidebook in hand, I’ve seen my share. This book is almost 1200 pages and covers all the countries and territories listed below. Oddly, several major Caribbean destinations, like Cuba, Haiti and the Bahamas are not included, presumably because there are dedicated guidebooks from Fodor for those locales. Instead, this book includes some hidden gems, like Montserrat, Saba, and St. Eustatius (the latter having been featured on a House Hunters episode on HGTV). Including these in this guidebook is just a nice touch.Although this book is in full color, there aren’t that many photos. The introduction pages give a lot of good information that is helpful in determining where to go in the Caribbean, and each destination chapter includes a photo, map, and a few “top reasons to visit”. All of that is helpful in deciding if a destination is for you, but some information on population, currency, language, and more “down to earth” facts would have been welcome. Still it’s a great start to learn about the area, especially the geography, since it probably is not too realistic to think one will visit all of those countries and territories.As a general overview of the entire Caribbean, this is a great book, but at almost two and a half pounds, it isn’t a very portable guidebook.

But no, it contained six towels, sure enough. We both like the pretty pastel colors, which were slightly different from the one displayed on the Amazon site (see first photo). They are incredibly soft, which makes them comfortable to use. These are, however, very small, much smaller than normal wash towels (second and third photos). We thought they would be highly absorbent, but they were just average, and after washing, they not only frayed quite a bit, but shrunk even more (last photo). (Note that the shrinkage actually made them their advertised size of just under ten inches.)Still, they are small enough to carry with you in a pocket or purse, and they still have decent utility as either a handkerchief or cleaning computer screens, glasses, or handheld devices and the like.

Of course, if you’re a coffee or soup person, you can just remove the infuser and you’ve got a sleek, slim, futuristic thermos bottle. Either way, the Urbane gets the job done. I love the matte black finish, the metal trim and the solid feel of this bottle. It also gets the job done of keeping your hot drinks hot, and on my workout days, my cold protein drink cold. It just works.What really puts this over the top are the quaint little quotes on the outer packaging and on the bottle itself. The oddball English is food for thought as you sip your oolong or rooibois. The thermos comes in a cardboard tube that is equally elaborate and has another quaint quote. It’s neat. I received this as a sample in exchange for an honest review, and honestly, this is a five star product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD79CUXL02ZQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014G63YUG#wasThisHelpful","RD79CUXL02ZQM","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Winter is coming and with it comes my annual battle against dry air, cracked skin, dried respiratory tracts, and the whole nine yards of torment that is winter. One of my frequent weapons in this battle is a platoon of humidifiers, so when the manufacturer offered me a sample of this nifty little decorative humidifier, I jumped at the chance to try it out.I was a little worried when the whole thing showed up in just a nylon mesh drawstring bag, but the unbreakable plastic parts were none the worse for wear. I took everything out and followed the simple instructions to fill and assemble and plug in the device. (The instructions are clear and pretty well written, too, rare for these types of devices.) Once I turned it on, I was immediately treated to a solid stream of cool mist and a repeating colored light show. The device cycles through seven colors or you can stop it and leave it on your favorite, perfect if you’re using this during a themed party or are striving for a certain mood effect. On high, the smallish tank only allows for a few hours operation before it needs to be refilled. The LED indicators are easy to decipher and with just two buttons, this humidifier is a breeze to operate. Because it is so small, it doesn’t put out a lot of mist, but the stream is consistent and steady enough to make a noticeable difference in an average sized room. The device isn’t loud, but it isn’t silent either. I think I could sleep with it on, but it probably is best used outside of bedrooms.This is one of those things where I had really low expectations that were quickly exceeded. It works well, is very attractive and quick to set up and get results. Although I got mine for free, I wouldn’t hesitate to buy another (or two, or three) if the need arose for even more beauty and humidity. So of course, I rate this at five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OL2ISQDJVBOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016BPO0SA#wasThisHelpful","R1OL2ISQDJVBOO","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a few patches of thin grass where the dirt has been exposed and started to look quite peaked. Watering didn’t help because there wasn’t enough plant life to hold it in, and grass didn’t take because it couldn’t get a grip – a vicious Catch 22. Although this is supposed to be used in the spring, I tried a few sample plots in a few of those exposed areas.I honestly want to say I notice a difference where I used EveryDrop, but to be frank, I can’t tell. Grass still hasn’t come in and the ground looks pretty much the same. Based on the generous and clear instructions, I don’t think this was quite the intended use, so I can’t say for sure this is good or not. All I can say is, Scotts makes lots of good grass and plant products, and I’m optimistic that next spring, I’ll use this to help me effectively restore my grass. In the meantime, I rate it at three stars for not doing noticeable harm, even while not doing noticeable good.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MZ98HXUIPIWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010872WBE#wasThisHelpful","R2MZ98HXUIPIWB","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite living in the (relatively) sunny south, the wife and I still take a regular vitamin D supplement for good health. Lately, we had the opportunity to try a number of other Viva Labs products, all with good success and no side effects, so this D3 seemed a perfect fit to our regimen.At 5,000 i.u, this is a bit of overkill. It is more than double the dose of our current D3 supplement (shown at left in the photo, this product on the right). Still, the price is competitive and while our bodies may not need all the extra D3, this way we know we are getting more than enough. As can be seen in the photo, the pills are small, which means they are easy to take. They don’t leave any after taste and we had no noticeable side effects taking these.This is high quality vitamin that lived up to the Viva Labs reputation, making it another five star product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SX0D5N1LYFEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JV4934#wasThisHelpful","R2SX0D5N1LYFEA","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My wife and I listen to music on an iHome every morning as we get ready for work. In the shower, I can’t really hear the music coming from the bedroom, so when Seedforce offered me a free sample of this waterproof Bluetooth speaker, I was excited to get wet with it.The speaker is compact and well-constructed. It comes in a drab olive with deep gray trim, looking militarily rugged. I charged it (it comes with a cord, but no plug), leafed through the manual and proceeded to pair it up with my Kindle to test out some tunes. The sound was loud enough, and clear as well, but because of its small size, I thought the music sounded quite flat and had lost much of its vibrancy. (I’m a hobbyist musician who owns a lot of high quality audio gear, so I’m pretty demanding when it comes to sound.) That is to say, this speaker doesn’t sound “bad”, per se, it just doesn’t have any bass or treble to speak of, and for me, it just isn’t to the level of performance I demand, not even in a shower.I’ll probably keep this around for using outside and in the garage when I would like a little background music while doing chores or whatnot, or in the shower when one of my good songs comes on the iHome. Because it is highly portable, waterproof, and easy to use, this is definitely an above average speaker, but the sound is just not there, which is why I end up giving it an average three star rating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQGXGXYFJ684J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013W7IG8U#wasThisHelpful","RQGXGXYFJ684J","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And you can get it, if you try. And if you do walk, you might want to consider doing so with this Smartfly watch and pedometer. I was offered a sample in exchange for an honest review, but I walk at least three times a week (between runs on the other days), and for walking, a GPS always seems like overkill to me. For years, I’ve used a small Omron clip on pedometer, and I’ve found it to be very accurate, so I had something to gauge this Smartfly pedometer against.Like most pedometers, this one is very simple to operate. You set your stride length (in metric or English), make a few simple adjustments to the clock, charge it up and you are ready to go. The wrist band is a flexible overlapping thing which is nice because it does away with buckles and other fasteners, but to be honest, I felt it was little clumsy. That’s okay, though, because this also comes with a lanyard so you can wear it around your neck if the wristband is too funky for you. I found that accuracy was not affected either way. Of course, because this does not use a GPS or other location finding function, it’s distance accuracy is entirely up to how accurately you can gauge your stride length. If you have been walking for years (like me), this is easy enough, but if not, you may have to do a little tinkering. Once set, however, the Smartfly is highly accurate in judging steps and distance.In this day and age, where even two year olds have smart phones and most smart phones have a plethora of available health apps at hand, the need for a pedometer like this is certainly diminishing. But, if you just want to take a stroll and not get bogged down in satellite signals, reams of data, apps and analysis, something simple like the Smartfly is a good way to go. Again, I’m not a big fan of the wristband, but everything else about this device is great, so I gave it a solid four star rating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XEQBUC63M80B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LIWDMWW#wasThisHelpful","R1XEQBUC63M80B","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s hard for me to get too excited about something as simple as ground turmeric, but in reality, this is a very high quality food product with amazing texture, color, and of course, taste. About the time I received this free sample, I came across a recipe for Yemenite soup that requires a boatload of turmeric, along with cumin and black pepper mixed. (The resulting spice is called “hawaji”.) After pouring all three into a jar for mixing, I took a picture. The deep yellow layers are the Kazu turmeric. You can tell how rich it is, just by looking.I’ve now tried two teas and two spices from Kazu, and I’ve been impressed with every item they sent. If I had to complain about something, I don’t really like storing spice in these plastic zip pouches, but I’ve been okay by transferring small amounts to the shaker jars in my spice rack. These food products have been very impressive, so of course I continue to rate them at five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP1EVCSJIONCO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0125EHCMM#wasThisHelpful","RP1EVCSJIONCO","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The manufacturer of this product offered me a free sample in exchange for a review, and although I have a double-USB port plug already, it is big and bulky and doesn’t travel well, so I was ready to give this Blitzwolf product a try.This solid black plastic plug even looks good in a white outlet. Just plug it in and you are ready to charge two USB devices. The plug folds into the body of the device for great portability. (We used this on a recent road trip, with great success.) I did not notice any effect on charge time and I like the little blue LED which helps you find the plug in the dark (see photo). Plus, it just looks good.In this day and age, it’s hard to imagine how anyone doesn’t have at least one of these two port plugs, but if you don’t, you might as well get a five star product like this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTDJWM1NDXMN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OGHEJY#wasThisHelpful","RTDJWM1NDXMN1","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The manufacturer of this product offered me a free sample in exchange for a review, and as I was just about to take a three-day road trip with the wife, the timing couldn’t have been better. Between her and me, we have two phones, three computers, and iPad, and some mobile speakers that all charge via USB. This creates a lot of headaches, but not anymore.This Blitzwolf 4-port USB car charger really came to the rescue. Let me say that again: there are four ports. That’s enough for two people, no matter how many devices you have. It was nice having everything getting charged as we rambled along, and I like the shiny look of the solid black plastic. To be honest, if the whole thing were a little shorter, it would be better for our compact car, (see photo – notice the limited space due to the hand brake) but we didn’t have any problems plugging up and unplugging things, even in the relatively tight space. Charge time seemed about the same as with other USB charging devices / connectors, and oh, this has 4 ports!This is just a nifty, neat little car charger that I’m sure I will get a lot of use out of, so I rate it at five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ2SZ89IM4Q3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013WEI99O#wasThisHelpful","RQ2SZ89IM4Q3S","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although it was neither the best timing nor soil conditions, I had just reworked a flowerbed in my back yard and was left with a few dirt patches that needed attention.

"Although you can connect USB 3.0 devices to this hub, because it is a USB 2.0 version, you won’t get the faster data throughput that 3.0 provides. (You can tell which is which by the connector color: blue for 3.0 and white or gray for 2.0.) Most of our devices, cords and connectors are 2.0, so that wasn’t a big concern for the wife and I. We both, however, like devices that are easy to set up, and this was just plug and play, so it excelled in that department. It is small enough to carry around, and with 7 ports, even our overloaded home office with a hard disk, scanner, printer, camera, smart phone, tablet and music speakers could be connected all at once. You think we would be happy about that, but there was one drawback.The ports are not on one side of the device (see photo) but instead, are spread evenly around it. This means you really need a little extra space around the hub and even with the space, the look is kind of messy. Compared to a hub with the ports all on one side, like the AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 2.0 Hub with 5V/4A power adapter, you can see that this hub is really not the best solution if you are only using it on top of a desk or cabinet or something.For keeping devices connected and charged while traveling, especially for two techie wannabes like my wife and I, this is a convenient hub and a good connection solution. It is still eminently usable in our home office, it just isn’t quite laid out the way we need for maximum efficiency, which is why we rate it at a high four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7BCM77FSAJQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1UWJF6#wasThisHelpful","R7BCM77FSAJQD","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a music student, jazz enthusiast, and sometimes performer and composer, as well as a well-traveled concert goer, so I have and use more than my share of high quality audio systems. Right now, my house has three Bose systems, a JBL system, a Bang and Olufson Beolit Bluetooth device, Yamaha receiver, some Sony and Logitech speakers, and enough off-brand Chinese shower speakers to fill a bathtub. I’d never heard of Devialet, but I am always on the lookout for a better sound and music experience, so I was excited to give this high-priced, designed and manufactured in France, product a try.The Phantom comes packaged very securely in a box that is in itself a work of art. You cut the seals and slide everything out, open up the inner shell, and the speaker is sitting on the floor, ready to be plugged in and put to use. (You know when a company pays attention to the packaging that the thing inside the package is going to be great.) When you plug it in, the Phantom emits an ethereal music that Devialet calls “breathing”, which means it is ready to connect to with any standard Bluetooth device. For test purposes, and because I have a lot of different music on it, I tried out the Phantom with my Kindle.I went to the settings and connected with no issue on the first try. The Phantom’s music stops and is ready to play yours. I started it with something deep and thumping, Exit Planet Dust, and holy cow! Even the cats were looking around trying to figure out where all the sound was coming from. I daresay, right out of the box, this is the most unbelievably great sounding wireless speaker I have ever laid ears on. Next, I went to jazz with some The Complete Village Vanguard Recordings, 1961 [3 CD]. The sound is deep, and so realistic, you can even hear the clinking of the glasses and the whispers of the crowd while the solos are going on. From there, I went to the Go West, which has a lush men’s choir that positively makes you stand up and shake your head. The guitars on Just Like a Pill rattled my teeth. The violins on Symphony 5 gave me goosebumps, and then, Gordon Goodwin’s Big Phat Band playing with Chick Corea on Senor Mouse (Act Your Age) just made me sit down and laugh. Nothing has ever sounded as realistic, deep, and true to the recordings as the Phantom. Sure, Bose and Beolit don’t sound bad, but Devialet seems to be able to carry more genres at a higher level, which is a big plus for someone who listens to as much, and as different types of music as I do.The device itself is very attractive, but it does look a little like a vacuum cleaner canister and it is heavy. (See photo, with the Phantom still sporting the speaker warning sticker, next to our Roomba.) You have to be careful handling it, not only because of the weight, but because the speakers on the side can be damaged if mishandled (per the aforementioned sticker). Also, my wife didn’t like the lemon yellow cord, which I suppose is a design consideration and didn’t really bother me, but she found it just ugly. I haven’t really found a good spot for the Phantom yet, and am experimenting with different tables and corners of various rooms. The app for iPhone installed in just a few seconds and gives you another degree of control over this fantastic device, with a volume control, mute, and a “nighttime” button. (The neighbors will not like the nighttime button, which bumps the sound up louder for a rock out party.) The app is just another really nice touch and customer consideration from the manufacturers.I don’t know what more I can say. This device is cool looking, as easy to set up as anything I have ever owned, and it gives a new dimension to music and entertainment in our home. The fact that it is so simple to get so much out of it, just makes it a modern marvel. Devialet is, as far as I can tell, a new company to the audio market, but the Phantom promises they will make fast and thorough inroads. If they continue to develop winning products like this one, they will be a household name like Bose and Sony faster that you can say “Magnifique!” I love my Phantom and will be using it steadily for the foreseeable future. This is the single most obvious five star product I’ve ever owned.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E1N44GZ2UJ0A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015XDTSP6#wasThisHelpful","R2E1N44GZ2UJ0A","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is latex, so latex allergy sufferers are advised to go for one of the nitrile choices.Any of these products is a solidly performing glove. If you keep some of the above comments about application and use in mind when making your purchase, you will end up with a five star glove for whatever project you have in mind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SYU09GP34X8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003DQXMJO#wasThisHelpful","R3SYU09GP34X8T","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although this bag has a number of advantages over my workaday Takata computer bag (see photo: this bag on the left, Takata on the right), the single biggest advantage is the generous pockets on the outside. My other bag just has one pocket that is very small, and it can’t really hold all the cords, chargers, USB flash drives, phone chargers, and other accoutrements of a modern day, tech savvy businessman. This case logic bag has two pockets on the outside and two dividers on the inside, so everything fits. It also is well padded and with the extra organization and dividers inside, you could even carry a tablet without worrying about scratching the screen or otherwise damaging it.Of course, the bag also looks great, in a subtle, profession elephant gray with tan accents and handles. It is lightweight and just the right size for my laptop (an Asus Chi with Bluetooth keyboard). The charger fits easily in the aforementioned pockets, and with the divider, I can now throw in my Dell Venue 10” tablet, and even the Belkin keyboard I got for it, and I still have room for a notebook, some pens, and a few cords and USB to micro-USB converters.With this bag, I really feel like I’ve moved up in the world. I didn’t think I’d ever find another bag that fit my computer without being over-large, yet that could also hold all the things that go with the computer. But Case Logic has delivered, so I’m satisfied to deliver five stars in return.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNBRPMRJ2MVU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013LDU5FW#wasThisHelpful","RNBRPMRJ2MVU3","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Right on the heels of the missus and I trying out the luscious Vichy foaming face cleanser, we got to try out this dark spot evener.  For purposes of this review, I just tried a smidgeon, while my wife has used it regularly for the past few days. Here’s what we thought.It took a while to figure out how to open this, as there are no instructions on the box telling you that you have to use the cap to also pierce the tube. As a result, the tube is easily crushed and deformed (see photo). The “cream” is also very thin, possibly from too much of the famous Vichy volcanic water being added. So even with the small spout, a little squeeze and this stuff come gushing out.The cream, however, is very light and smooth and it absorbs into the skin quite quickly. The fragrance is nice but very subtle. My skin is titanium, so I didn’t have any irritation issues, but my wife, with the tissue-paper-on-needles skin (hey!) also had no irritation. This cream just makes skin soft and supple. As far as the dark spot evening feature, that can take up to eight weeks to notice, so we may have to report back, but based on the results of other Vichy products we have tried, this should be quite effective and do what it say.Although this is a little pricey, it really is another great product. Names for a city that has some world famous spas, this makes one feel pampered and relaxed, so we rate it at five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDOBRK6ALE3AA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CE16S4#wasThisHelpful","RDOBRK6ALE3AA","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although the wife and I prefer Tiffany’s holiday series china, because they are so expensive and so formal looking, we long ago switched to Lenox’s Winter Greetings series as our holiday dinner ware. We have always loved the red ribbon pattern and as avid bird watchers, you can put a cardinal on just about anything and that will convince us to buy it.This plate is very hefty, weighing just a little over two pounds, which means it should stand up to frequent use and probably will be harder to break, whether hand washed or tossed in a dishwasher. The design is a little sparse compared to the dinnerware issued in the past (with more leaves and other birds), and the overall color is lighter. (See photos: this cardinal has red wings and a red beak, our other dinnerware has brownish wings. Everything is still a match, though.) A little scary is how this cardinal is facing forward, staring straight at you with his beady eye. He’s still a looker though. The gold trim and accented corner really add a lot to the beauty of this plate, and it comes in a sturdy, well cushioned gift box.Even if this wasn’t a perfect match for the dinnerware we already have, it good looks, stylishness, and overall beauty would still earn this plate a full five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QE1GEBB3KWG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U61LE3U#wasThisHelpful","R3QE1GEBB3KWG7","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s been about three years since we ditched our 32” Sony CRT TV for an LG 55” HD 3D jobbie, and when we made that upgrade, I for one sincerely thought that it would be a lifetime before a better, sharper TV would come along. But now I’m back in the Sony fold and not too proud to admit, I was completely wrong.This Sony 55” Bravia ultra-thin, Ultra HD 4K TV is simply amazing, and it decidedly outclasses and outperforms our LG in many, many ways. And make no mistake, that is not a statement to take lightly, because our LG TV is, for our money, one of the best TV’s you could have bought three years ago. But the Bravia really has it all.For starters, right out of the box, the Bravia is a breeze to set up. Even the box comes with plastic locks that allow you to set the box down and raise the box up to expose the TV. Every piece of literature that Sony sent with the TV shows set up to be a two person operation, but because it is so thin and not that heavy, I succeeded in setting it up by myself twice (keep reading). Once you have the TV out of the box, you can attach the legs to put the TV on a stand, or you can do the included wall mount (which probably really is a two person operation). After attaching the legs, I realized the TV was actually wider than the stand we had prepared and just as I resolved to have to buy a new stand, I came across the page in the manual that shows how to attach the legs towards the middle to fit it on our smaller stand. So I took everything down, reassembled with the new configuration, then had the TV up and ready to go.The first time you turn it on, you have to update the software and firmware, and if you are going on a home network (we did wireless), you’ll have to configure that. The firmware download said it would take 30 minutes but took only about 15 over our cable connection, and once that was in, I was connected to Netflix, Amazon Prime, and everything else through wireless, and regular TV through the onboard tuner. Remaining set up was less than two minutes: just ran an HDMI cable from a Sony Blu-ray player to the TV and an HDMI ARC cable to the Bose sound system. Total set up and configuration time was under an hour and there were no hiccups.Turning on the disc player and TV turns on the sound system, and boom! We were shaking the house! The picture is stunningly bright, with remarkable depth. Watching the Sony ads on the disc we put in (Avatar, Die Hard, etc.) and sitting only ten feet away, I honestly started to get dizzy during some of the shots. Even something like black-line animation (Archer) showed up crazily sharp and distinct. Already the wife is suggesting we move the Sony out of her study (where we put it to watch her art films) and into the living room, where we watch the majority of our movies together. (We’ll probably do that.)In short, this TV is just amazing. The sharpness, deep blacks, color range, motion, just everything is gorgeous. The ease of set up is a huge selling point for me, and I think it will make a lot of tech-fearing home owners feel more confident and happy. Other than the brief letdown of fiddling with the legs, there isn’t a single drawback to this TV. It’s just unbelievably good, and way better than two other TVs that I rated at five stars, so of course, that’s what this one gets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30XIXIJ892BV3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R45XL64#wasThisHelpful","R30XIXIJ892BV3","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shortly before I stopped lessons with my piano instructor, he threw out the name Lee Evans as an approachable jazz pianist whose style was eminently learnable. So I put a bunch of Lee Evans music books on my wishlist, and for whatever reason (there’s little logic in my approach to learning the piano, unfortunately), I bought this one. The cover says it is “Late beginner” level, so I thought that would be hard enough to teach me some new things, but easy enough I could learn without an instructor. My assessment turned out to be exactly correct.Two of my biggest weaknesses before starting work on this book were, first, rhythm, especially keeping time, syncopation, and observing note lengths and rest locations and length. (As a former organist, I tend to not take advantage of the percussive capabilities of the piano.) My second weakness was a lack of movement and depth in my left hand. Although the songs in this book are very basic, using nothing shorter than a quarter note, the pieces are cleverly built to work all aspects of a jazz performance. So, immediately, I was challenged to sustain notes across bars, sustain notes in one hand while the other moved, and presented with assorted rhythms and passages that (of course) I was not familiar with and was challenged to construct without a teacher to show me the way. It took a lot of practice with the metronome, taking everything at a slow pace to get the timing and notes down, but once I had done that, the songs were sounding very musical and, magically, jazzy.Speaking of the metronome, because all the notes in the pieces are a quarter note or longer, the pieces are meant to be played at fairly brisk clips. Again, this is a huge advantage of this book, because the student can always set the metronome to four beats a measure, slow it down to an approachable level, then play the pieces through, without having to worry if they’re keeping good time or not. (Either the quarter note is on the correct beat, or it isn’t.) For me, this is huge, because once I have the notes down, it’s just a question of kicking up the metronome until the piece is being played at the specified meter. And once you reach the specified meter, the flavors of the pieces, flamenco, boogie-woogie, blues, whatever, start to come through. They bring the whole world of jazz to your piano. Turn the metronome off and start to swing them, and your ears will be amazed.Really, I couldn’t be happier with this book. Some will probably find it a little too simple, but I still think working through the pieces will help 90% (or more) of pianists understand and play jazz tunes better, especially if they are making the transition from other piano styles. I love this five star book, and I can’t wait to work through the last few pieces and pick up the second book in the series. Lee Evans has made me a happier, and better, jazz piano player.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O6BFZMQSYZC1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1569397341#wasThisHelpful","R1O6BFZMQSYZC1","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the longest time, I wondered what, if anything, these sort of clip-on lenses could do for the average, dinky, low-res smart phone camera. But as in-phone cameras rapidly improved and become more and more useful – indispensable really – and as their quality approached higher and higher levels, I started to think an enhanced lens set might not be a bad idea. So when the manufacturers of this lens set offered me a sample in exchange for a review, I was ready to give them a try.And right out of the box, the Go Go Robot lens impressed, as it uses the previously mentioned clip-on feature to great effectiveness, allowing you to use the phone camera and lens without removing your phone from its case. Of course, it becomes a little trickier locating the lens, especially with bulkier cases, but it’s still much easier than removing the phone from the case. The two lenses included with this set are a fish eye and a macro lens. To be perfectly honest, while I can see that they alter the image or the photo the camera takes, they really are small lenses, so the alteration is quite subtle and the image is severely reduced. With certain subjects and lighting conditions, it can even be hard to notice any difference at all. But for specific objects under certain lighting conditions, the effect can be more dramatic. (Some samples appear below. L-R, no lens, fisheye, macro, all taken standing in the exact same spot.) The lenses are well constructed of what looks and feels like aluminum, and they screw onto the clip quite easily and firmly. A small cloth carrying pouch is included, and each lens has its own protective cap, so you can just toss them in the pouch, put the thing in your pocket or purse, and away you go. To use, you just pull out the clip, screw on the lens of choice, and clip to the camera, ready to shoot in just a few seconds.As an amateur photographer, I have to admit that I’m still quite reluctant to replace my high quality cameras and lenses with a smart phone and a couple of clip-on lenses. But I don’t drive around with and carry my camera everywhere I go, and I certainly don’t carry my advanced lenses unless I know I’m going to have something to shoot. (They’re heavy and expensive, you know.) Recognizing, however, that the phone is usually handy and that these lenses vastly increase the phone camera’s utility and “artsiness”, I’m probably going to find it not too hard to get in the habit of keeping these around and getting a fair amount of use out of them. For that reason alone, even if they didn’t have all the fun and function I mention in this review, I’d rate them as a five star product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39YGCZHDIJXBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPTNSFK#wasThisHelpful","R39YGCZHDIJXBW","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a regular tea drinker, but as I’ve gotten older, I’ve found caffeine affects me a little more than it used to, so I’ve been swinging my way over to herbal tea of late. Kazu offered me a free sample of this ginger tea in exchange for a review, so I decided to give it a try.Although I usually drink chamomile when I don’t drink black tea, I use ginger (raw root and dried powder) in a lot of Asian dishes that I cook, so I felt like the flavor of ginger tea wouldn’t be too “alien” for me. And while I found it soothing enough, I will probably only drink it occasionally. My wife, however, absolutely loves this tea and has been enjoying a cup four or five times a week. She’ll drink it in the morning, afternoon, or evening, just whenever, as it is a great anytime tea. We both felt it was pretty soothing tea, and of course, no caffeine jitters.We both really like this tea. I was leaning toward a four star rating, but my wife said she wouldn’t appreciate it if I gave her new favorite tea less than five stars, so, there you go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTMK64C6DS931/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0125PKVHY#wasThisHelpful","RTMK64C6DS931","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The makers of this product offered me a sample in exchange for a review. I do a lot of baking and Asian cooking, so naturally, I use my share of cinnamon, so I agreed to give this product a try.In the bag, this is as fine a powdered cinnamon as I have ever seen. Compared to some of my Vietnam and India cinnamon, as well as the most common Sri Lankan (like this one and the McCormick I have on hand) this is a slightly lighter brown, almost tan, than I am used to. After opening the bag, the room smelled like a shopping mall food court with the sweet, tangy cinnamon smell. Taste wise, I want to say this is slightly more intense in flavor than my usual cinnamon, but that may be my olfactory senses telling my brain and tongue more than they really know on their own. Overall consistency is what I expect from a fine quality cinnamon, and in all the taste tests so far (lamb kebabs and cinnamon toast), flavor has been excellent.I would have preferred if this came in some kind of bottle or container, as it is a little hard to handle in a bag and transferring the contents to a spice jar is a meticulous, time-consuming, and still messy task. But that mess is a small price to pay for a lot of delicious cinnamon, so I still rate this product at five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KZJX46K7YNDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0125P6EDY#wasThisHelpful","R2KZJX46K7YNDC","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my fourth or fifth food thermometer, and I received this one as a sample from the manufacturer, but it is by far the best one I have owned. I say that not because I got it for free, but because it truly has some features that set it above the others.For starters, the probe swivels on the handle so you can set it at an angle to insert it into just about any cooking vessel, or poke it into meat or another dish to get maximum exposure to wherever you want to check the temperature. It also turns on automatically when you swivel the probe out, and shuts off when you close it. You can set the device to read either Fahrenheit or Celsius, which is convenient for me because I have a number of Japanese recipes that specify degrees in Celsius instead of the more common Fahrenheit. It also features a button that holds the temperature before you extract it, so you can take the temperature of a dish while it is still in the oven or on the range and pull it out to read the temperature, thereby not singing your eyebrows. Of course, the display on this one is actually quite large, so I haven’t really had to take advantage of the hold button all that much. For storage, the probe folds against the handle with the point protected, so it is safe to store in drawer with other implements. And, it takes a regular AA battery, which is a godsend compared to smaller food thermometers that use combinations of tiny watch “coin” batteries.Seriously, this is a great food thermometer and as I said, is the best of four I have owned so far (including two that broke). That makes it a five star performer in my kitchen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PPWCEF2RPKKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0135MNB3C#wasThisHelpful","R2PPWCEF2RPKKC","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I received this watch for free from the manufacturer, I have to say that this is the kind of watch I would buy for myself anyway. I like that it is a simple, easy to see design, and I also like the leather band, which is sturdy but comfortable. The elements of the watch, such as the silver-finished hour markers sit on a raised ring on the watch face, with the minute markers set outside the ring but also slightly raised. It gives the watch face a three dimensional quality resulting in a very distinctive look. The day can be set to either English or French, but it clicks through two settings so that it always stays in the language of choice. After two weeks of use, time appears to still be very accurate.The watch came with a fashionable box which includes a pouch for gift giving or toting around. The instructions are clear and the watch is as easy to set as any other, with a two level pin for choosing to adjust the day and date (clockwise and counterclockwise) and time. There’s really nothing that I don’t like about this watch. It looks good, goes with my wardrobe, is simple and functional enough to wear to the factory where I work, but elegant enough for a night on the town.

"As a musician soon to be starting on earning a music degree, I spend a lot of time, money and energy looking for good sound reproduction for both commercial and personal recordings. Depending on what I’m listening to, and where I’m listening to it, I can need anything from a heavy duty Bose system, to just something that gives me an idea of what I might hear when I play something a certain way. With that in mind, I decided to give this HP system a try.The system is quite small and sets up in just a few minutes. The connectors are of average quality, and the speaker cords are basic, vinyl shielded, nothing special black cord. The right speaker is the power unit and confusingly, the cord from the right speaker to the subwoofer is about five feet long, but the cord to the left speaker is right around four feet. That means you can set up the subwoofer a little farther front or back of the speakers, but if you want to put the three speakers equidistant from each other, your set up can only be about four feet wide.Sound wise, I’m not particularly impressed. The subwoofer helps the system achieve a fairly deep bass, but heavy electronica bass sounds fade pretty quickly, even with everything turned up. On full blast, the system is not loud at all, so this is probably good for basic computer and tablet sound in an apartment or condominium. The high ends are not very crisp, but they aren’t tinny and crackly either. I listened to classical, jazz, electronica, and 80’s pop, and nothing stood out. All sounded decent and a little flat, but there was enough richness to hear everything that was going on.For compactness, portability, ease of set up, and price, this system is very good, but serious audiophiles will likely be disappointed. It’s just run of the mill audio gear for improvement over a “back of the device” speaker, which is why I rate it at three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP8BQ7MJ1ZIU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5X1XKU#wasThisHelpful","RP8BQ7MJ1ZIU3","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started taking this just a few weeks after I got new eyeglasses. As I’ve aged, I’ve noticed that when my prescription changes, it takes a good while for my eyes to get used to the new lenses. Also, because I work in a factory, I have not only distance glasses and reading glasses, but also safety lens bifocals. I’d been having headaches and severe enough eye fatigue that I basically had to give up computer work after three in the afternoon (don’t tell my boss). Then, I started taking this astaxanthin. And to be perfectly honest, I took this thinking it would help with run recovery due to its anti-inflammatory properties, and I knew nothing at all about its effect on eye health.You know what? My eyes started doing noticeably better. I’ve been able to keep up with work throughout the day, still use a computer for personal things in the evening, and even play the piano for an hour or so, learning – and reading – new music. I hardly even noticed how well my eyes were doing. Then, we had to do an audit of third shift production and I put in a thirteen hour day starting at 4 in the morning (instead of my usual 7:30). Again, no eye problems through the entire day. Is it because of the astaxanthin? I honestly couldn’t say, but I don’t think I’ve all of a sudden gotten used to all my new glasses, and I haven’t been doing anything else differently or changed any of my other supplements. I’m compelled to conclude that astaxanthin is really having a noticeable positive effect on my body, particularly my eyesight.I’ve tried a number of Jarrow products in the past, and this is not the first time I’ve had such dramatic results. And when I have had good results with no negative side effects or digestive issues or whatever, I’ve always given their products five stars.

"I’ve been a fan of Black and Decker corded yard tools since the day I bought my first house sixteen years ago. They are always highly functional, easy to use, and they get the job done. Although I was already quite happy with my Poulan electric chainsaw, it is getting a little old, so I was happy to try this B&D model.I have to say that out of the box, I wasn’t too happy that this thing had to be put together. That said, it is a tool-free operation and it only took a few minutes to get the bar and chain inserted, sprocketed, and ready to go. The chainsaw itself is what I would consider average power, but electric chainsaws never quite have the power that a gasoline model would, anyway. For my purposes of removing tree limbs, trimming crepe myrtles, and dispensing with a neighbor’s willow tree that fell in my yard, this chainsaw was more than powerful enough. I suppose that with the tools free feature, one might also not complain about being able to remove the bar and chain for easy storage, although this makes for a little messy operation, due to the auto oiling feature that keeps the tool lubricated. (This is a positive, by the way.) And anyone who has ever used a chainsaw for an hour or two will tell you that eventually the chain will need adjusting, and being able to do this without looking for a little wrench or special saw tool is probably this chainsaw’s greatest advantage.All in all, I’m pretty pleased with the chainsaw. It is simple, user friendly, and as I’ve said, gets the job done. It didn’t revolutionize my life in anyway, but it still makes me quite happy, which is why I’m also quite happy to give it five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39F5V1OFKIRKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TJ3FBOY#wasThisHelpful","R39F5V1OFKIRKH","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve been a regular jerky eater for as long as I can remember. My homemade jerky is by far the best (pinot noir and black pepper marinated flank steak jerky, anyone?), but I don’t always have the time and energy to make it. Walmart beef jerky was my favorite for a long time, but they recently changed the recipe (or something) and it didn’t excite me anymore. I’d had Jack Link's before and it didn’t leave a strong impression, but I was ready to give it another shot.This is a fairly straightforward, tasty jerky. Not too hot, not too sweet, it has the right amount of salt and bitterness with just a hint of heat and umami, with a slightly honey-like finish. The texture is good, though some of the thinner pieces are a little chewier than others, but those are sometimes the ones I crave the most. For a quick snack that satisfies and is healthy for an older runner like me, it’s hard to beat any kind of jerky, but Jack Link's is one of the tastier ones and definitely worth going for.

"Our normal brand for cutting products is usually Fiskars, even for things like plant pruning. But the wife has been a fan of Martha Stewart for years, especially for craft products, so we decided to try out this paper cutter.At first glance, it seems kind of light and cheap, as the plastic does not seem especially robust, but once we began using it, that image was quickly dispelled. This is a very sturdy cutter that had no problem dispensing with thin paper, thick paper, thin cardboard, and large envelopes (as a test). The handle is very firm feeling and has a locking mechanism for safety that works very simply and sturdily. The handle part of the cutter can be removed for easy storage, and the cutter also comes with another mechanism that presses down on the hold bar to secure the paper as it is being cut. The light blue lines on the traditional square grid make it easy to cut precise triangles and other shapes (see  photo). With a large deck, the grid, the triangle lines, and the secure handle, it is really easy to use. It’s just a first class cutter, top to bottom.I know my wife is going to get a lot of use out of this cutter, and although I’m not a particularly “crafty” type of guy, this thing is good enough to make me want to be creative. That alone makes it a five star product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI3R9OKCYYVKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DV91G9Q#wasThisHelpful","RI3R9OKCYYVKG","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of course, as pretty as this ring is, it doesn’t really go with my wardrobe, so after making some initial observations, I handed it over to my wife for testing. (Okay, “wearing”.) Here are our joint comments and assessment:Unlike some other jewelry from Amazon, this ring is a decent enough size that it really has some presence when worn. The cubic zirconia is cut quite intricately, and it is brilliant enough that it almost looks like it is being lit from within by an LED light or something. If you look at it closely, or catch the angle that makes it look like a light, you can tell this isn’t an exquisite or expensive rock, but from most distances and angles, the overall presentation is gorgeous. This is probably thanks to the elegant and classy design of the setting and ring itself. The size turned out to be right on (see photo on the ring sizing cone), and it comes with a nice gift box. For the price range, this is a high quality, five star piece of jewelry.Finally, my wife is glad my fingers are as big as they are, because I would borrow it if I could.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSUJE0JWUFRAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ND12NFS#wasThisHelpful","RSUJE0JWUFRAA","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve been a Fruit of the Loom guy for as long as I can remember, so I thought my wife would like to have and appreciate this women’s underwear. Turns out I was right. Here’s what she thought about this five star product:You can select the size but not the color, and the colors we received were completely different from the picture on Amazon. (See photo.) I did like the vibrant color with accent trim. The sizing, however, is a little confusing. I normally wear an 8 or 10 for most brands, but these came in 6 and were just a touch bigger than necessary. Determine your optimum size by the numbers of “bottoms” and you’ll want to go one size down. Note also the sizing is important because these do not shrink in the wash.These panties were very comfortable, possibly due to the “breathable” feature. They are stylish enough and the tag free feature is a nice touch, with the logo and size printed on the back. I really like just about everything about this underwear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UIC95W7QA70Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTV7POS#wasThisHelpful","R1UIC95W7QA70Y","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We only recently for the first time tried Solid Gold Indigo Moon Chicken Holistic Dry Cat Food, Chicken & Egg, Grain & Gluten Free, Cats & Kittens of All Life Stages, All Sizes, 12lb Bag, and although it wasn’t an unqualified winner, our two adult Persians, after some deliberation, took to eating it pretty regularly. And although neither of our cats has a weight problem, neither do they have any other health issues, so even though this has reduced protein content, we decided to give it a try. The cats’ reaction to this was almost exactly the same as with the first product: they showed some hesitation, then began picking at it, and after leaving it out all night, it was gone.Like its sister product, this is a pretty healthful cat food, so we are comfortable feeding this to our two cats. Our cats are also quite finicky, so adding variety to their regular diet really helps. As I said, Solid Gold was not on our radar before, despite the psychedelic holograph-laden packaging which probably shows up on the local airport’s radar, but now that we’ve had success with two very different products from the same maker, we’ll definitely keep an eye out for Solid Gold, as we now consider this five star product to be an important part of our cats normal feeding regimen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OQFDUB08BC5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X0GTKQG#wasThisHelpful","R2OQFDUB08BC5S","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sure, you can buy colored napkins, check out a YouTube video or online instructions and make your own party decorations just like these, probably for less money, but why would you? These solid but soft napkins come twelve in a package, pre-folded into an elegant origami half-moon shape. Just pull them out of the box, give them a twirl, set them down, and you’re ready to party. The look is fantastic, and I’m all about ease when it comes to this type of decoration. Available in multiple colors for all sorts of occasions and themes, these orange ones arrived just in time for Halloween, making great accents for an otherwise black and purple table.Some people might feel these are a little pricey, and I would too if the napkins weren’t such high quality, but these are thick, soft and absorbent, and they definitely have a sophisticated look. I’d be inclined to deduct a star from the rating for the lower cost performance, but I really do feel these are worth the price, so I’m sticking to a five star rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TEDYFJRTMWJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B18PXOI#wasThisHelpful","R2TEDYFJRTMWJZ","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a regular gardener and a sometimes DIY’er, I always have use for something as handy as these stakes. They’re ideal for supporting plants, with their generous 3’ length allowing you to secure them in the ground and still leave a good portion for tying off branches, chicken wire and whatnot. I also used mine to lay out the edging of a flowerbed. I plan to cut them down and use them for supports and spacers for a wooden pathway that I’m running through the middle of the flower bed, too.They come in a box that keeps them organized and clean until you are ready to use them, and it makes a great space saver, too, as these can be unwieldy when you have a handful of them out and loose. Besides all the practical uses, you can paint and decorate them for sundry art projects and outdoor décor, and with Halloween around the corner, I’m thinking a skeleton with one of these through the rib cage might be just the right level of scary and artsy to get the neighborhood kids talking.It’s a simple product, but it is manufactured to a high standard of very sturdy wood.

"The manufacturer of this dog whistle offered me a free sample, and I had an idea that this would be useful on my morning walks to keep the neighborhood dogs at bay. So when it arrived and I learned it was mainly intended as a dog training aid, I was a little unsure it would suit my purposes. Nonetheless, I took it with me on a few morning walks and runs, and tried it out.The problem I have in my neighborhood is that we have a number of covenants and restrictions on barriers and home decoration. This means that more than a few of my neighbors utilize the so called “invisible fence” to keep their dogs reined in. This is fine for them and their dogs, as they both know where the animal is going to stop his mad charge toward the sidewalk. I, however, am unsure if I’m about to have my ankle choked by a terrier, or if I need to go ahead and start running (or running faster) to save life and limb. So, I decided to try this whistle as a general deterrent or “confusion inducer”.As near as I can tell, it works pretty good. It doesn’t really make the dogs stop, but I did get at least two animals to stop barking and one that kept barking but looked like he wanted to play rather than attack. I think this is better applied in the training of a dog as described in the sketchy instructions (no doubt translated from Chinese). The lanyard/strap is soft, strong, and has a generous width, and the whistle itself seems cast from stainless steel or some other corrosion resistant metal. That is to say, everything looks and feels very high quality. Everything comes in a resealable plastic pouch, which is handy and hygienic. All in all, it seems effective and is decidedly well made, so I felt comfortable giving it a full five star rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28OAM7AVZITZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0159CHOL6#wasThisHelpful","R28OAM7AVZITZ2","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our two pure bred, adult, Persian cats are never easy to please. They also tend to get in a finicky food rut pretty frequently, from which they are not easily removed. This was a brand that not only had we never tried before, we’d never heard of, so we opted to start them out by mixing this with their favorite (usual) snack one evening. They showed some typical hesitation, but picked at it for a minute or two. We left it out all night and were pleased to see it had all been eaten by the next morning, warranting a try without mixing. Long story short: They ate it without issue after the initial test.Although we’d love to credit the high (42%) protein and grain and gluten free ingredients chock full of vitamins and omega-3 and -6 fatty acids, probably more than anything else, the small piece size and good texture attracted them and convinced them to stick around and eat it. We like that it comes in a convenient package and is priced competitively, and it also has a number of other flavors, which we plan to try out. For just being good enough to get consumed, but not particularly aggressively “liked”, we’d normally call it a five star cat food, but with the psychedelic, holograph laden package and multiple flavor options, we decided this is actually worthy of a full five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S0V132IA8XC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PAV2CDM#wasThisHelpful","R2S0V132IA8XC7","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m a pretty regular drinker and I indulge in a cocktail or two most every weekend. I’ve tried varied and assorted mixers in the past, but I often just stick with homemade. Still this product promised a good cocktail with not much fuss, so I gave it a try.The size is just right to make one drink. For this bloody Mary mix, you just add one ounce of vodka and you’ve got a tasty, smooth drink. This mix is spicy enough that you won’t need to add any hot sauce, unless you really want to burn it up with your drink. The consistency was perfect and that taste was really good. Like the copy and the label says, you can leave the alcohol out for a virgin drink, and the taste really is good enough to enjoy as is. Honestly, I was really surprised at how good this is.These single serving cans are easy to use and full of great taste, and if you have them on hand, you’re always just a shot of booze away from a tasty drink.

"Before taking this product, I did review the “vegetarian” product ingredients beforehand, and suspected that what I was looking at was a bloated belly of fiber that would make me less hungry. What I was not expecting was a high (and low) colonic of such intensity that I thought about calling my doctor and seeing if he wanted to go ahead and schedule a colonoscopy to coincide with me taking this product. Here’s the poop:After taking the first dose of morning pills, I drove to work. Shortly after sitting at my desk, I felt a rumbling. I spent the next thirty minutes not working (in the rest room). When I finally felt well enough to return to my desk, I was dizzy and vaguely nauseous. That was when I decided to check out some of the other reviews of this product on  Amazon. (Yes, boss, sorry. Still not working.)As a rule, I do not read other product reviews before at least composing, if not posting my own, but I wanted to know if my distress was a case of bad luck and happenstance, or if I had jumped into something I shouldn’t have. By now, you know the answer. In fact, I’ve never seen a product on Amazon with so many terrible reviews. I almost didn’t want to pile on.Then (speaking of piling on) I had to run to the rest room again. This is a horrible product that I wish I’d never put in my body. I stopped the “regimen” after one dose, thankfully living to tell the tale.If you have an iron stomach and need to drop a few pounds to fit in a tuxedo at a friend’s wedding or want to impress your former classmates at a reunion or something, this will definitely help you drop a few pounds in a few days.

"If you have an air conditioner that uses a remote control for normal operation, this Tado unit can take it over for you. Then, using the phone app, you have enhanced control of your air conditioner, including programmability and operation from outside the home. The app installs quite easily and the operation of the unit is straightforward. You will have to experiment a little bit to figure out all the operations, because the included manual is sketchy and not very thorough. Also, the icons on the unit itself are quite wonky and unintuitive, so you’ll have to keep the manual handy until you figure out what everything means.To be honest, though, as good as this product is, I’m just not sure how useful it is. I think a programmable thermostat is more than adequate for HVAC operation, and it provides other advantages like a clean, unobtrusive install and sleeker look. If you have a standalone AC unit and no thermostat, then this is probably a great thing to have and certainly would rate five stars. Nonetheless, as good a product as it is, I have to question its utility, which is why I rate it at four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D4Z0LUGELI8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010ACFKNE#wasThisHelpful","R3D4Z0LUGELI8Q","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The makers of this package of silicon freezing devices offered me a sample in exchange for an honest review, and while it has been years since I ate, much less made, a popsicle, I agreed to try out their products, mainly for the round ice cube making tray. I enjoy a cocktail or two now and again, and I’m always looking for ways to make my concoctions a little more interesting. So I gave it a whirl.These ice molds are very well constructed. I like the swirl pattern of the popsicle molds, but I’m glad they made the round ice cube tray look a little more subdued and “adult”. Using these products is about as straightforward as it gets: fill them up, freeze them, pop out your ice cube or frozen snack. The cone shaped popsicles were fine, but the round ice cubes are what I really want to focus on. As you can imagine, this tray is just a little tricky to use. I requires patience to fill and the final shape is highly unlikely to be completely round, due to the fill hole and seepage at the seams. But, when you pour your libation over the cubes in the glass, the protrusions melt off quite quickly, leaving you with nice, partially clear, round cubes. (I’m told distilled or filtered water would result in clearer cubes, but that makes filling the tray a little harder, due to the small fill holes.) Because the cubes  are larger than average, they also keep your drink cold for a while without diluting it too much. I have to confess to have experienced beginner’s luck, as my first batch of round cubes was the best, but since then, I’ve had difficulty duplicating the feat. Still, just getting pretty close still makes for an attractive way to keep your drink cold. The mold set also comes with a collapsible funnel, an interesting little contrivance that isn’t completely useless, but not something I have a lot of use for anyway.All in all these are very nice molds. I’m not sure if they could be designed better to be a little easier to use, but they are attractive, fun, and I will get a lot of use out of the round ice cube mold, so I think these are definitely worth five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14MCQXIJ2TM36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014OEYYCM#wasThisHelpful","R14MCQXIJ2TM36","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I guess marketers have figured out that by putting a small ‘i’ in front of the name of an electronic device, they can make everybody think it is something special and sell a bunch more of them. Although we have a scale that is somewhat sporadic and were looking to replace it, this thing turned out to be not much better, despite a huge price gap. The iPhone app is a complete non-starter, and “sorta, kinda” worked, but not really.What I’m sure its manufacturer considers its biggest advantage is absolutely this scale’s biggest disadvantage, and that is the setup through the craplet. You have to scan QR codes, connect to wi-fi, get everything talking to each other, then you have to download another, updated app (which the manufacturer apologizes for the inconvenience). So I followed the instructions and set up myself, weighed myself, stored my data, voila. Great. Now let’s try the missus. Well, you have to set up a completely different user account, which will cause you to lose the first setup, which means rescanning QR codes, and doing everything from scratch. Try to add yourself back in: oops! That doesn’t work. Try to delete an account to eliminate the confusion: oops! That’s not possible. Check the manual for how it might be possible: oops! That’s not in the manual.In fact, there are no instructions for using the app with the scale ANYWHERE. As in NOWHERE! Download data, connect other devices, add users, delete users, calibrate the scale (which it needs), none of the information is available anywhere, even if you read eight languages fluently. Pitiful.Almost forgot: There is a way to get the scale to tell you the temperature and humidity of the room, and that is carefully explained. (Hooray!) How that will help you lose weight or track your health is anybody’s guess.My wife hates our other scale because it sometimes gets off by a pound or two after moving it or getting a few drops of water on it, but it was only about $40 and it eventually rights itself. This one, I can’t even get it to tell me if it is sure who it is weighing. I congratulate iHealth on designing a superlative scale. When they actually implement it with usable hardware and intelligent software, I hope they will give me another one to try.

"The missus and I both tried this hair product, me when I was getting out of control between relatively short-hair haircuts, and she as a normal everyday hair care product for her shoulder length hair. The label indicates two uses. One is for adding “youth” and shine to damp hair, which you style as usual after applying to wet, washed hair. The other is as a touch up to dry hair that is losing its vitality as the day wears on.For the damp hair application, it seemed to work pretty well. The product smells nice and hair was easy to style and (I’ll say) fresh looking. I think one would definitely want to use some active drying and styling with this, as I believe there is some danger of hair looking greasy and flat if you don’t. I say that because as a touch up to dry hair, that’s really what it does. Sure, it brings the frizz of the stray curl under control, but it does it by making hair wet-looking and heavy. Users will have to experiment with which level of each application they are comfortable with.This is an above average post-shampoo styling aid, and a more-or-less average touch up cream, but it smells good and is priced very economically. For all that, we think four stars is a fair rating for this Tresemme hair lotion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NRFFFM6S35DK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PATJRNW#wasThisHelpful","R3NRFFFM6S35DK","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"L’Oreal Paris is one of my wife’s favorite brand for inexpensive but effective skin and hair care products. She’s been quite satisfied with their Youth Code product line, but even with summer ending and the UV index is getting lower, she said she wanted to try this product because protecting her skin from harmful UV rays is one of her biggest concerns for her aging and sensitive skin. Here’s what she thought:When I saw this RevitaLift Triple Power™ Day Lotion Moisturizer SPF 20, although an SPF 20 factor seems to be a little low, I saw some information on WebMD that said an SPF 15 product blocks about 94% of UVB rays, while an SPF 30 product blocks 97% of UVB rays. After that, the numbers take on less and less meaning and it just gets silly, but I felt SPF 20 was a sufficiently high protection factor. This moisturizer has nice fragrance, and is very light in texture. It was not greasy at all and it didn’t cause me any distress, discomfort, or any breakouts on my skin. Best of all, I can tell the result that the manufacture promises, which is vital and younger looking, healthy skin. After using this for more than three weeks, my skin looks brighter and smoother.I had no doubt this product would work well, and I was proven right.

"This product is mainly for curly hair, but my wife and I both tried it on our relatively straight hair.

"Every time I write cat food reviews, I explain how our two Persian cats are really finicky eaters. To be more specific, golden chinchilla will eat human food at the tables (everything from roast chicken, turkey, sashimi tuna and salmon, to roast beef and even goat cheese) is not nearly as finicky as the Himalayan, who never eats human food and sticks only to high quality cat food. One thing the two cats have in common is they hate to be served the same food (flavor) every day. We try to accommodate their demands, and since we have had some success with other Nutro products in the past, we had pretty high hopes for the multi-pack sliced version of this high protein, grain free, real meat product, three important factors we look for in high quality cat food.The verdict on this is above average. The first flavor (Sliced Chicken & Tuna Entree) was a hit with both cats. The golden chinchilla even ate the food on the floor, which was scattered while eating. We were quite surprised to see him doing this, because he never does this with other wet food. The next day, when they were served the second flavor (Sliced Turkey Entree), the chinchilla ate some without passion, but the Himalayan was immediately turned off. He strode away and defiantly sat twenty feet away from the food bowls until after dinner snacks were brought out. On the third day, the third flavor (Sliced Salmon Entree) was much the same story as the second day, with the Himalayan begging (demanding) to be served something else, walking around and meowing loudly. On the fourth day, we went back to the first flavor both cats ate and both of them ate in the same fashion as if they were programed that way.Besides one cat’s positive acceptance of this food, another advantage is that with three different flavors, it makes it easy for us to rotate these in with some of their other favorites, such as Fancy Feast Appetizers (now called Purely Fancy Feast) and Simply Nourish.The smaller 3-oz size of the can is good, as neither of our cats are big eaters. This allows us to keep too much from going to waste. Because each can has the similar design and color and the text on the side is quite small, however, it’s rather hard to tell the difference between each flavor and actually, all three flavors look the same.

It would be nice if Nutro sold this sliced version of product in the “perfect portions” package like they do with the soft loaf version of their product. Still, all said and done, this is more of a pleaser than a failure, so we rate it at four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX1HMC4LCLOHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WEIQ0AU#wasThisHelpful","RX1HMC4LCLOHW","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oddly enough, at about the time I received this wireless TRENDnet adapter, I also received a TRENDnet wireless PTZ camera. Unfortunately, the camera was so hard to install that the installation ended after two frustrated hours with not even being able to get the camera working. As hard as the camera setup was, that’s how easy this upgrader/adapter setup was.To install this upgrader, all you do is, plug it into a power outlet, then plug it into a port on your existing router. Instantaneously, you have a wireless AC network where before you only had whatever your other router had. I used ours on a Mac Airport router and I had no issues. It just worked easily and intuitively. I can’t tell what kind of throughput and bandwidth it provides, but I imagine it is only limited by the specifications of the host router. It’s nice, too, that the device is very small and unobtrusive. It can easily be hid somewhere, or just stacked on top of the router being upgraded.Whatever, this provides a great solution for a better, stronger network with AC level capabilities for people who already have a working wireless network that they don’t want to dismantle just to upgrade. Get this simple to install, highly effective five star upgrader, and take the rest of the afternoon to relax and rest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ7RLBUCPVKBP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MPDPFMI#wasThisHelpful","RQ7RLBUCPVKBP","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, it will soon be 2016 and you own a smart phone, a tablet, and a netbook, all with calendars, all synched, and all with more notifications and features than you even know how to use. You couldn’t possibly need a spiral bound daily planner made of paper, could you? Well, maybe. Maybe you are of a certain age, like me, that the paper format is just more familiar and “comfortable”. Or maybe you want something you can keep open and out on your desk for quick easy reference, without running down the battery of a device or having to find it and boot up an app to get to. Or maybe you’re like me and you have an alternative use for this planner. Whatever the case, if you are going to get a bound daily planner of paper, you’re going to want one that is nice looking, functional, easy to use, with generous space for notes, appointments and everything that threatens to clutter your busy life. That is why you need to consider something like this At-A-Glance weekly planner.Right off the bat, probably the single best feature is the tabbed pages for each individual month. This allows quick and ready access, even though the planner has a generous number of pages. I like that it includes a monthly spread for a general overview, but when you get to the individual week pages, you have a full quarter page for each day to write down a either a chock full schedule, or plenty of notes and reminders. That also leaves another quarter of a page for general notes not specific to any day. I happen to be planning (sorry) to use hits as a piano practice notebook, as I am now working on my music without an instructor, so I need to be able to guide myself and my musical work. This allows me to plan specific things on specific days, and then I can make adjustments as I go, or just note what I did or did not work on. Then I compare day to day and week to week results and make even further adjustments. It’s intuitive and easy. I’ve already begun filling in my regimen for next year, as I loosely test various programs this year. It may not singlehandedly make me a virtuoso pianist, but at least it gives my practice routine some direction and structure.Going back to the more traditional use of a scheduler-slash-planner, this has a holiday calendar through 2019, which is handy, plus a time zone chart and a few extra pages for notes. The light gray cover has the look of heavy paper, but seems to be some kind of plasticized material, which means it should be quite durable and travel well. (This will come in handy if I decide to go back to a music instructor for lessons.) The spiral binding means the whole thing will lay flat, or you can even fold it over and carry in one hand with the pages open.This is just a really nice looking, easy to use, well-thought out planner. You may want to rely on some electronic device instead of an old school notebook style planner, but if you are old school or just plain imaginative in the use of a typical daily planner, then this five star planner is definitely the one you want.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLEZJ7MRH2GAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWYIXYW#wasThisHelpful","RLEZJ7MRH2GAY","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TRENDnet makes some great electronic products, and I’ve been very happy with some of their other products, most recently a wireless router adapter. Also, although I may not be the savviest person when it comes to setting up electronic gear, I’m pretty close to advanced, as I have set up everything wireless from printers and scanners, to cameras (D-link), light bulbs, thermostats, and of course routers and adapters. I say all this because I am about to tell a story of completely failing to install this camera.I thought that installing this camera would be quite straightforward and quick, and so I timed my set up effort, expecting to be able to say something like, “I had it up and running in about 20 minutes”, but that was simply not the case. In fact, after two hours of installing, uninstalling, re-installing, wireless set up, wired set up, and everything I could think to do, and although I confirmed the camera was working (see below), I couldn’t get a picture on my computer or my phone. Of course, without working software, I also had no way to control the camera, making it essentially useless.I followed the not-always-completely-clear-or-helpful instructions for wireless set up using WPS. My expensive new D-link AC router knew what to do after I pushed the WPS button, but the camera failed to find the network on the first try. It succeeded on the second try. As soon as the camera came on, the audio function conflicted with my computer’s Bose sound system, creating a huge bass hum that shook the floor. I had to turn off the sound system. Inside the set up app, I could see what the camera saw, so things were looking good, but every attempt to set up the browser software failed at the plug-in stage. I tried three different browsers and all failed. No worries, because I have an iPhone. I installed the TrendNet app on the phone, filled in the fields and away we went … to an error screen. Authentication failed. This was probably because it asked for an ID, but the software didn’t provide a way to input a new ID during the setup process. So, redo. Same thing. Authentication failed. I plugged up everything with wires and tried again. Same result with all browsers failing to install the plug-in. I searched for some solutions online, but best I could determine, this camera is just tough to set up and it is unclear if it is compatible with Windows 10. I read through some of the troubleshooting docs on the CDI don’t know if Windows 10 is the culprit or something else. It could also be some browser incompatibility, but that doesn’t explain the problem with the phone app. The inability to get the phone app working is just a mystery. In the end, I unplugged everything, uninstalled all the software and apps, and put everything back in the box. We may at some point try to install this on our older Mac, but for now, this camera just failed, on every level except the in app set up on the computer. I think giving it two stars is more than generous for a device that was impossible to set up, completely and correctly, through no fault of my own.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SB6LIYCMMHD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HPR7UEK#wasThisHelpful","R1SB6LIYCMMHD5","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last fall, Tony Bennett released a fantastic vocal jazz record together with Lady Gaga, Cheek to Cheek (Deluxe). In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Lady Gaga said that she loved working with Tony Bennett, loved jazz, and that she planned to record “one jazz record a year, forever”. One year to the day later, Lady Gaga’s next jazz album is nowhere in sight. Instead, we have Tony Bennett, the octogenarian king of jazz, who basically reinvented the concept of the duet with his two duets albums, stretched that work with a pop diva, and now, much in the mold of his inimitable work with Bill Evans many years ago, we find him paired with one of today’s premier jazz pianists, Bill Charlap. And, as Tony has become one of the defining masters of the American songbook, he stays close to home by taking on a number of standards by Jerome Kern. The result is an eminently listenable, fascinating jazz record.One big difference between this Bennett-Charlap recording and the Bennett-Evans recordings is that this time, they went ahead and used a full rhythm section on a number of the songs. With Peter Washington on bass and Kenny Washington on drums, the sound has more of a club atmosphere and less of the intimacy of the pure duets with Evans. Another difference is Bill calls in his life partner and fellow jazz pianist Renee Rosnes to do some fabulous piano duet work on four of the tunes. (As a jazz pianist, those tunes really stood out for me.) Throughout, the solos of Charlap tend to be more evenly constructed and hone closer to the original songs, especially so as each song is kept (for the most part) close to or under the classic three minutes twenty seconds time frame. The selection of songs is solid and includes all the “standard” standards: Yesterdays, All the Things You Are, The Song is You, and even I Won’t Dance, which Tony may have done simply because it was still fresh in his repertoire from last year’s Lady Gaga recording.Tony sounds great, and the recording is very clean. (It was produced by Tony’s son, Dae Bennett and Bill Charlap, with another son, Danny Bennett, as executive producer.) Charlap is absolutely on top of his game here, carrying each tune along until it’s time to solo, cleverly breaking and shifting the solo while keeping the feel, then throwing it underhand back to Tony so Bennett can knock it out to the finish. It’s a formula that Tony has stuck with for five decades, and I personally am glad that he decided to not try and change it up. The CD booklet includes full liner notes and a nice background essay/exposition by WSJ columnist and jazz writer Will Friedwald. There are plenty of calm photos and a portrait of Jerome Kern to fill out the booklet.I don’t know how much longer Tony is going to be with us, but I hope it’s a long time and I hope he keeps singing, because treasures like this five star vocal jazz album are few and far between. Maybe he will do like Ella did with Norman Granz and work through some of the songbooks of some of the other great American composers. And if he keeps Charlap, his trio and Rosnes along for the ride, there will be lots more great music to come.I’ll also keep my eyes open for that next Lady Gaga record, while I’m monitoring the airwaves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11WEHI76BU6CV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013YKOVL6#wasThisHelpful","R11WEHI76BU6CV","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you’ve been thinking of picking up a sporting pair of comfortable, sharp trousers for casual wear around town, but you haven’t enough quid to sashay down to Saville Row for a bespoke number, you’re going to want to look seriously at ringing up a pair of these British khaki twill trousers from Wrangler. Until recently, I hadn’t even owned a pair of Wranglers, but after falling in love with Wrangler Men's Authentics Classic Carpenter Jean, Retro Stone, 36W x 30L, and then also a pair of Wrangler Men's Authentics Premium Relaxed Boot Cut Jean, Blue/Black Stretch, 36W x 32L. I’ve become a big fan of Wrangler’s pants.Ah, beg your pardon. Trousers.Although these may not be fancy enough for tea and scones at The Ritz, their fine weave twill looks refined and classic. The fit is very comfortable, and the cut is natural and falls neatly over my 179 centimeter, 14-stone-eight body. You probably will want something sturdier and more casual if you’re going to work under the bonnet of your lorry, but for a night of pub crawling or some fish and chips with your lass in the park, these strike a perfect balance of sophistication, fun, and fashion. Because they are carpenter pants, they also give you some options for hauling stuff around town, like the generous front or side closure pockets big enough for an oversize cellular. Peoples' eyes will open like the doors of a lift as you stroll in your twill with confidence and panache.My wardrobe has stepped up several levels with the addition of these Wrangler trousers. My wife even suggested taking her out a few nights, just to be seen in my new finery. (That usually only happens when she buys them for me.) So British or American or something else, get yourself a pair of these khaki pants/slacks/trousers. You’re sure to look like a proper gentleman wherever you go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39BY9HCIJIJJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKYNDNO#wasThisHelpful","R39BY9HCIJIJJ8","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a couple of features that make this a handy little item. First are the, not one, but two USB slots for charging. I can’t begin to count the number of road trips I’ve taken with the missus where we had to switch out phones and charging devices based on whose battery was lowest and what the phone was being used for (music, communication, GPS). Now, either or both of us can plug in anytime we want.Second is the hands free earbud phone headset. It comes with four sizes of silicone (?) plugs and uses a magnet to hold it in the housing of the charger. I’m not busy enough that I need to take advantage of this Bluetooth phone extender, but I can see where it would be useful for some power-user-slash-road-warrior. The whole thing just plugs into your cigarette lighter on the dash and you are ready to phone or charge for as long as your car is running. I like the polished sophisticated look, especially of the modernistic headset. It won’t look out of place in a rundown Pontiac or a sleek new BMW.I would like to add as the third feature the oxygen bar. I say “I would like to…” because I can’t really add it, as I haven’t a clue what it is. The manual hints at it being some kind of ionizer, but in my small cabin car (yes, a Pontiac, a Vibe no less), I couldn’t tell any difference in air quality, oxygen level, or anything. It’s a mystery function.One more plus is the intuitive use of the device, which like most Bluetooth devices, involves turning on devices, searching for devices, and pairing them up. I read through the manual, and while I knew what they were trying to say, the Chinese translators sure seem to have had a bit of a struggle. Fortunately, I read through to the end where they talk about avoiding heat, oil depots, and magnets due to the threat of explosion. That section cracked me up.Wait! Is this thing going to explode? Glad I’m not putting it in MY ear!In the end, this device definitely has some utility for me, just because of the double USB charger ports. The oxygen bar is a non-starter, and the threat of explosion is unsettling, but I don’t mind living dangerously if there is some convenience involved. For solving a first world problem and giving me some laughs, but because of the trepidation, I give it an average rating of three stars.Note: I received this as a free sample in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AN90ARARK3Z9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZTBU1Y0#wasThisHelpful","R1AN90ARARK3Z9","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first experience with zinc supplements was when I was much younger and used it to help with my inflamed teenage acne. I continued to use it into my college years when I took up (don’t laugh) body building. So, it had been over thirty years since I had taken zinc as a supplement when Pacific Coast contacted me to offer a sample in exchange for a review. I’ve had a lot of success with some of Pacific Coast’s other supplements and I had nothing to lose, so I decided to try zinc again.A quick look on the web will tell you that while zinc has a lot purported benefits, most of these are not well supported by scientific facts. There is, however, plenty of evidence of the ill effects of zinc deficiency, which leads me to believe that as long as there is no harm in taking zinc as a supplement, it might not be a bad idea. I say all this because, while taking the zinc, I did not notice any tangible benefits or effects. I am physically active, in pretty good health, and I take a few different supplements and vitamins that are generally recommended for a male in my demographic, so I would probably notice it if there was some effect. Nonetheless, I didn’t feel any different taking the zinc.Pacific Coast is a high quality, reliable manufacturer of a number of different supplements, so despite my lackluster results with this supplement, I still feel like it is a quality product. I especially like that PC provides a brief e-book so users can learn about the supplement and use it correctly. As with any supplement, it is recommended that you talk with a health professional before taking this product if you are being treated for a chronic illness or condition. Everybody, and every body, is different, so results may vary, but for being a good product that did no harm and possibly has some benefits, I give this four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13NJC8581ZZ19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SJOI88U#wasThisHelpful","R13NJC8581ZZ19","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After getting a pair of Wrangler Men's Authentics Classic Carpenter Jean, Retro Stone, 36W x 30L, I more or less fell in love with Wrangler pants. When I saw these, I immediately wanted them, both for their good looks (I love that semi-faded look), but also for their stretchability. These also look sharp enough to wear for a night out on the town if you have a quality T-shirt and a nice sport coat.When they arrived, I found they were everything I thought they would be, and more. The color is fantastic, with the base being more or less a hyper-dark blue that fades to black, but lightens to a light tan at the wear points. If anything, they look much better in person than they do in the picture. The fit is more or less perfect, as is the length. Having recently learned the proper way to wash jeans (like delicates, and inside out, line dry), these really maintain their fit and look well. My only problem is I work in a factory where spills and splashes are pretty much inevitable, and sometimes, you can even rub up against equipment the wrong way and tear your clothes. So not wanting to take a chance on losing them, I can’t wear them nearly as much as I would like.Honestly, prior to getting the carpenter pants, it had been something like 35 years since I had worn Wrangler, but now, I’m a major Wrangler fan. Their pants are just terrific and if I could quit my job so I could wear them more often, I would. That is reason enough to give them five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHBINMR3TU58D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKY4VWG#wasThisHelpful","RHBINMR3TU58D","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was pleasantly surprised with this piece of jewelry, because sometimes when I see pictures of accessories on Amazon, they look a little lame, but I have a tendency to think they will look better in person than the photograph. Then when it shows up on my doorstep and looks just like the picture (or smaller, or duller), I’m disappointed. This one actually looks pretty good in its photo, but really does look much nicer in person.One big plus is its size. It isn’t huge, but it does have some heft to it, with the winding band portion being thick but not overbearing. The accent diamonds are set on a portion of the symbol that is sort of frosted to contrast with the polished look of the rest of the piece. The chain is a basic 18” silver that conveys the beauty of the piece without distracting attention away from it. It provides a nice accent. The piece comes in a solid black box that suggests elegance and sophistication. Inside and out, and out and about, my wife enjoyed this piece.It’s a great piece of jewelry and I like the theme, as it suggests a number of possibilities and uses (infinite love, infinity and beyond, etc. etc.).

"Like most adults who had acne growing up, I’m prone to the occasional stray pimple or two. Stress, breaks from a healthy diet, general ill health, and even environmental factors such as heat and sun can cause a temporary breakout. So I keep a few tried and true remedies on hand, and was glad to have the opportunity to see how Benzac works.Because this is a mask, it takes a little time to use. You put this on your face like a normal mask and in a couple of minutes, it dries, This one is kind of aggressive going on, but I like the feel of it doing something as opposed to just being soapy or greasy. It rinsed clean and while my skin didn’t look noticeably different, the one pimple I had on my jawline appeared to be reduced in size and was definitely less red after my face had dried. On another occasion, I applied this before bed and when I woke up, a pimple had vanished completely. That was quite impressive.I wouldn’t use this on a regular basis, but as a spot treatment of a breakout or as a weekly rejuvenation for the face and pores, I think it will work fine.

"I’ve had great success with Epson products in the past, especially their WorkForce series of scanners and printers. When our main meeting room project started acting up, this seemed well-timed to fill the gap, so I decided to try it out.Out of the box, this projector really is light. It isn’t compact by any means, but it is still easy to carry around. Despite offering a wide range of hook ups, from HDMI to USB, it comes only with an outmoded VGA cable. Since my computer only has one VGA connector and I didn’t want to fool around with it, I opted to try the USB connection. I did so with some trepidation, as the quick set up guide indicated some software would have to be installed. So, I started timing and what do you know? The software was downloaded, the connection made and my projector was on and displaying my desktop in just under four minutes. That made me happy.Looking at the screen, I have to say that the picture is super clear and the colors are bright and vibrant. (See photo. Apologies for the reflections - it's a makeshift screen.) Once I had everything focused and aligned, I could tell the picture was at least as good. If not better than my 1080p HD monitor. I played around with a few different screens, and they all looked good to me. I like the one switch for orienting the grade of the picture from left to right, as we often have to do makeshift meetings and displays on the factory floor or break room. It’s nice that the projector compensates for that so you don’t have to mess with the big screen. It also has a standard one point height adjustment and amazingly, does not require a cool down period before you can move it or pack it up. (It still gets pretty warm, though.)If this projector came with all the cables necessary to make whatever connection you wanted (or needed) at any given moment, I’d have absolutely nothing to complain about. The device is well-made, solidly built, and has great optics that are easy to adjust. It’s very portable and the remote can be made to do things on both your computer (move the cursor, etc.) and the projector to make it even easier to use to give masterful presentations. The picture is projects is crystal clear at any size and can be adjusted on the fly. Set up is fast and easy. The more I think about, the more I think I’ll just give this five stars and say, if you need to make a connection other than VGA, buy that cable when you buy this projector. You won’t go wrong.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGJF55R88EX9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0119FYPD2#wasThisHelpful","RGJF55R88EX9A","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My notion about Ahava is, they make great skin care products. My wife and I recently tried out the AHAVA Dead Sea Mud Dermud Intensive Foot Cream, 3.4 fl. oz. and were amazed to find out how effective it was at rescuing dry cracked foot skin. This German manufacturer of skin care products is all about the ingredients, and this particular moisturizer contains Osmoter (a perfectly balanced concentrate of Dead Sea minerals that effective replenishes, rehydrates and recharges the skin) and witch hazel (powerful antioxidant ingredient to smooth skin, help minimize pores and rebalance skin). For those who want to be in the know, the full list of ingredients is at the bottom of this review.Since I don’t really use facial moisturizers, but my wife does multiple times a day, I deferred to her experience. She has sensitive combination skin and is always changing up her skin care products. She started to use this at night even though it says “Day” moisturizer, because she wasn’t sure if it would irritate or cause day long oily skin by wearing it in the morning. Ahava passed her evening test without irritating her skin and with the right amount of hydrating without oiliness So, she started applying it in the morning. It is not a regular product in her skin care regimen.The best thing about this product is there are options to try a mini size (0.51 fl oz / 15 ml) to see if this works for you or a full size (1.7 fl oz / 50 ml) if you know it’s what you want. At the time of this review, however, buying 4 of the mini (total of 2.04 fl oz / 60 ml) is less expensive than the full size. Unless the price of the full size becomes less expensive, we’ll continue to purchase the mini so that not only can my wife always have fresh tube, but this makes a perfect travel size solution.

"Recently, after stopping music lessons in favor or working by myself to learn music for a little while, I discovered a book called Practiceopedia: The Music Student's Illustrated Guide to Practicing. It’s an almost four hundred page book of music practice ideas and strategies, and although it is written more with school age students in mind, it was very helpful in giving me plenty of new ideas and practice “tricks” to get back at the piano. Unfortunately, it wasn’t really helping my musicality. Just as I was finishing that book, the author of Sound Origins contacted me to offer me a free copy of his book in exchange for a review. The timing couldn’t have been better, so of course, I agreed.Mr. Robitaille is a noted musical scholar and accomplished musician. In addition to performing with a plethora of jazz musicians, he’s also a teacher and composer. This book, however, is not about improving your chops or giving you a pep talk. Instead, he covers, in a very personal way, what it means to make music. He explores music making by delving into the thought process of music itself: what we mean when we say “music”, how we can expand our musical thinking, and how our life experience and the world around us can influence (and I presume, improve) our music. Not to oversimplify what the author says, but I took it to mean that it’s about harnessing the forces and energy in the universe that make music, rather than about beating a song out of a Steinway or Les Paul.Some ways a musician might do this is by exploring other art forms: poetry, painting, conversation, even science fiction and random noise. All these can become driving influences in the creation and composition of music. There’s also a rundown of the elements of music, from touch and timbre, to articulation and expression, where a full understanding of the individual element makes its execution that much more meaningful and impactful on one’s music and the process of making music. Those sections certainly bring a tangible feel and recognizable force to the music making process.If there is any weakness in this book, it is that it is too short. Often the author makes an intriguing suggestion or points out another aspect of a musical concept, only to leave it to the reader to determine its ultimate use and impact. Although I’m glad to have had the thought-inducing starting points given to me, I would have welcomed the author to more purposefully discuss and expound on those ideas. I had the feeling that the author has more ideas to share, and I think those would have made the book more interesting.The electronic version of the book that I received had several examples of songs with the sheet music in the book. (The book assumes readers possess a certain level of musical ability.) This did a lot to emphasize and illustrate some of the points the author made. This is an easy read, and although it is a short book, I believe any serious musician will take away something of value from this book. Especially if you find yourself where I did, wanting to make music but having “forgotten” how to even be musical, Sound Origins is a great place to start over from. Because of its short length and narrow subject matter, I can’t rate it at a full five stars, but this is worth every bit of four stars, simply for providing the musical mind jog that it does. I commend Mr. Robitaille on his insight and effort to put such difficult subject matter into words.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VHAUDKHA0U2B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692492437#wasThisHelpful","R3VHAUDKHA0U2B","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the longest time, I needed, but did not have a vise. Then I ransacked my father’s tools (don’t worry; he can’t use them anymore) and found a small Craftsman vise that I used growing up, and have been getting by with that. Then Yost came along and well, I wondered how I got along without it.This vise is huge. (See photos for how it dwarfs my Craftsman vise.) It weighs almost 50 pounds and comes with a base plate that allows it to swivel. It looks great right out of the box and after mounting, it works great, too. It can hold anything you can imagine needing holding, including pipes up to three inches in diameter. If you have a proper work bench and properly mount it (more on that in a moment), it’s hard to think of what it couldn’t hold. I like the powder blue finish, which is easy on the eyes and looks “professional”. Operation was smooth and straightforward: Turn the handle counterclockwise to loosen, clockwise to tighten. I worked on a few pieces of wood that needed cutting for a pathway in a flowerbed. It held securely without slippage, making fast work of my project.Disappointingly, they did not include screws or bolts for mounting. Presumably, they figured too many handymen would have too many workbench configurations for a “one size fits all” approach with the mounting screws. Yost also recommends under-mounting a 18” square, 2” thick piece of wood, or a quarter inch steel plate. It all sounds like overkill to me, as I used oversized wood screws from an antique piano project gone bad to mount to a fiberboard table and experienced no problems. Note, however, that I’m just a DIY’er and I wouldn’t expect that sort of mount to last for a heavy duty user, or even for a long time.The vise itself, with the surface anvils, cast construction, powder coat, swivel mount plate, and everything else is quite amazing. For someone like me, it’s really over the top, which makes me believe just about any serious handyman, mechanic, carpenter, weekend warrior would love this thing. I thought about deducting a star for the lack of mounting screws, but I decided that wasn’t actually a disadvantage for the majority of users (I mean, people who are going to buy this surely have a few screws lying around – even I did), so I stuck with a five star rating. As the title says, you get the most with Yost!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ66I6NAMF6F0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YS405Z4#wasThisHelpful","RQ66I6NAMF6F0","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After overexerting myself running one morning, sort of testing my limits, my bum knee was bummer than usual and I had sore muscles twinging in both my lower and upper back from compensating for the knee. Normally, three ibuprofen tablets would be my remedy, and normally, I would notice some relief after 30 minutes to an hour. I figured this was a perfectly controlled opportunity to test Goody’s Back and Body Shot.So I took a gulp. If it hadn’t been for the twinge in my back keeping me from straightening up too fast, I would have spewed this halfway across the room. Seriously, this is some horrible, vile stuff. In the interest of science (okay, this review), I slugged back the rest in two more agonizing, battery acid flavored Kool-Aid, gulps. The Japanese have a saying that “The bitterest medicine is the best remedy.” If that is the case, then Goody’s should probably be able to cure cancer, tuberculosis, measles, and malaria. At least I had hope as I washed out my mouth with soda to revive my chemically burned taste buds.Alas, it was not to be. After 30 minutes, my back and knee were the same. After another thirty minutes, still no discernible improvement. Two hours? Still nothing. It seemed that I had tortured my tongue to absolutely no purpose. The back and body shot was, just plain, shot.Very rare is it for me to come across a product that I can’t find something positive to at least give it a two star review without giving my conscience a fit. But this Goody’s product is awful tasting, slow (or no) acting, and essentially ineffective against pain – back, body, knee, or otherwise. I imagine it is also pretty expensive (unavailable at this writing, so no price available), especially compared to a huge bottle of ibuprofen at Costco or Amazon that is a couple of bucks for 500 or more. Even at a competitive price point, there is nothing that would make me take this again, and so Goody’s goes to the realm of one star products.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REJ0S5O72W74W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZEMPH9S#wasThisHelpful","REJ0S5O72W74W","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To start, let me say, these are two very fine products. With Perky Pet bird feeders, you never know if you’re going to get a “beta” design that doesn’t work quite proper and the birds don’t like it, or if you’re going to get the National Geographic approved, “flocks will migrate to the thing” bird feeder. This is definitely the latter. It’s big, easy to use, holds a ton (well, over two pounds) of black sunflower seed, sets up in less than a minute – just hang it up and fill it – and it looks great. The birds have already integrated this into their feeding routine. (We have a number of different feeders already set up, and this one is pretty much already getting equal time. Check the photo and notice the little bird, left on the cardinal feeder, taken about five minutes after filling it up.)The spinner is just cool. It ships flat and you simply fold out the metal spines and you have a really eye-catching, optical illusion like decoration. It, too, takes just a minute or two to set up, and you’re spinning in no time. I’m not sure if this isn’t a distraction for the birds, however, I doubt it acts as any kind of attractant. I don’t think the birds see it, and go “Hey! Look at those two dimensional half-sized cardinals over there! Let’s go eat!” I put ours up well away from the feeders, just because I prefer natural birds over fake ones, but still, we love the look of the spinner. I just don’t think a sparkling, moving mobile thing, even in a bird motif, is an obvious pairing with a bird feeder.One other confusing thing: both these items ship completely flat, but they were shipped together in an absolutely oversized box that probably could have held a dozen of each of them, with that space taken up by wads of butcher paper. (Which reminds me: if anybody needs 125 square yards of wrinkled butcher paper, let me know.) Surely, with all the stuff Amazon ships, there had to be a more economical box somewhere.The products themselves are close to or exceeding my expectations overall, I just remain unsure of the pairing concept, and I totally don’t get the packaging, but what you end up with is two five star products and three star everything else, so I’m setting it down at four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUIO92LQNMZ4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBOXP36#wasThisHelpful","RUIO92LQNMZ4X","A3QS4WWC1LCA6H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QS4WWC1LCA6H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It took me three or four tries to get into this book, but once I got going, I found it fascinating.Omm Sety was born Dorothy Eady. She was an Englishwoman born in 1904 to relatively normal, middle class parents. When she was a child, she had an accident, and the doctor who was summoned declared her dead...which made everyone all the more surprised an hour later when she opened her eyes.The author of the book, Hanny el Zeini – an Egyptian chemist (of all things) who was a good friend of Omm Sety's and had an interest in ancient Egyptian history – even points out the obvious conclusion: that the doctor was wrong. Maybe his examination was too cursory, or maybe his stethoscope didn't work properly, or whatever. That's likely what Omm Sety's family believed, except for the fact that after her “miraculous” recovery, she turned a bit...odd. (Which I suppose is like saying the sun is a bit warm.) This very young girl was completely convinced that she could remember a temple that not only had no one she knew ever visited, but that no longer even existed except as a ruin.Anyway, thus began Omm Sety's lifelong fascination with ancient Egypt, so after spending her childhood learning from an Egyptologist friend, she married an Egyptian man, moved to Egypt, took an Egyptian name, and spent the rest of her life quite literally living the dream she had as a concussed toddler. Her unusual experiences didn't end with her childhood, either. She spent a lifetime receiving otherworldly visitors...including her long-dead Egyptian lover.I am not a mystical person. I believe in science and logic. I believe that numbers always add up the same way, and I believe in following the rules. I am agnostic, and I lean more toward  atheism than theism. I am a great lover of fantasy fiction and video games, so it's not that I don't *want* to believe in magic or ghosts or past lives, it's that I'm simply not equipped to. I'll be the first to admit that I don't know everything about this sometimes-mysterious world we inhabit, and neither do I think humanity as a whole has even scratched the surface of all there is to know...but I have to say, I'm very skeptical about all of this.And so I spent much of this book entertained but still convinced Omm Sety was off her nut. But, assuming the book doesn't contain flat-out lies, there were enough inexplicable goings on that my doubt came to the fore, and I almost convinced myself more than once that this lady really did have a window into the past. I can say this much: should future investigations prove some of her theories correct, I'll be thrilled. Which isn't to say that I'd necessarily believe she'd had a past life as a priestess, but it would go along way toward convincing me that, wherever her knowledge came from, there was more to her than met the eye.Well, regardless of whether you think she was a total crank or the reincarnated spirit of 19th Dynasty priestess Bentreshyt, she WAS incredibly knowledgeable on the subject of ancient Egypt and one cannot say she didn't put her money where her mouth was, given that she chose to live in abject poverty so as to be closer to her temple and her work. If Egypt is a subject that interests you, well...biographies on the topic really don't get more unusual or interesting than this, you know? No matter what the truth is, I'm very glad to have read it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZAUQSCHKQ2W2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0976763133#wasThisHelpful","R1ZAUQSCHKQ2W2","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Dagger in the Desk is a short story set in the Lockwood & Co. universe.The plot is pretty thin, even for a short story; The Dagger in the Desk is essentially a single mission without much in the way of build-up. The Lockwood team is retained to investigate a school that, after some renovations, is experiencing a sudden uptick in ghostly activity. (And as children are most sensitive to spirits, a school is about as bad a place for a haunting as can be!) Dagger doesn't really contain any world-building or insight into the characters, and the mystery (of what the source might be) that the other Lockwood books are built on isn't really given the room it'd need to create any tension; this is pretty much just a single action sequence.The story is listed as 46 pages, but only about 2/3 of that is the actual story; the rest of the page count is taken up by the illustrated ghost guide (which, incidentally, contains awfully little illustrations, and the guide portion doesn't have much more than the glossaries included in the full books) and preview. This was a seriously quick read. So if you're hoping for something meaty, you might be a bit disappointed. What Dagger does provide, though, is another taste of Stroud's excellent world. It's short, but it's well-written and exciting...so, four stars. While I don't think it'd be worth paying for, this story is, at the moment, free, and I'll never turn down a chance to hang out with Lucy and Lockwood and, yes, even George, even if it's just for a few minutes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F011IHZ27JPT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153PYMK0#wasThisHelpful","R2F011IHZ27JPT","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remarked on my review for the Magician's Tower, book two in this series, that I didn't care for it nearly as well as the first book. Oona aggravated me a bit, the antagonists aggravated me a bit...I loved the plot and the setting, but the irritations sucked some of the fun out of it all. And if I'm going to read a middle-grade book, being, you know, not a middle-grade person, I want it to be fun.Happily, I can say that with The Magician's Dream, we're back to a solid four stars and a thoroughly enjoyable read. The mysteries were well written, some of the overarching plot lines were resolved, and this book's specific plot – a combination of battle training for Oona, women's rights, and the investigations of the aforementioned mysteries – was probably my favorite of the three books. I was a bit nervous about possible romantic elements given the high angst quotient in book two, but what was in this one was not at all overbearing.If you haven't met Oona Crate and Deacon and Samuligan and the wizard yet, start with The Wizard of Dark Street. If you have met them, but you felt as I did about the middle book and you're wondering whether continuing is worth it, well...my opinion is that it definitely is. I have no doubt that this book, and this whole series, would delight just about any kid who happened to pick it up, but one doesn't need to be a child to enjoy it...which is, sadly, often not the case. I said it earlier, but it bears repeating: there may have been a few kinks that needed working out in earlier volumes, but overall? This series is *fun*.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B11L2WA6ISPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011PXAL2W#wasThisHelpful","R3B11L2WA6ISPX","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Much to my surprise, I was able to give the first book in the Oona Crate series four stars. (I say “much to my surprise” because, for one thing, I'm a tough critic most of the time, and for another, I'm not in the intended age bracket.) While I can't say it blew my mind, I found it highly enjoyable. Unfortunately, this one, while still pretty good, didn't make me smile quite as much.Partly, I'd guess, it's just that the bloom is off the rose, so to speak. But it's also Oona herself. I really enjoyed her character in book one, but in this one, she started to get on my nerves.Oona was introduced to us as a young girl who, though she retains enough girlishness that we don't forget that she's not an adult (the way so many authors seem to when it comes to their own YA characters!), is sensible, and logical, and practical, and highly intelligent. The combination of little girl and capable protagonist was very well done. In this one, though, she...I dunno, regresses? Her bad traits start to come out a bit more — she's headstrong, she makes foolish decisions, she allows herself to get needled by her rivals... She doesn't seem quite as mature, which makes her harder to relate to. I'd have expected Oona to apply her impressive mind to her problems. And...well, she does, but not without indulging in a bit of scowling and foot-stomping first.Another (fairly minor) irritation was the inclusion of a couple of devices that quickly grew tiresome. Isadora, Oona's main rival, has a boyfriend, and as soon as he's introduced, Isadora refers to him in conversation as “my BOYFRIEND.” All caps, just like that. I assume that it was written that way to imply bragging. Well...it does. To the point of obnoxiousness. Another bit I didn't care for was the recurring theme of “chivalry,” which didn't have as much of an impact on the plot as I'd have expected, given how often it came up. I suppose I just didn't care for these characters, and not because they're antagonists, but because they're annoying.The whole not-having-an-impact thing brings up another thing: there are couple of situations that Oona finds herself in that don't really go anywhere. I'll assume they were included to set up a plot line for book three, but it felt a bit untidy.But, I'm doing a lot of nitpicking for a book that got a respectable three stars, so I ought to make it clear that I did like it. Not as much as I liked the first book, but it wasn't bad by any means. I enjoyed the light, cheerful plot, I enjoyed most of the side characters — I love the wizard, I love Samuligan, and I really really love Deacon! — and I enjoyed the little flashes of humor. Despite my three-star rating, I've already purchased and started book three; The Magician's Tower may not have been perfect, but there's...well, a *magic* to this series that suggests I'll find myself back on Dark Street sometime down the road.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P0AZ2U7U5VKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ES1J2R4#wasThisHelpful","R2P0AZ2U7U5VKH","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Getting middle grade books makes me nervous. Every now and then, you come across a Harry Potter...but for the most part, you end up with books that, while delightful for children, don't really hold up to a worldly and discerning adult's suspicious, near-sighted eyeballs. I wasn't reassured when I saw all of the critical (or at least tepid) reviews for this first Oona Crate mystery, either — usually, I'm in the position of being harder on books than other reviewers, so when a lot of people dislike something, I generally take that as a sign and keep walking.I'm not sure why I didn't this time, to be honest. Maybe it was my mood; don't you, every now and then, just crave something simple and uncomplicated, something that's not going to make you *feel* too much? Maybe a desire along those lines subconsciously pulled me in. Or, I suppose it could've been most excellent cover, too. Or, maybe I was just riding high on my discovery of Jonathan Stroud's Lockwood & Co. series and wanted to keep the winning streak going. Don't know.And you know, the complaints others have about it? They're not wrong. The story is a bit thin. The bad guy is as stereotypical as Snidely Whiplash. The writing gets a little bit much at times. This book had more than one element that I'd normally find exasperating.Except...I didn't. Get exasperated, I mean. I don't know whether it really was a mood swing or what, but when I went in NOT expecting fine literature, I freed myself to simply enjoy riding along on Oona's adventures. Sometimes, when you read a book or watch a movie that you liked as a kid, you find the story just doesn't hold up anymore. But other times, and I've never been very clear how much of this was the story itself and how much was just frame of mind, but those other times you get taken over by the magic of a child's imagination and expectation and you remember how to delight in a story even when it isn't perfectly structured.I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you can suspend your adultiness for a bit and go into this without expecting a masterpiece, if you can enjoy it for its own sake, you'll probably have a pretty good time reading.And now? Now I'm off to read book two before this childishness wears off!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10D03OVW8N91U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ES1J1FW#wasThisHelpful","R10D03OVW8N91U","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Novelty Maker is a short story set in a steampunky world featuring Cole, a younger son in the upper class, and Harlowe, the scarred mechanical genius that fascinates Cole so.I can't say it really rocked my world, but it's a fairly sweet and fairly well-written story. I found the plot to be a bit thin, even if I'm making allowances for the length. Surprisingly, there's no overt sex...but not only that, there's precious little romance. (To be clear, that's not a complaint. I like a slow burn, I prefer implication to demonstration, and I think stories like this are almost sweeter when they aren't packed with juicy bits. If you're looking for something that gets you hot and bothered, though, this probably isn't going to be it.)This is one of those stories that was perfectly entertaining in the moment, but that doesn't have enough substance or complexity to stick with me.

"This first book Jordan L. Hawk's new series surprised me. I'm a huge fan of hers, and as always, she does some things very, very well. She writes historical fiction that feels truly historical, without the anachronisms that pepper so much of it, and you can tell she really does her homework. She writes romances that I don't hate. (I know that sounds like faint praise, but I've really grown to dislike all the insta-love and cliched endearments and formulaic sex scenes that we see all. the. time.)And I've said before in reviews for other books of hers, perhaps her greatest strength is in her ability to create characters. They're complex. They have their own unique voices. They feel real, and you can't help but fall in love with them all.That's what surprised me. Throughout much of the book, I hadn't fallen in love with them. Don't get me wrong, they were excellently-drawn. They were definitely complex. They felt like real people. It's just...this time around, I didn't really like them. (I guess it was bound to happen. I meet people that I don't really like all the time.)In Restless Spirits, we have Vincent, a medium – a man who can interact with and channel ghosts – who has some severe doubts about his path in life, and we have Henry, an inventor and scientist, who has a strong prejudice against mediums thanks to an unfortunate past and who wants to make them obsolete with his latest invention. At the beginning of the story, both are up against a wall financially, and when an offer comes to both of them for inclusion in a contest pitting science against the occult arts, they both feel like it may be their last chance.I had a hard time connecting with either Vincent or Henry. Vincent was a little too oversexed for my taste, and Henry was an uptight fussbudget whose predilection for taking offense got a bit tedious. Thankfully, I did NOT have that problem with the main supporting characters, Lizzie (Vincent's partner) and Jo (Henry's cousin), who were both delightful. (You know, in Hawk's excellent Whyborne & Griffin series, my most favorite character there is also a sidekick; I still think Christine deserves a series of her very own!) I think, if we're holding a contest, Jo edges ahead just a bit; she was so real and so wonderful, with exactly the right combination of vulnerability and verve, that even if I hadn't been into the story itself, I might've kept reading just to get more of her.Anyway, I said I wasn't enamored with the main characters through MOST of the book, that's true. The ending, though, redeemed them solidly, and I'm excited to read the sequel.In many of Hawk's books, she tackles the topic of historical homosexuality and just how difficult it was to be gay in those earlier times, and I've always thought she did it expertly. In Restless Spirits, she adds to that difficult theme by throwing racism and trans issues into the mix. It's an ambitious move, but she does it really well. (Well, from my perspective anyway, given that I'm white and cis.) I think it was tackled sensitively, but without sugarcoating any of it...and it really brings home how society's outcasts have to stick together.I haven't said much about the plot itself yet, but rest assured, it was quite good. With all of fantasy fiction's offerings in this day and age (BTW, you know you're getting old when you say things like “in this day and age”), a plain old ghost story doesn't seem, on the surface, to be all that thrilling. Trust me: this haunted house story can hold its own.Considering the quality of e-books in general lately, I feel compelled to add that (1) it was proofread, (2) the dialogue isn't the least bit stilted, and (3) it doesn't end with a cliffhanger. (For that matter, I wish all the writers who are so in love with the whole forgetting-to-write-an-ending-so-as-to-manipulate-readers-into-buying-the-sequel device would read this. It's proof that a book can have a completely satisfying ending, wrapping up the story completely, while making us readers even MORE anxious to read the next one.)TL;DR? I knocked off a star for how long it took me to warm up to the characters, but all was redeemed in the end, and this was a solid start to a new series I can't wait to continue. Well done again, Ms. Hawk.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRPCRM5VDXY7B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R0GGZOW#wasThisHelpful","RRPCRM5VDXY7B","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm calling this one 4.5 stars rather than the full unqualified 5 I gave the earlier books in the series. I really enjoyed it, but not quite as much as I did the first two. There are two reasons. (The next paragraph has spoilers. Not for the plot as much as general themes, but I know some people like a completely clean slate.)I was all set to pin my discontent on Holly Munro, the newest member of the Lockwood team, but I realized that's not quite fair. As a character, I liked Holly quite a lot; she added a personality to the team's mix that filled in a few holes. Unfortunately, she also added jealousy — even though Lucy would never for a second admit it, the presence of another girl vying for Lockwood's attentions makes her realize...well, Lucy never delves deep enough to realize she might have feelings for Lockwood, but she certainly realizes she doesn't like his attention being elsewhere. Retrospectively, I think one of the things I found so refreshing about this series was the utter absence of romantic plot lines. But now all of a sudden we have hurt feelings and rivalries and bad decisions and denial, and it all just seems so mundane. I LIKED this series about a girl and two guys who are friends and live together and have a relationship of equals free of the most common sort of teenaged angst...even if I didn't quite realize that was one of the things I liked about it at the time. Now, I'm not saying any of this was badly done, because it really wasn't. In fact, Stroud is a good enough writer that he can evoke romantic tension even though he barely hints at a romance. I just...I guess I just wish he had gone in another direction.Of course, he really couldn't have done so if he wanted to use the ending he had planned. I can't really call it a cliffhanger (which is good, considering the number of times I've trumpeted how I'll immediately strike any author from my list who uses such a nasty, manipulative device, and I don't actually want to drop Stroud) because the story's plots are all effectively wrapped up. I'm left with the same feeling of unfinished business, though, and I don't like it. It's not that he failed to tie up the story's main arc, it's more that he introduced a brand new one — in the last freaking paragraph! What's more, I can't tell if it was his way of leaving us hanging until the next book, or if he was ending the series with all the finality of a nail being driven into a coffin. (By the way: please comment if you've heard one way or another whether the series is continuing — his website didn't say when I checked.) I can't really say this any better than that, either; the ending was shocking, but if I give any more detail, I'm afraid I'll give it all away.I know I just spent two long paragraphs going into what's wrong with a book that I proclaimed was a 4.5 star read, but you should know (assuming you read all that) that I still dearly love this series, its characters, its outstanding humor, and its world. I may not think it was quite up to the standard set by the first two books, but all this is a matter of personal taste, not a commentary on Stroud's skill as a writer. If you've read the first two books, I'm sure you don't need my outside opinion when you decide whether to continue the series, and if you haven't, I can still recommend the series without reservation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25D942ITHJFBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WLEEKZ4#wasThisHelpful","R25D942ITHJFBJ","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn’t certain, last year, whether Drew Hayes was planning to write a sequel for his novel NPCs, which just so happened to be the book that introduced me to someone who’s become one of my most-watched authors. NPCs left plenty of room for more adventures, but stuff like sequels can depend on reader interest…and even though I thought the whole thing was just great, I wasn’t convinced the general public would take an interest (or get some of the concepts the book was poking fun at), or that the target audience (fantasy RPG gamers) would be big enough to inspire a continuation.Well, here we all are, so something must have gone right.I’ll admit, though, I had a bit of a sinking feeling at first. Part of what delighted me so much about NPCs was the concept. It took all the stereotypes and tropes of fantasy RPGs – and forget the PnP games, these are things that anyone who’s even played a single video game probably started taking for granted early on – and it laughed at them. The concept of it all was plenty strong enough to prop up the first novel, but that concept only had so much momentum.Fortunately, the whole NPCs-turned-adventurers thing stayed in the background; this sequel is more about them settling in to actually BE adventurers, rather than just pretending. And that’s good; I really liked the concept of NPCs, like I said, and I’d really hate to see something so genius turn tedious.And it didn’t; far more focus was placed on the capital-Q Quest itself, and the growth of the characters, and the introduction of a few new faces. Just like the last book, there were short interludes in the real world showing an actual tabletop game being played in the fantasy universe, but this time, the role players’ quest ended up diverging from the NPCs’, though there were reminders of the overarching plot tying everything together. (Also, the real-life role players weren’t nearly as aggravating, which was nice.) All in all, I’d call it a huge success. As if you couldn’t guess from the score I gave it, right?Since it’s hard for me to write a review without finding *something* to complain about, I will point out one negative, at least as far as I’m concerned: anyone who’s familiar with Hayes’s other series, the Super Powereds, will see a lot of similarities in the way he draws his characters. It wasn’t hard for me to find a parallel character for, well, pretty much the entire cast of NPCs…and I’m surprised he even bothered to come up with a new name for SP’s Angela when he plopped her in this book as the real world GM’s big sister. I’m not saying I don’t like Hayes’s characters, in whatever incarnation they’re taking at the moment, and I’m sure he taxed himself writing as many different people as he did, considering the enormous cast of Super Powereds, but it might have been nice had the NPCs grown their own unique voices instead of sounding so…universally familiar.Now, I’ve read enough e-books that I almost feel obligated to address the usual technical issues. First,  cliffhangers — I’m happy to report that we don’t have one. Like he did in book one, Hayes left plenty of dangling threads so there’s room for the story to grow and flourish, but this is a complete book. (I’d wish any number of other authors would read this and see how it ought to be done if I didn’t know I’d be wasting my time.) Second, editing: it’s good. I caught one mistake – he used the word “tenants” when he meant “tenets” (as in “the tenets of a god’s faith”). I wasn’t looking for errors, but since they usually jump out at me whether I’m looking or not, I’d say one whoops is pretty darn good – and it’s consistent with what I’d expect in a traditionally-published paperback book.So. I’ll assume that if you’re here, checking out reviews for Split the Party, you’ve read NPCs. If that’s the case, I can recommend this one strongly – the story could’ve easily stagnated, but Hayes moved the story and the characters in the direction it and they needed to go with some real precision. The very moment the cleverness of the first book’s concept started to get old, he moved the focus elsewhere, and the series is stronger for it. Now, if you stumbled onto this book by mistake and haven’t read NPCs, go and do that, please. Split the Party will still be here when you’re done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UE6IEQSQACGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011QBP5NI#wasThisHelpful","R3UE6IEQSQACGL","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a huge Mercedes Lackey fan. I love everything about Valdemar, and I have since the first time I picked up Arrows of the Queen. (Which, by the way, I almost didn't do. Have you seen the cover of that one? So pink and little-girly and twee. My first thought on seeing it was My Little Pony Meets Girl With Unfortunate Haircut and thought there's no way I'd find anything entertaining about it. Ha!)That said, every now and then, Lackey gets a little bit too...hmm...coincidental for my tastes. By that, I mean that she writes scenes that don't really pass the sniff test, as though she didn't spend a great deal of effort on plausibility, and she expects us readers to accept her characters' actions no matter how unlikely or thin the reasoning. I've seen it in several of her books – especially her later ones; Owlknight got a little ridiculous there for a while – but while I overlook it out of my abiding love of all things Valdemar, the Mags books are rife.Indeed, it was an issue I remarked on in my review for the last book, Closer to Home, and I'm most glad to report that this one is a distinct improvement! I won't say my credulity was never stretched, but at least this one didn't have me saying “wait...uh, really?” in a skeptical tone of voice far too often for a story by an author who knows better.Here, Mags and Amily have settled in to their roles as Crown Spy and King's Own, respectively. Things in Valdemar are going well, which is why it surprises exactly no one that a major plot against the crown and Life As We Know It is uncovered. And then? Then it's a race against time.I'd probably call this one 4.5 stars, even though my official rating is a full 5. Like I said, there were a few strains on my ability to accept Lackey's words as realistic, and as well, there was a plot point or two that didn't seem to bloom the way I thought they would. The climax – or rather, the explanation for the climax – seemed a bit “out of nowhere,” especially since it didn't seem like she was trying to foreshadow or tie future books into this one. (But that's just an impression; I'll be perfectly happy to be proved wrong.)But even if it's not perfect, it's another dose of the Valdemar I love so very much; the only reason I didn't post this the day after it was released is because I forgot it was coming and wasn't paying attention to my pre-orders.If you're a Valdemar fan (and you really ought to be, you know) this is a must-read. Of course, you'll want to start with the first book in the Mags arc (Foundation); there's a lot of history in the Collegium Chronicles series that wouldn't be adequately explained to a reader who's missing all the background. But for those who have been keeping up, and maybe especially for those who were a bit disappointed by some of the turns the story took in the last book, I think you'll like this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ALZVFWN7T9EP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI028VI#wasThisHelpful","R3ALZVFWN7T9EP","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a number of reviews mentioning the nice fragrance this stuff has.Those reviews were evidently written by bots. Or people with heavy damage to the olfactory center in their brains. One or the other.I was really hoping to get something that smelled like tea tree oil...which, if you've never smelled it, is a sharp, clean, sort of antiseptic fragrance.It does not smell like tea tree oil. Instead, the fragrance is heavy and cloying and...well, awful.Does it work? It might. Unfortunately, to find out, I'd have to gas myself and the poor cat every day for a couple of weeks, and frankly, as much as I hate cleaning the shower -- and I really, really do -- I think I hate that prospect even more.To be fair, I've yet to find a natural no-scrub shower spray that doesn't smell horrible, so maybe the required ""green"" ingredients interact with the fragrances negatively. Hard to imagine something that could overwhelm tea tree oil, but the evidence speaks for itself. I can't imagine this stench was intentional!Do not listen to the five star reviews unless you want your bathroom to smell like you tried to cover up the dead bodies with cheap drugstore perfume.Though come to think of it, if you have actual dead bodies, investing in a bottle of this stuff might confuse the authorities long enough to get you across the border.

"I was torn as to what rating to give this.In several respects, it's not all that good if we're being honest. (At least, if you're not a teenager.) The plot is thin and really only held up by teenage melodrama; it's one of those movies that makes you look back at your own teen years and feel embarrassed at how much importance you placed on liking someone and whether they liked you back. There's a fair amount of ridiculousness throughout, and plenty of scenes that really just come across as overacted. I started out quite enjoying the subplot of Robin de Jesús's character - he's gay, and suffers for it, and Camp Ovation is obviously a safe haven for him - but even the resolution of that one left me with a raised eyebrow.But despite its flaws, I still like this movie. It's got some terrific voices - including a young Anna Kendrick as Fritzi and a young Sasha Allen as Dee, as well as a few names who aren't quite as famous but still pretty incredible, like Tiffany Taylor. I will say that not all of them blew my socks off, though. Alana Allen and Joanna Chilcoat both have lead roles, and I confess, I'm not entirely sure why. Of course they're not BAD singers, but they're outclassed by some of the secondary characters. As for the songs themselves, I'll admit that some of them seem odd, or maybe out of place, but they're still awfully engaging, and there were a couple that I like very much. ""Turkey Lurkey Time"" (Promises, Promises) and ""Ladies Who Lunch"" (Company), of course, but there were several I hadn't heard before (not sure if they were originals written for the film or if they're just obscure) that I liked very well, too, particularly ""I Sing For You"" and ""Here's Where I Stand."" There were a few surprise moments of real humor, too...particularly in the scenes involving Anna Kendrick.So while I couldn't call this film great, or even particularly good, there's just something about it that makes the flaws...well, maybe not charming, but at the very least, overlookable. And at the movie's base, we've got some awfully good music. I expect teenagers would really enjoy this, particularly any who are involved in the arts, or who maybe don't fit in all that well. And adults? It really depends on your expectations.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DZBEAATEN386/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018SNF4Q#wasThisHelpful","R2DZBEAATEN386","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Despite being a longtime En Vogue fan, it took me nearly two decades to get this album and listen to it all the way through. EV3 was recorded right around the time Dawn left, and while she's on some of the tracks, many of these songs are just the remaining trio.

It's not quite as creative as Funky Divas, their previous album, and I wouldn't call every track a success (track one ""Whatever""? Eh. Whatever), but I like a lot more of the songs than I figured I would. Don't Let Go (Love) and Too Gone Too Long are definitely my favorites, but there's a lot more replayability here than I had any reason to hope for.En Vogue is one of the most musically talented girl groups of all time, and the fact that the group started to fracture when this was being put out doesn't change that one jot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HRGN38I1H6WF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002HPR#wasThisHelpful","R1HRGN38I1H6WF","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me just say right up front that I'm not really the sort of person who likes middle grade books. I don't hate them, exactly, but except for a couple of rare exceptions, I tend to find them too...thin, I suppose.The Graveyard Book is not too thin. (Don't get me wrong: it *is* thin, both in the plot and in the characters...just not so much so that I couldn't enjoy it. Or maybe a better word would be ""simple."")The plot is probably the weakest part of the book...because what the plot was didn't become particularly apparent until close to the end. Until that point, we're mostly just meandering along in Bod's unusual life. At the same time, though, I didn't really feel the lack; there was so much imagination in the book that I didn't mind the fact that I couldn't exactly tell how Gaiman was planning to take me from point A to point B.The characters, too, were not deep. Had they been your regular sort of characters, I'd probably have been disappointed. But just like with the plot, I found I didn't have to delve too deeply to get something out of them. I didn't fall in love with any of the characters, but I sure did like just about all of them.You're probably wondering why I scored this book 4.5 stars when I sound so lukewarm about it, and I'll tell you: I think it's the setting where this book really shines. It's truly magical; I don't think any of us can pretend that paranormal elements in a story are unique, but the way Gaiman approached his world was really masterful. All the paranormal books think they're something special, but this one truly does feel unique.And, of course, there's the writing itself. Gaiman's artistic way with words and subtle humor always seem to strike just the right chord in me. It took me a few pages to get into the cadence, and once I did, I enjoyed the writing not just for the story it was telling but for its own sake.The one part of the book I'm still feeling a bit torn over is the ending. (Of course, at least this book HAS an ending—I could scream at the number of decent-sounding books I've come across that end in blatant cliffhangers.) I know I'm being very vague—I don't want to spoil it for you—but it left me deeply saddened. It was well-written, and it fit the story, but it still really tugged at my feelings. I suppose that's a pretty good testimonial for how good this book really is—an author who doesn't evoke emotions isn't doing a very good job—but I don't think I was prepared for it.Regardless, this is a pretty terrific book, not just for kids but for all of us who like a simple and exceptionally unique story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TYI22RG2XCCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0011UJM48#wasThisHelpful","R1TYI22RG2XCCF","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't believe I almost skipped this series. See, book one was tagged as a middle grade book, appropriate for readers in grades three to seven. Or six to nine, depending on where you were looking. (This one is apparently either three to seven or five to eight.) And you know, I've revisited too many books that I loved-loved-loved as a kid that simply don't hold up. (I was a precocious reader, too; it's not like those childhood favorites were unusually simple.) That's always sort of disappointing, so I'd pretty much decided that, with a couple of rare exceptions, I do better when I leave the middle grade books to the kids and focus on stuff that's written with my own age bracket in mind.But, a few things got me to risk it in this particular case. It was on sale. A few different friends of mine had rated it highly. And I really liked this author's Bartimaeus series. So, I bought it and promised myself I'd start it right away so that I'd have time to return it if it ended up being too young for me.Oh man. I don't know if the reading level was set unusually low or this just happens to be one of those rare exceptions, but book one wasn't just enjoyable, it was destined for my “favorites” shelf. And I'm pleased to report that I loved this one as well.Lucy, Lockwood, and George are back. This time, they have the benefit of a somewhat improved reputation...but their cred still isn't quite on the same level as the Fittes Agency. And too bad the Fittes folks they keep running into are such jerks. The Whispering Skull serves up another excellent ghostly mystery, complete with plenty of danger, and as an added bonus, we get to find out more about the creepy skull from Lucy's pre-employment test. A lot more.It probably goes without saying, since Jonathan Stroud is such a terrific author, but this book checks all the right boxes. The plot is engaging. The characters have depth. The setting that I praised so highly in book one is still delightful and magical and sinister all at the same time. (And, since there are so many ebooks lately that are so unprofessional, it might be worth pointing out that the dialogue is realistic, the editing happened, and the story doesn't end on a cliffhanger.)I understand book three is being released soon and I'm practically dancing with anticipation. Whether you're in grades three through seven or not, I suggest you do yourself a favor and get this—along with The Screaming Staircase, if you haven't read that one yet—and settle in for an outstanding ride.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SEUZVS5FW8MI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IYXRUYY#wasThisHelpful","R3SEUZVS5FW8MI","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I found this book, I was torn.On one hand, there was the fact that it was written by Jonathan Stroud, author of the Bartimaeus series (quite good, BTW). On the other, we have the label in the description telling us this book is intended for readers in grades three through seven. (Elsewhere, it says grades six through nine, but still.) It seems to me that for every Harry Potter, you have about a thousand middle grade books that, though I can easily see why they'd be enticing to kids, simply don't hold up to a discerning adult's eyeballs.But holy cow, people: we've got a Harry Potter.Now, before you all start shrieking at me because this book is nothing at all like Harry Potter, let me just say this and hope that I'm being quite clear: this book is really nothing at all like Harry Potter. Except maybe in the most superficial of ways. (Magical Britain, two boys and a girl...) What I meant was that this is a book that was no less delightful just because it was written with a younger reader in mind...and though it's rather darker than the first HP book, it still manages to introduce some of the same sort of literary magic that made me fall in love with Hogwarts.The Lockwood & Co. series is set in the ""real world,"" with one major divergence: several decades ago, ghosts started appearing. Turns out that ghosts aren't benign, and to make things even worse, the only people who can sense them with any sort of reliability are kids. And those with the most psychic ability? They're on the front lines.The characters were quite well done, I thought, and so was the plot. Where this book really shines, though, is the setting--Stroud's land of malevolent spirits is rich and well-planned and masterfully painted. The descriptions of the ghosts and the dangers the characters faced were vivid, and though I didn't personally find the book frightening, precisely (though if you really are buying this for a child, you may want to make sure they have a strong constitution...or at least read it first yourself), I was sucked into this baleful world expertly enough that I could almost feel the chill the specters were emitting.I've already said this book reminds me a bit of Harry Potter, at least in the way it made me feel, but it also reminds me of John Bellairs's The House with a Clock in Its Walls (Lewis Barnavelt). Again, not really in substance, in experience. I read HWACIIW as a kid--maybe 3rd grade?--and it was the book that turned me on to fantasy. I do recall finding that one a bit frightening, but far more important was how it opened me up to a world of magic. I can easily see the Screaming Staircase doing the same for a new generation of readers.Seriously, folks. If the description makes the book sound like it's up your alley, don't let the reading level scare you off. This grown-up will be reading the whole series, doubtless over and over, until my eyesight finally goes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA398KDCW5PBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CJ05F1S#wasThisHelpful","RA398KDCW5PBH","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If this is a ""powerful"" dehumidifier as the description suggests, I'd hate to see a weak one.I bought this during a stretch when my A/C was out of commission. I live in a humid area, and my choices were to either open the windows so I didn't slowly roast to death, or keep the place shut up to keep the humidity out. Out of necessity, I chose the former.So the inside of my house was particularly swampy for a while there, and I kept this running right next to my computer desk, hoping that at least that room would have fairly controlled moisture.This machine does run quietly, and it does collect moisture, but not nearly as much as I would've wanted to see. I realize that one can't expect a smaller machine to operate with the same sort of power as a more expensive one, but the amount of water it pulled out of the air was negligible. I would practically have dew forming on my body, yet this dehumidifier collected mere ounces after running for a whole day. The air it was spitting out must have had nearly as much moisture in it as the air that went in.If you're reading this, I expect you're tempted by the same hope I had - that perhaps a great big expensive dehumidifier isn't necessary if you're just wanting to dehumidify a single room. Perhaps there is a machine out there that doesn't cost an arm and a leg and still gets the job done.

The whole time I was messing with it, I couldn't really imagine how this little pad would stay cold - even while I was smooshing the air out of it, it seemed to be room temperature (in other words, hot and sticky) - but I guess I figured I'd be amazed once I was done following all the directions.I...really wasn't. This pad isn't remotely cold. It's somewhat cooler than my sheets, true, but with no a/c, that's not saying much...and even a thin pillowcase was enough to negate that temperature difference. So I took it out of the pillowcase and moved it to the foot of my bed (hot feet are the absolute *worst*!), thinking I could rest my feet and ankles on it. Again, the pad wasn't so cool that I found it any sort of relief, and of course the cool side of the pad is plastic, so without the pillowcase, I'd sweat and stick to it.Not a very pleasant sensation.After all my experimenting, it occurred to me that even though I wasn't going to get much use out of it, maybe the cat would like something not hot to snooze on. (At least until the inevitable puncturing, but it's destined for the garbage sooner or later.) But no, even the cat seems to find it unsettling.I'm chalking this one up to my own fault for being naive enough to think that a pad that doesn't get refrigerated would be cooling enough to make a difference. Good for the people who like it, I guess, but it's not the product for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JIE6L4UTSHSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GRT48HO#wasThisHelpful","R3JIE6L4UTSHSS","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This fan was a great buy. It's nearly perfect for my own needs, but I'll list its qualities just in case some of them might not work so well for you.It wasn't difficult to assemble. The hardest part was getting the front cage to snap on properly, but even that only took a few tries. And since the cage just hooks together rather than needing screws, popping it off to clean the blade will be a breeze. (Although, there's not much of a hook to those hooks, so I don't plan to pop the cage off any more than I absolutely have to. If those hooks wear down or break, then that's that.) Also, all you need to put it together is your own two hands. No tools needed.It's very powerful. It moves a great deal of air, even on low (I haven't gone past medium yet; I'm afraid it might blow the cat across the room on high!), which is a relief. For two weeks when my A/C was out, I needed a fan that could cool me off even though the air it was moving was hot and humid. This fan blows with such force that even warm air movement is refreshing. And its force means you can set it at a fair distance and still feel it, but it's also strong enough to blow papers and stuff around if they're in the fan's path, even when they aren't particularly close to it.The oscillator has a wide swing to it, about 90 degrees, which I suppose could either be a negative or a positive. If you want it to swing but still stay relatively contained at a small angle, you may not care for this. On the other hand, it's perfect when you have a small area of cool air (like a new portable a/c with a fairly puny blower) and want to distribute it far and wide.The cord is fairly short—rather shorter than I would've liked, honestly. I didn't measure it, but I'd guess it to be maybe 6 feet. That could be a problem if you want to use it in a place without an outlet handy, but a cheap extension cord solved that problem for me. (Incidentally, there is no grounding prong on the plug, so you can use a 2-hole extension cord if necessary.)The pole has a decent amount of extension to it; I'd say you can adjust the height by about a foot and a half. At its tallest, from base to motor is (again, this is an estimate) probably 4-1/2 feet. This makes it pretty versatile; you can stand it on the floor or shorten it and put it on a (large) table. At full length, though, that also makes it a bit top-heavy. It's fine if you leave it alone, but the cat knocked it over when I first put it together and now he's scared of it.It's loud. Even on low it's pretty loud, compared to what I remember my last box fan sounding like. It doesn't bother me at all, but if you're someone looking for a fan for your bedroom, and you need quiet to sleep, you probably won't like this.Seriously, I have a hard time imagining a fan with this small a footprint with as much power as this one has. I wish the cord were a bit longer, like I said, but that's really my only complaint. When the air conditioner died, it was a real lifesaver!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTU6K6HK95AY8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FXOFM6U#wasThisHelpful","RTU6K6HK95AY8","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While there was no question about getting this short story--I became addicted to the Magpie world in no time at all--I was afraid I'd come away disappointed. In a tale this short, it can be like getting a tiny appetizer when you haven't eaten all day: you come away even more hungry than you were to begin with.KJ Charles did good, though. For all that it took about 10 minutes to read, it was packed with excitement and chills. (Truly, I have to wonder where she comes up with some of this stuff. This story was way creepy.) Like all the best short stories, it was a tale with all the elements needed to make it complete and satisfying.It's free, at least at the moment, so I doubt there's any reason NOT to get it, but...get it.

"This is going to be short (at least for me); I've reviewed books one and two in this series, and I'm basically just repeating myself.Flight of Magpies is the final book in the Magpie Lord series, and it's just as excellent as the other two. In Flight, the always-short-handed justiciars are in an even more precarious position, there's a rogue practitioner with a truly horrendous talent, it appears that someone Stephen trusts has turned criminal, and some unfinished business comes back to haunt Stephen and Lord Crane. We're also introduced to a character who'll become the focus of Jackdaw, a novel in the same universe as the Magpie series.Charles's writing remains excellent. The book is just as hilarious as the others. The romance continues to stay in that sweet spot between mundane and fairytaleish. (And BTW, can I say how impressed I am that Charles was able to create a D/s relationship that still has the characters feeling like true equals? Most romances I've read in this vein come across as unbalanced and unhealthy, which isn't a turn-on at all. Stephen and Lord Crane show all those others how it's supposed to work.) Really, the only thing disappointing about Flight is the fact that the series is over. The author has written some Magpie short stories, and there's the linked novel I mentioned, but...I'm going to miss Lord Crane and Stephen and Esther Gold and Merrick. (Maybe especially Merrick.)Bittersweet as finishing this novel might have been, though, I still can't help but recommend this excellent, excellent series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MC97VV3N12EV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZFHQ4I#wasThisHelpful","R3MC97VV3N12EV","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't expecting to like The Magpie Lord (A Charm of Magpies Book 1) (book one in this series) quite as much as I did. It was the first novel-length work by K. J. Charles I'd read, and I was surprised and pleased by its quality. (There are a lot of mediocre books being published these days, and too many downright bad ones.)Anyway, I liked it enough that there was no real question as to whether I'd continue the series, and I'm pleased to report that this book is just as excellent as the first.This one deals a bit more with the closet, and we get to meet Stephen's colleagues, who, as supporting characters, are nearly as terrific as Merrick (who, incidentally, probably rivals Christine in Jordan L. Hawk's Whyborne & Griffin series as Favorite Supporting Actor Evah).(Which you should also read. After you're done with this one, of course. First book is Widdershins (Whyborne & Griffin Book 1).)I don't want to spoil the plot for you; there's another mystery, and Lord Crane's Chinese past comes back to haunt him in a sense, and, like I said, the closet issues that were bound to come up in Ye Olde London...well, they came up. But just like book one, A Case of Possession is still funny, still superbly written, and still manages to avoid the fairytaleishness that surrounds so many fantasy romances.If you haven't read book one, I strongly suggest doing so; while the books don't end in cliffhangers--I'd have written a very different review if they had!--you still need the setup from the first to get the most out of the second. But if you have? Stop reading reviews and buy it already!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSDCM2A7XJP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D89OGW8#wasThisHelpful","RSDCM2A7XJP0","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a hard time scoring this one.The writing is darn good, the dialogue was realistic, and the characters were likeable. The setting, an alternate steampunky earth, was delightful. Even two thirds of the way through, I was most pleased with this one; any scoring difficulty would be in choosing between four and five stars.But then we got toward the end, and I had two fairly major problems with it. (I'm posting spoilers, but I'll flag them so you know where to stop and start reading if you want a clean slate.)The first is pretty specific to me—meaning, many of you might not find it to be a negative worthy of such specific criticism. It's one reason (of many) that people think I'm odd. See, I can handle a lot in my books. I'm not easily frightened. Extreme violence doesn't bother me if there's a reason for it. I'm not put off by swearing. And when I see people marking down book scores for stuff like that, I have to forcibly stop myself from rolling my eyes long enough to remind myself that we all have our things, and that's OK.[SPOILER AHEAD]And it's good that I'm successful most of the time, because now we come to one of my things: animal abuse. Specifically, the gratuitous and deliberate injury of a dog. I very nearly stopped reading the story because of it, and it didn't even go on very long. (I did pause long enough to clutch the cat and babble nonsense at him. At least until he bit me.) Even recalling the scene just enough to type this review has me upset again, and I'm not stupid—I know the dog is a figment of the author's imagination. But...I read books for pleasure. Reading about someone being cruel to an animal is the exact opposite of pleasure.[SPOILER #1 ENDED]My other issue with the ending itself, which was tepid and unsatisfying. To be clear, it didn't seem precisely like a cliffhanger, which I'd define as a non-ending designed to manipulate us into buying another book in order to finish the story. No, this was more like...the story petered out without actually revealing the good stuff. At its heart, this book is a mystery. Someone is after Kit the clock repairman because of...well, nobody really knows why. And underneath the love story, this little novella's whole point is finding out what someone could want from Kit enough to attack him.[SPOILER AHEAD]It turns out that there's a mysterious and badly-metered poem hidden inside this rich old dude's clock, and it was obvious to everyone that it must have had some hidden meaning 'cause, well, it really wasn't very good, and it was stuffed in a freaking clock. The back end of the story involves the attempt to decipher the hidden meaning and discover what everyone assumes is some fantastic treasure that was carefully hidden by the poem's author. The characters aren't the only ones assuming such a thing, either; the poem is stolen, and it turns out the people attacking Kit are after the treasure for themselves.So you'd think that once Wes and Kit stopped the attacks and plans to uncover the treasure were confirmed, we'd actually find out what all the fuss was about, right? Wrong. Wes and Kit are so happy to be alive and in love that they decide they don't care...and they just leave. The end.[SPOILER #2 ENDED]So what we're left with is a short little story that starts out with a great deal of promise, but then goes off the rails. It's like waiting all day for dessert only to find out you're getting some lo-cal, artificially sweetened monstrosity, and you can't figure out why you're the only one who's disappointed.I think I'm probably more honked off because the story was chugging along so well for the first two thirds or so; had it been rotten from the start, I would've shrugged and read something else. Having no potential is one thing, but having it and not living up to it is quite another.So, I guess, read at your own risk. Most of this story is quite nice, but the finish is less than terrific. Too bad.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V06VRKXBANTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MFVY2RY#wasThisHelpful","R1V06VRKXBANTC","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll confess, I find a lot of historical m/m romances are misses—sometimes authors don't do the research and end up with startling anachronisms in their stories, sometimes it seems like a historical setting is just an excuse for some ready-made plot stresses (because gay relationships were even less cool back in the day), and sometimes the writing, especially the dialogue, comes across as stilted and boring instead of old-timey and charming.I'm glad I didn't let my reservations stop me from downloading this, because this is how it's supposed to be done. There's a lot to love here.For one thing, this book is *funny*! I've seen a lot of authors try for that dry, sardonic tone, but considering I'm a dry, sardonic sort of reader, it takes just the right amount of effortlessness and understatement and just the perfect timing to impress me. Consider me impressed; there was lots of smiling going on, and even a few bona fide LOLs. I've also found books that utilize this sort of humor to run into a same-voice problem; the funnies might be there, but you can't necessarily tell without double-checking just who it is getting the laughs. TML pushes up against that line, but the characters' personalities are all unique enough to pull it off.Another thing I've noticed in romances is that in many cases, the plot seems to exist only to allow the characters to hook up, and that hooking up often happens in an unrealistic, ham-handed way. In TML, I had very little trouble imagining the characters acting as they did, and neither the romance nor the plot seemed contrived. While I refuse to spoil the ending by confirming or denying a happily-ever-after, I think I can safely say that this book is no fairy tale.And finally, the magic system deserves some serious praise. It's a little funny—I like my magic with a side of rules. Scientific. Robert Jordan-esque. This...is not. But instead of coming across as ill thought out, it's just mysterious and compelling. Not an afterthought, not overpowered, the magic in TML takes what's essentially just a (very good) historical romance and adds a whole new dimension.Seriously, you guys. K. J. Charles knows what she's doing. It's time to stop reading reviews and experience The Magpie Lord for yourself.

"Can I just say, I've been having bad luck with ebooks this week. The number of books I've abandoned barely a chapter in was high enough that I was starting to wonder if it was me. Maybe I didn't need better books, maybe I just need...dunno, an antidepressant or something.But no: I've been vindicated by one Jordan Castillo Price! It was NOT just me, and I needed a book this well-written, engrossing, and unique to prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt.Magic Mansion was recommended to me by an acquaintance, and if I'm telling the truth, I probably wouldn't have bought it otherwise. It really didn't sound like my thing. I love fantasy, but contemporary fantasy isn't usually my first pick. I've gotten a little sick of romances, since all the romantic story arcs I've encountered lately feel awfully paint-by-number. And the two big themes of the book—stage magic and reality TV—are really not my thing.Starting the book, I was relieved that the author could at least write, and had bothered to get this edited (I'm a little disgusted that that even needs to be said...I'm not sure when editing became optional), but I was still a bit skeptical of the romance. Ricardo is mid-30s, extroverted, a bit queeny, and super hot. Professor Topaz seemed like your stock widower at first. A 60-something has-been with a dead partner and lots of ennui. While I wouldn't say I'm turned off by the whole May-December thing, I can't really say it gets my juices flowing either, and I was afraid the huge age gap would turn into either a gold-digger thing, a lecherous dirty-old-man thing, or both.I was also a bit skeptical of the concept of True Magic, or Truth, that both Professor Topaz and Ricardo possess. Don't get me wrong: I love magic in stories. I'd say over half the books I choose have it in some form or other. This, though? It—and I can hardly believe I'm admitting it—started out feeling...unnecessary. It had such a minor impact on the plot at first that I wondered if it was added just so that it could be shelved with the fantasies as well as the LGBT books. I love books with magic, but badly-done magic is awfully disappointing.But, the writing was good, and skepticism isn't the same thing as dislike, so I kept going.Oh man, I'm so glad I did. I refuse to post spoilers, but I will say this: the romance was not creepy. The characters weren't stereotypes. The inclusion of True Magic started to make a bit more sense. And there wasn't a single paint-by-number thing about it. I've read plenty of books lately that I like just fine, and a few that I've loved, but this is the first time in a while I've had to stop mid-chapter and boggle at the author's imagination and research. She created a fresh new storyline that involved things that would normally turn me off, she included details that never would have occurred to me, and I actually stayed up all night to finish it.If you like a well-done m/m romance, I highly recommend this one. I even recommend it to those people who wouldn't normally be into things like reality TV and magicians' tricks. Go ahead—get it, and prepare to be wowed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XOCI5EQ5CR4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007SWU1E8#wasThisHelpful","R2XOCI5EQ5CR4B","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just so you know: my rating is not for the game itself, but I'm hoping it gets people's attention.I purchased the Deluxe edition a couple weeks ago through Amazon. The game key they gave me, however, was NOT for the deluxe edition, it was for the standard GOTY edition. The base game was still playable, but I only had the two major expansions available to play (Knights of the Nine & Shivering Isles)—the other addons were not installed. I rechecked everything—it's not like I've never clicked the wrong thing by mistake—but my purchase history was very clear that I bought Deluxe, not standard. (And I definitely paid the higher price for the addons!)This turned into a tech support black hole. Amazon told me to contact Steam. Steam told me that only Amazon could help me.Now, yes, the game was priced quite cheaply, and I probably only paid about $5 extra for the additional content I didn't get, but I'd played Oblivion before and, IMO, the DLCs enhanced the game considerably. If you're on the fence about whether to get the Deluxe or the standard GOTY, I'd choose Deluxe every time (especially since the extra content is so inexpensive compared to the base game). The game itself is great fun, even though Skyrim has me spoiled graphics-wise, and for the money, Oblivion is a tremendous source of entertainment. If I were rating just the game, I'd probably have given it four stars.Normally, I wouldn't put something like this in a review, since it's a customer service issue more than it is an issue with the game itself. However, since I got such a runaround from everyone involved, I want to make sure everyone's aware that this is a problem. Now, I have no idea whether it's happening to everyone—I'd have expected to see a bit more outrage if it were—but I'm definitely not the only one. There's a customer question related to this same issue on this page, and googling the problem sent me to several forums where various people were seeking help. I eventually got it resolved; Steam revoked my game code, I've emailed Amazon CS for a refund, and I repurchased it through the Steam store. (Successfully, I might add; I got the DLCs.) Steam made it clear to me that they were making a huge exception by doing so, so I wanted to get this warning out there as others may not be as ""successful"" as I was.So to be clear, Oblivion is a great game. If you're wanting the Deluxe GOTY edition, however, I strongly recommend that you not purchase it through Amazon and go through Steam instead. (As of this moment, the prices are identical on both sites, but two weeks ago when I bought the game, Amazon was somewhat cheaper. If you do end up buying from Amazon, be aware that you may not get a code for the game you purchased—and if you don't, getting the problem corrected is like pulling teeth.Good luck.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EDO3EX6JHY5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXHJG1I#wasThisHelpful","R2EDO3EX6JHY5H","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's been a long time since I've anticipated a series continuation as much as I have this one.I always wonder a bit whether it's worth my time to write reviews for one of the later books in a series. I mean, either you're familiar with the series and need little help deciding whether to keep going – I certainly didn't wait around for reviews before picking up this one! – or you're not, in which case you'd presumably realize you should be investigating the first book. Still, even though you probably don't need my opinion to weight your purchase decision, I think Super Powereds 3 deserves all the praise it can get.I tend to go on, so for those looking for the TL;DR version, here you go: Buy this. It's good.If you're after analysis, though, keep reading.I'm not going to bother rehashing the plot. For one thing, you can read the blurb and the other reviews as easily as I can, and for another, you already have a good idea what the HCP students' junior year will be like.Well...actually, no, you probably don't. There are a fair number of surprises. I just don't intend to spoil them.Drew Hayes came to my attention when I stumbled upon his book NPCs. It was on sale, and it sounded like a cute little diversion, so I picked it up...having no real idea just how good a writer he is. I know better now, but it's worth mentioning that there are some things he does very, very well.Intrigue. Intrigue is hard for a  lot of writers to write. Honestly, I have my doubts as to whether I'd be any good at it. It's not something an author can fake; his brain has to work in the same twisty fashion as his characters'. Hayes has the touch, though. He gets inside the heads of his criminals and his subtlety heroes and he makes it all authentic. It's really, really impressive.Plot webs. SP3 – and by extension, the whole Super Powereds series – is not a run-of-the-mill linear story. He can weave mysteries and plots that resolve themselves right there in the book with multiple overarching slow-burning storylines, and he does it with great finesse. There's a depth to this series that's sadly lacking in a lot of the SF/F offerings we're seeing lately.Density. Just like the earlier books, SP3 is LONG. Really, it has to be. Hayes has five main characters (or six, I guess, depending how you count Roy and Herschel), and many, many secondary characters that have nearly as much flesh on their bones as the mains. In a story that ambitious, the author can go one of two directions: he can skim the surface, or he can publish something with a massive word count. There are disadvantages to the latter route, naturally. Long books intimidate people, for one thing, and for another, an author really has to be careful not to kill his readers, slowly, one bit of minutiae at a time. Personally, I like long, involved books...but only if the story can support the length. Drew Hayes is a past master at writing a long, dense book while still making sure every word has a purpose.Balance in action. Non-stop thrill rides seem to be popular lately, and really, I'm not a fan of the trend. I read to relax, and I don't much care for stories that never give me time to catch my breath. At the same time, a story has to have some excitement in it, you know? Hayes balances the mundane with action masterfully. There's nothing exhausting about SP3, which means we have the energy to tackle the climax...which is an edge-of-your-seat, searing blitz of an ending. Which brings me to...The actual ending. You all have no idea how much I loathe cliffhangers. I can love a story with every fiber of my being, but if you dangle a cliffhanger in my face, I'll never pick up another of your books. They're manipulative, they're disrespectful, and, if you have any talent at all as a writer, they're entirely unnecessary. They're also popular lately, and I think every one of those authors who decided for whatever reason that cliffhangers are acceptable ways to end a book should pick up this one and see how it should really be done. SP3 wraps up the book's story nicely while leaving plenty of room for next year's adventures.Now, you'll probably notice that, up at the top, I gave this book 4.5 stars. That wasn't a mistake; I wouldn't call this perfect. One thing that's not perfect is the editing. It's good, certainly, but I caught mistakes. (I can still recommend this, though, even to those readers who cannot abide errors; they weren't numerous, and they were easy enough to overlook.) Also, I mentioned in one of my earlier reviews that there's a bit of a same-voice issue, and that hasn't really been resolved. While I wouldn't say the characters all blatantly speak with the same voice, there are SO MANY characters, and some of them start to resemble each other. Similarly, the dry, sardonic humor that I like so much seems to come out of more characters than is maybe realistic.But...pfft. Those are quibbles, and I'm really only including them because I don't believe there's ever not room for improvement. This is an outstanding installment of an outstanding series, and you should read it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CX3M53N1GHER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAN8CYW#wasThisHelpful","R2CX3M53N1GHER","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was so disappointed when I heard that the Elder Scrolls game to follow Skyrim was going to be MMO, since I have no interest in those, but part of that disappointment was because I loved Skyrim so much and I didn't want the Elder Scrolls experience to end.And you know? This game was released years ago, and I still play it, and I still love it, and somehow, it hasn't gotten stale. So people can have Elder Scrolls Online if they want; I'm content with just playing my trusty old Skyrim and being amazed that years later, I'm still discovering new stuff. (And I'm talking about the vanilla game, too, but with the number of well-executed mods available, I'm pretty sure I'll be able to play this game indefinitely.)I've also played Morrowind and Oblivion (and their related DLCs & add-ons), and even though I've heard many times that others think Morrowind was the best and the games have gone downhill from there, Skyrim is my favorite of the bunch, hands down. Part of that is the graphics, which are *vastly* improved over Oblivion, part of it's the game mechanics (I like the magic, the skill level-up system, and the radiant system much better than what the earlier games had), and part of it's the story, which is rich and intense. (Well, rich and intense when you consider that such a wide-open world can't really support much more than a skeleton story. More rich and intense than Morrowind or Oblivion, let's put it that way.)Unlike most of the video games I've played and loved, Skyrim is a wide-open, non-linear game. So while we necessarily lose some of the depth of the plot and the characters, there are offsets. You can travel anywhere. You can (for the most part), explore caves/castles/crypts without receiving a quest first. And instead of leveling up by getting XP from doing quests, you get XP from using your skills...which aren't restricted to certain classes. So while Skyrim's story isn't nearly as immersive as many others', it's made up for by the fact that Skyrim's story is essentially a Choose Your Own Adventure. No two players' games will ever turn out exactly alike.I think I bought Skyrim for something like $60, and I'm pretty sure I paid full price for the three DLCs (Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn, all of which were well worth getting), and you know? I've more than gotten my money's worth. I'd easily pay that kind of money again for the amount of entertainment this game's brought me. But I was compelled to write this review when I realized that, at the moment, Skyrim Legendary (which includes all three official add-ons) is available for only $15, and it's an absolute steal for that price.Get this game. It's amazing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FI19MMEK7VVR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CJ7IUIQ#wasThisHelpful","R3FI19MMEK7VVR","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you’d asked me whether I could see  myself calling this series “searing” before I’d started this book, I probably would’ve thought you were kidding. I can think of many adjectives I would’ve applied to Yurt – all of them complimentary, don’t get me wrong – but one of the things I enjoyed so much about the books was…actually, I’m not sure I can explain this. The plots of the prior ones were intricate and well done, and increasingly thrilling, but I never lost my sense of “it’ll turn out alright in the end.” The excitement of the prior books was tempered by an affable tone, some well-placed humor, and a main character who refused to take himself too seriously. Boring, the series was certainly not, but at the same time, it didn’t exhaust me the way a book full of non-stop tension might.Never let it be said that I’m too hidebound to change my tune. Now I'm sitting here wondering if ""searing"" is strong enough!Is This Apocalypse Necessary is aptly named, I think, for if you think of Daimbert’s adventures in the prior books as skirmishes against enemies known and suspected, this is the last stand. All bets are off, and nothing will ever be the same again. Apocalypse starts off like a cannon shot and then keeps upping the ante, and for the first time in probably years, there was no question about going to bed before I’d read the last word.I wrote in my review for book five that the separate plots were starting to come together; if one paid attention, one got hints of an overarching story with its seeds planted in each of the standalone Yurt books, and I was excited to see if my suspicions about where the author was leading us were correct. Well, those suspicions were correct - in the sense that I’d be correct if I said “I’m expecting tomorrow’s weather to be a bit warmer”…the day before the planet gets knocked off course and flies into the sun. Apocalypse, indeed.I don’t want to give away too much, so…let’s just say I was surprised, several times, and delighted, and breathless, and my already-high estimation of C. Dale Brittain just got blasted into the stratosphere. I want to go back to my review of A Bad Spell in Yurt, where I smugly typed away about this new pleasantly light fantasy I’d just found, and point and laugh at what a doofus the me of two weeks ago was. Why most of this series is out of print, I don’t think I’ll ever understand.To say this series is “good” doesn’t do it justice, and Is This Apocalypse Necessary was so masterful that there’s no doubt that Yurt has a permanent spot on my (surprisingly short) list of all-time favorites. My only caution to potential readers is that you perhaps wait to start this final installment until you’ve got plenty of time to see it through to the end.Standing O, Ms. Brittain.PS: I would sell my own mother for a purple flying beast.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16HYOX6R707ET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HV2D5FM#wasThisHelpful","R16HYOX6R707ET","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would assume, if you're here, you've read books one through four in this series. (If you haven't, do. Especially since the reviews here might give away bits of the plots of the earlier books.)I would also assume that, provided you haven't totally lost your mind, you need very little persuasion to buy this.In DOM, Antonia, Daimbert's cute and precocious forbidden child, is staying over at the castle for the week. If only his biggest problem was an argument about bedtime! As we've all come to expect by now, something happens, and Daimbert finds himself wrapped up in several seemingly-unrelated puzzles that range from ""mild nuisance"" to ""threatens everything I hold dear.""It's in this book that the foreshadowing really ramps up. Each of the Yurt books is a self-contained story with years between them, and while I definitely recommend reading them in order, you won't be troubled by cliffhangers and I don't think you'd miss out on *too* much if you started the series in the middle. (But really: read them in order.) Nevertheless, there have been hints all along that there's an overarching plot simmering away in the background, one that's taking decades to come to fruition, and each successive book does a little more to advance it. It's in this one where we begin to see the separate threads really start to come together in an ominous way.Isn't it funny how a book can be ominous and so cheerful at the same time?I've written reviews for all the Yurt books, and if you were to go back and read them, I think you'd see them becoming progressively more enthusiastic about the series. What started out as a light diversion grew into something more; the setting has been colored in, the plots have gotten more intense, and the characters have grown into friends. If you're new to Yurt, I recommend it without reservation. And if you're not, you should probably stop wasting time on reviews and get reading, don't you think?","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20J7AOLHNATF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0056NUQIM#wasThisHelpful","R20J7AOLHNATF","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave the other Yurt novella, The Lost Girls and the Kobold, 3.5 stars. Though I rounded up, I was left feeling like there wasn't a whole lot of point to it.I'm most happy to report that this one didn't invoke the same vague sense of (admittedly mild) disappointment. Wizard's Tower, which takes place between books three and four, gives us another mystery or three, and it ties in nicely to the overall story arc, and it's written in the same style I've come to love. The only real difference between this one and the regular series novels is its length; TWT's plot is a short one that wraps up quickly. But while it's not as involved as Brittain's full length stories, I wouldn't call it shallow at all. It was exactly the right length.So, 4.5 stars, rounded up because this snack-sized Yurt adventure hit the spot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T8X4Z5ENE1D3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N823IME#wasThisHelpful","R2T8X4Z5ENE1D3","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Out of all the Yurt novels and novellas I've read - which is all of them except for book six - I probably liked this one the least.Don't get me wrong. I'm still giving it 3.5 stars and rounding up - it definitely wasn't bad! But one of the things I enjoyed so much about this series is how the characters have grown. In this one, there didn't seem to be a lot of growth. Instead of advancing the overall story arc in a meaningful way, or answering a question we readers had about the time that's passed in between books, it was just sort of a snapshot that didn't seem to serve a lot of purpose.But, it did mean another hour or two in Yurt, which is never a bad thing, and I'm not sorry to have read it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14ZTY48VXXHSH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GMPTU1M#wasThisHelpful","R14ZTY48VXXHSH","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wrestled with the score for this one. Had it not been free when I downloaded it, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have gone as high as four stars. The recipes themselves look fine, but this is probably the most un-fancy, quick-and-dirty cookbook I think I've ever seen.To the good, we're talking about cookies. Some of these get pretty creative, and combine flavors in ways I might not have thought to do myself. I've read other reviews stating the recipes aren't original. I'm certainly not going to spend my time trying to prove those reviewers right or wrong, but I will say that a lot of them sound pretty original to me. Not all, certainly, and even some of the funkier recipes can probably be found online in some version or other - what can't? - but there's a benefit to having them all compiled in one place.Also good, there are a lot of recipes. (Or, at least a lot when you consider the book is, at the moment, free.) 45, if we're being specific. 21 are for cookies, 19 are for bars/brownies, and 5 are frostings. That's a lot of dessert!But the weirdest thing about this? The thing that guaranteed this book could never be worth five stars? There are no YIELDS! You don't know before making it whether a recipe is going to give you one dozen cookies, three dozen, fifty dozen... (Well, OK, we can be relatively sure we won't get that many. At no point are we instructed to purchase industrial equipment or organize a team of church volunteers for an assembly line.) Joking aside, isn't that kind of critical information? I suppose the author could make the argument that rolling your cookies out into a different size will change the yield, but...some of the recipes even say ""roll into 1"" balls."" And the author still can't tell us how many cookies we're going to get?The overall impression I get is of a cookbook author who slapped the contents of her granny's index cards into a word document and called it a cookbook. Do these recipes look good? Yes. Are they creative? Yes, many of them are. Am I going to make them? Most certainly! But could the author have done a more professional job? Oh yeah.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SMH6U21S956I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C9J5RIU#wasThisHelpful","R3SMH6U21S956I","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We're getting to the point in this series where I'm no longer sure it's even worth it to write a review. I mean, this is book four. Either you've been reading the series in order - in which case I hardly think you need my help deciding whether to keep going - or you haven't, in which case you probably ought to head over to the page for book one (link: A Bad Spell in Yurt (The Royal Wizard of Yurt Book 1)) and start there.But, since I'm here...A Bad Spell in Yurt, and to some extent, The Wood Nymph and the Cranky Saint (The Royal Wizard of Yurt Book 2), are a bit like a skeleton. They started the framework for the series. Entertaining, if a bit superficial. In Mage Quest (The Royal Wizard of Yurt Book 3) and now this one, it's like the author has taken her sketch and colored it in, and it's becoming clear that this lady is a real artist. The characters have deepened. The plots have started to feel more sinister. And I realize how much I've come to care about Yurt and its inhabitants.So maybe it's good that I decided to write a review after all - it gives me the chance to speak to those who read book one, and maybe book two, and are skipping ahead to see whether the series is worth continuing. My opinion? It just keeps getting better and better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T05SJ04RSNDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050US1II#wasThisHelpful","R2T05SJ04RSNDV","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was skeptical of this series at first. I hadn't heard of the author before, but although the blurb made the A Bad Spell in Yurt (book one) sound right up my alley, I wasn't sure whether to believe the fair number of lukewarm-to-negative reviews it received. But, it was deeply discounted, so...what the [heck].Obviously I enjoyed that one, since I continued on through the sequel to pick this one - book three in the series - up. And you know what? I've fallen head-over-heels in love with Yurt and Daimbert and the King. And even Joachim, the royal chaplain whom I didn't care for at ALL in the beginning.I said in my earlier reviews that I found books one and two to be very light. Not fluffy, exactly, but a bit comical, and not stressful at all; even when the things are at their bleakest for Daimbert, I felt placid. This one? It was...less light. Don't get me wrong: the tone is much the same as in the earlier books, so if you enjoyed Brittain's writing in those, I'm pretty confident you'll continue to like it. But in Mage Quest, the intensity ramps up considerably...in a good way.Brittain's technique of inserting a mystery into her fantasy world - or rather, a cluster of little mini-mysteries - has become familiar by now, and I think she outdoes herself here. In MQ, the king of Yurt decides it's high time he goes on a quest, and in true Yurt fashion, pretty much the entire court cheerfully clamors to go along. Those selected each have their own reasons for traveling, and the way a half dozen quests all tie together in the end was a delight.I particularly enjoyed the way the various characters have developed - and continue to develop - through the series. Though I enjoyed it, I thought the characters in book one were rather superficial. By now, they've really started to come into their own, and I'm impressed at how the author managed to flesh them out while still maintaining the breezy writing style I like so much.Mage Quest may not be perfect, but it's the closest yet. I wish I had found these books years ago!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KJBNEVMVTO8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VWL76E#wasThisHelpful","R1KJBNEVMVTO8Q","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you've read A Bad Spell in Yurt, which is book one in this series, you're familiar with the author's style, and this book is much the same. Actually, I'm not sure whether it's because this book is better or if it's just that I'm more in tune with the author's writing, but I think I liked this one a bit better than book one.The Wood Nymph takes place a couple years after the events in ABSIY. Daimbert has settled into his role as Royal Wizard nicely, and seems a bit less stressed about his less-than-stellar grasp of magic. His friendship with Joachim, the Royal Chaplain, is comfortable, and he's still got a teensy little enormous crush on the most unavailable woman in the kingdom. All in all, things are nice.Well, we can't have that, can we?In the beginning chapters, the king and queen have gone on vacation, leaving the Royal Heir in charge. So when Joachim asks for company on a short trip for some church business, Daimbert readily agrees...and from there, things degenerate into the chaos we probably ought to have expected.ABSIY was ultimately a mystery. This one is too...or rather, it's several little mysteries all wrapped up in one little package. Where did the great horned rabbits come from? Who's the stranger the duchess seems to have taken such a shine to? Where did the monster come from? Does the cranky saint want to leave his valley or not? And what in the world does the wood nymph have to do with all this?I read several reviews of book one written by readers who were disappointed in how un-comical they thought ABSIY was; they thought they were getting a comic fantasy and were surprised at how dark or intense or something it got. Now, I didn't think that at all; even though Daimbert very nearly died in book one (it's not a spoiler if there's a sequel, right?), the tone of the whole book seemed pleasantly jovial to me...and while I didn't think it was funny in the sense that I was laughing out loud, I did a lot of smiling. It was light. It was breezy. It didn't stir up a great deal of emotion. I found it to be a happy escape.The Wood Nymph has a similar tone throughout most of the book, but I will say that the ending was darker and more intense than the previous book. If you were one who thought book one was a bit too dark, you'll probably think that even more about this one.To recap a portion of my review of book one, since it's relevant: I had two issues with ABSIY. The first was the importation of Christianity into a fantasy kingdom. The Yurt universe doesn't just have a religion that resembles Christianity, it has actual Christianity. It felt like a jarring sort of anachronism; the immersion in reading a fantasy book set in a made up world full of wizards and royalty and dragons and stuff evaporated when Joachim would start going on about Christ dying for their sins. In The Wood Nymph, I will say that although that aspect didn't change or go away, I found it less...unharmonious. I suppose I just got used to it, but in any case, it didn't bother me nearly as much.My other issue, though, persisted. Daimbert was (is?) at times a hard character to relate to. This came up in several respects, but probably the most grating was his interpersonal relationships. Daimbert simply doesn't react to other people the way I would. In book one, the primary manifestation of this was in his friendship with Joachim - Daimbert decided that they shall be friends, and he spent the rest of the book taking that for granted...even though Brittain didn't portray the priest as particularly likeable. I couldn't figure out why Daimbert *wanted* to be his friend. Like the religion thing, I guess I made my peace with the chaplain, because I didn't find him nearly as unpleasant in this book. (He rather grew out of his piousness, which no doubt made a difference.) No, but now, Daimbert has a new ducal wizard to contend with, a young man he'd gone to school with named Evrard. I think the author was trying for cheerful and impish, but Evrard mostly struck me as rude and exasperating. I could understand to a point why Daimbert would want to have a good relationship with his colleague, after two years of only having the priest around to talk to, but I lost my patience with Evrard about five minutes after Daimbert and I both met him, and it was hard to understand how Daimbert could be so...forgiving.Daimbert's slightly dissonant personal relationships might not have been such a big issue for me had the book not been written in first person. The advantage of a first person story is that we're right there in the main character's head. When being right there in his head still isn't enough to relate to his thought processes, then we've got a problem.Eh. I'm giving this four stars, so clearly it's an overlookable problem. I won't call this book perfect any more than I thought ABSIY was perfect, but it was still a fairly light, amusing, pleasant couple of days of entertainment. If you liked the first book, you'll almost certainly like this one too.And now that I've typed a review that's longer than the book itself, I'm off to go read book three.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O0ZJHL7U99G7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S3CW88#wasThisHelpful","R3O0ZJHL7U99G7","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently won a copy of this book in a giveaway (not by the publisher), and I was excited to receive it. Looking at it, however, I'm beginning to think that I wouldn't have purchased it for myself, even though I'm always on the lookout for new vegetarian recipes. I don't think this cookbook is really intended for a cook like me. But, I'll explain why and you can decide for yourself how applicable my opinion is.I rarely buy cookbooks online – mostly because it's so impossible to tell what it is you're going to get; a promising title might yield nothing appetizing. For example, because of the title, you may have been under the impression that this book focuses on root vegetables. (Not really, FYI.) So, in an effort to help you decide whether this book has food you're interested in making, I'm listing the recipes. (Just so you know, I'm shortening/paraphrasing some of the recipe titles, some of which got pretty long. I tried to capture the essential character of the recipe, but it's not word for word.)The book is divided into five sections: spring, early summer, late summer, autumn, and winter. I thought that was particularly clever of the author; a plant-based cookbook is going to be very seasonal, but I haven't run across any other arranged in such a manner. Within each section, the recipes are grouped into four categories: “mornings,” “small measures,” “mains,” and “sweets.” Here they are:SPRING (20 recipes) – (Mornings) Strawberry coconut milkshake, Carrot rhubarb muffins, Freekeh pancakes, Strawberry chia jam, Dark chocolate cherry oats; (Small measures) Olive caraway bread, Cabbage wraps with couscous, Pickled turnips, Turnip and radish salad, Savory spring hand pies, Dandelion greens with poached radishes; (Mains) Oyster mushroom bisque, Quinoa risotto, Black lentil salad, Wild rice with pistachios and vegetables, Socca with asparagus/dill/feta; and (Sweets) Macaroons, Apricot rhubarb clafoutis, Strawberry chamomile frozen yogurt, Sunflower sesame brittle.EARLY SUMMER (18 recipes) – (Mornings) Rooibos ginger tea, Carrot cake porridge, Tempeh mushroom breakfast bowl, Breakfast bars; (Small measures) Sorrel hummus, Labneh with rose petals, Carrot top and garlic scape pesto, Grilled zucchini and green onions, Ginger ale; (Mains) Onion/olive/kale calzones, Arugula salad, Polenta with fennel, Thai coconut soup with zucchini noodles, Fava and pea soup; and (Sweets) Mint chip ice cream sandwiches, Blondies, Raspberry macadamia cookies, Pina colada popsicles.LATE SUMMER (21 recipes) – (Mornings) Raspberry smoothie, Cashew yogurt, Cornmeal pancakes, Blueberry cardamom chia pudding; (Small measures) Melonade, Grape salsa, Zucchini cornbread, Red pepper walnut dip, Tomatoes with olives and bread, Carrot and corn salad, Lentil salad; (Mains) Coconut bacon lettuce tomato sandwich, Cucumber nigella spelt salad, Glazed eggplant, Hemp tabbouleh, Buchwheat crepes with purple string bean slaw; (Sweets) Blueberry lemon anise cantuccini, Berry volcano cake, Key lime coconut tarts, Grilled peaches, Ice creamAUTUMN (20 recipes) – (Mornings) Vanilla rose apple cider, Smoothie bowl, Hazelnut flatbreads, Spinach/bacon/egg salad, Fig/buckwheat tart; (Small measures) Onion lentil soup, Cashew cheese, Celeriac salad, Pan bagnat, Roasted squash; (Mains) White bean fondue, Cauliflower with lentils and kaniwa, Forest floor flatbread, Chocolate chili, Roasted pumpkin; (Sweets) Pear/apple/blackberry crumble, Upside-down plum cake, Walnut fig bars, Chocolate night sky, Banoffee pie.WINTER (19 recipes) – (Mornings) Chaga tea, Chaga hot chocolate, Banana bread granola, Roasted grapefruit, Breakfast tacos, Cranberry carrot loaf; (Small measures) Fennel/grapefruit/cabbage/avocado salad, Beets with orange/pine nuts, Glazed roasted parsnips, Tie-dye soup; (Mains) Lentil soup, Butternut stacks with pesto/kasha/butter beans, Leek scallops and mushrooms, Kale sushi rolls; (Sweets) Eggnog milkshake, Pecan/cranberry pie, Poached pears, Chocolate chip cookies, Orange chocolate cake.The primary reason I'm only giving this book three stars is because of the sorts of recipes in it – they stray a bit too far toward the exotic for me. I have to think a cookbook author has it rough. Keep too close to the basics, and your cookbook won't have anything new in it and people won't like it...but get too creative, and you end up with complicated recipes using funky ingredients that are more trouble than they're worth, and people won't like it.Now, I should clarify what I mean by “too exotic.” I'm all for interesting new foods, and new flavor combinations, and new eating experiences. However, I live in a fairly small city that doesn't have a specialty grocery. To give you an idea of what I have to work with: the “international market” is a three foot section of shelving at the local grocery store...that's mostly full of taco shells and soy sauce. Glancing through the book, I see recipes calling for pea shoots, and food grade rose petals, and celeriac...I cannot make these recipes. Now, I don't want to give the impression that all of the recipes call for hard to find ingredients, because that's not true at all. And if you live in a place that has a more robust produce selection than I do, then there won't be any problem at all. (Other than the fact that I'm brimming with envy.) And some of the funky ingredients are shelf-stable things that can be ordered online...though I'm always a bit hesitant to buy something that I'm only going to use a tablespoon of.But that's probably secondary to my next point, which is: I am a lazy cook. I work hard, my time is precious to me, and I'm only cooking for myself. This means that I don't need recipes that are fancy or impressive. I need recipes that I can make with a fair amount of certainty that they're going to be satisfying. I need recipes that are quick to execute and that don't get every dish in the cupboard dirty. Now, again, I don't want to give you the impression that the recipes are unusually complex. It's just...the focus of the book seems to be skewed toward creativity, toward stuff I wouldn't have necessarily thought to try on my own, and that's a wonderful thing. But when you get right down to it, we all know I'm going to get home from work, look at the beautiful photos accompanying the inspired recipe of my choice, sigh wistfully because it looks so wonderful, and make a cheese sandwich.I'm disappointed by the number of beverage recipes, although I'm happy to be disagreed with. I don't want a recipe for tea, no matter how unusual the flavor combinations. I also wish the cookbook had provided nutritional information on its recipes, although there are notations for vegan, gluten free, etc. recipes, which could be helpful for some.However, I have learned that one of my talents is gauging how well I'll like a recipe just from reading it, and some of these sound excellent. I have wild rice soaking as I type for the wild rice and pistachio salad.I do feel like I ought to praise the look and feel of the book. It's printed on a beautiful heavy, matte paper, and contains some amazing photos.Anyway, the TL;DR version of all this is that if a cookbook is going to get five stars from me, it needs to call primarily for ingredients that I have ready access to, and it needs to wow me with the easy ways of preparing and combining those ingredients for a consistently tasty result. And I'll tell you the truth: that's hard to find. I know I'm not an easy customer to please. But, that's why I probably wouldn't have bought this book for myself.

"I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into, buying this, with all the tepid reviews over on Goodreads. Happily, I enjoyed it.ABSIY is comic fantasy, along the lines of Diana Wynne Jones or Robert Asprin. In it, a recent graduate of the wizard school applies for a job as the royal wizard of a tiny kingdom named Yurt...and he gets it. Unfortunately, he wasn't a terribly good student, so when he arrives at the royal castle to find sinister goings-on - the ""bad spell"" of the title - he doesn't really have the expertise to deal with them.[Note: What follows may include some (mild) spoilers. I'm certainly not giving away the ending, but I am complaining a bit, and it's hard to do that without getting specific.]I want to be clear that I really did enjoy this, quite a lot, but I'm not going to pretend it's perfect. The character development was lacking, for one thing. Daimbert (and BTW, I don't think I really registered the MC's name until the very end - the book is told in first person, and pretty much no one ever calls him by name...seems to me that not drilling the protagonist's name into your readers counts as a negative of its own) is sometimes pretty hard to relate to. He alternates between terrified determination and awkward ridiculousness - which works well for him - but some of his thoughts and actions are a bit incomprehensible. When a book is written in first person, one would hope that you'd come away understanding every nuance of the main character's motivations. In this book, though, I found myself wondering more than once why he was behaving the way he was.One example might be the chaplain. When Daimbert - it still feels weird typing that name, like I ought to be calling him ""Wizard"" or ""Whippersnapper"" - arrives at the castle, he makes up his mind that the chaplain, a young man near his own age, shall become his friend. The author then proceeds to make the chaplain fairly unlikeable, obnoxiously pious with zero sense of humor, who goes on and on at great length about evil influences. Yet, Daimbert never wavers in his decision that the chaplain - funny, now I can't seem to recall his name, either - is now his closest friend. It was odd.Not all the characters were like that. I rather liked the king and queen, I liked the duchess, I enjoyed the old wizard, and Lady Maria was entertaining. But if you're after characters with depth and nuance, you won't find them in this book. Even the characters I grew fond of were pretty flat.I also wondered about the idea that Daimbert was left to deal with the Bad Spell by himself. Now sure, I could understand him being reluctant to ask for help - he was quite determined to not let on how over his head he was. But...are we really to believe the more experienced characters were willing to risk the kingdom since it wasn't their problem? That seemed unlikely to me.Possibly the oddest aspect of this book was the religion. Now, I read lots of fantasy. LOTS. I feel quite at home in worlds where religion plays a large role. Thing is, in most of those worlds, the religion is...made up. I mean, sure, it probably resembles the religions we're familiar with, but it's still imaginary. In ABSIY, Brittain imports Christianity. Like, actual, unadulterated, regular Christianity. It was very startling; to hear a chaplain from a magical kingdom in another world talk about Christ dying for all their sins invoked a dissonance that jarred me right out of the story.Yet, you'll see I still rated the book four stars. If ABSIY's imperfections were to turn another reader off - which it evidently has, if Goodreads is any indication - I would fully understand. However, I still liked it. Kind of a lot. Do you ever have days where you don't want to read/watch/play/think about anything intense, or scary, or deep? Where all you want is something light and a bit mindless into which you can escape for a few hours? Because I do. (Regularly.) And this book turned out to be exactly what the doctor ordered. It was cute. It was funny - in a gentle-smile sort of way rather than a laugh-out-loud way. It was entertaining. And Yurt, the setting, was delightful.So, a masterpiece this is not. But if you're in the mood for a light comic fantasy along the lines of Howl's Moving Castle or Myth Adventures, you might enjoy this as much as I did. (And if you're wondering, at the 50% mark I still wasn't sure whether I wanted to continue the series. By the time it was done, though, I had book 2 bought and waiting for me.)EDIT: I came back to edit this because I wanted you all to know - I did buy and read book two. And three, four, and five, and I'm in the middle of book six right now. This review is like most of my reviews; even when I like something, I still tend to call out the various ways it could've been better. So while I'm not apologizing for that, and while I still think the book is a solid four stars, I feel like I ought to let you all know that man, does this series get better! The author keeps her same cheerful tone, but the setting fills in, the characters deepen...this series has turned out to be one I'll be re-reading time and time again. This book is good. Later, they get great.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R7O123JKX4Q2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S2CPM2#wasThisHelpful","R3R7O123JKX4Q2","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This mix is truly outstanding. It's got the perfect balance between sweet and salty with a little tang from the fruit thrown in for complexity. It's almost got a buttery taste to it, like a really good fresh pastry. I'm a bit astonished that I had the willpower to only eat half the bag in one sitting.I may have moaned.Only reason I'm giving it four stars is the price. I almost wish I hadn't tried these because there's no way I can afford to blow four bucks on a bag of nuts that would take me all of 20 seconds to inhale if I were to give in to my base urges...which, let's face it, I probably would; the leaving-half-for-tomorrow thing was a fluke.If you can afford buying these in quantity, go for it.

"In my review for Super Powereds: Year 1, I wrote about how astonished I was to discover a book that was just. that. good. This series might not have sounded like my thing at first, but I decided to give it a shot based on the strength of Hayes's writing in one of his other books (NPCs, which, incidentally, I recommend). I'm so glad I did; SP1 was long and involved and meaty and totally riveting.I've read lots of decent books lately, and several darn good ones, but seriously: it was stay-up-till-1-a.m.-even-though-you-have-to-get-up-in-four-hours riveting.I'm pleased to report that SP2 is just as wonderful. All of the things I loved about the first one continued seamlessly. Love the characters, love the story, love the complexity and the intricacies and the length, and I have to say, I'm super-impressed by how well the author does intrigue.I feel the need to comment on the reviews that refer to the poor editing. For real, I hate badly-edited books. They don't just distract me, they actually have started to make me angry - angry at the author for thinking he or she has any right to collect my money for a slipshod product. Here? I just don't see it. Yes, there were some mistakes. (Not the all-too-common ""this author has absolutely no idea how to wield an apostrophe"" mistakes, but more like typos. Missing words, the occasional ""too"" instead of ""to,"" that kind of thing.) I didn't find them particularly numerous or distracting, though. I can't decide if it's because there really aren't that many errors or if it's just that I was so enraptured by the story that they slipped past my vigilance, but...bad editing aggravates me. This book didn't aggravate me at all. Just the opposite, in fact.If you've started the Super Powereds series with book one, I doubt you need any recommendation to finish it. If you liked it, you'll like this one just as much. If it wasn't your cup of tea (which I have a hard time imagining), whatever bugged you about it is probably going to be in this one too. If you haven't read SP1, I really really recommend it; I thought both it and this book were outstanding.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLX2Q82TTNWVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GJXA45S#wasThisHelpful","RLX2Q82TTNWVX","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was prepared to be disappointed by this, considering it was a blind buy - I had no idea whether it would work or if it was actually stinky.I'm actually a bit impressed.First: the scent. I don't really get any hint of either thyme or fig from this, which is one reason it's not getting five stars. I was really expecting something green and herbal smelling, and it's not even close. Nevertheless, it does NOT stink. The predominant fragrance seems to be apple. Not a fake-smelling perfumey apple, but like what an actual Granny Smith smells like when you slice it. And while it's primarily a fruit scent, there's enough complexity - floral, other fruits, maybe the barest hint of some sort of pastry - that I can definitely call it both pleasant and interesting.It's got moderate-to-poor staying power. When I tested it on fabric, the smell had dissipated considerably ten minutes later...but the notes left behind were almost more pleasant than the original blast. There was some smell left, and it was just enough to smell nice without giving the impression that I had whipped out the fabric freshener.As to its claims of odor neutralization, it's not terrible.

Not filthy, but not freshly laundered, either, and when I sniffed them up close - BTW, I'm so glad no one was around to see me doing this stuff - well, let's just say you could tell they'd been worn. I got the fabric damp on the outside without using so much it could soak through. The spray didn't completely neutralize the old jeans smell, but they did smell much fresher 15 minutes later - fresher in a way that makes me think the spray actually did something with those weird all-natural ingredients besides cloak the odor with fragrance.(Grain of salt: I've been told I don't have the keenest nose around. I won't argue with anyone who says they can perceive the fragrance more keenly or for longer than I did. So if you're particularly sensitive to smells, you may want a second opinion.)All in all, this was not the disappointment I thought it'd be.

"If we're being extra precise - which, as an accountant, I tend to be - I'd give this book 4.5 stars. To translate that, let's just say that while I can see where others might find fault, the book's general excellence carried the story at a pace that allowed me to overlook the sorts of things that might otherwise bug me.I bought this book after reading another of this author's: NPCs. NPCs is one of those books you buy because it sounds lightly amusing and, since you're feeling a little frisky with that $0.99 rattling around in your pocket, well, why not? And it turned out to be the sort of book that made my obnoxious smugness evaporate about a chapter in because, holy cow, this author knows how to write! I point this out because, while I don't know if I would have been drawn to Super Powereds had I not already had a sampling of what this guy can do, I was delighted enough to take a chance on what might not normally have been my thing.I'm very glad I did.My reviews are generally on the critical side; while I have a hard time, sometimes, articulating what was so great about a story, I have no such hard time pointing out where one falls short. And even for an outstanding book, there's always something, right? This review won't be an exception to that trend, but understand that what follows are quibbles that, while about stuff that might bug others, were not enough to get me to round down to four stars. That says something right there.One of those quibbles might be about the pacing. This is a meaty book. This is not one of those stories that just hits the important parts and lets you fill in the rest. No, this is a story with everyday conversations, everyday activities (well, as everyday as they can be, considering they're superheroes)...and for five main characters, not just one. I can easily imagine people making suggestions as to how the writing might have been tightened up so that we're not left reading this sprawling gargantuan story that's only book one out of what I assume will be four. ""Pfft,"" I say to that. This wasn't a story that boiled over and went wild (i.e. this wasn't one of those stories where the author throws everything but the kitchen sink in because he or she can't discern which bits are important). No, I get the impression that the author purposely wrote with density in mind, and I'm glad he did. It's long, it's detailed, it's wordy...but the length and the details and the words are all good. Then again, maybe I'm just the sort of person who likes a long, involved story.Another one might have to do with the characters. Now, I liked the characters in general. All of them, really, and with a book this vast, that's impressive. Nevertheless, there were occasions when, for example, a more minor character hasn't had a POV in so long that I'd almost forgotten about him or her. There were a few that approached the stereotypical category; one was unfailingly good-hearted, another was the very epitome of jerkishness. Or, there's the fact that we have so, so many unique characters with their own talents and personalities but who all have regular college kid names, and a ""wait, who now?"" would pop up while they're being juggled. Again, though, these are quibbles. I think the author did a pretty terrific job with them overall.The plot is a good one. Even though the general idea isn't new - I've read books with a lot of similarities - it felt pretty fresh. It wasn't a non-stop, edge-of-your-chair ride (which is good; a book can't be too constantly thrilling when it's this long or it just ends up feeling too busy and stressful), but the author a achieved a very nice balance between action, dialogue, and exposition.I was very impressed with the ending. Obviously, one expects a climax in this sort of story. We got one, but...it really wasn't what I expected. Or rather, the part that I expected happened, but it was immediately overshadowed by a much more climactic surprise. It's been a long time since I've had a real ""Holy [crap], it can't be bedtime yet!"" moment. That was fun.I've read other reviews that mention the editing, or lack thereof, and wanted to address those. I read one of those reviews before buying this one (I tend to skip the good reviews and jump straight to the bad ones so as to see whether the others' deal-breakers are the same as my deal-breakers), and admit, I was a little nervous. Poor editing actually gets me angry these days; if I'm going to buy an author's book, I expect him or her to have enough respect for me to make it worth buying. That worry was groundless. I did catch a couple mistakes - of the typo persuasion, which is a little easier to forgive, since we all make them - but I'm talking about maybe two or three over the whole ninety-two million page book. (Could there have been more I didn't catch? Certainly...and if that's the case, it says something that the book was so engrossing that I didn't catch them. I *always* catch them.) Perhaps there was an earlier edition that had more errors in it?Since this is getting ridiculously long, I'll just finish up by saying that I found Super Powereds a delightful, engrossing read from an author who clearly is really, really good at what he does. Do yourself a favor and check his stuff out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLN1VLG8YHDEY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BIJ05F2#wasThisHelpful","RLN1VLG8YHDEY","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You know, I thought the premise sounded amusing, but I was truly not prepared for how delightful this book was!I've never played a pen-and-paper role playing game; I thought they sounded like fun as a kid, but didn't know anyone else who was into that kind of thing. A little older and I was too ashamed to admit to liking something so nerdy...and then I discovered video games. Even though I'm not the stereotypical gamer, I like a game with a good strong storyline for the same reason I like reading well-written fantasy: it's a chance to immerse myself in a magical world, and the best games do it like a Choose Your Own Adventure. (Remember those?)Sadly, many of the books I've tried that are based on a D&D-style storyline just don't cut it. The ""rules"" that make a lot of sense in a game get cumbersome in a book, and things like characters and the depth of the plot are sometimes less developed than they should be. Too often they just sound like something that would be better if you could play it, like a you-had-to-have-been-there moment.Not sadly, this was not one of those.The author was completely transparent about basing this on an RPG; the whole story is built on a real-world frame of five obnoxious kids playing a pen-and-paper game, and the author frequently pokes lighthearted fun at the game structure that any of us who've played them for any real length of time probably don't even notice anymore. It really was a very funny book. One of those jabs was at the traditional party structure - a standard RPG party of adventurers contains a fighter, a rogue, a magic-user, and a healer because those four classes cover the bases. It's both an interesting look at stereotypes and a mockery of the way character races gravitate toward certain classes.I was a little nervous about the writing going in. I hadn't heard of this author before, and there are SO many e-books written by people who never really grasped the mechanics of telling a story well. I needn't have been; I thought the book was very well-written and I enjoyed the author's style enormously. It wouldn't have surprised me if the author's voice and sense of humor had started to grow old - again, it happens a little too often, and what starts out charming starts to grate before too long - but it never did. And I KNOW I don't need to mention the epidemic of editing fails going around lately. This book was definitely edited. I think I caught two mistakes.This was a very quick read. (Too quick? Only 'cause it was so good.) The plot itself was impressively well-paced, with a perfect scope for the length, and a terrific balance of action, discussion, and exposition. The main storyline is tied up neatly - I do so hate cliffhangers - but instead of a happily ever after, the author leaves plenty of room for the continuing adventures of the NPCs. I really, really hope we get to continue their adventures!I've been trying to decide whether people who aren't into role playing games would enjoy this, or even get it, and I'm inclined to think they would. While the universe is along the lines of Drizzt's or Elminster's (though to be clear, this is not set in the Forgotten Realms) or the Dragonlance books, it probably reminded me most of the comedic fantasy of Jig the goblin in Goblin Quest, with flavors of Robert Asprin and Xanth without the puns.I'm either off to see what else this author has written - he's seriously got some chops - or maybe I'll dust off Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter Nights; NPCs really reminded me why I liked those games so much. As for you, I say you should try it...and if you're not a ""gamer"" but find you like it, then maybe that's a suggestion that you ought to give an RPG a try and find out for yourself what it's like to be an adventurer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KMUTYGVZE37L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KB2RLKO#wasThisHelpful","R1KMUTYGVZE37L","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You know, when I write a review, I tend to be critical. Possibly overly critical. Just because I enjoy a book doesn't mean I'm going to ignore the ways it may have fallen short.This series came out of nowhere and muscled my way onto my favorites list. For the first time in a loooooong time, I seriously had nothing bad to say about Night Calls. I was able to point out a few things I thought might bother other readers, but that was all the criticism I could muster up. Alfreda Sorensson isn't the only one with magic; Kimbriel has the touch.Then I read Kindred Rites (Night Calls Book 2), and if it's possible, I may have liked that one even better. It was a bit more suspenseful, but still maintained the slow, detailed, rich tone that so drew me in to Night Calls. Alfreda is a bit older, a bit wiser, and knows quite a bit more about working her craft, but she's still the same young, practical, precocious child who gets in over her head, gets on with things anyway, and with whom you have no choice but to fall in love.Except now I'm a little torn.Like books one and two, Spiral Path covers a very short period of time that nevertheless feels...bottomless. All of them are so well-crafted that even though we may only spend a few months at a time with Alfreda and Marta and the others, there's so much detail that it's like you're living right along with them. There are those who don't care for detail when it comes at the expense of action, but in this case you don't read the story, you drop into the pages and live it.So why am I torn? Because there's no resolution. Or, to be more clear, even though there's a conclusion to the specific adventures that make up the Spiral Path storyline - this does not end with some manipulative cliffhanger - we cannot be done with Alfreda yet. She's barely just gotten to school. She's barely explored her feelings for Shaw. We haven't helped Margaret, or gotten to know Esme's professors, or learned the implications of the unicorn.In other words: there's so much of everything left to do!It's been over 15 years between the releases of books two and three! Don't get me wrong. Spiral Path was a sheer delight to read. I certainly recommend reading the series - as if you needed the recommendation if you've already read NC1 & 2 - but good grief, make it last for your own sake, or you'll end up feeling as bereft as I am right now.Huh.

"I probably would've rated it higher had the plot not seemed so, well, thin. And holey. And a bit ridiculous. More than once, when a question was answered or something was revealed, my face got that scrunched-up, skeptical look that means ""well that's an...interesting...direction to take things."" (That's what it means when I'm being extra-diplomatic, anyway.)In other words, without getting into spoiler territory, Miller made some odd choices - ones that I think hurt the story. The writing technique, though - the language itself - was well done.If you're after a torrid romance, you won't find it here. Any romantic themes are essentially an afterthought. (I don't consider that a bad thing, BTW. A light touch with the heat is often an improvement.)It wasn't terrible, and it's free, so I guess just see for yourself.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QSRVWHH71591/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C54UVCQ#wasThisHelpful","R2QSRVWHH71591","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're here, you've hopefully read Night Calls (if you haven't yet, start there), and probably need very little prompting from me to continue learning and growing along with Alfreda.I don't know that there's much to say other than Kindred Rights continues along in the same style as NC1, with the same masterful writing and the continuance of the delightful plot. I'd judge this volume to be more suspenseful than the first; Kindred Rights has a bit more of the typical how's-she-going-to-get-herself-out-of-this-one plot, although there's still plenty of the serenity that made NC1 so wonderful. If you liked the first book, there's no doubt in my mind you'll enjoy this one too.If I had to choose between which volume I liked better, I think this one has a slight edge. Very slight, really, because I have nothing bad to say about Night Calls. There's more suspense here, like I mentioned, and Alfreda has matured quite a bit, both emotionally and in the craft, which allowed the author even more latitude to spin a yarn. (Book three was just released today, and even though I'm not very far in, I have a hunch that one might surpass both its predecessors in sheer entertainment value.)It's been a long time since I've stumbled across a series that has me as excited as this one. Start with book one if you haven't met Alfreda yet...but if you have, for goodness's sake, stop reading reviews and start reading the book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M2GJN1PPTYVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYPRITK#wasThisHelpful","R2M2GJN1PPTYVN","AL7R5LO0AUGKQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL7R5LO0AUGKQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am coming to feel, after listening to Paul Desmond for over forty years, that he might just be the most melodic improviser in the history of jazz. Even Bird at his finest doesn't make PD sound anything less than what he was: a phenomenally gifted musician who almost never wanked at all. Just pure melody, all the time, which as any player will tell you is the hardest thing for an improvising musician to achieve. And this collection of Paul Simon tunes---one of the most melodic of all pop composers---is exactly as wonderful as one would expect. I love it more than any other Desmond album.I first got this on vinyl in the mid-1980s, finding it for 99 cents one fine summer day in the bargain bin of some used record and antique emporium in our little town. I brought it home, opened the windows and put it on loud so as to hear it with some very music-loving friends in the yard, where we were relaxing with a few cocktails. It should be mentioned here that Desmond was a prolific drinker, almost legendary according to his contemporaries, yet even though I have over twenty of his solo records and dozens with longtime cohort Brubeck, plus a whole bunch of bootleg tapes of Desmond in various live situations, I can't find one place where he sounds hammered. Happily floating, yes, all the time! But never really ripped. Which, coming from a guy who said he wanted to sound ""like a dry martini"", is pretty impressive. He knew how to lay back like few others ever have, and I can't even imagine him overplaying: how many jazz guys can you say that about?So there we are, lying in the sun on a perfect July day with icy margaritas perched on our stomachs, and this almost ridiculously sublime music wafts out the window. I wasn't yet a CTI nut, but when I saw Herbie and Ron listed on the colorful cover, I knew it would at least be solid. Yet HH's gorgeous Rhodes piano, enveloped in pizzicato strings, seemed somehow sweeter than usual when the first track started, and when Desmond's incomparably evanescent alto tone came floating in on top, man, we were mesmerized. I always loved Simon, but this version of El Condor Pasa was another beast entirely. It ended so quickly that it seemed unfair. We wanted that one track alone to last an hour.To our delight, every cut was just as good, and some, like America and Mrs. Robinson, seemed to lift the beautifully matched melodies and lyrics, a Simon hallmark, to the place where dreams are made. The lyrics didn't need words; Desmond brought them to life with his incredibly tasteful lines and unmatched tone, and the songs took on new meaning. Even if you've never heard Old Friends before, you can practically hear the wistful lyrics in Desmond's carefully gentle reading of this lovely song. I've never heard Paul Simon the same way since, in fact, and I have little doubt that his shift towards jazz harmony and more complex writing in the early and mid-1970s was spurred in part from hearing on this 1969 record what truly gifted jazz musicians could do with his work; o how I wish Desmond had given this same treatment to Simon's flawless Still Crazy album.The sweetest music takes your brain and body to a place of true peace, and I challenge anyone to find a smoother jazz record than Desmond's BOTW...that isn't cheezy. Smooth jazz is now a category with its own radio stations and stars, but so much of it is just pap. Thus the term Smooth Jazz is often pejorative, yet check out this album and hear what smooooth can be at its very best. Simon's excellent melodies and relatively sophisticated harmonies, even at this early point in his career, were well above the pack, and the CTI arrangements here do them complete and utter justice, and then some. This may be mood music, but when the mood it puts you in is unfailingly happy and relaxed, and the musical quality is this high, I say bring on the mood music!Carter's supple bass, the delicate cymbal work of Airto et al, Herbie's very tasty Rhodes work, and the sweet but never saccharine strings make this one of the best CTI albums I know, GB etc included. Desmond gives them all lots of room to play, unlike some solo leaders, and they are clearly in his thrall, as they are all at their early best here. But when Paul comes floating in, you realize, dang, this guy plays more music by himself than most any full band. His touch with a melody can not be overstated. He embellishes every head with subtle flourishes and grace notes that bring the melody alive but never overwhelm it; you never forget what tune you're hearing, but he's still playing freely, if almost always well inside.Which might bother some for whom not going harmonically or melodically outside means it ain't jazz, but to my ears jazz is a feeling separate from those categories. It's a free, loose, happy, intelligent feeling, and that feeling is all over this fabulous album. Mrs. Robinson is a perfect example. That was a HUGE hit for S&G, and most cover versions are schmaltz and take the tune nowhere new. But man o man, this version is absolute heaven. It swings like crazy yet always feels tight and right, and PD tosses off melodic phrases like leaves in the autumn wind.Laying in the backyard that July day, my fellow music lovers and I looked at each other and smiled that special smile I used to see on the happy heads at the best '80s Dead shows, when Garcia was having one of those extra special nights. That look that says, we'll never be able to replicate this exact moment, so let's just luxuriate in it like dolphins in the ocean. This is what it's all about; this is why music is the best thing we know.And now, thirty years later, hearing the fine cd remaster of what has become my favorite Paul Desmond recording of nearly 100, I still get little shivers every time I put it on. I still prefer my old vinyl, pops and all, as it has a warmth that suits this music to a T, but the digital version is also very fine, gently remastered and not compressed, as so many now are; the Loudness War is anathema to this quality of gentle music, so thanks to the engineers for taking it easy on the digital levels. It's a short album, barely a half hour, but it bears being put on repeat for hours, as I often do while lying on the back porch sofa under the trees with my wonderful lady and our magnificent mutt, where it makes any day that much sweeter. I often think back to that July afternoon when I first heard this record, and hearing it takes me there in an instant. Very few records still hold that kind of sway over my mind, but Desmond's Bridge Over Troubled Water is so melodic, so tasteful, so smooth, so masterful, that I have never once tired of it in over three decades.If you have ANY interest in jazz, saxophone playing, inside improvisation, or just perfectly musical music, please do your ears a favor and get this album. It's still around in used record shops, as most jazz fans apparently see the cover and concept and pass it by; their loss, your gain! The gloriously colorful and hazy fold out cover is so apt for the music. I often spread it out and display it with other favorite vinyl covers on my Wall Of Joy, and when I see it I think of hundreds of perfect days and nights that have been made even finer with the addition of this music.I have no doubt that Paul Desmond is sitting beside God's favorite harp player in Heaven this very moment, and the endless Cocktail Party In The Sky goes on forever as everyone toasts Sir Desmond, one of the most musical musicians to ever grace our world. Thank you to PD for all of your shared musical gifts, and especially for this album, which despite being relatively unknown remains one of the most melodic slabs of joy my ears will ever know.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10FAZK8P3T0TN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013F3XLO#wasThisHelpful","R10FAZK8P3T0TN","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love solar anything, when it works, and this one does. It also charges via USB, and is of course much faster that way, because solar cells, while improving, are still along way from even 50% efficient conversion. Still, this will easily charge via sunlight if you leave it out all afternoon in bright sun.The other pluses here are that it's very light, amazingly so, in fact; it comes with a carabiner for carrying, and a nice loop; the USB cord can be tied up around that loop so you never forget it; and the rubber case is quite solid. And the battery works just fine.The 5500 mah should charge most phones at least twice, and because this thing is so light and thin, it's easy to carry in your purse, etc. I keep the sample they sent us in the little console between our front car seats. The glove compartment gets way too hot to store any battery in, as heat discharges (and might even explode) any battery. Our console doesn't get hot at all, stays cooler than the car in fact, so it's a great place to keep this for emergency purposes. You can just leave it on your dash for charging as well.I'd have guessed this to cost 25 without solar and 35 with, so seeing it sell for 25 makes this an easy five stars. It feels solid and made to last, better than most portable batteries, and the rubber case and good construction make me think this might last quite a few years if kept fully charged all the time, as all batteries should be.At 25 bucks, this is a very good deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R297S39L094TID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNV8SRS#wasThisHelpful","R297S39L094TID","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Diffusers seem to be growing in popularity lately, and here's another in the long list. Unfortunately, this one has some drawbacks.The sample they sent had only a USB cord, so it can only be used near a computer. The cord is about 3 feet long, which is a decent length, but not being able to place this out of the way in a corner is a hassle. As is opening this to put in water; there is no easy method, you have to hold the whole thing in your hands and kind of pry the top off. It takes very little water, and the aroma tends to last a short time, as the oil usually sinks and gets diffused quickly. Then you get hours and hours of the tiniest little stream of mist, which is nice if you are using it for the rainbow lights but doesn't add much to the smell of your room. Adding more oil is a drag due to the opening issue, as mentioned; it's too easy to spill the water.It also makes a little noise, not much but enough to be heard in an otherwise silent room, which the best diffusers avoid by being totally silent.That, along with the tricky opening, the USB cord, and the quite cheap plastic feel of the unit makes this three stars at its price of 25. I'd give it four for 15 bucks, but could never give it five stars even at five dollars. You can get much much better diffusers with none of those issues for 30-40 dollars.If you need a little unit for your cubicle or office, this is a decent option. Otherwise, shop around for diffusers of higher quality. There are plenty out there now.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10L8QQ3HG1U46/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VF6YSNS#wasThisHelpful","R10L8QQ3HG1U46","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a hefty, well made battery. It takes about 6 hours to charge from a computer USB outlet, but then recharges most any phone etc at least four times. It holds its charge well, and is a good solid hunk of metal. It's not as light as some other batts I own, but that's because it's made with more care, from what I've experienced using it so far. Its various over-charging protections work well, and make this a good battery for those who tend to forget it's plugged in for a day or two.When I get sent a review sample of any product, I avoid looking at its cost and use it for a while, then assign what I think is the price I would pay for the item to be worth five stars, assuming it's made with attention to lasting more than a year or two, as most things these days are.

"This is a serviceable headlamp, if not exactly heavy-duty. I have a bunch of these kinds of lamps, and the best still remain Zipkas. I've been using one of those for over 15 years without fail. By that standard, this is a merely fair light for roughly the same cost as the cheaper Zipkas.The sample they sent me does not have a red LED, as advertised. It does have a very flimsy battery cover that seems destined for breaking in the not distant future, however. The spot and floods are somewhat bright, but nowhere near as bright as other high-intensity headlamps now selling for the same price---28 bucks---or less. The strap is cumbersome compared to the best headlamp straps, and not stretchy elastic fabric like those. The buttons are kind of odd here, and also feel rather made-in-china cheap, as does the whole lamp, to be honest.It has worked well enough for the hours I've used it, but the cheap plastic feel of it doesn't bode well, from my experience with other knockoff headlamp brands. I will stick with Zipka due to their proven reliability and fair price; when I find something that works for many years I remain a loyal customer. Their models with the single string strap that zips back into the lamp makes this type of huge strap seem truly archaic. I am always open to a better mousetrap in all walks of life, but this is not one of them.If this cost 15 bucks, I'd give it five stars. 20 bucks, four stars. At 28, it's three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27VLHDRQSHHK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSQEVQW#wasThisHelpful","R27VLHDRQSHHK6","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been hoping Attell would release something as good as his immortal Skanks cd for a while, and here it is. His last few specials have been solid, but this is truly a legendarily great collection of live highlights from a short US tour in 2014, filmed by one onstage guy and two folks in each audience. Low budget and it works perfectly. Attell is easily the most underrated live comic working today---except by his peers and fans, who know how very very sharp and creative he is, and how much new material he's always writing, inculding a number of improv bits on stage here, many of which are excellent. Most comics have neither the balls nor the brains to be this loose and easy with a crowd, and still get 6 to 10 laughs a minute, for an hour-plus. That is legend territory, in with Carlin, Rock, Hicks and the other handful of standup greats.Attell's material here is as always nice and raunchy, pushing the boundaries in most every direction and making you wonder if there are any subjects that can't be turned into comedy gold. Why should there be? Comedy's job is exposing our foibles and moral inconsistencies, and no one does that better than this guy. The simple filming concept fits Dave's act to a T, and when he jokes about his career being dead, it's real irony: he might not have a TV show any more, and is still working clubs while other less talented and simply less funny guys are filling theaters, but Dave Atell is consistently delivering the funny like few comedians today, or ever.Strong words, but then this is one of the best standup shows I've seen in about a decade, almost all hit and no miss. Watching a true pro work the various rooms here, incorporating the decor of each club as well as slinging custom jokes tailored to each city, makes you realize how great most comics are not. It also makes this special worth watching over and over; it's a lot of fun watching a comic crack both the audience and himself up! There's very little ego in Attell, and plenty of talent. And man is his timing beyond perfect. He knows exactly when to let a laugh sink in and grow, and when to cut it off and take it to the next level, until the crowd is howling. That's mastery.Dave Attell might not be the biggest name going, maybe not even in the top 20 these days, but he is easily as funny as anyone else out there now. Gaffigan, CK, Barry, Rock, Chappelle and many others haven't put out anything this good in years. Dave has honed his wit to a fine edge, and is only getting better as he ages. If he keeps pumping out shows this good he should finally get the respect he deserves, and be filling theaters across the country. If he comes to your town...GO!!Even at 41 minutes, this is a great deal for five bucks, but really deserves a dvd of its own, with cutting room extras, of which there must be hours.All told, this is to me one of the best comedy specials by anyone in many years. In fact, the more I watch it the more I think it might be in the all-time pantheon. Get it if you like to laugh and aren't uptight or easily offended, as this is not ""clean"". This is not even blue. It's black humor at its best.Thanks for all the laughs, Dave! Your career ain't dead, buddy. It's just getting started. Rock on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SB95LOX7BP92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JF1LNSS#wasThisHelpful","R1SB95LOX7BP92","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These dissolve very quickly under the tongue, in about a minute, and sublingual is the best way to abosrb many vitamins, especially B12. I like that the dosage per gummy is very small. Good for kids and also for adults; I like to stick one under my tongue before going running, gives a nice little boost and keeps the mouth moist.The quality of the ingredients is unusually good, if not perfect. Still, much better than most. The sweeteners are much, much better than most, if over-applied. The mix of oil and multi is a wise concept, and D3 is vital for dental health and remineralization, so it helps make up for all the sugars in here. These gummies really are very sweet.The price---20 bucks for 120 is about 16 cents a piece---is good, if not great.

"This is MASSIVELY overpriced.And it's soggy mush to boot.Apart from that, our dog eats it only if there is no other option offered. Adding warm water and then waiting for a while while it becomes firm mush is also rather pointless. In fact the only point I can see to dehydrated food like this is maybe travelling with it...but then you still need to heat up water. Standard good dry dog food still makes far more sense, and freshly homemade food for our furry loved ones makes far, far more sense. The one plus I see here is that they used realtively decent ingredients. It's nice to have human-standard food, but then again  I personally won't eat any of the GMO etc crap that passes as food these days, so it's not as if the FDA stamp of apporval means anything of use any more.Back to the price. This stuff adds up to about two hundred bucks a month for a fair-sized dog at this price! Are they kidding us? We can get the finest all-organic no-prep-needed dog food available for about half that. This price is insane.This is ""boutique"" dog food, for rich folks who need ""love"" written on their package to tell them that they are great people who really care about their dog. Hardcore dog lovers will be making food for their dog with fresh ingedients with their own hands...and still be paying half what this stuff costs, with the same prep time and far better ingredients. Andf they know their dog will love it.Did I mention our dog doesn't much like this stuff...and she's really not picky about food?She just doesn't enjoy exceptionally expensive mush, I guess.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CQYYNQBMELJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGLYU86#wasThisHelpful","R1CQYYNQBMELJA","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love top notch single malt scotch. I own a number of double-walled glasses. Here's what I think of these two sample glasses plus ""Artisanal Hand-Cut"" whiskey stones.First, as is obvious from the artisanal marketing slogan, there's no shortage of Hipster Factor involved in these products. But as a serious Scotch drinker, let me add a vital thing that it seems most new Scotch drinkers haven't learned...or aren't being told because it doesn't sell artisanal pebbles.The best Scotch is almost always drunk WITH a splash of spring or other good water...by the folks who make it. Yes, the whole ""don't get ANY melted ice in your Scotch"" is hoohaw. A little water helps bring out a Scotch's character and tames the alcohol edge that can overwhelm the more delicate aspects of a fine single malt's taste. Do some research and read interviews with top Scotch distillers. Few will tell you to drink it neat. A splash of water, or one or two ice cubes (though the cold lessens the taste) are preferred, and have been for centuries in Scotland. But what do Scots know about Scotch?Now back to these glasses. They're too thin.They are thinner than my other double-walleds, and I wondered about the safety of dropping the stones in to test them out. I gently placed them in and drank some Macallan 12 with stones in one glass, then with a bit of water in the other glass. The water one was far tastier. Artisanal or not, you might as well just freeze the glasses as put in cold stones. These stones go for 12 bucks alone, by the way(!) Good thing there are no free stones in your local creek, ain't it.So I think the stones here are unneeded, and hilariously over-priced to boot.The box the glasses come in is nice, however, thickly padded with heavy foam which has become a nice safe place to store my extra guitar amp tubes. So Teikis has got that going for them.The glasses do what dw glasses should, which is not sweat, and look kind of stylish. But two things to consider as a buyer: there are thicker versions available for less money, and the three one-star reviews here reveal some self-exploding glasses (from the thin glass plus a bad vacuum inside, perhaps). So, for 25 bucks, I can only give these three stars. Free or not, I'm giving these an honest review.And why not discuss that for a minute? As people who actually paid for these are complaining about, on this item's page and on many more items' pages on Amazon lately, those of us who get free stuff to review give them five stars very very very very often (ok, sorry, that's not fair, more like maybe only very very very often). This is becoming endemic here, and makes me as a customer begin to wonder what I really can trust on Amazon now.Funny little side note: I first mentioned this a few weeks ago in another review, and my rating dropped one hundred points almost overnight. I was top 500 for many years, then the first time I criticize Amazon openly they dump my rating, like I've been a bad little boy and must be spanked! Hohoho, getting a little greedy now, are we Mr. Bezos and friends? Is mistreating your workers like slaves not enough (go online and search for ""Amazon workers mistreated"" to see some very disturbing interviews and videos from BBC and elsewhere)? Now you also actively discourage what you've always said we reviewers should do: be 100% honest? How very phony, greedy and hypocritical. How many more hundreds of billions of dollars do you need, anyhow? Is it worth treating tens of thousands of temp workers like dirt? When is enough greed and deceit enough?Anyhow, perhaps this overly honest review will get my rating dropped another couple hundred points. From many years of being ranked in the 200s to 400s for being honest and accurate, then from 400 to 800 in weeks! For the very same reason, oddly. Honesty and Amazon are becoming distant cousins, it would appear. Please do feel free to dump my ranking because of this overly honest review; it would certainly expose your growing greed as a company even more. Maybe better to do it slowly, over a month or too, though; that way it looks less obvious that you don't truly want honest reviews any more, just lots of money. Fine by me, whatever you do, as I will still write honest, accurate reviews even if my ranking becomes 25,000,000. I didn't start writing here eight years ago to help Amazon, and I ain't doing it now. I write for people like me who simply want total honesty before they spent their hard-earned money.It's time people woke up to how this whole ratings system has become a Pavlovian reward for selling stuff for Amazon, and not saving customers money, time and sometimes even their health. (Broken glass is bad for fingers, isn't it?)But really, Amazon Ranking Drones, no worries, as readers here know to trust the quality of writing and thinking in reviews more than ranking. Now more than ever, in fact, with the very top reviewers usually giving five stars to 9 out of 10 items, or more; one of the very Top Scamazon Reviewers TM has given over 95 of their last 100 items five stars, and almost every one was for a free item. The low-starred reviews of this item and so many more show that I am but one of a rapidly growing number of readers and potential buyers here who are questioning how honest Amazon really is as a company. This could swiftly bite you in the corporate butt: five star reviews might become a sign of deceit and not quality, at this rate.And as a longtime Amazon shareholder who has only recently seen the evidence of how badly Amazon treats so many of their employees---the online WalMart is what Amazon is becoming, it appears----I say to Jeff Bezos and friends: stop cheating and gaming your own review system, and start treating your employees better!!!Finally, seeing as I'm being as 100% honest as Amazon has always told us to be (an incomparable feeling, truly), let me add another very vital detail: these glasses and Artisanal Hand-Cut stones were sent to me for free via Amazon shipping, not the company. Not every company chooses to do this, but more and more do, for this sneaky reason: it allows them to count it as a sale, thus falsely inflating the sales ranking of the item. Just as all the easy-five-stars-for-free reviews for items given away like this falsely inflate the rating of the product. Yes indeed, it's a never-discussed but very effective scam that Amazon seems to have no problems with. But when you treat your workers like slaves, why would you treat your customers any better?So there you go: the most honest Amazon review you may ever read.It will probably not make me any friends at Scamazon, but gee whiz, it may wake up lots of you, the readers and customers who support Scamazon and their increasingly shady business methods.. And I am one of you first and foremost, not a shill for Amazon or any drop-shippers-of-made-in-china-crap firm that tosses a couple of free trinkets at me then writes an angry email asking why I didn't give them five stars.Thus, my fellow readers and writers, I say look elsewhere for thicker, cheaper double-walled glasses, as there are many of them out there. These glasses plus the stones are ok at 25 bucks, but you can do better. Shopping online is all about comparing reviews and prices, so look around at various sites---and even better, LOCAL stores that hire your neighbors and treat them fairly!---and make your informed purchase.I do hope this review has been quite informative for many of you.Cheers!","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RW39SO9Y4ICA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPXHWFM#wasThisHelpful","R2RW39SO9Y4ICA","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes, this thing has various limitations: short battery life, weak camera and no bluetooth chief amongst them. But it is very thin and light, so not a lot of battery room, I suppose. Cameras, meh, 15 mp cams are now cheap so I prefer a dedicated, real SLR camera with real lenses. And the two-plus hours while watching a movie is plenty, especially as it'll work for days if you keep it plugged in to a little remote 5 or 10 mah battery which are now ubiquitous and very cheap. But it's worth four stars for me simply because it does so many other things so well...for 50 bucks.The 1080p is almost unbelievably crisp for a screen this small. The wifi works quickly and well, even though it's becoming ever clearer that Google is now the devil. Speaking of, the home page is default on Android and thus this box, natch, and when it came up it said, ""Say 'OK Google"". Like a sucker I did and suddenly the next thing I said was entered into the search box as text (reminding one that every mic around us these days is always on, and likely always recorded by TPTB)...followed by my next sentence to my better half, written as this by Gaggle: ""Holy ****, these *********** are listening to us!"" (What, I'm going to be offended by seeing what I just said in actual words? The PC Police are everywhere now, no doubt. **** all of those weaselly *************, by the way.)So I then said, ""Is Google evil?"", referring to their old (very old now, it turns out) slogan, Do No Evil. The first link that came up was a great blog post wherein the fellow points out that Google now has major shares in many of the most socially invasive markets, and are out to basically catalog and control the world's collective lives. Seriously, search for it, read it, and be amazed, dismayed, and justifiably enraged.Which perhaps answers my question: how can a screen this good and device this versatile be only 50 bucks? Gosh, maybe Google just gives away Android so that they can remotely listen and watch what everyone does for their masters at the NSA! Yes, do a little Google + NSA search/research about how they are, as with the internet itself, essentially a military/government project posing as everybody's pal (except creative artists...read Zoe Keating's recent piece about how Google/YouTube brutally rips off musicians and other artists). Thanks, Larry and Sergey! If this is No Evil, what's Evil? Guess we'll soon see...So perhaps that's why we are inundated with gaggles of everything Google now, including super-cheap hi-quality devices like this free sample I was sent. All I know is that after I watch something on this, I put it in its case, then in its box, then in a cupboard...just like we do with every smartphone-type device.Why be Winston Smith voluntarily?Yet here we are, not only carrying devices with us everywhere that can remotely record everything we do and say...but WE PAY for the ""privilege""!If that's not Eisenhower's Military-Industrial Complex wet dream/nightamre come to life, what is?In any case, with 8gb memory plus room for 32 more on sd card, a serviceable 512 ram, and a picture this good, this makes a decent leave-it-in-the-car emergency internet or movie-watching device, and for 55 bucks, you can even lose it without remorse, or perhaps even toss it in the ocean while intoning, ""Google, thou art the Devil, begone with your greedhead owners to the depths of Hades from whence you slithered!""","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WUCCC7OXUXZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2TJ6HW#wasThisHelpful","R1WUCCC7OXUXZW","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good neck pillow. I have a bunch of these things, and my favorite has beads in it, which somehow seem to massage my neck while I use it. This memory foam version is a little firmer, maybe a tad too firm for me but perhaps perfect for airplane travelers who need their head to stay very put while snoozing. I like the removable cover; the grey sample they sent washed up well with no fading, but make sure to not put it in the drier, as it will shrink a bit.My only niggle would be that I'd be more likely to pay 10-15 for this rather than 20; my bead pillow cost seven bucks and I like it more.

"This is basically generic Frontline under another name. It is cheaper than Frontline, but nowhere near as cheaper as a generic should be; you're still paying a hefty pricetag for a tiny bit of chemical. This could and should easily be ten bucks, not 19, and they'd still be making massive margins. Frontline Plus is still the best we've tried, but it has a much higher priceteg than most brands, though buying it at bulk stores gives a fine price break.In any case, vets recommend switching between brands of Fipronil-containing meds every month or two, as fleas are developing immunity to various formulations and that helps slow that process. So this is a decent choice for those off-months.But seriously, Big Pharma, or rather Medium Pharma (the knockoff firms who do generics): make this stuff for ten bucks and you will do business like you never imagined.

"I like this belt, it's a very useful idea for nighttime runners. It offers three modes: all blue, fast flash, and slow flash. It also has a double zipper around almost all of the belt, good for storing cash and keys but not much else, as the pouch is by design only a couple inches high and barely half an inch deep. But it's the lights that sell this thing, not the pockets. The clasp is solid enough and should stay on well, very similar to most heavy backpack clasps.So if I like this, why only three stars? Simple: it costs WAY too much. 30 bucks is at least ten bucks too much. These LEDs are cheap as heck to make now, maybe a penny a piece, and this while thing is just nylon webbing, a plastic clasp, and a couple zippers. It's made well but simply ain't worth 30 clams. If you need one of these now, go ahead, but I think many other firms will be knocking these off like crazy within a few months for 10-15 bucks, so I wouldn't pay 30 for one just yet.

"These don't replace a Furminator-type brush, but along with one of those these give you most everything your pooch needs to stay clean. I like the wide brush best, as it goes deeper than a furmy and gives a nice little skin massage along with pulling out lots of old hair. It doesn't clump onto the brush like a furmy though, so best to use it outside or on a towel to catch all the hair and dead skin, etc. The other brush is an all-in-one deal, not bad, and the dematter is good to have after messy park trip etc.The samples they sent are made well enough to last for a few years at least, and at 13 bucks total, the price is very good, considering what some specialty pet stores charge for similarly basic plastic made in china stuff.

"I think the Pro-15 is the best probiotic I've ever used, though expensive, so I was looking forward to trying this formula for colds and sickness in general. I got this sample three months ago, but have been perfectly healthy until recently, when I caught the flu that's been going around from a friend who works with kids (I know to always wipe my eyes with my sleeve, not my hands, but after a few beers I forgot, and paid the price). I got it pretty good too, simultaneous chills and fever, and about 12 hours in I felt so bad I started laughing at how painful it was just to expose a bare arm to the air (embrace your pain to erase it!) . Then I remembered I had this stuff.I had already been hitting the echinacea-goldenseal tincture and Vitamin C every two hours, which always works for me. Then I remembered having this stuff, and took one. In about an hour I felt a definite lifting of the worst of it. Took another after 6 hours, and within 12 hours I felt like I had a mild cold. Three days later there was little trace of anything. Whereas other folks I knew who'd caught the same flu had it bad for at least three days, some of them a week. So I know this helped.Which only makes sense, as it combines four of the most vital compounds to battle sickness: C (the king and queen of illness prevention and cure), zinc (which is a great acute immune system boost), echinacea and a vast spectrum of probiotics. I've been taking probiotics off and on for about 15 years, as needed, and these are as good as the Pro-15. They work fast, and you'll be pooping within a few hours. I believe in fasting when sick, drinking only liquids and vegetable soup, as a clean gut is the easiest way to let your body focus on the infection. Digestion takes a lot of energy. A good probiotic will help empty your colon fast and let your body go to work on the virus.That's what happened here, and in this case the high cost is almost no issue at all. When you're really sick, relief is at a premium. Getting rid of that wicked flu in a day was wonderful, and I know this stuff helped. I think echinacea is more of a long-term preventative than a quick attack---goldenseal does that best---but everything else here is exactly what I usually take separately. Plus they use ""EpiCor"", a fruit-derived substance I know nothing about, but it seems to work and that's the main detail I care about.While I recommend splitting the Pro-15 pills in half to get more value and almost the same effect, I would say take a whole pill of this Pro-Immune formula when you get sick or feel like you're about to (sore throat, tiredness, aches). The buck a pill or so will end being a bargain as you won't need to buy much else. I took two of these while sick; two bucks is a small price compared to many ""remedies"" that barely work. Although I still advise at least a gram of Vit C every day of your life, and five to ten times that when sick. You can't OD on C, and as Linus Pauling proved, it cures cancer and just about everything else (please research C in real depth to learn about Nature's greatest gift to our bodies, aside from pure water).They gave me this stuff for free, but I will buy more when it's gone; I can't offer a better rec than that. The thing I really like about the Hyperbiotics pro's is that they are shelf-stable and don't need to be refrigerated, unlike almost all other pro's. For a sickness formula you'll only use a few times a year, that makes these a good deal at any price under a buck a pill. I still keep them in the fridge though; it can only make them last longer.Highly recommended to combat and ward off illness, along with a gallon of pure water a day, and always lots of Vitamin C.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X2YJMBXUQYA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OG5O37Q#wasThisHelpful","R2X2YJMBXUQYA1","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.7 starsThis is a decent machine, but it's more for the in-a-hurry morning folks than serious java aficionados.If you need convenience, here it is. But there are some negatives that come along with the ease of use.The good things:-You can just put beans in before you go to bed, set the timer, and wake to a freshly ground and brewed cup of coffee. That's pretty sweet for the morning commute, doubly so if you have a few folks in the house to share the coffee. If you're going to have a 12-cup large coffee maker like this, it's nice to justify that size.-Put the filter and the carafe into the dishwasher and you're good to go.-This would be good for an office; set it before you leave at night and when everyone gets there in the morning, fresh coffee and lots of it.-Easy to dump out the grounds into your compost. I always compost coffee grounds, they make great soil and our tomatoes love that coffee ground mix.-Makes very good coffee. Not the best, but I'd give it an 8 out of 10 for taste compared to the way I prefer to do it. (See below.)The not so good things:-The worst thing is all the plastic. Not only is most of the body plastic, but the filter parts are too, and boiling water plus plastic equals leaching and plastic taste, never good. That's a real knock here. The filter and all parts that touch boiling water should be stainless steel, like any good french press, which make the best coffee in my estimation.-It's made in that country where quality control seems the absolute last concern, but then so is most everything these days. Gotta keep those corporate profits high! Employing people in your company's home country? Not so vital, apparently.-I prefer real buttons to these plastic overlays. They often go bad within a year or two and are a hassle to fix.-This thing is LARGE. Wider than most coffee machines and not short either. Depending on your counter space, this might take up too much space for some folks.-If you don't have a dishwasher, the filter/blade combo is a pain. It's hard to clean the underside of the blade.-The grinder doesn't grind fine enough on the highest setting for my preference. It's nice to have varied settings but the top one should be finer.-They probably do that because when properly fine, the filter lets a tiny bit through and you get some grit in your cup. It settles, but still, not ideal. That's why I prefer a french press.-Which leads to this thought: do you really need a 12-cup machine? This one is rather huge.My preferred coffee ritual is to grind beans in my old Krups or Braun grinders to a very fine grind, then brew in a small four cup french press with all-metal parts. The taste is perfection, there are zero grounds in the coffee, and it's all very easy to rinse clean in a jiffy. We have a Keurig too, but it doesn't compare to a quality press either.French press plus grinder is my recommendation for single or a few cups, by far. A good grinder is only 20 bucks at most, and a good french press only 30. That's 30 less in total than this machine's price of 80 here now. Plus you can grind the beans precisely as you like them, from very coarse to pure powder, and no grounds in your cup with a good filter in your press, no matter how fine you like your cuppa joe.But, as mentioned, if you have lots of counter space, a dishwasher and a specific time you get up every morning, the convenience here certainly might be worth the money for you. If that's your situation, this is worth checking out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KE6SY1T8COUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2HZFK#wasThisHelpful","R3KE6SY1T8COUP","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These multiple usb outlet chargers are pretty standard these days, and I've tried a bunch of them and own a few. This is a good one with plenty of power to charge your phone or computer etc quickly. The slow and fast outlets seem to charge at roughly the same rate, but it's quick in any case, a few hours for most devices I've put into the sample charger they sent me. It's very simply laid out, an on button and five outlets, plus a wall wart that's almost as big as the charger but at least it has a long cord on both sides to facilitate hiding it.I say hiding it because I assume anyone paying 40 bucks for this unit is doing so for the look of the real wood case, for this costs about twice what most comparable basic plastic case units do. That's my one knock on this item; you really do pay a premium for the wood. But if you want a nice-looking charger sitting on your office desk, this will do very nicely, as the wood grain is very pronounced and quite attractive.In any case, this is a very solid charger.

"In short, these are excellent for gaming, but not so much for just listening to music. They have punchy, solid bass for all of your boss-destroying pleasure, and the boom mic is good quality. But the upper mids and top end are less natural than one would like for musical listening, and these simply don't compare to their Sennheiser competitors for doing both jobs well, though they do have more bass.They are comfortable enough, but if you have a larger cranium, try out the various other wireless gaming headphone options and see if these feel too tight compared to their competitors. They get their bass from their large cups and seal, so it's part and parcel. For normal or smaller heads, say 7 1/4 and under, no issues at all.I would definitely recommend two sets of three AAA batteries to switch between while charging, as these will chew through normal batteries way too fast at normal gaming rates. I'm no hardcore online player, but I can see that you'd really need that extra set to play long sessions without breaks. The corded version of these is very bulky, so the wireless version is a whole lot easier to wear.All in all, I wouldn't recommend these for both music and gaming, but if you're dedicating them purely for gaming---which makes sense as few cans will do both perfectly---then these will give you all the oomph you'd ever want, and the wireless gives you plenty of freedom to move around unencumbered.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EXQV0QAXWW6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JFOKJNU#wasThisHelpful","R2EXQV0QAXWW6C","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Our pooch ate this right up first time out, but then there are few foods she doesn't like. She got a little rambunctious afterward, which I ascribe to both something new on her menu and the (truly minimal) bits of freeze-dried raw meat in here, but we're talking one bit in maybe fifty or so, so the whole ""raw boost"" aspect here is more marketing than substantive. They are in there though...you can tell because they're a different color! Oh those clever marketers.I do appreciate the ingredients in general here, there are a wide array of good things, including probiotics which those who are victim to older dogs' farts will certainly value highly. Salmon, turkey, a little bit of kelp and broccoli and many other varied foods provide a good nutritional spectrum. The main ingredient is chicken, and I really wish, especially at this high price, that it was free-range or organic. If you're going to charge five bucks a pound, at least use some non-factory-farm chicken, guys! This stuff is full of antibiotics and GMO feed, and where's the health benefit in that for our dogs, or our environment? (Please look up the billions of pounds of fecal matter, blood etc that factory farms dump into our rivers and lakes every year). So I'm less than impressed by that aspect here.They also make a big deal about this being grain-free, but frankly I've found that all of my dogs have loved some whole grains in their diets, especially brown rice and whole wheat. Animal protein is vital, yes, but dogs are omnivores just like us, and a wide diet is a wise thing and makes our dog happiest and healthiest. We feed her various dog foods and raw food and stuff we make for her, and a good mix of it all keeps her very jolly indeed. Her favorite is still Kirkland lamb-based kibble, which is good stuff, and at just over a dollar a pound it sure is hard to see replacing that with this, at five times the price.But she does enjoy this Instinct food, and we'll give it to her in rotation with the many other things we share with her to keep her diet fun. (Imagine eating the same food every meal for years! Crazy that so many of us think such a mono-diet will keep our dogs as happy as they could be.) There are lots of good foods in here and as a spice of life every few days this is welcome in her always happily-eyed food dish.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TMP7BM963V7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZFEBR4#wasThisHelpful","R2TMP7BM963V7E","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a number of things I like about this stuff. The vegetable base, the vegan proteins, the enzymes, the lack of any GMO ingredients, the mild sweetening; I even like the very mildly chocolate taste, unlike many reviewers here. Not great but not bad. I ALWAYS put any powder destined to become liquid into a blender, even when it says ""shake or stir into water"". A lot of the chalky consistency and even taste issues people complain about with protein powders go away when the stuff is properly and heavily blended for thirty seconds. I also use plain organic almond milk, which thickens the drink and makes it far more palatable. It helps powders to have something to bind with in the liquid as well; water never quite does the trick for me.There's plenty of protein here, so I only use half the recommended amount, as I only want about 10-15 grams of protein per meal or snack. My personal experience is that we are hyped by the media to take WAY more protein than we need every day. I find 50 grams or less is plenty for me, and more simply goes undigested or slows me down in various ways. I am in good shape and exercise a lot, and even then I find 10-15 grams of protein is plenty at a time, even easily assimilable veggie proteins.But, there are also a number of things I don't like about this Vega protein powder. The first is that the container is huge...for no reason. Opening it up, I found the container 2/3 full. ""Settling during shipping"" blah blah, whatever. NOW and other brands pack the stuff in and save me cupboard space, but Vega seems to think using 50% more plastic than they need to, and taking up 50% more of our cupboards than they need to, makes sense. I sure don't. I think it's a waste of energy and space, and is mindless. I think they do it to justify the price.The price is the main thing I don't dig here. 40 bucks, or 50 MSRP, is just too much for this, especially as it has no organic ingredients. I can get various protein powders that are mostly organic for less than this stuff...so why pay this much for non-organic? It doesn't make sense, nor does a company called Vega---thus trumpeting their vegan creds---who won't got the extra mile and source organic ingredients.I'd pay twenty bucks for this, maybe 25. 40 is way too much. Add the pointlessly massive container and lack of any organic ingredients and no way does this justify a 40-50 dollar price tag.I do applaud Vega's basic concept, but will wait until they package stuff more wisely and use better ingredients before shelling out what they're asking for this powder.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38YD4FGKJHISX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYRXDHE#wasThisHelpful","R38YD4FGKJHISX","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered this as a review sample, and loved the concept, so I tried one out. In short, I love this idea, but wish the execution was better.The instructions are so tiny I had issues reading them and had to read reviews here to realize you have to wait 30 seconds after turning the mic on for the blue light to signal it's ready to record. To me that's a big minus, as a device like this is mainly useful for sudden ideas etc to me, and waiting 30 seconds is a drag. I was going to use it to record song and writing ideas when waking from dreams, which I often have, but waiting 30 seconds makes that kind of pointless, unless I plan on staying awake.The quality is fair, not great but not bad. It might be 384 kbps but it sounds like 64. At least it's 16 gb, so space is no issue.But for 26 bucks, I would expect this to work within a couple of seconds, not 30.

"For fifteen bucks, this is a good deal. The LED is very bright and can be focused to be even brighter. The included battery lasts for many hours and is LI so it will hold the charge for months. This makes it a great option for keeping in the car as an emergency light, and it also has a flashing strobe mode for alerting cops, etc.It's made of tough metal; I dropped it onto concrete from three feet with zero issues at all. The clip on it is also very useful, as is the plastic case with the little charger.For a solid rechargeable flashlight with these features, I'd pay 20 with no qualms, so 15 is a very fair price.

"Gund has always made the plushest, softest kid's s toys. They also last pretty well. This one is likewise super soft and seems well made, with solid seams and nothing for a little kid to pull apart, except maybe the feather, which won't sit up straight like in the pictures. But that's about the only mini-complaint here. Mostly this is just a really fun little toy at a good price. It's a pretty cute little monkey as well.The best thing is that the ball lights up in rainbow colors and is quite entertaining to look at for kids of all ages. There are almost two dozen different answers, mostly variations on yes and no with a few maybes. The monkey's voice is maybe a little squeaky, but then a basso profundo hardly makes sense. The on-off switches hidden in the paws (nice touch) work well and seem unlikely to break, and it's easy to change the batteries, though I think there won't be much need for that, as the LED lights and the voice module use little juice. The moving mouth, which is quite amusing, probably uses the most energy, but even then we've used this as a kind of basic I Ching many times as we walk by its perch on the shelf and it's still showing no signs of monkey non-business. It's surprisingly accurate, too. Perhaps there's a job in Congress and/or Senate for it.All in all, for twenty bucks this would be a decent deal even without the light show and fortune teller aspect. With them, and the promise of Gund quality helping it stand up to lots of monkeyshines as time goes by, this is a good value that might last quite a few years, a rarity for a moving toy these days. This is a cuddly little pal and could easily become a kid's favorite furry toy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J2BZN5PPYT6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZ9TCEE#wasThisHelpful","R3J2BZN5PPYT6Q","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shane was obviously a one-off, a guy with less fear about risking his life skiing down near-vertical mountainsides and jumping off buildings and bridges than most of us have just walking down the street. There's some incredible footage of his many astounding feats here, no doubt. But somehow despite all that, I was left feeling that this film could have been better.No complaints about the endless spectacular stunts shown, and watching it just for that will leave anyone who appreciates true daring exhilarated and maybe exhausted. McConkey routinely went for tricks that even the average daredevil considered insane, and seeing some of them will put butterflies in your gut. There's a lot of mind-blowing footage here, footage that Shane risked his life for time and time again.Was it worth it? That's the very tough question that this film sort of attempts to answer, rather than simply showing the stunts. But by the sad end (no spoilers here, it's pretty clear from the start that Shane is no longer with us, and if you're watching this you probably know that already), I was left with a few questions about the way this film showed Shane's life.The best thing here is McConkey's sense of humor. He didn't take life too seriously and was a truly funny fellow. His naked ski runs show a guy who just wanted to have fun, and also to remind others that fun is what skiing, and life, are all about for him. That love of laughter, combined with Shane's maniacal quest for extreme thrills as a way of daily existence, made him a truly unique individual. He did what he loved, every day. How many of us can say that? However you measure success, it can't be far from that.One fascinating thing early in the film was after he left school and was floating around looking for what he wanted to do. A number of people say, ""He was aimless, and he was living in a little shack, and he was even a busboy."" OMG!! A busboy?! O the shame. So what? The shots of him during that time show a very happy young man doing what he loves. So what was the problem? Many people NEVER figure out why they want to do. Why would the son of a (successful) skibum want to start seeking security when he just got out of school? The guy just wanted to ski. So why do his some of his friends and family look back at it like he was somehow a failure for taking his time, eschewing greed and security for the freedom of chasing his dreams? That's a strange thing here, but Shane showed that following your bliss is how you get to be happy, that's for sure. Was he happy? He sure seemed to be. Maybe guys like him will never be happy unless they are risking their lives. Thanatos for happiness? Some people are just wired that way.I know some will say, this guy is selfish for risking his life after he was married with a kid. I don't fully subscribe to that notion. His wife married him knowing full well who he was and what he did. They both wanted to have kids, though he wanted them sooner. Upon hearing her say that, my first thought was he knew the odds were that he was going to buy the farm sooner than later at the rate he kept jacking up the risk level in his stunts. Thus he wanted a kid as soon as possible just in case that was true. Is that a selfish thought? Very tough question, and one I can't answer. It was his life to risk, after all is said and done.But one of the issues with that is that this film makes it clear how deeply affected he was by not having his father around as a kid, and how he ended up idolizing his father's uber-skibum ways, and carried on likewise. Was this in his DNA, or was it a product of his emulating the man his Mom clearly didn't like, seeing as she left him when Shane was 5 and moved thousands of miles away? Interestingly, she comes off as quite bitter here, while his father seems like he's at peace with his son's decisions and life. He never left Shane, it's worth noting; his Mom took him away from his father.But Shane knew what he wanted from life, and it was what his Dad wanted: thrills and fun! And he sure got them, as this film shows. But one of the things I found a little lacking here, as this film tries to be a doc and not just a typical highlights film, is that they barely mention the many brutal injuries McConkey suffered throughout his career. They're mentioned briefly in passing, and only near the end of the film. I felt they should have been integral to the course of the film; as it is, it all seems almost safe and doable to the average kid watching this, and you know there will be plenty. Shane rarely wore a helmet for some of his most nutty stunts, but hey, he was one in a billion, and most kids don't have his intense skillset. A little more emphasis on safety would have been nice.For instance, it's mentioned in passing a couple times that Shane was very careful about planning his stunts. But we almost never see him doing that, or hear about how he did it. That is a VITAL detail! This flick often makes it seem like the guy just saw a cliff and skied off it. We need, I mean the kids watching this need, a little more awareness of how much work and planning went into these stunts. At least, I think they do. Maybe I'm wrong, the filmmakers bear no responsibility of that sort, and it's all fun and games until someone pokes your eye out with a stick.But let's be honest. McConkey died doing an almost pointlessly dangerous stunt, one he obviously didn't prep well enough for. One he was maybe too old to reliably pull off. One maybe he shouldn't have ever attempted with a little daughter waiting for him. One that left her to be raised by her Mom, just like her Dad was. Except she won't get to reconcile with her father years hence.Does that make Shane selfish? Probably, but I really don't think it's our place to judge him for it. He made his living doing these things. He paid his family's way risking his life. His wife knew that and accepted that's who he was. She's a cool lady and she understood. But his daughter didn't. Will she one day? Probably, but it's still all very sad. Yet in the end, it was McConkey's choice to make, and make it he did.Which brings up the question this film neatly sidesteps, though it's truly at the heart of the project and of Shane's life: was it all worth it? Was all that crazy footage worth his life? He clearly thought so, and so do the filmmakers, judging by how they avoid the subject of his death until the very end, instead of leveraging his achievements with it as the film goes along. The guy never really grew up, and seeking thrills was his sole raison d'etre, even after having a family. Is that admirable?That's for each of us to decide, and I wish it was examined more carefully throughout the film. If you read the many books about the Everest catastrophes, for instance, you see over and over men deciding that their thrill of climbing paled in comparison with staying healthy for their loved ones' sakes. It took a near-death experience to wake them up to that. Shane had those basically every day! His decision was to never stop seeking them, because they made him feel good. Is that selfish? Well, look at how many of us are entertained by his risk-taking. We give him (and the cameramen who make their money from others risking their lives) our cash in return for seeing them take chances we never would, or could.And it's that ""could"" that I wish we saw more of here. McConkey was a freak, a super-talented guy who decided death was just an inevitable side effect of seeking the most extreme thrills. But most of us watching this, and especially the kids, might think they can try this stuff too...without the benefit of seeing how Shane carefully planned the stunts, or what training he put in, or even all of the brutal injuries he suffered, again and again. This film kind of seems like it takes advantage of the footage Shane risked his life for, while rarely showing what work led to that footage. It's all a lark! That feels somehow wrong.But maybe that's not the filmmakers' job, and it's all about the thrills and the fun. But if that's the case, why was I left feeling sad after watching this? Not just for Shane's wife and fatherless child, but for the 99.999% of kids watching this who will never have the innate talent that McConkey did, but think they do, and take chances far beyond their abilities. And also for Shane, in a way. What drives a man to risk the life he had worked for and achieved (admittedly by risking his life)? We get hints of an honest look at that question here, but somehow it feels not only sad but unsatisfying by the end.Maybe I'm crazy though, and this is all just radical fun, dude! One thing for sure: if you want to see a lot of death-defying stunts, and one that wasn't, here they are.Wheeeee.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EJD94PJS4TR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOYC3D8#wasThisHelpful","R3EJD94PJS4TR2","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is quality stuff. A lot of thought was clearly put into these products, as they all accomplish what they're supposed to, which many brands do not, and entirely without any toxic chemicals. Most standard household products use a potpourri of carcinogens, simply to save their corporate masters some money. What they do to our health is of far less concern to corporations like Procter and Gamble than how much money they can make from us. It's nice to find a company that offers instead a better product that is also entirely safe to use, and at a fair price.I like this multi-pack, as it lets you get all the usual cleaning stuff at once to compare with what you usually use to see if it truly is better. When you figure the individual price of each item, it works out to being quite cheap per product, so it's not only a good sampler, it's a good way to save some cash.My favorite of the bunch is the hand soap, which I normally never use. Most types leave a film on my hands, and feel odd. This stuff is basically transparent after use, to the extent that I can use it for washing my face and have a completely clean feeling after, just like my favorite soap, Dr. Bronner's. There is very little scent, which I prefer, and it takes a dab to clean my hands or face. This stuff is as good as Bronner's, which is as good as it gets in my book.The laundry detergent works well, is very concentrated, easy to dispense from the pump, and gets clothes very clean with only a tiny fresh citrus scent left. I like that, as I don't want my clothes to smell like perfume.The stain remover actually works! We've used other types that didn't do much, or left a bleached spot. This stuff doesn't leave any mark, and after spraying on and leaving it for half an hour then washing it, we got rid of some stains on a white shirt that have stayed there for over a year. Plus it takes very little of this liquid to do the job, so it cost a couple of cents to get rid of what were previously rather incorrigible stains. My better half asked me to say how very effective it is on every type of stain we've tried it on; she was surprised and happy at how well it works.And we don't discuss laundry very much, so for her to mention it is a sign of how uniquely good this stuff is.The multi-surface cleaner is decent, though we haven't really found any stains for it to show its magic on that we couldn't get off with just plain water. Maybe we'll get some crayon marks on the walls to try it on...but we'd rather not!This dish soap, on the other hand, has had plenty of grease etc to tackle, and it works perfectly. It takes very little to foam up enough to do a load of dishes, and it cuts through even baked-on grease that I forgot to soak. It also leaves absolutely no film or smell on the plates or glasses, and the glasses rinse spotless.I think Puracy will be gaining more and more fans as families realize how much their health is affected by the normal crap we all usually buy. People are increasingly aware of the dangers of all those chemicals, and when a company takes the time and care to offer completely clean alternative products at a fair price, they're bound to do well. These guys deserve to, as they created excellent cleaning products I can feel good about my family using every day. They offered these as samples for us to try, and the highest praise I can give is that we'll be buying more of them when these are finished.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21FLXH755U3PC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQLFHVI#wasThisHelpful","R21FLXH755U3PC","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"[Edit: Five stars to three stars. After two months, this thing does NOT hook up automatically every time we move it from one socket to another. We have to turn everything off, plug this in, then turn on the router and the computer and then we get five bars MOST of the time, but even then sometimes it won't hook up. Sad, as it hooked up quickly at first. TP-Link had this issue with the last version of this, so it's not impressive that MkII is having the same problem.]We can never get a full signal in the guest room or office, so I thought I 'd see if this would help.We have a TP-Link pocket router, so I figured they'd hook up easy. But I forgot to see if the router had a WPS button. Turns out it doesn't. So I had to do the other setup, where you:-plug this into the wall-go online to the TP site they list in the instructions-type ""admin"" in both boxes-disconnect from wifi on your computer-enter your router password-wait two minutes for this to hook up automatically to your router-turn the wifi back on on your computerTook me about four minutes total.And there you go. Without this we get two bars in the guest room, one in the office.Now it's five and four!Yay.They say to put this in between your router and the computer, in an open area like a side wall in the middle of a room, but I have it five feet from the router, and it still goes through the walls (or around the corners) like a champ. It might work even better in between as advised, but it works perfectly like this as well.It definitely also makes surfing the net faster and we haven't had one dropout all day, whereas we often have about one an hour. (I sure hope this unit is why, as that would be a major bonus, especially when dealing with the greedy corporate nightmare that is Time Burner, maybe the worst company in the world. Money-saving tip: we use their cheapest service, as we found the top tier to be not much faster for three times the price; with this thing we get better speed than TW's top tier gave us on both our laptops, at one-third the price.)You can also plug this little guy into any socket and after 30 seconds it resets itself and is good to go in that room. Which means you can get good wireless outside, in the attic, etc. And for 30 bucks, that's a good deal.By the way, we've had the TP router for over a year with zero issues, and when we needed to call their customer support to set it up they were some of the most efficient, friendly folks I've ever met in CS, so that's a big plus.Nothing to not like with this range extender for us so far. Easy to set up, and if you have a WPS button, even easier. I'd pay 30-50 for this, so at 30 it's a very fair deal, and an easy five stars.I see that the last version of this needed a firmware update out of the box (this version fixed that...I hope!), and folks had issues with it after a few months, so if I have issues I'll come back here and post them.Fingers crossed...but so far it's been a very simple and powerful little device.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SU0N8VZD2F1Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVIXCCO#wasThisHelpful","R2SU0N8VZD2F1Z","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To my mild amazement, this thing seems to be working.I don't know why I'm surprised; people across the world have been wearing copper bracelets etc for millenia, so there's probably a reason for that. (I even recall seeing Hercules and Conan wearing thick copper wrist rings, and gosh, they're pretty strong!) But if you look online, Western Medicine TM is very quick to say ""copper bracelets don't work"". Of course, experience has shown that old WM doesn't like anything that is natural, cheap and effective. How can you sell billions of dollars in pills every day when people might buy something once for a few bucks and have it work for them for years?But still, part of me is a skeptic, and I need to see and feel proof before I believe anything.So when I heard these bracelets can help arthritis and joint pain, etc, I decided to try this sample and see.I got it a few months ago, put it on for a few days, noticed nothing different, and thought, oh well. So I put it in a drawer and forgot about it.Then this week I was playing a lot of guitar one night; sometimes I'll practice 4, 6 or even 8 hours straight while watching movies or reading or just wailing away. And after a few hours my left wrist and fingers can get pretty sore, and I have to take frequent breaks. My inner voice said, ""Hey bozo, where's that copper bracelet?""I dug it out and put it on.And to my great and happy surprise, my wrist and finger tendons slowly stopped feeling sore.I kept playing for over 7 hours total, and felt great afterwards. So I wore this thing to bed. Slept well, maybe a little better than normal but nothing spectacular. But then the next day I decided to really test this thing out, and I plugged in and started playing riffs like mad, every Zep, Jimi, Floyd, ZZ, Santana, Van Halen etc solo and song I could remember, for hours on end. Hundreds of riffs and solos, blasting away, playing as fast as I could to see what happened to my wrist.Incredibly, I played four hours with only a brief break, and NO wrist pain!The only thing I had changed was wearing this bracelet. So I know it does work, for me, for this issue. But what makes it work? Is it the copper, which is said to enter your bloodstream very gently while mixing with your sweat, and balance your brain chemistry a little better as well? Is it the six magnets? That could be it, as I believe we are being massively hurt by the wireless frequencies we are all now surrounded by every day, all day and night. We are very sensitive electromagnetic beings, and the cell phone grid is now all-pervasive; how can that be good for our bodies' magnetic fields?Well, whatever makes this work, it DOES work. For me, at least. It's more than just a little discernible; it stops my wrist pain. I also seem to feel a bit more balanced and grounded while wearing it, and my temper seems a little more stable while driving. Copper bracelets for road rage!This is pure copper, and very flexible, easy to get on and off and easy to shape to my wrist perfectly. I wear it with the opening on top, as that seems to work better for me and be more comfortable. I hate jewelry and wear no rings or watch etc, but this doesn't bug me at all, got used to it in hours. It also doesn't leave a green mark on my wrist as others say some copper bracelets do to them.If this thing was bunk, I'd say so in two seconds. But I've felt the difference and I know it works for me.Do all copper bracelets work? No idea, I've only tried this one. Some cost only six bucks, while this is almost 30.Is it worth it? If it works, it sure is. Try a few and see, and then please write a review and let us all know!Is it the magnets, the copper, or the synergy of the two together? Probably the latter, but who knows.All I know is that this does work. For me.So if you have sore joints, arthritis etc, they give you a month money-back guarantee on this. Try it, and if it does nothing, send it back. Don't trust me or anyone else, see for yourself. Because if it DOES work for you, wouldn't it be nice to stop taking all those pills with all their side effects? Wouldn't it be nice to not spend hundreds a year on pills when a 25 dollar bracelet could be helping even more...without side effects?It's worth a try, isn't it?I didn't believe in this thing, but it's working for me.That's all I can say, other than to encourage doubters to see if it works for you.Because, if it does...how great would that be?","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RJV65B3OETZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LLIJGZK#wasThisHelpful","R1RJV65B3OETZK","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.7 starsThe big knock on this machine seems to be its weight, a little under twenty pounds. I agree that this vacuum is heavy compared to most of the new vacs, but I also have my fingers crossed that this weight means solid construction that will last for many years. Remember when things were built that way, rather than made of cheap plastic to make you buy a new one every couple years? Hello Kirby! Serious reliability rarely comes with cheap plastic.So for Samsung to make this so heavy, in a world of lightweight throwaway vac, gives me the thought that they made it to last, as they're not stupid, and they know folks are now used to lighter machines. Only time will tell. Meanwhile, it's really not that tough to move around; it's no Dyson, but of course it costs half as much. It also has a wider mouth, which equates to less laps around the room.The suction is quite strong, better than average to be sure. It does carpets well, though more level adjustment would be welcome on the rug brushes. It clogs a little too easily with pet hair, but it's easily pulled off. The hand-vac is a good idea but the design is weak; having it up top makes this already heavy machine more top heavy than it should be. The hand vac is ok but I still prefer a dedicated hand vac that's light; less suction but so much more easy to get into corners and sofa edges.It's easy to empty and does hold a lot of dust and dirt before needing to be emptied, a big plus.I would recommend this for folks who don't need to carry it up any stairs (although 20 lbs is really not super heavy), who have large flat areas without lots of corners to maneuver this in and out of, and who don't have more than one dog and one cat.The price has been coming down here over the last month, from 299 to 231, and I think it's just under four stars at that price. If its heaviness translates over the next few years to heavy duty reliability, then it would easily be worth 250, I think. But if it's just another fall apart in two years modern vac, it's worth half that. I have high hopes for this unit, because I've had good luck with Samsung in the past, and their products seem made to a higher level of durability than many of their competitors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R112BPOEOOYDTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOD354I#wasThisHelpful","R112BPOEOOYDTV","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's absolutely nothing I don't like about this detergent.It works well: cleans as thoroughly as any detergent I've ever used over the last four decades, including all the big name, chemical-laden brands. Except Puracy has no toxic chemicals, and you can both smell and feel that.Our clothes came out soft (we hang them dry) and smelling fresh, free of fake fragrance, with just a tiny hint of citrus smell.It has a simple pump top, so it never drips or leaves a mess.It's so concentrated that two quick pumps did a large wash easily and effectively.Amazingly, on top of all that: it's not only not expensive, it's cheap. Just about fifteen cents per load.And since clothes come out soft even when we hang them dry, they come out even softer from the drier, and thus need no fabric softener in either the washer or drier. That makes this detergent even more of a bargain.I love that it's Made In The USA, and that Puracy is a small local firm, not a multinational tax-dodging corporate behemoth. They clearly care about keeping their products as safe and yet also effective as possible. Which makes you wonder why the Big Label boys are dumping all those chemicals in our homes....and why we let them!This laundry detergent works perfectly, costs very little, and is completely safe for your family and the environment. Any product I can say that about that gets five stars and a thank you to the manufacturers for taking the time and care to offer real value on every front. They sent me this as a sample, and when it's gone we'll buy more. I can't offer a higher recommendation than that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UZF7AXJKFYE7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGLIZSE#wasThisHelpful","R3UZF7AXJKFYE7","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very useful tool for your glove compartment. Normal flashlights have nicad batteries that leak easily in heat, whereas this lithium battery has less issues with that. It not only makes a good and VERY bright emergency flashlight, it also strobes to signal help. Plus it doubles as a cellphone charger for emergencies, very useful in the car. As small as it is, it puts out a lot of light and power; this is a very good, basic design and is made pretty well.It has a good solid metal housing with one simple recessed switch.

"We have a collection of retractable dog leashes, so I compared this sample with various other models. The first thing of note is that this is almost exactly the same leash as the best selling RL on this site, for a dollar or two less. So that's a decent endorsement. But by the same token, there are a number of other companies selling this exact same leash, with their logo on it in the same place, for a few dollars under that. Clearly these are all made in the same factory in China and rebranded for each company. So, they might be pretty good leashes but they are not a unique design, which means you need to check out all the similar RL's on here and see which of these is the cheapest, as they all seem identical. And which has the longest warranty. No idea of the warranty on this one.The leash extends exactly 13 feet 4 inches (our dog measured it). The handle is a fair bit bigger than the spool, and easy to hold. The stop-leash button is spring-loaded, which is frankly not my favorite design, as those springs do go after a while. I have a very similar leash to this and our 50 lb shepherd ran hard at a squirrel and popped the leash off its inner sprocket. Because these are two halves glued shut, there are no screws to take it apart and fix it, which I've done with other higher quality RL's. That's a negative, as this is pretty solid, but nothing near the kind of heavy duty leash that a real running/playing medium/big dog will need to be able to rock hard while you brace yourself for the big pull at the end of the leash.13 feet is ok but my favorite RL is 20 feet, and those extra feet are well worth the mild extra weight and size, to me at least. I like to give our sweetie lots of room to roam when she has to be on leash.***By the way, we tie a little poop bag around the handle so we always have one ready if she goes.  Keep your city clean for your neighbors and they'll be more likely to love and support our doggies!***The leash is all band style, not cord plus band end, so that's a plus.The clip is decent, and well-attached to the band.If you have a light dog and don't want a long leash, this should do you well.But if you have a 50 lb or more dog that might be chasin' squirrels and cats suddenly and put pressure on the leash and mechanism inside, I would go for a heavier and longer retractable leash, preferably with the halves attached with screws so that you can do maintenance. This leash will be toast when that spring goes, and in my experience it will go in a year or two, especially as it's made in China. I have seen a MUCH higher failure rate on even simple mechanical items like this when they come from the corner-cutting Chinese factories.My best RL was ""Made in West Germany"", and it's been enduring much abuse and water etc for over six years with zero issues. It has a double switch for freezing the leash: one stops it and the other clicks it in. No spring, thus nothing to pop out or bend or break. That switch has taken serious abuse for six years and is as good as new (I've not seen any spring model be that good). It looks beat up but still works like a champ. It cost less than double this leash but it looks good to go for another six years. Sadly, I can't find it for sale anywhere any more. But look around at your options, there are a zillion in this category now.As with most things, I say go for maximum quality; in the long run it will save you money, and you'll have the best performance along the way. But if you just need a simple RL, this is the basic standard these days and is a decent deal at twenty bucks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CV3WTYK3D474/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OC72FXM#wasThisHelpful","R1CV3WTYK3D474","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Get the blu-ray! It's 20 now and the dvds are 18, and the BD is of course crisper and with better sound , and you get everything on one disc. I've seen both the dvds and BD, and for only two bucks more the blu-ray is a no-brainer for a set of shows as splendid as this.I really like a number of the Kilburn songs, but it's the Coliseum show that makes this a must. They were at their absolute peak that night, and even the mediocre sound (but not terrible at all, especially if you're used to bootlegs and hearing the music first and sound second) doesn't detract at all. I also like the minimal camera movement and shots; I just want to see all the band at once to see how they interact. I hate today's constant cutting every half second. This is how I like to watch a group: working as a group.Kilburn might have annoyed Pete at the time, but it holds up well, especially Fooled and Baba, and I really like this version of My Wife. The jam into the unrecorded Who's Next is another highlight; Pete's got a major buzz on and is just having fun at that point. The footage looks very very crisp indeed in blu-ray, and the sound is good. Keith is starting to fade, we can see that, but he's still pumping out the rhythm and good humor, and his love-hate with Pete is on display for all to see. Clearly much more love than hate.Daltrey is as much an Ox as the Ox, I think, dependable and solid. But it's Townshend who is the real highlight in all of this. He is without doubt the most entertaining guitarist to watch of them all, including Jimi, I think. Maybe Eddie during the classic VH days was this much fun to see (check the VH live vids on yootoob from '78-82 or so), but Pete had that raging bull aspect that really lent his performances an air of danger and edge. He seemed to be falling over much of the time but was very in control while out of control, and his groove is unmistakeable as he careens around the stage, windmilling and doing knee-slides and jumping three feet in the air as he crushed those power chords (or ""crash chords"" as Roger calls them).And of course, to get the full experience, turn this up to 11. They were the loudest band ever, after all.Volume is a big part of their visceral impact. This is their power fully unleashed, and designed to overwhelm.The Coliseum show is just Who paradise, to me. I have many Oo bootlegs and this is as good as the best of them, with video added. So crisp, and Moon is in tip top shape here. He and Pete are so tight it's crazy, and you can see why John was called the Ox. A more reliably crushing bassist I have not yet heard. Plus the Tommy material was so fresh and clean at this point; they were riding a juggernaut in every way and they knew it. Pete's comments to the crowd also show why they were so special: no typical rock star buttkissery here, simply a serious rock fan whose goal was to be part of their celebration of music and exuberance, not a rock star.This is THE video for serious Who fans, I think, even more so than The Kids, simply because of the Coliseum show. That's one of rock's best bands on one of their best nights (Pete himself has said so many times, and he might know), and it's a joy to finally have it in decent quality.Can't say enough about how great this is. No Who fan, perhaps even no rock fan, should be without it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22VYSZLAM8J3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DWNUI8#wasThisHelpful","R22VYSZLAM8J3","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An excellent overview of one rock's most rocking bands, Amazing Journey is full of truly intelligent interviews, and blissfully free of the excessive worship that plagues many rockumentaries. Pete isn't the only bright bulb in the band; Daltrey comes across as a very thoughtful and wise fellow, as do the filmmakers, who are smart enough to let the band speak for themselves.Six Quick Ones might be even better than the main feature, as we get more in-depth and personal stuff about each of the four, with Moonie of course being the most entertaining. There's some prime stuff in there, and plenty of laughs to boot. Curbishley's story about the Ox trashing Keith's hotel room in the extras is worth the price of admission alone. Hilarity followed Moon everywhere he went...as did astronomical bar bills. Drinking 18 margaritas and then walking upstairs to mess with your bassist's gourmet meal, and his wall? Priceless. Or, about 8k, all told.There's only clips of songs here, but plenty of them; if you want live footage, run don't walk to the Kilburn reissue dvd, or of course The Kids Are Alright. But this is the best overview of The Who's career I've seen, in terms of placing them into context of their times, socially and musically, and getting the band to talk about themselves and each other in depth. Anyone who sees them as a bunch of yobbos (which is how they see themselves!) will also find a very thoughtful group of frenemies who rocked as hard as they did because they never held anything back.And at the present price of less than six bucks for two dvds, this is a g-g-gift!So if you know any Who fans, gift them this and they'll love you for it.It's top notch all around.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R390596OFUXEVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VLOKQI#wasThisHelpful","R390596OFUXEVN","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very well-made thermos mug. All-steel body keeps things warm/hot minus 10 degrees or so for about two to three hours. The top is easy to open with one finger, and stays very closed when not. Also easy to flip and keep open for washing or finger-free sipping.The carry loop is a nice idea but I'd prefer it to be a bit more recessed, as it does make packing it etc a tad trickier than with an all-slim profile.My only real knock on this is the price, which they're not clear on yet here. It says 30-42, and that's just too high for this. I'd say 20 bucks is the perfect price for this item, and would give it five happy stars for that or less. Maybe even at 25. But over 30, this is a great mug but not a great value, unless you are a driver who loves hot hot liquids and must have a one-hand mug.One caveat: this does keep stuff very hot, so if you put in boiling coffee you will be sipping near-boiling coffee for at least one hour afterwards. That's a good thing, but my burned tongue reminded me to mention it, as it's easy to expect things to cool down faster than this. That they don't is the big plus of this mug.It's definitely built to last, so if price is no object, this should last you many years; the only thing that can break is the spring lid, and it seems to be a good steel spring.

"Very brief:This is a good heater for small-medium rooms, but it does use a lot of juice. If you need quick heat, it's very good. But if you need long term, more affordable heat, I'd go with a good oil-filled radiator. Please read the whole review for the reasons why.Very not brief:I've been using portable electric heaters for 30 years now, and I've tried most every type there is: quartz space heater, baseboard, oil-filled radiator, and these infrared puppies. Each has their purpose and use, and in reviewing this infrared heater I'll compare and contrast all of those, and also, I hope, save you some money and aggravation. I'll also address some common issues people complain about with these heaters.First, how much power does this unit use? Electric bills are a main concern with these heaters, so always keep your power bill in mind when comparing them. This unit claims to pull 1500 watts and 12.5 amps. I have an appliance load tester and to be exact, while it's heating this draws 1430 watts and 11.9 amps. That is quite a lot of electricity at today's prices, and seeing as there is no low setting, that's what you'll be drawing from your wall ALL of the time with this. Keep that in mind when comparing.Bu the way, I must add here the most vital point with any of these heaters:NEVER USE AN EXTENSION CORD WITH ANY PORTABLE HEATER!!!Sorry for the all-caps, but it's a warning used not often enough in the literature for PHs. These usually draw anywhere from 500 to 2000 watts, and that gets their factory cords warm enough already. Add an extension cord and suddenly the resistance can easily result in hot cords and fires, and every year it does, in hundreds and maybe many thousands of cases resulting in torched houses and deaths around the world. Don't be one of these statistics.NEVER use anything but the factory cord, no matter how heavy, straight into your wall socket. And always keep all heaters at least two feet from all drapes. In fact, I set them on tiles, never a rug or wood, just in case. Tiles cost a buck a piece and might save your family's lives.That said, let's look at this heater. The best thing about this sort of infrared heater is that it heats very quickly, the most quickly of the four listed above. The element heats up within a minute and then the fan blows the heat out of this unit. (This fan makes a mild noise, not loud but very audible.) In this Duraflame's case, the fan is about 12 inches off the floor and blows slightly upwards into the room. You can feel the warm air blowing to about 30 inches away or so. This is very nice if you're in a very cold room and need direct heat on your body, or for putting your frozen toeses up in the air and letting the warm air thaw them. A tiny quartz space heater (let's call those QSH) will also do that, but a baseboard (BB) and oil-filled radiator (OFR) will not.The off-gassing smell took about 3 hours to disappear from this during first use. Put it outside or in your garage for at least three hours first time out, as whatever they claim, those chemicals coming off the filaments ain't healthy. That smell gives headaches for a reason: your brain is telling you to flee. But all heaters have this, so there you go.This unit lets you set the auto-off timer to 30 minutes, or 1 to 8 hours. That's a very useful feature. It also has a thermostat, going from 50 to 97 degrees. This is, like almost all of these PH thermostats, quite useless. It rarely matches your room's actual temp, and there is usually a 3-7 degree swing in using it as your on-off switch. For instance, you set this at 66 in a 60 degree room and it will try to heat the room to 68, then stop and not come back on until it's 62 or 63. That wide swing is often too wide for many folks' comfort, so I recommend using this as an on or off proposition, and letting the timer do the work. Otherwise, if you unwisely trust this thermostat, the heater might stay on 24/7 in serious winter weather, and 24 x 1430 watts equals a LOT of money at the end of the month.That brings up another vital thing I've learned about heaters. All of them work best if you have two simple tools: a thermometer on the wall, and a fan to move the heat around the room. I can't stress enough how vital the fan is. Heat rises and gets trapped by the ceiling, where it does you no good. A small (or large in a large room) fan pointed at the ceiling will keep that heat circulating, and end up saving you a TON of money. I've compared, and also paid the high bills without a fan.USE A FAN POINTED AT THE CEILING.You'll stay much warmer for much less money. Even this unit, with an enclosed fan, needs another fan to keep the heat moving properly in the room.When you're warm enough, check your thermometer. That's your baseline goal. Now try moving your heater in various places in the room and see how long it takes to get to that temp after it's dropped a few degrees. Pay attention and you will save a lot of cash, because one of the main goals with a PH is using as little electricity, and thus money, as you can.And now the most vital thing to make your PH work well: insulation. INSULATION! Look at reviews across this site for PHs and you'll see the same complaint: ""This won't get my room above 60 degrees no matter how long it's on!"" Well, in a word...duh! If your room isn't insulated properly, it's leaking heat! NO heater will get your room to stay warm unless you're using a wood stove or central heat, and you will still be wasting heat and money.Want to stay warm all winter? Insulate your main room and your whole house. Period. It's an investment that will pay major dividends over the years, and we know energy prices will continue to rise; in the long run they always do.This step will save you the most money in the long run, and keep you warmest, and you'll need a smaller heater. Even just some blankets over the windows can make a massive difference. Put some on the coldest walls too. Get plenty of blankets cheap at Goodwill and save hundreds of dollars in heat/power bills over the winter.By the way, you'll never get warm in zero degree weather without wearing some sweaters and thick wool socks. This might seem obvious, but how many folks have you met who complain about being cold while having thin shoes or no socks or sweater(s) on?Why heat a big room when it's only YOU that is cold?Wear a ton of clothes and save a ton of money! It's that simple.In fact, the easiest and cheapest way to stay warm is very simple: a wool watchman's cap. NOTHING will keep you warmer longer than a 100% wool cap. Socks are the other key, but a large amount of body heat radiates from your head. A simple all-wool cap will stop almost all of that loss, and you can keep your room cooler and save a lot of money. I've endured many winters in deep snow and sub-zero temps, and a wool cap is the absolute secret to comfort. Wearing one in your house saves you a load of cash and keeps you warm in every room. Don't feel silly wearing a cap in the house...feel silly for having to because your house isn't properly insulated! Seriously, try an all-wool cap, nothing works better. But get all wool, acrylic etc doesn't come close to insulating like wool.Hot tea is also extremely efficient. Nothing heats your body faster and cheaper. A wool cap and socks plus hot tea or soup every half hour has kept me toasty in minus 30 weather in a 40 degree cabin for days on end. Try it and see!And for arctic-cold area folks who complain that their little portable heater only gets the room to 50 degrees when it's minus 10 outside: NO portable heater will warm a poorly insulated room way above the outdoor temperature. You're dreaming! Dress warm, drink hot liquids and seriously consider a wood stove. For heavy-duty BTU's, nothing works better, and the new ones use very little wood and are very efficient. Small or large propane heaters are even faster, but cost more and I have never liked the very dry air they create, nor the way they suck oxygen from the air. I consider them and all gas heaters unhealthy, especially with the carbon monoxide issues. They give me headaches and make me feel lethargic, even with a cracked window. In order, I prefer central heating (if your house is well insulated), then a very good small wood stove, then PHs, and finally gas if there is no other choice.A quick summary of this heater's other features: it's a little over a foot high, made of solid, not too cheesy looking veneer, and is on casters for moving, a great feature that also keeps it up off the rug/floor. I still put it on tiles, but those casters are a good feature. It weighs a little over 20 lbs and is easy to move around. You could sit in a chair and put your feet up against the front to warm them with this, another good aspect. It has a remote control, useful for cold mornings in bed; hit the snooze button and turn this on, and in ten minutes your room is warm. Nice feature. On the front of the heater there's a power on/off button, temp up and down buttons, and the timer button. And as stated, only one power/heat setting is available: high!Which brings us to the disadvantages of this heater. You'll have issues getting it to keep your room temp right where you want it; the temp swing will make it a little cold then maybe a little hot. Or a lot too cold. But rarely too hot, unless you are a wise soul with good insulation on your body and in your room and house.And that is why, all told, I prefer a good oil-filled radiator heater. They are completely silent. They swing less in temperature, and best of all they usually have three settings: 500, 100, 1500 watts. I have found that with a fan blowing the warm air above an OFR around the room, I can leave it on 500 watts and keep a room as warm as a 1,500 watt heater like this. That is of course a major savings. Plus, a good OFR is often less than 100 bucks.BUT...the key with a heater is not initial cost, it's heating bills. You can end up paying fast and hard for buying a cheap portable heater.Speaking of, what about those quartz space heaters and baseboard heaters? I've found both to be very inefficient. BB are good because they are low and heat rises, but even with a fan I find their total power cost to be too high, and they sit against a wall, which is usually cold, and this makes them even less efficient. QSH are great for one use: warming up a cold bathroom or bedroom in minutes. On winter mornings before our central heat warms up the house in about 15 minutes, I put our little QSH on in the bathroom and it's warm in three minutes. They are basically a tiny version of this larger infrared heater, but this guy is way too big for a bathroom. I recommend having a nice little QSH on hand for folks in very cold areas, as it can be a life saver when coming to a cold cabin or house and needing to thaw frostbitten fingers or toes in minutes. And it can get your bedroom warm in minutes.Which is the main negative with OFR: they take a good 20 minutes or more to warm a room. But that also means they hold their heat well after that, which makes them far more efficient than the other types. That means money saved. I've compared power bills between all types of electric heat and the OFR wins by a mile. If your utility company is hosing you, get a small fan and an OFR, insulate your main room, and you will save big time.And please keep in mind: our electricity is coming from power plants that use mostly either coal or nuclear fuel, neither of which is doing our planet any favors. The less power you have to draw from your sockets, the better. You'll not only save money but also make the world a little healthier, and at this point in history we are fast running out of resources, so creating efficiency is doing not only your family but everyone's families a big favor.So here's my heating recommendations in a nutshell: wear a wool hat and socks and sweaters when really cold, no matter what heater you use. And stay under blankets, even on the sofa or at a table. Drink plenty of hot liquids (add some cayenne to really get your core sizzling). Make sure you've insulated your house, and especially main sitting room, as well as possible. No heater can warm a drafty room, period. For quick heat, use a QSH in small rooms or IH in large. BB heaters, don't bother, not worth it. But long term, an oil-filled radiator will cost the least and heat the most.Yet if you can afford it, I think one of these infrared heaters plus an OFR is the best all-around solution. The IH will heat your room fast, and then your OFR will keep it warm for less money. When it gets really cold, you can use the IH's blown heat right on your body.And this Duraflame is a good infrared heater at a fair price, and with its features like casters and auto shutoff, it's a safer unit than most. At its present price of 160, it's a good deal for a 1500 watt IH. I wish it had a half power setting, which costs it a star. But along with a quality OFR, this will keep you warm all winter and at a fair power bill price, if you pay attention to insulation of your house and your body, and use a fan or two to keep the warm air flowing.If you've read this far, you are likely trying to stay warm. Please try my tips and see what you think, and also please write a comment to say if they worked for you, or if you have other good ideas to share with the rest of us.Here's wishing you many cozy winter nights in your efficiently heated home!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO7RZGZGLUARY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K172QS6#wasThisHelpful","RO7RZGZGLUARY","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This leather vest is extremely well made. The stitching is above average; I pulled on all of it, inside the pockets and out and along the seams, and there was no give at all. Bike gear needs to be extra solid, as it gets pulled and torn at more than most clothing, and Viking Cycle did a great job making this vest (in Pakistan, btw) solidly and with attention to detail.For instance, in addition to two outside zip pockets, it has two inside pockets, one zip and one snap. The snap one is big, the zip one smaller but perfect for a wallet and phone, etc. The linings on both pockets are solid and well-sewn, often an issue with inside pockets. The zippers are good quality, as are the snaps with buffalo nickel heads, a nice touch.The leather is a good thick hide, pebbled and sturdy. It's not butter-soft but I wouldn't want that nap on a biking vest. This is solid leather, thick enough to give you some protection in a mild wipe out but still pliable enough for daily use.I have only one minor issue with this vest: for an XL it's very tight around the waist. I am a 36 and this JUST snaps shut when I have on jeans and a shirt. The arm holes are huge and thus give good room for arm movement while riding, and you could wear this over sweaters, etc. But unless you have an unusually small waist, I would opt for the XXL if your waist is over 36, or maybe even 34 if you have a beer belly, as when this is buttoned up and I bend over, it's mighty tight. Still, if you want to look a little more svelte than you are while emphasizing your shoulders, perhaps this design is just the ticket. I do know that while I wear it, I keep getting ladies asking me for my autograph and saying, ""We love you, Dwayne!"" When I tell them I'm not really The Rock, they can hardly believe it. Until I take off the vest. Then they grab their pens back and look at me all huffy. Oh well.All told, I think this is a flat out bargain at its present price of 55 here. The leather is tough and will help keep you warm while giving your arms plenty of mobility, and the snaps, stitching and pockets are top quality. I was sent a sample for review, but I would gladly pay 75 for this and feel it was a good deal. Just keep the waist size in mind. Of course, if you like to leave your vest open, as many riders do, then the XL will be fine for you, unless you are the Hulk. But I'd recommend XXL if your waist is 36 or over.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ8ZTG8W1VBRT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IA44LJO#wasThisHelpful","RZ8ZTG8W1VBRT","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is certainly the lightest guitar stand I have ever used, and it folds up nice and small. If your gig bag has a big front pocket, it might even fit in there. Oddly enough, however, my main issue with this stand is that I wish part of it was bigger and another part smaller. The stand is not tall, so the back of the guitar touches it low on the instrument, making it less stable; this combines with flat legs that stretch so far out that some of my guitars, mainly electric, have to be quite far from vertical to grip the rubber properly, so the stand has to be far enough out from the wall that the neck of the git won't touch the wall, as it leans far from vertical on the stand. Not a big problem, and not for acoustics, but a mild issue for electrics in one very small practice room I use.The only other issue I had with this review sample is that it is so small and light that I'm a little edgy about having it out in the open and not a corner, as even a small nudge on a Les Paul I had in the stand made it almost fall out of the stand. So I'd recommend lighter guitars for this stand, and putting it far from where it might be touched. I would not recommend this as a gigging stand, unless you can find a corner of the stage that no one goes near.But it's still quite stable for its size, if used with lighter axes, and its portability is certainly a plus. The present price here of 25 is not bad, so if you need a very small, light stand, this is a good choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HHX486VY35G9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MU2DJM2#wasThisHelpful","R2HHX486VY35G9","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Carbons tend to be brighter but not quite as warm as old school nylon. This set is ""hard tension""---ie thicker strings---and seems even brighter due to that tension, but the Dynacore bottom wounds are a little warmer than you might expect. These strings certainly do project well, with a fair bit of bite. If you use mainly fingernails, these might seem pretty stiff at 440. I use my pads and tips more, so the brightness is appreciated, but I also tune down to Eb, so the extra give is a big plus with these. I do that because I like the tone more, it's easier on my fingers, and I break WAY less strings. I don't know about you, but I'm not nuts about putting new strings on my classical guitars; it takes some doing to get it just right. These went on relatively easily enough, however, and I stretched them very gently to avoid breakage.These are on a good old '70s Yamaha, and at Eb they sound very full and rich, though with that carbon edge. I would recommend using normal tension for most players trying these strings, or tuning down as I do with these thicker strings, though some guitars might need an adjustment if they flop a bit too much for you at Eb. But with these hard t's it's a nice tradeoff, as the deeper tone compensates for the brightness nicely.I've used D'Addarios on my acoustics for over 25 years and love them, as they're very reliable and hold their tone well. I haven't used their classical strings much, but I do like these. I can't say much about the long term tone of these Pro-Arte carbons, but we shall see. They do feel good under my fingers, and the tone is sharp and strong out of the package. Another reviewer said he had breakage issues, so perhaps he and others with this problem might consider using normal tension strings, or tuning down a half step to compensate; the looser feel can be good, once you adjust. All I know is that these went on fine for me and play well at Eb, with no action or nut adjustment needed.They are a little pricey, but if they hold their good tone for a while I'd say they're worth it, as they do give the guitar a bit more edge and authority. I'm merely competent on the classical guitar, but I'm guessing serious professional players might really dig the projection and snap of these carbons.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23YJGDNNVB3NL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L1LL182#wasThisHelpful","R23YJGDNNVB3NL","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like everything about this unit, except the price. The mics work well, the speaker is clear, the build quality is solid. It's (USB) plug and play, pretty much, and relatively noiseless. But I've got a number of bluetooth mic/speakers that do just as good a job, or nearly, for 50 bucks or so. Perhaps if you are sitting around a conference table with many people, the multiple mics are useful, yet even then, one good mic will pick up everything in a room. But to charge 220 for basically a small speaker and a few small dynamic mics? Unless you're writing this off on your company's dime, I just can't see paying that much when I can get almost the same performance for 1/4 the price.For professional users, I would recommend this as a well-made, pro-quality unit. For the usual simple skype etc calls, though, I'd say shop around before committing to this price tag.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BAOTL4QGC39X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GD1B8U6#wasThisHelpful","R2BAOTL4QGC39X","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a big lavender oil fan, I like this stuff. It's finer and stronger than most, and one drop goes a long way, and therein lies my only quibble with this product. I don't mind the 15 buck price tag, as fine oils do cost a lot. But the bottle most always drops out two or three drops at a time due to the crappy top, so that you end up with a very strong lavender scent where you might want it mild.Apart from that, it's excellent.I was sent this as a review sample.

"4.7 starsI've used this almost every day for the past few months, often for 10-14 hours, and can vouch for its durability. It leaves less mess under it than most diffusers, and the sleek design and quiet operation make it usable anywhere. It uses a little over 3 oz of water and will keep your room smelling of the oil you prefer for about 4-8 hours; the machine shuts off automatically after about 4 hours, usually with a little water left. If you add more water to that, you get a very light scent as the rest of the oil is diffused.We like lavender, peppermint, and lemon oils best, and this works well for all of them, and combinations thereof. Some oils are heavier than others, and this unit's sonic mister does use up the heavier oils faster, as they sink to the sonic ring faster. So you get more of those smells quicker, and then less as the hours roll by.Here's a VERY useful tip: after using many diffusers and seeing how they only diffused in a small area, I've started using a mini-fan behind this one, and what a difference! It blows the fine mist across the room, thus not only dispersing the scent far more, but also completely getting rid of any residue near the machine. Win/win! It also humidifies the room a tiny bit.By the way, the switch is really in the little rubber rear feet, so if you have issues with turning it on/off by pressing on the unit, simply lift it a tiny bit and use the little foot. The sample they sent me had a sticker where you're meant to push, and that left some goo after removal; a little rubbing alcohol on a tissue cleaned that right off.The changing lights are very nice in the dark, and being able to freeze the color you like is a very useful feature.That and the quality of this diffuser in general makes it five stars. I'd like it to cost 30 bucks, but even at 50 this is so well-made that it's worth five stars. It's as good as any diffuser I've used, and the good adapter, easy-fill, subtle rainbow color band and look of the unit makes it a truly fine diffuser.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGS1XFG3VJ272/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9NR672#wasThisHelpful","RGS1XFG3VJ272","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll never really understand why electric guitar strings need to be ""louder"". Acoustic, sure, as the string and guitar top are what produce the tone together. But electric strings simply make a rather infinitesimal signal that is then picked up by the poles of the pups, passed on through the cable to the amp, and then amplified. Strings not loud enough? Turn up the amp. It's the tone of the string that concerns me, not how loud that tone is.So I'm always a little skeptical about ""louder"" e-strings. Really, what's the point? If you're trying to get your pups to create more signal, you can easily raise them closer to your strings, or use bigger strings (the legendary if mostly apocryphal SRV .15 set; his tone came more from how hard he attacked the string than anything else, though thicker strings will take more abuse). Or just crank the amp! So I put these ""maraging steel"" strings (weren't they a metal band from Putney?) on a Strat, with low expectations.And, for the most part, those expectations were met. Yes, these strings are somewhat louder than standard Slinkies, which for years were my usual choice, and a fair bit louder than the pure nickels which I now prefer. But the feel of these m-steels is not very pleasant. I slide and bend a lot, and these are just harsh on my fingertips. They might be great for metal players who chug along in drop-tunings and play basic riffs and power chords, but for blues, jazz and classic rock, these are overkill, and actually make the tone too harsh for my ears.I compared them to both regular Slinkies and pure nickel Slinkies, and I found the m-steels' ONLY ""advantage"" to be a brighter, edgier tone. But there weren't finer harmonic overtones, there weren't sweeter sounds, and above all they were just not as musical-sounding as the other two. I play mostly class A tube amps, and these m-steels just don't seem to vibe with them like the pure nickels, or even regular strings. They sound a little sterile and edgy, great for metal but that's about it.Plus, I just had a fret job on that Strat, and these m-steels are definitely harsher on the frets. I had played pure nickels on them for about 100 hours with no visible wear at all, but after only about three hours with the m-steels, I could see very clear flattening on the frets where I do a lot of bending. After only a few hours! Seeing as quality fretjobs cost at least 200-300 bucks, that's not very economical.Which brings me to the least appealing aspect of these strings: the price. They are now 11 clams here, three times the price of regular Slinkies and more than double the pure nickels. But why? Maybe the tiny bit of different steel is worth more, but three times? There's very little metal in a pack of strings, all told. The high price is a marketing scam, I think, and the tone and feel of these nowhere justifies that much more money. Add that 11 bucks times 10 or 20 to a new fretjob every year, which I would need playing these strings every day for hours, and these become very very expensive, unless you never bend notes. Which means these are, to my mind, useful only for metal rhythm players. Hetfield might love them.So in my opinion these are well-made strings that do seem to hold their tone (however sterile) longer than most, and give a louder, brighter signal to your pups. But I think only metal players will truly find that useful. Metal players who don't mind an annual fretjob, anyways. For classic rock, blues and any other music where sweet tone is at a premium, these are not only not worth three times the normal price, I wouldn't use them if they cost the same. The scratchy feel under my fingers, the grating bite of the tone as you go up the neck, the edgier harmonics: none of that is what I want from a string.But each to their own, and I know that Petrucci and Gilbert and other more-notes-is-better players use these, so that will appeal to some. Fair enough. But they can afford $300 fretjobs every year, and they get these strings for free. Plus, I'd rather sound like Gilmour or Page or Hendrix than those guys, and you'll have trouble getting their sweet tone out of these strings. Louder is not better, to my ears. Sweeter is better, and if I need louder riffs or more top end, I merely turn up the gain or the treble on my amp a bit. But I couldn't get the sweet, rich tone I love from m-steels while playing Time or Spanish Castle Magic or Out On The Tiles.Still, that's just one set of ears and fingers. Perhaps you'll love the edge and volume of these; compare them to your favorite strings and see what you think, especially if you use solid state amps. Only your ears know what they like, after all. But my ears and fingers say that no way are these worth three times the price of normal Slinkies.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BZNHGBBSBRA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J5S5WY2#wasThisHelpful","R1BZNHGBBSBRA9","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Edit, 2/18/2015: I will never buy another DVP product. I just found out they were bought by Del Monte, who now sources some of the ingredients in DVP stuff from China.

They are pretty big so you might want to tear them in half, depending on your dog's size.They are perhaps a tad expensive; I would have guess these cost about 7-9 bucks, so 12 and change is a bit much. It's rather nuts that we pay double or more for pet stuff  than we would for the same ingredients when meant for people.

"This is a small solar led lamp that gives off a flickering effect from a little LED bulb under the dome. This reflects off the fake candle under it and gives the effect of a burning candle, or so.The first thing I'll say is you basically MUST have this below eye level, as seeing the LED bulb not only ruins the candle illusion, but it's just not very nice to look at directly and unreflected. Thus the hanging option makes little sense, unless you're hanging it from a low tree limb or bush (the famous Flickering Bush).The solar option is the best thing about this, as you can leave it outside on a table on the patio or by or even in the garden, and the sun will charge the little AA battery and keep the lamp flickering all night. Even indirect sun will suffice for a few hours each night. Not having to turn it on or off is nice, and there's a switch to turn it off if you want to.You can also replace the rechargeable battery after a year or whatever, a good option as that makes this usable for many years. The sample they sent came with a mediocre rechargeable battery; get a good one and you'll get a brighter light that will last longer.All in all, it's just a little plastic light, but the effect is pleasant, the price is about right at 15, and the automatic on/off solar aspect is the real selling point, making this useful for those who want to put it on a patio table or among the plants in their garden and let it do its flickering thing every night without your having to worry about turning it on and off.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXP9T09TP1HZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4OKO50#wasThisHelpful","RXP9T09TP1HZS","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Russian tubes, like most Russkies, break up sooner than their Chinese counterparts. That really matters if you want more hair (harmonic distortion) on your tone. So why pay 30% more to get gold pins, which tend to smooth out the hair?Good question, unless you want the best of both worlds. I A-B-C-D'ed this and a normal EH 12ax7 and a JJ and a GT in the vital V1 position of my Blues Jr. The GT was crap, hard and cold. The JJ was nicer but still not as good as an old Mullard I had (a real old one, not a New Sensor-owned Mullard reissue). The normal EH was nice but a bit too tight in some ways, not smoothing out when the amp was dimed. But this gold pin EH was very golden with the amp wide open, not only creamier and warmer but also quieter than the other tubes. Darn close to the Mullard, which, when you can find them now, go for 100-200 bucks.For me, close to that level of tone is well worth 18 bucks.I wouldn't bother so much with gold tips in V2 or V3, but try one in that all-vital first position where your preamp tone is really defined, and see what you think. It took about 80 hours for this tube to really wear in and start fully singing, but when it did, it was quite nice indeed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SNE08IBRO31G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UML9BC#wasThisHelpful","R3SNE08IBRO31G","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are just rebranded Sovteks and weak Chinese whatevers.PERIOD.GT merely weeds out the occasional microphonics and ringers and then adds 20-30%. But then everybody does that lately...except JJ, who makes their own tubes in their own factory, and while their 84's aren't anywhere near the very best NOS stuff out there, they're way cheaper, and don't cost a penny more than these often sloppy Russian/Chinese tubes.It says something when these are the only tubes stocked in-store by the masters of monopoly, Guitar Center and Musician's Friend (by putting all the small locally-owned music stores out of business you're our friends?). Bain Capital owns both of those firms---now there's some guaranteed competition, not---and I think we all know that creamy, singing tone is what Mitt Romney is all about!These 84's vary wildly in consistency. They're stock in Fenders these days, and many other amps. Why? Not because they're the best, but because they're the cheapest with a ""brand name"". Aspen Pittman's days of being truly musician-friendly are long gone. Just another sell-out. He was for real in the '80s and GT put out some killer tubes back then, but now they're just logo'ed mediocrity.I pulled the stock GT 84's from my NOS Blues Junior and used JJ 84's and EH 12ax7's and the difference was night and day. For the same money as these GT's sell for here. Duh. You do the math.The top end was smoother. The mids were creamier. The lows were punchier AND more extended, with nice definition around 100-300k, where these GT's were flabby and bogus.There are worse tubes out there, but GT does not deserve their long-done reputation as boutique tubes. They're really just a scam: they're not Groove Tubes, they're Sovteks. So go buy Sovteks and save 40% if you want cheap. Some Sovteks are pretty good...maybe you'll get lucky! Just remember that, in general, Russian tubes break up earlier than Chinese, so if you want edge, go Russian. If you want smooth, go Chinese.Or why not getcha some JJ's, or better yet, look around on your local c-list and find some NOS tubes and play mix and match. THAT is how you will get the tone of your dreams. Trust your ears and change tubes at will and see what you like. Wise tip: always use contact cleaner when you change tubes, it helps your sockets stay clingy and avoid all those scratchy noises we hate; maybe even retension your sockets if they seem loose. Easy to do.You CAN do all this yourself, as well as biasing your own amps easily. No need to pay techs when you could be doing it all yourself and learning about what makes your dream tone as you go along. A little research goes a long way. But no need for a bias probe with a Blues Jr or other cathode-based, Class A fixed bias amps. Just mix and match various tubes and trust your ears. Stick 'em in and wail away! Just remember, some tubes take 100+ hours to burn in and really show their potential. Patience (and lots of practice time!) go a long way towards the tone you want.If you love that sweet British chime and snarl of good 84's (and 34's), AVOID Groove Tubes and look up JJ and local NOS stuff. It's out there if you search. Your Marshall, Vox, Blues Jr etc will thank you for doing your homework. Because if you've read this far, you know that when you finally find that tone you want, it will be worth all the effort.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32A795L92RX6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UK781I#wasThisHelpful","R32A795L92RX6J","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These were certainly brighter than the factory bulbs they replaced. I wasn't nuts about the rather odd hue, but the throw was longer than before and they were quite bright. Though do you ever curse that guy driving at you with super bright bulbs, so you flick your lights to tell him he's got his brights on, and he replies by saying. ""These are my normal bulbs!"" by flashing his brights...which blind you? Well, I'm not really sure I want to BE that guy! Not very polite to blind other drivers, is it? The Golden Rule and all that...if our society still operates on anything remotely close to that outdated principle of putting kindness before self-interest.Exactly how bright IS too bright, before we're abusing other drivers? And maybe temporarily blinding them for even a second, enough to cause an accident? Look at the stats, it happens more and more. How bright is really fair to other drivers? Like people driving while talking on their omnipresent umbilical cell phones, we need to seriously look at how our driving behaviors hurt everyone else on the road.In any case, GE didn't give me the chance to find out, as the left bulb went out intermittently within two weeks of installation. (Installing headlight bulbs is usually very easy to do by yourself, by the way. Takes two minutes. If confused, look up a youtube video on it, there are many.) At first it happened only once in a while, then it started happening every ten minutes for a minute or two. Finally a cop pulled me over and said, ""Your driver's side light is out."" He said to turn it on, and suddenly it worked again. The cop looked confused and let us go (that was rather entertaining, I'll admit). Lucky break, but not exactly a fun way to almost get a hefty ticket.I thought it was a bad connection so I took it apart and used cleaner on the contacts. But no help, and finally it just stopped working half the time. Switched sides, same issue, so not the car's fault. Might be a bad element, who knows? The filament isn't broken, in any case. I bought another brand instead, bright but not too bright for other drivers' comfort. They are to date much more dependable than GE. And much cheaper. Ahem.And that's the thing: stuff does break sometimes...but when the company is charging WELL above the average price for that product, you have a right to expect top notch performance, and no bad batches. Isn't that why we pay top dollar in the first place?In any case, General Electric needs to get a little less general about quality control.If you're going to charge the most, you better deliver.I wouldn't pay anywhere close to this price for this performance.

"Edit, 2/18/2015: I have now researched DVP more thoroughly. Turns out they were bought out by Del Monte, a super-sleazy multi-national who don't give a damn about my dog or yours. They source some of their ingredients in China and MANY people have reported their dogs becoming very sick with UTI's and other serious issues since NB/DVP have started using China's sickeningly greedy and morally bankrupt suppliers.Let me just say this:NEVER BUY ANY NATURAL BALANCE AGAIN IF YOU LOVE YOUR DOG!!There are many brands for far less money that are sourced from people who care.Don't support these greedy corporate weasels.I apologize for not researching this company better for previous reviews. I hope to make up for it by costing them a lot of business. They don't care about my dog, why should I gave a damn about their bloated corporate profits?Dick Van Patten must be turning in his grave. SHAME on whomever in his family sold this good brand to the Del Monte scumbags.  *************************************************Our pooch likes these, but that's like saying men liked Marilyn Monroe. It's just the nature of the beast. She'll eat most anything she can get her paws on (our dog, not Marilyn). But she seems to enjoy a soft treat like these as an alternative to the fine organic snacks we often give her, among other treats. I like the lack of crap in the ingredients, but if NB is going to really go healthy, why not spend the extra couple cents per pack and use free range, non-tortured chicken?Most chickens in this country are ""raised"" in tiny cages and stuffed full of hormones and antibiotics while barely moving inches from birth to death (it's the sad truth, look it up), so feeding the oft diseased parts of these maltreated, malnourished animals to my own animals somehow seems not only hypocritical but just plain wrong.If I love my pets, shouldn't I share that same level of love with animals I won't meet? I think so, which is why I try to participate in cruelty-free animal treatment by buying non-factory meat for my animal friends. Because they are indeed my friends.I bring this up because I think someone from DVP might read this and consider it. They are clearly trying to care more than most pet food companies, so why not take the quest for quality-sourced ingredients to the next level?It's for that desire that I give this product four stars, as it is mostly made of very decent ingredients. No GMOs, no bad grains, a small amount of nutraceuticals, much better than most dog snacks in general. But to fulfill Dick's desire to really help animals, why not whole-heartedly support cruelty-free animal treatment?Edit: Four stars to one. No wonder they don't use free-range anything. They don't care about animals, yours or mone, only their products.

"As a long time (if presently former) New Yorker subscriber, I like the idea of this book: who dreams up those intelligent, wry and often hilarious cartoons? I have certain favorites among their veteran cartoonists, and a couple of them are here (Gahan and Gross). I was really hoping for BEK (Bruce Kaplan), the sharpest of the last few decades' bunch to my mind, but oh well. Insert dejected caption here.These are all world class single panel cartoonists/artists, yet the truth is that in every case the art is far more fascinating than the artist. I enjoyed learning about Chast and Koren and the others, and was most amused by the predictable yet welcome irascibility of Gross and Wilson, whose work has been the edgiest in the magazine for roughly a half century in both cases, a startlingly lengthy record (maybe laughter really does keep you young, or at least let you live longer). They are both grumpy old coots but still funny and committed to their weirdness in charmingly odd ways. If you don't know their work, I highly recommend their best-of collections, easily found on this site. They both have wonderfully warped senses of humor, and Gahan in particular has a macabre imagination unlike any other artist, which along with his weird whimsy has created thousands of classic panels.Likewise Sam Gross. The best part of this book for me was the inclusion of a few previously unpublished cartoons by most of the artists. The Gross ones are by far the best, if laughter is a fair barometer of a cartoon's worth. The box office sketch, which the NY would never publish, is so classically Gross I literally had to put the book down while I LMAO (no doubt Sam has a cartoon somewhere of a guy texting that while having a completely flat backside). The lack of a caption makes it doubly perfect.That's one of the details discussed here by many of the artists: what makes a great caption, and how not needing one is the pinnacle of the art. Another sad detail is how few cartoon outlets there are now. I grew up in the '70's reading many mags with great cartoons, not only Playboy but so many others. One odd omission here is no nod by anyone towards Hustler, who love them or hate them have published some of the funniest cartoons since the National Lampoon (king of all twisted cartoon mags). Flynt was all about freedom of expression, however sick, and many of these cartoonists had hundreds of panels in his mags, but won't mention him. Or the NY won't let them...Which brings up a real issue here: since there are so few outlets for these guys now, they're all rather fawning towards their last big cash cow, the New Yorker, and the author, part of that team. So this book often comes off as a rather dull magazine article advertising the NY's cartoonists, rather than a truly in-depth, no holds barred set of artist biographies. Which is kind of disappointing and perhaps overly ironic, considering how edgy and acutely accurate these artists' work often is about the shallow nature of our society and economy these days.But if you like these folks' work, you'll like this book. You'll learn about their methods and personal quirks, and you'll also get a last glimpse of what is, quite sadly for those of us who have loved their work for so many years, the last of a dying breed.Insert perfectly accurate single panel drawing here, with no caption necessary due to its perfectly pithy pictorial portrayal.Thanks are due in any case to all cartoonists for making our lives a lot more fun. From the New Yorker to the Far Side, Herman and Doonesbury, you've sure made me laugh for a long, long time. It's nice to see some of you get props via books like this. But how about some bio books as edgy as your cartoons?The great Rick Geary (and others) have done cartoon autobios that turned out very well, so here's hoping for more of the same from Wilson, Gross and company. Until then, this is a decent little tribute to some very fine and under-appreciated artists.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RMVQAQW7VU6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544114450#wasThisHelpful","R1RMVQAQW7VU6H","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I am one of those odd folks who prefers using a computer for computer things and a phone for phone things, I know most people now want it all in one. Unless you're a constant all-day user, I would think this unlocked phone/camera/computer/toaster with dual sim and a very nice 8mp/1080p camera will do very nicely for 150 clams.First, the negatives. It's all plastic and a bit flimsy. But once again, this costs 150, and in two years you'll get twice this performance at half the price (and another 500 million phones will be rather needlessly thrown away, a very serious negative about new tech that no one seems to want to discuss, but some of us do notice and care; conserve when you can! Do you REALLY always need the newest phone?). The other main negative is the very short battery life, barely enough to get through the day if you use the computer aspects/games etc much. But it does come with a usb charger that goes straight into 120 AC, so that's a nice bonus that makes charging anywhere very easy. The last negative is the sound, pretty weak. But then again, there's not a whole lot of space for better speakers in a phone this thin. And I guess another negative is that this is pretty darn big for a phone; you'll need a purse for this, or a big cargo pocket. Phones were all about getting tinier and more portable for a long while, but that has clearly changed.The pluses are many, mainly that you get a ton of features with a crisp 5"" screen for 150. The price of this thing is surely the selling point, and with a camera this good and so many other user-friendly features for online use, that price seems quite amazing. As for screen protectors, the one they include is good, but call me crazy, because I most always just leave on the peel away plastic that comes on most small screens. I have with this phone so far, and it doesn't show fingerprints and the screen looks just fine to me through it.The processor works very quickly for my needs, with over 1gb RAM, and 4 gb internal space, plus room for 64gb via SD card. I can't see needing much more space than that. Heck, those stats were tough to get on a small laptop not too many years ago, so to have them on a phone still blows me away. But we're all getting spoiled for performance more every year, so people want the moon. I for one am still astonished by all this stuff for this little money.And the very best thing to me is being able to drop most any firm's sim card into it and whammo, suddenly everything is ready to go. That is the joy of unlocked phones, and it's hard to justify buying a 600 buck flagship phone and paying 500 bucks a year for it and then having it be a useless brick (leaking chemicals in the town dump) if you want another carrier when phones like this are out there for 1/4 the price, plus unlimited consumer choice.All in all, despite the negatives, for $150 this is just a ton of phone. And computer. And camera. And hi-def video camera. And you're not tied to any company with it. Pretty nifty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TQ4XB2SHJXY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M78E2I4#wasThisHelpful","R2TQ4XB2SHJXY5","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a wonderfully sharp, stunningly quick flick this is. Nothing in it isn't top-notch. The script, every actor, the direction, the pacing, the twisty plot, the ending...it all works perfectly, and with wry wit.I don't even see the point of going into details. If you like a good mindbending thriller, and think Hitchcock was a true master, then you will love this film. It's 21st century Hitch. The violence is realistic but you're aware this is always a movie, so it's not overly disturbing. Not a film for kids, though.Nothing is over done, many things are wisely understated, and I can't recall the last film I saw where it kept getting more and more interesting as it went on. The laughs are mostly black but always great fun. Even its frequent, subtle social commentaries are crisp and unobtrusive.

"The only real faults I can find here are that the plastic casing could be tougher, and I wish the light swiveled, as it's tricky to get the right angle while reading in some chairs/positions. But in general this is a very handy tool for many reasons.-It's solar powered and also AC-powered, and takes half the time to charge by sun than it gives light-It is not only very very bright, but also dims by holding down the power switch so you can get even just a mild glow-You can use it to charge phones etc via the usb out port-I kind of like the cheesy plum blossom silhouettes on it!It's a rather weird little design, but somehow it's quite charming, and eminently practical for both emergency and everyday uses. I'd price this at 35-50 bucks, and it's now 40 here, so it's also a good value. If you are far from outlets but still need bright light, this thing will be the ticket. The dimmability is what really takes it over the top in my opinion, and along with the brightness of the long-lasting LED bulbs, that makes this little solar lamp a very cool thing indeed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3XG9KID3EQOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LVSNM5K#wasThisHelpful","R3XG9KID3EQOK","A356RFKNIG043B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A356RFKNIG043B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a near-identical copy of a unit Motorola sold about 4 years ago, the MBP36, and those had frequent battery-life issues (check out the 1,200 reviews of it here), so be aware of that when comparing this to other baby cams. Also be aware that while the daytime color picture on this is nice and crisp, the nighttime pic is black and white and not nearly so crisp. Seeing as most parents use this at night for peace of mind, that might be an issue for some.The good things here are that the camera is remotely movable and zoomable; the monitor works while plugged in, a plus due both to previous battery issues and the fact that this battery needs recharging pretty much every night; and the sound is quite clear and volume-controllable. The temperature feature seems somewhat redundant unless you keep your baby in distant cabin on the other end of your property, in which case both the temp and long wireless range of this unit will come in handy.All told, it's a good unit, but comparing this to other units, I would price it at 150, not its present 250 here. And if you're just copying your previous unit, why is the price the same and not a fair bit lower? There are a TON of baby monitors out there now, and you would do well to compare all of them on this site.

"This is a heavy duty water bottle for people who understand how serious an issue leaching from plastic can be (look up BPA leaching, etc). It weighs a fair bit but that's because it's good thick glass with a pretty solid rubber coating, triple thick on the bottom, a wise design feature. I dropped it from a few feet and it didn't break, whereas glass certainly would have.The lid is very wide, excellent for pouring stuff in and especially for inserting ice cubes, a big plus over most bottles. I generally prefer to reuse ice tea bottles etc, but for serious hiking, this is my new go-to container. I don't mind the weight as it means the glass is unlikely to break on me. The thick metal lid has a wide rubber grommet to prevent spillage, another plus over most bottles.It also has a strong carrying cord that is tightly attached but easily removable via spring-clip.Another reviewer said if you spill juice down the inside of the rubber it can't be cleaned, but in fact you can peel the rubber back and sponge the glass and rubber off and put it back on. You can also take the rubber all the way off with a little effort. Not easily, but I just did it one minute ago so it is doable. Yet this called a ""water bottle"", not ""all liquid container"", so H20 is clearly its intended use. One nice thing about is water is you don't have to worry about it getting sticky on you!For 15 bucks this is a very good deal, as it seems ready to last for years, and the wide mouth and thick metal parts all show a willingness from the company to make the best water bottle they could.

"There are so many awesome things about this camera. One thing I have to say about this camera is it is so simple to use. Once you open the box and pop in a memory card you are ready to go! Mine came with enough charge to play around with the camera but you may want to charge it before using it first. I did not need any instructions to figure out the camera which is awesome. When you get a cool new toy you don’t want to waste time reading a book! Something that is very great about this camera vs the last one I tried is the case and the buttons. You are able to push every button so easily which is important in an action camera. The case is also very secure and water tight and helps to protect the camera. (My sister dropped it off her horse and it didn’t break!). As far as video quality goes it is very good for what the camera cost. You are able to see everything clear even on the small screen and the colors are nice and bright. The playback is a little shaky when you are filming in motion (and chances are that is what you will be doing) but besides that I don’t really have anything bad to say about this camera. We haven’t gone on any big adventures since getting this camera but I am excited to take it to the lake once the weather warms up!

"This is a great set of containers. I love the different colored lids. If I am prepacking several meals I can just place the lids on with the order I need to pull the meals out. Rainbow order! Eat the red first, then orange, followed by yellow etc! Very easy to remember. These are great for proportioned meals since they can be put in the freezer or dishwasher. They are also great for packing lunches when you have a house full. Everyone in my family likes different lunches so they now all have a designated color so they always know which lunch to grab. The containers fit perfect in everyone’s lunch and even my youngest is able to remove and replace the lid by herself.

"This is a great box for any essential oil user. I have several different oils from several companies and I tried each one in this box and they all fit perfectly. It makes the most sense to store your oils that have lid labels in this box since you can not see the front of the bottle when they are stored in this. The wooden insert dividers are a little tricky to get apart at first but once you get the hang of it then it is very simple. I played around with several way to store my oils and finally decided it was best with all the inserts put in but I would love to get another box that I could store my roller bottles and homemade blends in.

"I lo ooooo ooooooove this litter mat. It is twice the size of my old one and it works way better. I love that it is large enough I could set my whole litter box on it if I wanted. Right now, since we have a box with a door I just have the front half sitting on it. This mat is huge and my cat has to step on it to get out. It gets all the extra litter off his paws and traps it in the mat. About once a week I take the mat outside and shake it off pretty well and most of the litter comes out. It may need to be vacuumed from time to time but not very often if you shake it. This mat works so great and I am thrilled that I am no longer stepping on little litter rocks all the time.

"I have a lot of pain in my wrist and thumb that gets a lot worse when I am on my computer a lot. I really weren't sure these compression sleeves would help my pain at all but they do!! When you first put them on they are a little annoying since they are so tight but that part is necessary for the compression aspect. I wore these the whole time I typed yesterday and then ending up wearing these for several more hours because I forgot they were even on and to my surprise I had no added wrist pain from the typing. This is a big deal for me because normally my hands will hurt very bad after typing and this time I had no more pain.

"This is super cool product. It is my first time playing with liquid latex. First thing I noticed is the smell. Not to nice but as long as you have a fan going you won’t even notice it and even without a fan the smell goes away very quickly. I dipped a paint brush into the liquid latex and sort of painted my finger and was a little surprised at how thin the liquid is. I really expected something different. If you are planning on making scars or wounds you will have to paint on several layers or apply it very thick. A big positive to it being thin though is that it dries extremely quick. This really comes in handy if you are using the liquid latex to work on your nail art. This stuff is great for painting the skin around your finger nail and then using the water marble technique. When you are done with your nails you can just peel off the latex and all the extra nail polish comes right off. I am excited to keep playing with this stuff to see what else I can do with it.

Just a pump or two in the toilet before going and it will make a film on the water that will trap the scent. After going all you smell is the rose smell instead of the business you just flushed.

"This hair mask really works great for frizzy hair. I like that the instructions say to apply to damp hair instead of towel dried hair (because let’s be honest, how many people are going to towel dry their hair before doing this type of hair mask). The smell of this mask is great but it is very strong well the mask is sitting on your hair. It may be a little much for people sensitive to scents. The positive thing about having a strong scent is the yummy smell actually stays in your hair and you get little wiffs of it later in the day. This product was easy to use and spread around my hair. I don’t time it but I would say I leave it on for the full 5 minutes if not more then I rinse with cold water. It leaves my hair very soft and really helps to cut back on some of the frizz.

"These are nice for people with smaller freezer or for people like me who have a ton of junk in the freezer which means you are forced to do a balancing act with the ice cube trays.

"My Children absolutely love sands alive! We got some pink sand a few months ago and my kids both love it so much it was a constant battle to take turns so we knew we'd have to get more. Finally we got some blue sand for my son. This sand is amazing. It's by far the best sensory toy we have. We have tried store bought and home made moon, kinetic, and cloud sand and my kids love this the most and I love that it doesn't make a mess of the table. (You will want to put a spare tarp or shower curtain down if you are playing with it over carpet. It did come out of my carpet but I had to vacuum several times). When the sand comes you will want to empty it into a container and let it breathe over night. The sand will get even softer and fluffier! This size pack makes a nice amount of sand and is more than enough for my son to make some pretty cool tower. It's also a super nice bonus to get some molds in with the sand! We also used some small cups and cookie cutters with the sand. One of my children's favorite things to do is make large balls or blocks with the sand and squish it down. I am not exaggerating at all when I say my kids will sit down at the table and both play quietly with their sand for a full hour! My son even asked to take his new blue sand to show and tell.

It’s a bit hard to gage but I base this on the fact that each night when I turn on my bedroom light, I will see anywhere from one to three silverfish on the vinyl floor as I walk toward the bed.  It just makes me want to scream (or cry, or both!)We’ve tried commercial sticky traps (worthless), rolling up damp newspaper (also worthless), and placing masking tape on the outside of a glass with it going slightly over the top and into the inside (actually, this trick does work, but not well enough to make a difference in the silverfish population).  We have diatomaceous earth in our drawers, closet, around the bedframe, etc.  (no way to judge if this has helped or not).Since plugging this device into the outlet in our bedroom, I’m not seeing the silverfish at night when I turn on the light (only 1 since plugging it in last week).  I don’t know if the little buggers are leaving, hiding better, or of if it is simply coincidence.  I read testing reports that say these devices have not been scientifically proven work, but so far, it appears to helping.  I have a friend who was able to rid his home of rodents with an ultrasonic repeller.  He’s the one who suggested I try it.  I was not able to put this at the suggested height but that doesn’t seem to be a problem.My dog and cats do not act as though they are bothered by anything, soundwise, and I don’t notice anything, so that’s good.  Obviously, do not use this product if you have pet rats, hamsters, mice, etc. since these are among the critters this unit is meant to repel.This repeller came with a complimentary PDF (How To Keep Your Home Pest Free) email that was very informative in regard to how to deal with a wide variety of pests, so be sure to keep an eye out in your email for that after you buy this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12SMB0BJHG0SP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016IBEDKM#wasThisHelpful","R12SMB0BJHG0SP","A1LNKKDBF2KOK3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LNKKDBF2KOK3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m happy I was able to purchase this Mr. Herb grinder at a reduced price in exchange for an unbiased product evaluation and review.  It works very well.My friend has been using a poorly-made plastic grinder for her cooking herbs / spices / small seeds, so I gifted this one to her.  She’s amazed at the difference.  Unlike her old grinder, the Mr. Herb grinder’s magnetic lid turns back and forth smoothly and stays on, and the threading allows the pieces to easily come apart and go back together.This unit cleans up well with soap and water (use a toothbrush to get between the sharp teeth). Use a little alcohol on the toothbrush first if the blades are sticky, followed by the soap and water.Overall, this is an excellent grinder and I’m glad I bought it for my friend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14Y4KSN0QR1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016L92JCU#wasThisHelpful","R14Y4KSN0QR1Q","A1LNKKDBF2KOK3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LNKKDBF2KOK3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:06 MinsI’m excited to have been selected to purchase this NaskaShop diffuser at a reduced price in exchange for an unbiased product evaluation and review.  I’m loving it.PROS:* Super quiet operation* Easy to remove top, fill chamber (I use distilled water), and replace top* Can be used as only a lighting accent with choice of color* Good volume of mist when using as diffuser* Choice of continuous mist or intermittent (30 seconds on / 30 seconds off – I like this setting)* Can be used with or without essential oils* Simple to rinse cleanCONS:* Beeping sound each time a button is pressedMy video doesn’t do justice to how nice the colors look.  There’s 8 main colors to choose from, with two settings (basically a high / low) for each, so a total of 16 variations.Nothing to do with function, but I really like that the electrical connection is a two-prong slimline so it doesn’t hog up extra space when plugged in. No matter where I connect this, in my wall outlet or in my power strip, it doesn’t block the others.I’m really pleased with this purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M6NAVVM0QV3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017A8OABY#wasThisHelpful","R2M6NAVVM0QV3P","A1LNKKDBF2KOK3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LNKKDBF2KOK3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I’m thrilled to have been one of those selected to receive this Manuka Lane face moisturizer at no cost in exchange for an unbiased product evaluation and review.I’ve long known of the many benefits of manuka honey but I’ve never tried any products with bee venom in it.  I have sensitive skin so I was sure to apply this to the back of my hand and waited several hours to see if I’d have any reaction to it (I do this with many products).After knowing it was safe for me, I began using this cream on my face.  It goes on lightly, absorbs well, and leaves my skin feeling refreshed.  I do notice a very mild, brief tingling from it, but this face life cream is completely agreeable to my skin.  It has just a hint of a pleasant, sweet scent to me.  I’m scent sensitive and this is very subtle (which is what I need).  I'm sure this next comment will apply to only a few people, but I've noticed this cream seems to make the strap mark left on my face by my VPAP machine headgear disappear more quickly.I notice that even my fingers are softer after applying this cream so I also use put a tad on the backs of my hands and rub them together.

"I was lucky to have been selected to purchase this Xestware rollup rack at a reduced price in exchange for an unbiased product evaluation and review. It is very useful.This rollup rack is very handy.  There’s many uses, as shown in the product listing, but here’s our favorite:When we come home from the grocery store, no produce goes in our fridge without being washed first.  This normally means we end up with our entire sink full of just-washed foods, as well as some of our countertop (which ends up getting wet and messy).  Now, we are able to still fill the sink with food, and the rack give us just enough additional overflow space that we no longer have to spread paper towels out on our countertop for the rest.  Anything that didn’t fit in the sink, now goes on the rack.The next best use, for us, is placing the cutting sheet on top it.  Brilliant!  I was always having to clean up the counter after cutting foods, especially if they were juicy. Now, the juices and tidbits fall into the sink. After, I can soap and wash the cutting surface, flip it, rinse, then give the roll-up rack a quick wash down at the same time.  Note: The only case in which this doesn’t work great for holding the cutting sheet is if I’m working with something that requires a lot of pressure (e.g.: cutting frozen kielbasa or carving larger (heavy) meats ... small ones are fine, especially the tender ones from the pressure cooker).  The rack is slightly flexible, so for those times when a lot of pressure is needed, I still use the solid countertop.I just let it air dry then give it one more wipe with a dry paper towel, roll it up, then stash it in the oven when not in use.  Very convenient.  Though it certainly looks nice enough that one could leave it out at all times if they wanted.I’m happy I bought this.  It’s definitely going with me to my mom’s house for Thanksgiving meal prep.  She is very short on counter space and being able to put this over her sink is going to make a huge difference for me while cooking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3096U6364P3ZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015BUXRQW#wasThisHelpful","R3096U6364P3ZQ","A1LNKKDBF2KOK3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LNKKDBF2KOK3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I try to reuse as many plastic bags as I can (like those from cheese, bread, veggies, deli meat, etc.) but that can be a little messy or smelly, depending what was originally in them. I’m loving how compact and clean these poop bags are.  They are super convenient for storing near and using for collecting the litter (poop and urine clumps) from the boxes.

"I love trying a variety of skin care products so I’m glad I was able to purchase this Spin Trap serum at a reduced price in exchange for an unbiased product evaluation and review.The serum has a light, pleasant scent, though I’m unsure of how to describe it.  It isn’t what I would call sweet, citrus, spicy, or woodsy.  I guess it could be considered a floral? I’m sorry, I know this isn’t much help for those like myself who really want to know what something smells like prior to buying.  I can say that I’m scent sensitive and I don’t find this overpowering.The texture is similar to a gel, not a cream.  It feels to me just a tiny bit sticky immediately after applying it, like there is a coating on my face, but after a short while that feeling goes away.  I’m so used to creams that soak in fairly quickly, that it took a few applications of this serum for me to get used to that more firm sensation.  Now, it doesn’t bother me, and it does leave my skin soft without any irritation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LOCB8HB07L7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015ZDIZ2G#wasThisHelpful","R2LOCB8HB07L7E","A1LNKKDBF2KOK3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LNKKDBF2KOK3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m excited that I was able to purchase Bubba’s enzymatic cleaner at a reduced price in exchange for an unbiased product evaluation and review.  This stuff is great!I have a dog and two cats so cleanup around the house is a daily occurrence.  Not so much for urine (though occasionally that too) but the little things like hairballs or regurgitated food.  That’s what originally got my attention about this product, and it does work well for the things, but after reading all it can be used for, I’m even more thrilled.My favorite new uses for this product are spritzing it:* In the litter box after washing it but before putting in the new litter (I wipe it dry after using the spray)* In the kitchen trash can before putting in a new bag (better than the spray I was using)* In the front loading washer to freshen it up* On and around the toilet in the bathroom (gentlemen …  Take note!)My dog likes to go wee in the same spot in the yard, on the outside of the trash can, which has gotten rather pungent recently.  This spray even works on that.This does have a rather strong scent while wet (not unpleasant, just strong to me, but I am scent sensitive).  However, once dry, it just leaves the area fresh.  I only use the sprayer on the “mist” option, but there is also a “stream” option if there is ever a time that I need to actually soak an area.

"loving the comfort of this!Packaging:  It came folded up in a correctly sized box.  It unfolded easily without any crease or warping due to being folded. No chemical smell at all.It is heavy though (surprisingly so), and more than a little cumbersome, so I strongly advise you to carry the box up to the bedroom or pull out the folded product and carry it up still in its plastic. Then lay it out on the bed still folded and encased before cutting (carefully) the plastic--that way it will spring open on the bed and you'll only need minor adjusting.It was a perfect fit for our queen size bed--no hanging over and just a little (very, very little) smaller.  Less than an inch smaller.As for the comfort, we can't say enough about it.  We both lay on it even before we put the sheets on and just said aloud ""wow"" and ""whose"", and then neither of us wanted to get up. We've been sleeping on it for a few weeks now and still love it, possibly love it even more than at first.

"So far so good with the sturdily built, relatively compact, good sounding speaker1)  Packaging:  packaging was minimal, no excessive space or paper or other such product and easy to open2) The Jam came charged and I got a bit over six hours on the ""shipped charged""  battery.  When I fully charge it and run it again I'll update. I assume the fully charged will up the hours3)  build quality is excellent. It certainly lives up to its ""heavy"" name.  I wouldn't want to wander around the neighborhood with it, but who would do that?  So I prefer the heft for the sense it gives of superior durability.  This thing feels like it will stand up to lots of abuse, and it has a decent modernist look to it as well.4) Pairing:  it paired immediately with all my Apple devices, not a single issue with a MacBook Pro, an iPad2, and a 5th Generation iPod Touch.  All recognized it, paired, and were playing music in seconds5) Sound quality was quite good across the range.  Very sharp and precise, especially in the treble range. I'm not sure I'd call the bass booming, but certainly solid and deep enough for me. Not at all tinny or weak sounding.  And the volume cranks up pretty high without distorting.Will update with a full battery, but for build quality and sound quality, Jam seems to have  a winner with this one","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TCV33V7VMNYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XLSS79Y#wasThisHelpful","R3TCV33V7VMNYJ","AFN32PGTZ31MV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFN32PGTZ31MV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether it be short stories or poetry, I always pick up a collection assuming I won’t like the whole thing.  With short stories, I’m generally pretty happy if I like more than half and thrilled if it’s over three-quarters.  With poetry anthologies, especially those by multiple authors, it’s a bit of a different story.  Give me a handful of poems that strike me on the spot, or that linger in the mind long after (sometimes they’re the same and sometimes not), or even some lines that wow me, and I’m good.  Because one good poem, or three powerful lines can make up for a whole lot of “meh.”  If you can’t find underlines or margin notes (or in the case of my Kindle, highlights and bookmarks) in my poetry book, I didn’t much care for it.  So how does Best American Poetry 2015 fare on this scale? Pretty good, even if to be honest there were a lot of poems that just didn’t do it for me.  But as poetry is so incredibly subjective, and as a reader isn’t investing in a 900-page novel, I’m going to focus less on what I didn’t care for and more on what I did (if I refer to great lines but don’t offer them up, it’s so as not to ruin the effect of their arrival in the poem for the reader).Jame’s Galvin’s “On the Sadness of Wedding Dresses” is a plainspoken piece that begins with a striking conception:On starless, windless nights like thisI imagineI can hear the wedding dressesWeeping in their closetsLuminescent with hopeless longing,Like hollow angels.and then moves on to some surprisingly evocative imagery as the dressesturn yellow over time,Yellow from prayingFor the moths to comeAnd carry them into the sky.The sky reappears at the close in a much more starkly concrete image, but one probably unexpected by the readers.Madelyn Garner imagines the inner thoughts of a next-door neighbor who comes outside,In her florid pink nightgown,Exposed  breasts like pendulumsAs she kneels in the gravelSpeaking to an empty planter.  As the two of usWait in the kitchenFor her children, it is clearHer thoughts floatFrom the back of the skull to the front . . .How resigned she seemsTo the eviction notices her body is receiving.Along with her neighbor’s thought, the speaker thinks as well of the neighbor’s family, their conversation about selling the houseBecause she is a system of bone and bloodBecause her hands are rusted hingesBecause wisps of spiderwebs float behind eyelidsThe brief stanzas, the sound quality, the use of repetition all build to a thoughtful, powerful impact, especially in the closing lines.“Goodness in Mississippi,” by Lawanda Walters, is another poem that ends with a killer close.  The piece opens with a great sense of voice:My friend said I wasn’t fat but she was, and we would go on that way, back and forth. She was my first realFriend, the kind who changes everything. Her mother was so cool,Didn’t shave down there for the country clubPool where weSat beside her. I saw a gleam of her secret, silverHairThe conversation tone, the sense of confidence lulls the reader into a kind of peacefulness, one shattered by a brutal ending that has stayed with me.An excerpt from Claudia Rankine’s Citizen, meanwhile, which may be as much essay as poem and makes highly effective use of second person should send all readers straight to her collection, if you haven’t already read it.Laura Kasischke’s “For the Young Woman I Saw Hit by a Car While Riding Her Bike” gives us a piece whose trauma lies not with the bike rider (“I’ll tell you upfront: She was fine”) but with the witness, who after imagining the young girl laughing over the witness’ reaction, thinks:But, ah, sweetThing, takePity. OneDay you too may beAn accumulationOf regrets, catastrophes.And then moves the reader into unforeseen territory, allowing us not just understanding, but that sense of pity she so gently asks of the young woman.There are other strong poems in the collection, and even more strong lines, even if the poems they are contained in didn’t succeed as a whole for me.  And yes, lots of the poems just didn’t work at all for me. Some felt more language game than poem, others were technically impressive but left me feeling cold, some I couldn’t recall for you a few minutes after reading them.  But as mentioned, I expect that in a poetry anthology. The joy is that there is so much here, and the editors have spread such a wide banquet in terms of style, length, and diversity of perspective that it’s hard to imagine someone not finding several poems and even more lines that they too would highlight or read to their significant other or a friend, even if they aren’t the same ones. I would have preferred to have enjoyed more of the poems as a whole, but I can live happily with what I loved.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z1FUW5JO39DI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P434CWA#wasThisHelpful","R1Z1FUW5JO39DI","AFN32PGTZ31MV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFN32PGTZ31MV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last year I gave Robin Hobb’s Fool’s Assassin five stars and put it on my list of Best Books of 2014.  Which puts me into a bit of a bind with her follow up, Fool’s Quest, since it’s even better. Clearly it will go on my Best of list for this year, but what about that ranking? I may have to petition our fearless leader Kat for a sixth star waiver, or a five-plus category.  Because in my mind, Fool’s Quest absolutely deserves that distinction.One of the reasons I found it a “better” book is that as much as I loved Fool’s Assassin (and I did love it), I could see how many readers might grow frustrated at its focus on personal relationships and um, “leisurely” pacing filled with small-bore domestic detail and frequent moments of introspection (though at this point, I’m not sure why you’re reading Hobb if introspection isn’t your thing).  Here though, those wishing for a little more plot in their plot shouldn’t have much to complain about. Yes, we still have long passages of Fitz musing on his life, detailed descriptions of clothes and food, and relationship, as always with Hobb, is the driver of nearly everything. But in Fool’s Quest we also get sword fights, chase scenes, escape attempts, wild gallops, dragons, torture, mutiny, vicious raids, and more.  In other words, it’s a more traditional balance of quietude and action, of inner and outer focus.Fans of this series will also I think get excited about how the different worlds of Hobb’s fantasy universe (Buckeep, Bingtown, Rain Wild) start to come together here, as the novel seems to point to a merging/capping off of these ‘till now mostly separate strands. We also get some scenes that call back to or shed a different light on earlier events in the series, adding to the feeling that Hobb is moving us slowly toward some closure.Even though I think most people will react more positively to Fool’s Quest thanks to its uptick in more traditional action scenes, what brings me back again and again to Hobb’;s work, and what makes this series one of my all-time favorites has always been, and remains, Hobb’s general strength in characterization. In particular, her greatest creation (and I’d argue one of fantasy’s greatest as well. Or heck, just literature’s)— FitzChivalry Farseer.  Hobb shows Fitz in the totality of his personality—good and bad, nobility and pettiness, selflessness and selfishness. It’s all here, the whole panoply of humanity, warts and all.Here, for example, is a scene between Fitz and the Fool, just after Fitz has refused to rush out and do something the Fool begs him to do:  He stared sightlessly at me as if I had said the cruelest thing in the world to him. Then is lower jaw trembled, and he dropped his face into his broken hands and began to sob.  I felt sharp annoyance and then deep guilt that I’d felt it. He was in agony. I knew it. How could I feel annoyed at him when I knew exactly what he was experiencing? Hadn’t I felt that way myself? Had I forgotten the times when my experiences in Regal’s dungeons washed over me like a wave, obliterating whatever was good and safe in my life and carrying me right back into that chaos and ruin?  No. I tried to forget that, and in the last decade of years, for the most part I had . . . “Please, don’t make me remember that.”  I realized I’d said the betraying words out loud.”How painfully real is it that Fitz, when his friend breaks down into tears, doesn’t feel sorrow or pity but annoyance? Annoyance!  What a crappy friend!  But that’s what makes Fitz and all the others feel so human. And then he feels guilt, and we as readers feel better about our protagonist. But then he goes back into his own world and has that selfish “don’t make me remember that” line—focused more on himself than on the Fool.There are so many such moments throughout this novel, this series, that Fitz has become such an accretion of tiny details over the years that it’s hard to remember he isn’t real. You know you’ve fallen wholly for a character, have completely bought into their human existence, when you tear up for a character not in a moment of tragedy (that kind of emotion can be easy to manipulate), but in a moment of happiness.  And that’s exactly what I did here.  Teared up, choked up, held the book loosely open in my hands for a minute or two without seeing the words, just reveling in this well-earned moment of joy for this character, this person I’ve spent so much time with over the years.  And then went back and reread it once I finished the book. And had the same reaction.  In fact, I choked up several times throughout the novel, which makes me worry just a tad about what might happen in the final book of this series.Of course, characters don’t become “great” on their own. Sure, Hobb creates three-dimensional characters who are compelling in their own right:  Fitz, the Fool, Bee, Chade, Riddle. Hell, she’s so good she creates compelling alias characters—some of Fitz’s disguises are more rounded characters than other authors’ protagonists.  Her animal characters are more “human” than some authors’ protagonists (Nighteyes, of course. But I defy you not to warm to “Crow” and “Horse” and even “Cat” in this book). The true genius of Hobb, however, lies not in the individual depiction of character, not in the parts, but in the whole—in the entirety of the complex web of human (and animal) interaction. And depicting this web, and having its individual strands resonate in the reader’s heart and mind, is something Hobb does perhaps better than anyone. It isn’t Fitz and the Fool and Chade and Nettle that get to me in this book; it’s Fitz with the Fool, Fitz with Chade, Fitz with Nettle.  Some of these interactions are touching, some are warm, some (not a lot) are funny, and some are just heartbreaking, heartbreaking in the present moment, but also heartbreaking in the anticipated future.The topics and/or themes of Fool’s Quest will be familiar to Hobb’s fans:  the impact of loss and the attempt to overcome it, the ways in which events of the past continue to ripple through time, the impact of violence on both the victims and the perpetrator, what makes for good parenting, free will. One aspect I do want to mention with regard to the violence is the depiction of rape in the novel.  I’ve pointed in recent reviews to major issues I’ve had with how rape is employed in many novels lately.  Its use here is, no surprise coming from Hobb, serious, moving, and realistic, with no hint of gratuitousness or of its use as a “motivating technique.”  Its lingering impact, as depicted in several passages, is crushing.  Lots of authors could do worse than study Hobb’s portrayal before they turn to it as a plot element in their own works.Beyond plot and character, the basic novel elements are just as one expects by now from a craftsman such as Hobb. The prose is vivid, sharply precise, evocative. Pacing and scene transition are expertly handled. Hobbs has always been a consummate writer, and that holds true here.I loved Fool’s Quest (so much so that I read its 750 pages in a single sitting), hated that it ended (and ended in a bit of a cliffhanger), and find myself in the position of eagerly awaiting the next book but also fearing it, nervous that I might have to say goodbye to Fitz and his world and knowing already that I’m “gonna need some lone time” if that turns out to be the case.  I might just stack up the earlier books next to me so I can start over from the beginning right away.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12II87DI4738M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PP3AHIM#wasThisHelpful","R12II87DI4738M","AFN32PGTZ31MV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFN32PGTZ31MV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Autumnlands, written by Kurt Busiek and visuals by Benjamin Dewey (art) and Jordie Bellaire (color), is an intriguing graphic series with lots of action, a complex character, and a visually and intellectually stimulating setting. The first six issues, which you can get separately or bundled into Volume One Tooth and Claw, resolve a particular arc, but are really mostly set up for further exploration of world and character.The story is set in a world peopled by animal races, themselves apparently separated into those who dwell in seventeen floating cities—masters of magic and technology—and land-dwellers (“the lesser ones”) who slave for them. The magic of their world, however, is failing, and so in a last desperate attempt to rejuvenate it, a group of wizards, against the wishes of the ruling council, try to bring back the, “The Great Champion,” the fabled warrior who ages ago, “facing the world’s destruction and certain death, opened the gates of magic and brought its power to us.”  Things, to say the least, do not go well.One of my favorite aspects of this story is summed up pithily in the back blurb:  “They needed a savior. They got a soldier.” What they are hoping for is a champion in the mode of great epic tales—one who wins against all odds but does so in noble, graceful fashion. What their spells get them (and it is a running question as to whether or not he is their true “great champion”) is a soldier who believes in surviving battles. And that means doing what is necessary, even if it is ugly and ignoble. This twist keeps a running tension throughout the storyline that adds not only some plot suspense but also a bit of depth as it forces not just the characters but the reader to question the ethics of particular choices/events. Busiek also does a nice job of playing off of this contrast between the old stories of heroism and the likely reality of heroism by having brief excerpts from typical epic tales open up each segment of the story.The champion himself, Learoyd, is a nicely drawn character. He maybe adjusts a bit too quickly to being thrust into such an alien world, but in a nice bit of dialogue, he explains to one character who wonders about his relatively sudden shift from trying to convince himself it was all a dream or hallucination:  “Maybe isn’t, maybe it is. But if so, it doesn’t have to be completely damn stupid, does it?”  Other characters aren’t quite such full creations. The wizard who has the idea for the spellwork to call up the Champion starts off pretty strong, but gets relegated to a pretty minor side story in the latter half (though I really liked the portrayal of the relationship between her and her significant other). The wizard opposed to her is a pretty stock type—stuffy greedy oblivious aristocrat type. A Coyote trader character who tries to play both sides between the city characters and the bison slaves (who wish to rebel), has some good potential, but is a pretty small role here. The narrator is a young terrier and as such is mostly a bit of a flat observer, though this changes toward the end and one assumes will continue to do so as the story continues. His flatness I’m guessing is more a portrayal of his youth in preparation for some maturing rather than a flaw of characterization.Visually, the artwork is quite strong, doing an impressive job of giving animal characters readable facial expressions and body language. Background scenes are vivid and colorful, and the art is equally convincing whether it is portraying characters or the natural world. And, as should always be the case in graphic stories, it both supports and extends the text and themes. For instance, that aforementioned tension between the image of the hero and the actuality of the hero is graphically portrayed at his early appearance, covered in blood. The art and text work great in tandem here, with our narrator stunned at the savage appearance:  “He was — He was — There as so much blood, but he didn’t even seem to notice it,” our character depicted baring his teeth and dripping in blood, and the text bubbles a series of nonsense syllables. It’s a great image because not only does it deal with the ideal/actual hero theme, but it also inverts the social structure of our world, with the civilized, dressed, speaking animals horrified by the savage, naked, bloody and growling human.I really had little to complain about with The Autumnlands. As mentioned, Learoyd does settle in kind of easily, but most of the other issues can be easily explained away as simply being a matter of the story only having just begun. But it’s hooked me enough to want to see where it goes.

"Really, I’ve got to say it’s shocking to me that there hasn’t been a Star Trek/Planet of the Apes crossover until now, with The Primate Directive, a joint graphic venture between IDW Comics and Boom! Studios. The five-volume story is written by Scott and David Tipton, illustrated by Rachael Stott, and colored by Charlie Kirchoff. As a mashup concept, it’s brilliant. As far as this particular execution, though, well, it has its ups and downs, with most of the former coming in the first half.The story opens up with an arms deal with one side proffering automatic weapons to an unnamed General. It’s nicely drawn so as to add a sense of unfolding mystery, with a focus on hands alone on the first page, only revealing one of the two speakers to be a gorilla on page two. The seller, meanwhile, remains a shadowy figure (literally), though Trek fans will most likely pick up on clues via the dialogue as well as memory of a similar occurrence in the original series. The setting, and the color palette, then shift to Uhura and Sulu on an intel-gathering mission deep in Klingon territory, where after a few tense moments, banter, and a display of hand-to-hand combat skills, they return to the Enterprise with coordinates that lead them to an inter-dimensional portal, which they go through after a brief firefight.Yes, it does in fact lead them to the other half of the mash-up. On a strangely similar Earth, they enter the Planet of the Apes tale just after the famous ending of the movie. The Klingons, it turns out, have been selling arms to General Marius and encouraging him to overthrow his ape leaders (Dr. Zaius for one). Kirk, et. al. decide they have to stop the Klingons, but do so with minimal impact on the culture thanks to the Prime Directive. This becomes a more complicated decision once they meet Taylor, who tries to convince him to help the humans overcome the apes, who treat them like livestock or worse. When Kirk refuses, Taylor tries to take matters into his own hands, giving Kirk yet another problem to deal with. Eventually, the story moves through the rest of the Apes movie cycle, with a few changes.To being with the positives, the Tiptons do a great job with the characters, nailing each of them perfectly with regard to their original portrayals. McCoy, for instance, when Kirk is mulling over entering the portal, tells him in his inimitable fashion, “This is hardly the place for space tourism Jim.” Taylor is as angry and aggressively effective as he was in the movie, and the writers haven’t forgotten his views toward humanity, having him explain to Kirk that he joined his mission because he “was hoping to find something better. Something better than man.”  Spock is his usual rational self, Scotty is inventive, and Kirk, along with being his decisive self, even gets his shirt torn in a fight. You can’t get more classic Trek than that, as Galaxy Quest once reminded us. The apes fare just as well, coming off just like their characters in the movies, as when Zira calls Cornelius “primitive” when he says he “won’t allow” her to risk the transporter. The tense relationship between Kirk and Taylor is also perfectly handled; each of them is so used to being in command, to being active and taking the initiative that it should come as no surprise that they don’t fall immediately into an easy partnership. The fact that they have two opposing goals also makes perfect sense, besides offering up motivation for conflict.Another plus is the way the story takes its time in the first two issues, with the slow intro to both worlds via the arms deal and the espionage mission, then the firefight at the portal before entering it. Once on the planet, the writers take the space to create a sense of the Ape’s world and culture, with Zira explaining their stratification (chimpanzees for instance located primarily in academics and science), Zaius via an internal monologue giving us the context of possible famine (which makes General Marius’ actions a bit more understandable), and Cornelius detailing their ethics of “Ape shall never kill Ape.” Meanwhile, the Enterprise crew have sometimes-lengthy debates over what they should or should not do, wondering for example if the Prime Directive even holds in an alternate dimension such as this.Things heat up, and the pace picks up, once Marius makes his move, leading an army against Ape City. These scenes are mostly well done, but it’s shortly after the resolution of the big battle that things started to go off the rails for me. One issue is with Taylor deciding not to take up Kirk’s offer of a trip back to Earth (albeit a different one). The decision I’m fine with, but his reason —  “I left because I thought there had to be something better than human society. I think your world is the same old Earth I left behind . . . I’m never going to fit in there” — makes no sense in the context of this. He has seen nothing at all to indicate that humanity is still as savage or war-torn as his own was in his day, and in fact, given Kirk’s constant attempt to minimize violence and corruption of this world’s society, he’s seen just the opposite.Once they leave Taylor behind, the beam back aboard the Enterprise, only to take part in a weirdly detached cat and mouse game with the Klingons that goes on for a few days, ends in a wholly abrupt and anti-climactic fashion, and seemed to serve no purpose save to have the Enterprise around for when one of the movie events takes place (why I’m avoiding spoilers for 40-year-old movies I don’t know, but I am). And while up to this point one needn’t have known much at all about the movie franchise to make sense of events, at this point, if you don’t know the plot of Escape/Beneath the Planet of the Apes, the ending scenes will seem to come out of nowhere.The artwork is clean and pleasing to the eye, with well-drawn lines and generally makes good sue of color. Fight scenes I thought could have been more clear in terms of the action a few times, and sometimes the reader has to work a bit harder than perhaps they should to distinguish the ape characters from one another (stitching on the sleeves helps), but generally I’d regard the art as mostly a positive. It also offers up some iconic images playing off the films, such as the Statue of Liberty or the crying statue of the Lawgiver.The story definitely veers off its mostly positive path in the latter quarter or so, with abrupt shifts, scenes that appear utterly random and contrived, and odd character choices. Up to that point, however the mash-up was a clear success, with both worlds feeling wholly true to their origins and coming together in a near-perfect melding of character and plot and tone, with mostly good dialogue that occasionally becomes a bit talky or expository. Even with the weak ending, I’d say it’s worth picking up as the positives certainly make up the greater balance of the story.

"Jade Mountain Dragon is about as classic a detective mystery as you can get.  In the main character Li Du, you’ve got your reluctant Everyman sort of character who is pulled into investigating a mysterious death.  You’ve got your “investigator gathers a roomful of suspects and works his/her way through why they could have been the killer and then why they are not” scene.  You have the investigator explaining to a befuddled partner exactly what happened and how he/she figured it out. Overheard conversations, hidden letters, possible femme fatales—they’re all here.  You even get some classic line deliveries:  “I know who killed [X], and I know why. There is not a second to waste.” While most of this is handled smoothly (exceptions to be discussed later), what really makes Jade Mountain Dragon such a pleasure to read is its characterization and its setting—an outlying province in early 18th Century China preparing itself for the arrival of the Emperor.Former librarian Li Du was banished from Beijing by this same Emperor several years earlier (for navely consorting with traitors) and has been a traveling, mostly solitary, scholar ever since. He arrives in Dayan unaware that the Emperor who had exiled him was arriving in six days for a grand festival, at which he will cement his divinity (and thus his power) by commanding an eclipse.  Li Du, of course, knows this is mere theater, that the Emperor’s Jesuit scholars have, as always, predicted the eclipse and the Emperor is merely making use of their science.  But when one of the Jesuits turns up dead, and then is revealed to have been murdered, Dayan’s magistrate, Li Du’s cousin, tasks him with finding the killer before the Emperor’s arrival.Included in the mix of suspects are:The magistrate himselfThe magistrate’s extremely efficient secretary, no fan of foreignersThe magistrate First Consort, a steely woman from the local village who may like her position a bit too muchAnother Jesuit in the cityAn ambassador from the East India Company trying to get the Emperor to open the countryA traveling foreign storyteller with a mysterious pastA pair of characters with ties to the former rulers of the area, ruthlessly conquered by the current EmperorAs mentioned, the strengths of this novel are the characters and the setting.  Li Du especially is sharply drawn and a wonderful character to spend time with.  Equally enjoyable is the foreign storyteller Hamza, whose intermittent tales add a nice bit of flavor to the story.  Other characters all feel fully three-dimensional and are nicely set up as potential killers in ways that feel wholly organic to their characters.The setting, meanwhile, is conveyed through vividly sharp details that create a fully present world that, as is not always the case in historical fiction, serve the story’s characters and atmosphere without calling attention to the author’s research.  Even better, the setting isn’t simply background visual tapestry but the political context drives much of the plot and motivations—the eager desire of the East India Company to get access to China, the tension between the current regime and the remnants of the old one, the Emperor’s need to emphasize his power in a region that has only recently come into the geographic fold, etc.As for the mystery itself, it’s well paced and clues are fairly revealed (some may find them too fairly revealed; it isn’t particularly difficult to suss out what is happening), and Hart does a nice job of tossing in a few “and then” moments, though some of them might have been more fully explored earlier.  It culminates in a strong ending, even if the big reveal in packed room of suspects is more than a bit familiar.In the end, as Li Du heads out, it’s easy to imagine most readers eagerly hoping Hart brings him back for further mysteries. I know, after zipping through Jade Mountain Dragon in a single night, I’d be happy to spend more time with Li Du in this world. Well recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NP91DRLHMDSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TDRJ96W#wasThisHelpful","R2NP91DRLHMDSD","AFN32PGTZ31MV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFN32PGTZ31MV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn’t a huge fan of The Maze Runner by James Dashner, thinking its frenetic pace was as much weakness as strength and that its characterization was pretty thin (plus there was the whole let’s not have anyone talk to each other or explain things pet peeve of mine). I admit, however, that it probably would meet the needs of a particular reader—one who likes fast paced action that blows by any annoying plot holes and isn’t particularly looking for a lot of in-depth characterization. That same sort of reader will probably find the sequel, The Scorch Trials, just as satisfying, though again, for my own tastes, it falls mostly short of being a good book. It’s going to be impossible to discuss The Scorch Trials without some spoilers for the first book, so fair warning.The sequel picks up almost immediately after the end of The Maze Runner, with the Gladers having been rescued after their escape from the Maze and brought to a dormitory, with Theresa, as the only girl, placed in a separate room. Turns out their escape, however, was only the end of Phase One of these trials, allegedly meant to somehow save the world from the “Flare” plague (amongst other disasters) by forming mysterious yet apparently necessary “patterns,” in the test subjects. Phase Two begins with the unexplained disappearance of Theresa, the unexplained appearance of a bunch of dead bodies, and then a task to cross a barren wasteland filled with “Cranks” (those affected by the Flare to varying degrees) in order to arrive at “Safe Haven.” Along with the Cranks, who range from merely dangerously unpredictable to dangerously violent to dangerously-zombies-who-want-to-eat-you types, the Glades must also deal with a blistering sun, lethally violent storms, decapitating technology, and another group they apparently are in competition with in what may be a “Only One Group Survives” sort of contest.The strength of The Scorch Trials is again relatively frenetic action, though I think the sequel has more pacing issues in terms of lag time, especially early on, where bouts of excitement are separated by somewhat repetitive and overly-long segments with the Gladers discussing what to do about their current situation. As with its predecessor, the strength is also somewhat of a weakness, as once again we move so quickly from excitement to excitement that few of the scenes really have a chance to build. A worse issue for me is that these scenes all feel very random and arbitrary. The background, of course, is that there are a lot of mind games being played with the Gladers by WICKED (the corporation doing the trials), so it’s hard to tell at this point whether the randomness will eventually have some cohesive rationale as opposed to the mind games being used as a Get Out of Jail Free card, letting an author just toss up whatever to create some excitement. Plot holes are still an issue — at one point I kept wondering why Thomas wasn’t using his telepathic abilities, almost as if the author had forgotten he had them, and in another scene a character just “escapes” just because the author needed him to for a future event. One’s annoyance at these moments will vary, probably with age as well as reading experience. I found them incredibly frustrating and evidence of slack writing.Characterization remains slim. A lot of Glader Redshirters die, leaving the reader to care as little about their deaths as most of the surviving Gladers do. The main character, Thomas, is a bit too much of the PROTAGONIST, always stepping forward as needed or turning out to be special in some way. The two primary Gladers beyond Thomas leave little impact. A new female character is perhaps the most interesting of them all in the novel, though she plays pretty strictly to a type we’ve seen before.Worldbuilding is just as slim, with little sense of place or rationale behind settings. We’re give a barebones explanation of the world, though we’re not sure we can trust it, but nothing feels fully formed and “lived in;” it feels rather like the characters are moving through movie sets.To be honest, based on The Maze Runner, I wouldn’t have picked up The Scorch Trials had my son not finished book one recently for his summer reading list and wanted to move onto book two (I suppose that says something about its appeal to 13-yr-old boys: he found it “pretty good or OK” albeit with some issues). And it turned out to be pretty much as expected—a relatively mediocre YA that has a certain action appeal but that doesn’t stand up very well under a close eye and won’t satisfy those looking for more depth of character or worldbuilding.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D6XUOK235FE3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003F3FJQO#wasThisHelpful","R1D6XUOK235FE3","AFN32PGTZ31MV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFN32PGTZ31MV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Swanwick’s Chasing the Phoenix is a slight but solidly enjoyably pleasant story of two clever con-artists that may remind readers of Fritz Lieber’s Fafhrd and Gray Mouser a bit, though the reflection/homage is perhaps a bit pale. The pleasures of the book arise from the humorously complex situations the two fall into (and have to escape out of), the sharp character banter, and the generally witty writing all around. How far those attributes carry you past an intriguing but thin worldbuilding, the not-too-substantive plot, and somewhat dull characters will go a long way to determining your level of enjoyment.The setting is a “Post-Utopia” far future that has only recently begun to clamber out of the cataclysmic battle between humanity and powerful AIs that took place generations ago. Wandering across this wonderfully rich mélange of futuristic (tailored viruses, frightening war machines, genetic engineered creatures) and more primitive technology are the grifters Darger and Surplus (himself a genetically engineered dog-human), looking for gullible marks wherever they can find them. The more specific “where,” in this case is China, which after the catastrophic war has devolved back into warring feudal nations. The two finagle their way into the advisory circle of a backwater ruler named The Hidden King and convince him they can lead him to his destiny of uniting all of China once more. Somewhat to their surprise, their plan actually begins to succeed, thanks to some luck, some old con man bravado, and with the help (and hindrance) of a cast of fantastically named characters:  Capable Servant of No Special Distinction, who attaches himself as their personal aide; Powerful Locomotive, the Hidden King’s top general; Vicious Brute, a Hillman bandit, and others. Two especially prominent female players are Fire Orchid, who somehow becomes Surplus’ fiancée, and White Squall, the Hidden King’s archaeologist and supplier of ancient weapons (which she’s dug up from Utopian sites).Darger and Surplus are recurring characters in a series of short stories (I have not read any of them), but while references are made to past adventures, reading them first isn’t at all necessary. It’s simply clear that we as readers have fallen into the middle of a tale (the story being their clearly long-running partnership) rather than the very beginning. The two have the warm fondness and shorthand communication/understanding one would expect for two who have been partners for so long. That said, the two were strangely disassociated throughout, either with wholly separate adventures or plotting together without us seeing them interact all that much. In other words, while you got that they know each other’s mind quite well, the duo lacked that true sense of camaraderie I’ve found in other pairings, such as the aforementioned Fafhrd and Gray Mouser or say, any of several in Steven Erikson’s Malazan world — Tehol and Bugg or Hedge and Fiddler.The two also have relatively removed personalities. Granted, Darger is playing the role of stoic mathematician/philosopher (his title is “Perfect Strategist”), but even so he comes across as more than a little vanilla. Surplus is a more vibrant personality, and his interactions with his “fiancée” Fire Orchid might have been my favorite parts of the novel (certainly the funniest), but unfortunately he disappears for surprisingly long stretches.As the challenges and obstacles pile one atop the other, growing ever more convoluted, the situations themselves become more humorous, and one does wonder how they’ll extricate themselves, but there’s rarely any true sense of danger or urgency. They mostly skate through pretty easily and even if a reader might worry they won’t this “last time,” it’s always made clear they’re ready to cut and run at the first real sign of personal risk. The still-dangerous AIs lurking in the background have a bit of a bite to them (and their dialogue is particularly well-done), and I wish a little more had been done in that area.In the end, I’d call Chasing the Phoenix a nice little tide-you-over snack between works of more substance or depth. It’s witty, will often make you laugh out loud, presents a sense of not a full picture of a richly intriguing world, offers up a number of quirkily engaging if not fully-rounded characters, has a wryly inviting voice, and wraps up at just about the right length (maybe just a tad long). I wouldn’t have wanted to read much more of this story with the two, but I’d pick up a second short novel with them at the center.originally appeared on fantasyliterature.com","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REVF5NZ137E88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SEOJK50#wasThisHelpful","REVF5NZ137E88","AFN32PGTZ31MV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFN32PGTZ31MV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Twelve Kings in Sharakhai is the first book in a new series by Bradley P. Beaulieu, set in the great desert city of Sharakhai, ruled for centuries by the same dozen Kings who long ago made a pact with the gods to fend off the desert tribes and establish their power. As a novel that comes to its own semi-resolution, it's nicely rewarding in its own self-contained way (if not without some issues), but Twelve Kings in Sharakhai I’d say works even better as an evocative opening to a world whose full complexity is only just hinted at by the end.The novel opens with a bang, presenting our main character Ceda (pronounced Chay-da) in a gladiatorial match in her persona as the White Wolf—a fan favorite in the city’s fighting pits. As character introduction, the scene is extremely effective. After Ceda defeats a much bigger and stronger opponent, one whom she purposely matched herself against, the reader immediately gets that this is a character who doesn’t back down, a resourceful, strong-willed young woman willing to put her sense of justice above her sense of self-preservation. All of which comes into play as the novel progresses.Ceda is a well-crafted, fully rounded character:  good, but not without flaws; a strong fighter, but not always the best in combat; clever, but not always the smartest in the room; likable but not always admirable. Orphaned at nine when her mother died (she has no clue as to her father), she was taken in for a while by the apothecary Dardzada, and then from there moved in with another street orphan named Emre, who became her best friend and more. Both Emre and Dardzada are equally sharply, fully drawn characters; in fact, just about everyone we meet is, though sometimes that depth is only slowly revealed through current plot events or via flashbacks (more on those later).One of the strongest aspects of the characterization comes not with the individual creations but in their interactions, which feel wholly real. Mostly thanks to the fact that the relationships are messy, ragged things, always changing shape, as is often the case in real life. When characters don’t talk to each other, as readers we don’t see it as a cheap means to send the plot in a certain direction (a pet peeve of mine), but as a natural occurrence due to the emotional interplay between two people. Trust is lost, won, lost again. Anger comes and goes. Jealousy, frustration, pettiness, loneliness, desire—all these and more raise their heads thanks to the complicated heart of humanity, not to the author’s spreadsheet detailing which plot points occur when.Because the characters are so well drawn, Beaulieu is able to take his time with the plot, trusting we’ll stick with him thanks to our engagement with Ceda and the others. The core of the story is her desire to destroy the twelve kings, whom she blames for her mother’s death. Her search for vengeance, however, is not served up as the usual simplistic and single-minded character motivation. Instead, it is often a source of inner conflict as it conflicts at times with a yen for a peaceful “normal” life, with her love for and sense of protectiveness over Emre, in addition to coloring and muddying her interaction with just about everyone she comes in contact with.While for Ceda, revenge against the kings is deeply personal (it isn’t just that they are to blame for her mother’s death; her mother also left behind clues that might lead to a means of bringing the kings down one a time), she is hardly alone in wishing to see the city freed of their ruthless and unchanging rule and these other attempts are just as important to the  plot. Several individuals, like Ceda, have their own personal vendettas, while an organized resistance group is willing to use any methods, including dark magic, to take the kings down, and if their attacks cost some innocent lives or result in the same via the kings’ response (they randomly select city dwellers for retaliatory executions—“Harm but one of our daughters, and twenty-and four of thine own shall drown in their wake”), then so be it. Despite their shared goal, Ceda is repulsed by the resistance’s methods, though she finds herself against her will being drawn ever further into their conflict with the kings.As for the kings themselves, early on they are a thing of mystery, with tantalizing hints here and there of their powers (The King of Whispers is said to hear all, another is in charge of fearsome creatures, another is a great fighter, and so on). Slowly we learn more of them, especially once we enter a POV from one of the kings, and of their elite guardians—the all-female Black maidens, and this steady pace of revelation about that deeply secretive world is a nice counterpoint to the vengeance theme.Stylistically, the novel has a captivatingly fabulistic feel about it. It isn’t just the fantastical creatures, the magic, the relatively unfamiliar desert setting. It’s the importance of stories, the way in which the past is slowly shown to illuminate the present, the recursive nature of the narrative, its non-linearity, and the willingness of Beaulieu not fully explain everything as it is introduced, whether it be a basic abstract mythos or a concrete prop . As one example, the desert people sail the sands in ships. Many, perhaps most fantasy authors, the first time such an action occurred, would have stopped right there and spent a few paragraphs describing the ships and giving us via the narrator or dialogue an explanation of how such ships work (“As you know Bob . . . “). You can be forgiven, however, for being well into the Twelve Kings before realizing that these sailing ships aren’t crossing water but dunes, so subtle is their mention.Now, as mentioned in the introduction, I did take issue with a few elements in Twelve Kings in Sharakhai. As is often a complaint of mine, I’m not sure the novel is fully deserving of its length. Coming in at just under 600 pages, it seemed to me cutting a 100-150 of those would have better served the reader, presenting a leaner, tighter narrative and smoothing out some pacing problems here and there. A few times necessary plot events seems to happen a bit too conveniently, such as a particularly fortuitous slant of light, or characters were a little too obtuse. These weren’t patterns, a few isolated incidents, but still noticeable. My biggest question though is with regard to the structure and the interwoven flashbacks, which appeared at times to be both longer and also more complicated in their timing and division than they needed to be. I’m calling this a “question” rather than a “complaint,” however, because I’m still mulling it over, trying to decide if it’s an issue of execution or basic structural design.In any case, none of my issues with the text would prevent me from happily recommending Twelve Kings in Sharakhai. Its characterization, setting, and style easily outweigh concerns with length and (maybe) structure, making it a fine introduction to what promises to be a richly rewarding series.originally appeared on fantasyliterature.com","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PLOAZO86C7ZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI0B80A#wasThisHelpful","R2PLOAZO86C7ZX","AFN32PGTZ31MV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFN32PGTZ31MV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The fantasy heist or caper novel, a la Oceans Eleven, has become a bit of a thing lately, and Greg Van Eekhout’s California Bones is a thoroughly enjoyable entry in the sub-genre, with the requisite impregnable vault, witty banter, hard-nosed villains, and the like, in addition to a relatively unique magic system. It’s a good introduction to this multi-book series and having just finished book two, you can rest assured there isn’t any drop-off going forward (if anything, I actually liked Pacific Fire a little  better).The setting is L.A., but an L.A. in an alternate world, one where Southern and Northern California are their own kingdoms, separate from the United States; where L.A.’s notorious freeways are replaced here by a canal system, and where some are wielders of osteomancy—a magical system where power comes from ingesting bones (or, more gruesomely, eating those who have already eaten those bones). Think Brandon Sanderson’s alomancy but using bone rather than metal. Different creatures’ bones give different abilities — griffons, dragons, manticores, krakens; this is not the L.A. of little lapdogs and coyotes. Nor does it matter how old the bones are, so a major industry sprang up for instance around the La Brea Tar Pits to mine them of every bit of ancient bone that could be found (by the time of the novel they’re almost tweezing out the fragments).The most powerful osteomancer is the Hierarch, who rules over L.A. with an iron fist (or stomach), ruthlessly putting down any perceived threats. Daniel Blackland lost his father — a powerful osteomancer himself — in one such purge, and carries with him the horror of watching the Hierarch begin to eat his father. Daniel escaped thanks to his father’s training and his own powerful magic, and he’s been keeping a low profile ever since, making his way via petty thievery, mostly in the employ of Otis, the gangster boss who raised him. Daniel left Otis a while back, but when Otis makes him an offer he can’t refuse, Daniel assembles his team and prepares to carry out the impossible: breaking into the Hierarch’s fabled Ossuary, a legendary vault filled with powerful bones.Meanwhile, one of the Hierarch’s grand-nephews, Gabriel Argent, has started to wonder if Daniel Blackland was actually captured and killed while trying to escape Southern California years ago, as has been believed. His point of view chapters offer a nice bit of tension as he tries to track Daniel, as well as a more interesting view of the Hierarch’s society. It’s through him as well we get to meet this world’s version of Disney and William Mulholland (he’s the guy who basically created then ran L.A.’s water system — think Chinatown).The caper part of the story is well handled, with a good sense of pace and tension, and Daniel’s crew is a pleasure to spend time with, both for their own personalities (even if they’re sketched somewhat shallowly) and for their group dynamics. And van Eekhout does a nice job of adding a few complicating factors to those dynamics which serve to deepen things a bit.I did have a few issues with the book. The ending felt both rushed and somewhat anti-climactic. While the alternate world aspects are often fun, I’m not sure they all hold together fully. But really, those were minor problems. Mostly California Bones was a fun read with likable characters who did a nice job of volleying dialogue back and forth. And with the sequel, Pacific Fire, being at least as good, there’s no reason not to jump in. Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R300FXQS2IWXCL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HTJ049C#wasThisHelpful","R300FXQS2IWXCL","AFN32PGTZ31MV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFN32PGTZ31MV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As with Book One, Book Two shifts between Lewis’ presence at Obama’s inauguration and his experiences decades earlier in the Civil Rights movement. It’s a vitally meaningful, significant time period told by someone on the front lines (literally), and its events obviously ripple through today’s world. Thus, this should be on everyone’s reading list.The opening image, two hands meeting in the center of the page to shake is a starkly hopeful one, and the amount of white space that surrounds it, the clarity of the image, lets us linger on that sense of optimism it delivers. Though of course, it took a lot of pain and dedication to get there—the focus of most of this graphic story. The opening scene in the earlier years takes place in Nashville on November 10, 1960.  As is the case throughout, the artwork does an excellent job of conveying tone and atmosphere. Here, the opening image is of a young African-American leaning against a brick wall just outside a fast food place, while an expository bubble tells us Lewis’ organization is turning their attention from their success at opening the lunch counters to fast food spots and cafeterias.  The casual stance of the young man against the wall, the way of the restaurant is brightly lit while the backgrounds is mostly white, seems to indicate a sense of light and openness, an optimistic tone. But the light is hedged in at the edges by far darker tones, and when she shift indoors we watch as three young protestors are horribly mistreated by the waitress, though even that pales in comparison to what happens when Lewis and a few others spell the protestors at the counter.  Then, the owner leaves them alone with a fumigator “used only for killing pests,” and as Lewis and the others struggle to breathe, as he wonders if “that man could’ve really left us there to die,” the panels grow more and dark, becoming almost utterly black.Later, the protests shift to stand-ins at the local movie theaters, which prompts a violent reaction first from white teens and then from the police, a violence that is again starkly, realistically portrayed both in sound and imagery as a policeman uses his baton in brutal fashion against several of the protestors.  But when the young Lewis is asked what they should do, his response his always the same:  “We’re gonna march.”  The protests continue, and the sample I had ends with Lewis and others being taken away in a police wagon, segregation continuing its absurd influence, as the cops tell them protestors, “You know the drill, whites to the left, coloreds over here.”As mentioned, I think this book and its predecessor should be required reading for just about anyone, including kids. Though there I’d say parents should read it with them to help them process the language and images, since none of that is sugar coated. The history is what it is though, and we should all know its reality. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPBVS3W4WWCY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RZY5JSM#wasThisHelpful","RPBVS3W4WWCY7","AFN32PGTZ31MV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFN32PGTZ31MV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How to Clone a Mammoth, by Beth Shapiro, is a highly informative look at the possibilities of de-extinction, with particular focus on the titular animal, along with another candidate she is heavily involved in — the passenger pigeon. Thanks to its clarity, focus, and lack of hyperbole, Shapiro’s work is highly recommended for anyone interested in this particular topic, and in environmental conservation in general.The book is a true guide to the topic, as Shapiro takes the reader step by step through what the attempt to de-extinct a species would look like. Or actually, several possible attempts, as she explains several potential methods, though she comes down pretty strongly on which is the best and most likely. Her table of contents lays out her basic topics:• Find a Well-Preserved Specimen• Create a Clone• Breed Them Back• Reconstruct the Genome• Reconstruct Part of the Genome• Now Create a Clone• Make More of Them• Set them Free• Should We?Before she gets to de-extinction, she offers up a fast reminder of when and how mammoths, passenger pigeons, and other species went extinct—naming climate change and human intervention as the two prime causes. She then quickly skims through some modern early attempts/announcements (often poorly reported) on de-extinction attempts and a description of one of her own expeditions into Siberia in search of mammoth DNA. After this introductory material, she moves into seven major questions:1. Is There a Compelling Reason to Bring This Species Back?2. Why Did This Species Go Extinct the First Time?3. Is There a Place for This Species to Live if We Successfully Bring It Back?4. How Will Introducing This Species Affect the Existing Ecosystem?5. Will It Be Possible to Learn the Genome Sequence?6. Is There a Way to Transform the Genome Sequence Into a Living Organism?7. Will It Be Possible to Move The Resulting Living Organism From Captivity to a Natural Habitat?Each question is answered in turn through clear, well defined, and mostly easy to follow explanations with no attempt to sugarcoat the many, many obstacles along the way. All science writing should be this crystalline and logical. The only problem area for some might be a few pages when Shapiro gets into some details about genetics involving base pairs, proteins, and the like, though really, a little concentration and some attempt to recall one’s old bio class is all that will be needed to follow her explanation.Along with explaining the underlying theory, and then detailing the ongoing work as well as exactly what will be needed in the near future in terms of new tools, greater sequencing capability, etc., Shapiro applies everything in concrete fashion to the task at hand — bringing an actual animal back from the dead — usually the mammoth but at times she discusses as well the passenger pigeon, the dodo, and others. In this way, she never spirals too far afield into theory/abstraction and the reader is always clear on just what her explanations mean in a practical sense.And none of it is done in the breathless sort of fashion that is too often how popularized science is conveyed. Shapiro makes no promises, never glosses over the difficulties, whether they be problems of finding/extracting material, or creating fine enough genetic tools/manipulators, or simple math (current cloning works at X level of efficiency, gestation periods for elephants are X months, etc.). It is refreshing to have a scientist lay out not just the stunning potential of an idea but also its stunning difficulty.At both the start and the end, Shapiro argues that really the goal here should not be species-focused—not to bring back a real mammoth or a real passenger pigeon — but instead should be on “ecological resurrection” rather than “species resurrection,” to restore a balance and a richness to an environment out of whack due to extinction. To this end, then, we needn’t worry about recreating a 100% version of the extinct animal, just one that can perform the same environmental duties (say, an elephant modified with enough mammoth genes to be able to thrive in the mammoth’s tundra steppe environment and do all the good things for the habitat that the mammoth’s once did). In this vein, along with de-extinction efforts she also spends some time (briefly) discussing re-wilding attempts — both those already undertaken (grey wolves in Yellowstone) and more fringe ones (recreating the Pleistocene time period in the US by reintroducing lions, cheetahs, horses, camels, donkeys and other species that have gone extinct here but have living descendants/near-relatives elsewhere).Finally, she closes by addressing, in the briefest section of the book, various concerns about de-extinction, ranging from fears or bringing back a dangerous pathogen (almost certainly impossible she says) to the idea harming current conservation goals (she can see the point but is more optimistic about people).If Shapiro lacks the lyricism of some populizers of science or nature/environmental writers like Gary Ferguson or Diane Ackerman, she more than makes up for it by a rare ability to make somewhat arcane topics wholly understandable, without dumbing things down or making it all seems so easy or around the corner. How to Clone a Mammoth is one of the most logical, clear, concrete, focused, and balanced/realistic explanations of a scientific topic I’ve read on any topic and is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC0WVFLP22I0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691157057#wasThisHelpful","RC0WVFLP22I0F","AFN32PGTZ31MV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFN32PGTZ31MV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Trees, a new comic by Warren Ellis and Jason Howard, has a great premise at is core. A decade ago, giant €œTreesâ€ (huge cylinders) landed in various spots on the Earth and then, well, stayed there. No aliens crawled out, no release of terraforming gas, no giant signals trying to communicate with the whales. They landed ten years ago and remain as mysterious now as when they arrived. But in the shadow of the trees, nothing is the same, as even without any overt action, the Trees shattered the previous social/economic/governmental systems of those areas as most who could moved out of their shadows. New enclaves and systems have grown up around the Trees, and the comic moves amongst several of them.In the Chinese city of Shu, a young painter arrives in the â€œcultural zoneâ€ to try and capture the Tree through his art. In Italy, where fascism is on the rise under the Tree, and a brutal gang rules the streets, a young woman who frets under the system comes under the tutelage of an old man with surprising skills and knowledge. In Mogadishu, a president risks using a Tree to keep his country. And in Svalbard, where a research base is studying that regionâ€™s Tree, one scientist thinks that perhaps something is in fact happening, that maybe the Tree is no longer a passive part of the landscape.I responded to the premise with a two-fold appreciation. One, I love how weâ€™re getting what on the surface appears to be an â€œalien invasionâ€ story, but then the aliens donâ€™t seem to even notice weâ€™re around. Thereâ€™s no big battles, no assimilation, no attempts at communication; we may as well not even exist, a point made immediately in the first few pages:They landed. All over the world, as if there were no one here and they did nothing, and did not speak as if there were no one here and nothing under foot. Ten years since we learned that there is intelligent life in the universe, but that they did not recognize us as intelligent or alive. They stand on the surface of the Earth like trees, exerting their silent pressure on the world as if there were no one here.Thatâ€™s a rarely-told version of this story. And then I also like how Ellis focuses on what humans do to ourselves in the anti-climactic aftermath of this â€œinvasion.â€ This is much more an us vs. us story than an us vs. them story. That said, some of the us were more interesting than others.The Shu storyline, focusing on the artist Tian Chenglei and Zhen, a transgender woman he meets on his arrival, has its moments, and I appreciated its diverse characters, but it felt at times like it was trying too hard on the diversity front. I was feeling the authorâ€™s hand a bit too heavily rather than experiencing the characters in a more organic, story-centered fashion. And, as Iâ€™ve said countless times in my reviews, Iâ€™m rarely a fan of the insta-love.The Svalbard plot is the suspenseful, creepy horror invasion story one, as one of the members begins to spot strange flowers around the Tree, flowers that shouldnâ€™t be here. His investigation of the phenomenon turns obsessive and eventually dangerous. I liked the banter amongst the characters in this segment, but the plot felt a bit predictable, and it pretty much ended where I figured it would.The Italy and Mogadishu sections, with their focus on society, politics, and economics, were strong ones, though again, at times I wish they were a little less blunt. And they seemed to move a little too fast, though that was a relatively minor complaint.As is often the case with graphic stories for me, I wish the language was a bit more vivid, a bit sharper. There are times when Ellis nails the dialogue, and at other times it falls flat or feels too much like speechifying or lesson giving. Trees didnâ€™t grab me, and its sometimes heavy-handed nature and flat dialog made for a lessened reading experience, but I did enjoy the structure and the shifting settings/points-of-view, and it captured enough of my interest that Iâ€™ll check out Volume 2.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R160HR0X05JTNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632152703#wasThisHelpful","R160HR0X05JTNT","AFN32PGTZ31MV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFN32PGTZ31MV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rachel Hartman’s Seraphina was a subtle, exquisitely quiet novel, nuanced and filled with sharply realized characters. I absolutely fell in love with it, placing it on my list of top reads that year, so it kills me to report that the eagerly-awaited sequel, Shadow Scale, not only failed to meet my (admittedly high) expectations, but really disappointed across the board.Shadow Scale picks up shortly after the events of Seraphina, with dragons involved in an all-out civil war and their ousted leader Comonot allied with the human land of Goredd. While Princess Glisselda and Prince Kiggs prepare for war, Seraphina travels to find other ityasaari (half-dragons) such as herself, prompted by a discovery by Orma (her full dragon uncle) that the half-dragons might be able to provide a magical defense against dragon attacks. Her antagonist in this endeavor is Jannoula, the ityasaari who nearly possessed her mind in the prior novel and who uses that talent to take over other nearly all the half-dragons in this oneI had several issues with Shadow Scale. One is the pacing felt way off. The novel comes in at about 600 pages, which felt over-long by several hundred pages. The story started off slowly, then plodded along from place to place, much as Seraphina herself did, with little variation — no sense of urgency even when the storyline seemed to call for it, no slowing down for quieter moments. That isn’t to say there were no quiet moments, but it all felt apace; those moments didn’t stand out at all. The whole thing just dragged for me, and it never really felt like the author was fully in control or cognizant of the pacing.This plodding sense attached itself as well to both the main character, who was surprisingly passive throughout most of the novel, and to the plot, which felt quite repetitive for the first half or more. Seraphina would travel to a new land in search of some half-dragons, find them, then Jannoula would possess them, Seraphina would bemoan their possession, then move on to the next land, where the process would repeat itself. Throughout it all, Seraphina was inexplicably removed from it all, paying lip service to the horror of it all, and to the real-world implications, but it never felt like she tried (really tried) to do much about it. Part of the problem  here I think is that the solution is tied so much to her coming-of-age epiphany, which Hartman clearly wants to save for the climactic ending, but 500+ pages is a long time for the sort of delayed agency (I had other issues with that ending as well—its abruptness, its ease, the way it comes somewhat out of left field, etc., but I won’t go into those issues more so as to avoid spoilers).If the protagonist was one issue, her antagonist was equally problematic. For one, the half-dragons’ mental powers just felt muddy to me. Jannoula can possess other ityasaari and basically wholly charm humans. How is never made clear, or why she is so distinct from the others in this capability. It also seems a matter of authorial convenience when she can fully charm people and when they can resist, or when she uses her possession to learn things and when she does not. And her pretty much unfailing ability robbed the book of much of its potential suspense. Finally, her backstory, which is meant to offer up some complexity to her villainy, never felt wholly connected to her.Here I think it would have helped matters if Hartman had chosen a different narrative POV, using multiple narrators rather than focusing solely on Seraphina. Putting us in the head of Jannoula would have deepened her character, while giving us some other POVs — some of the possessed half-dragon, the full dragon Eskar, young Abdo — would have allowed us to break out of the repetitive plot cycle as well as created some of that painful urgency the book needed in places.Shadow Scale has its moments, and Hartman does a nice job with some bittersweet endings, but it isn’t near enough to overcome its many issues: too great a length, a passive main character and overly effective villain, uneven pacing, a repetitive plot structure, unclear abilities/goals, and a problematic climax. It kills me to say it, but not recommended.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38R2Q6TCF7AUE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PBGOK#wasThisHelpful","R38R2Q6TCF7AUE","AFN32PGTZ31MV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFN32PGTZ31MV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m a sucker for early natural philosophers, so I admit the pre-publication description of The Mechanical, Ian Tregillis’ new novel, pretty much had me at,  “Soon after the Dutch scientist and clockmaker Christiaan Huygens … ” The rest of the blurb, about a “mechanical army” of “Clakkers” allowing the Netherlands to become the world’s sole superpower, the French trying to make a last stand in North America, and an “audacious Clakker, Jax” making “a bid for freedom”?  Icing on the cake. And a sweet, rich cake it is, too.The Mechanical begins two centuries after Huygens’ discoveries paved the way for the Netherlands’ creation of the Clakkers — clockwork servitors/soldiers. The Brasswork Throne dominates the world, and has just concluded an uneasy peace with the French, who have fled their own country to New France in North America, basing their capital-in-exile in Marseilles-in-the-West (Montreal). Also resistant is the Papacy, as the Catholic Church believes the Clakkers to be thinking creatures and thus their slavery to be an abomination.Tregillis tells his story through three limited POVs. The first is that of Jax, a Clakker who in the opening scene is witness to the execution of a “rogue” (a Clakker who has somehow broken its bonds of obedience) and a Papist spy cell. This scene does an excellent job of conveying in effective, concise, and moving fashion not just Jax’s personality, but the basic workings of the Clakkers. We learn, for instance, that somewhat similar to Asimov’s Three Rules, the Clakkers are instilled with a series of nesting orders of priority when it comes to obeying human commands, that the Clakkers have a secret form of communication employing rattles and vibrations, and that any time a Clakker is given a “geas,” he/she suffers an increasing amount of pain until that command is fulfilled. This leads to the powerfully affecting aspect of this first scene, as Jax delays his current geas so as to bear witness to this rogue who has managed to gain Free Will, the dream of all Clakkers:The torment of an unfulfilled geas speared Jax’s mind, his joints, his every bearing and pinion. He doubled over. He took an involuntary step toward the Stadtholder’s Gate … Another step. Another. Granite crumbled to sand beneath his grip on the Little Tower’s façade … He needed to see.As the blurb says, and as any reader will immediately guess, it is not long before Jax, through a series of events, turns rogue himself, and that event will catapult him into deadly danger fighting for his newly free life in North America.Another POV comes via the sole remaining member of that Papist spy ring, Father Luuk Visser, who has been masquerading as a pastor. We meet him as he is about to commit suicide so as to keep his secrets safe, but much to his surprise, it seems he has not been betrayed. His life too will be turned wholly upside down, though to give any more details would ruin some major plot points.Finally, the last POV gives the French perspective through Berenice de Mornay-Perigord, a vicomtesse who holds the spymaster title of Talleyrand and reports directly to the king in exile in Marseilles-in-the-West. The destruction of her cell in The Hague has damaged her standing, though she makes one final push to convince the king to take the risk of renewed war by breaking one of the treaty’s rules and bringing into the fortress an immobilized Clakker soldier that the Dutch are unaware of, thanks to its placement in the fort’s defenses. Her ultimate goal is to learn not just how to better defend against the Clakkers, the unstoppable force that has pressed the French into this sliver of land, but how to turn them to the service of the French.All three are fully formed, engaging characters, and each allows Tregillis to bring something different to the table. Visser offers the opportunity to dig into some heavy philosophical/existential discussion of free will, the soul, and so forth, both through interior monologue and through an almost formal debate with one of the guild members who create the Clakkers. Jax is the emotional core of the novel, the character the reader can’t help but empathize with in his desperate yearning to be his own individual. Berenice, meanwhile, adds a nice bit of grey area. We root for her thanks to her resistance to the Dutch slavemasters, but the lengths to which she is willing to go in order to achieve her goals, and her discomfiting attitude toward the Clakkers (not to mention her seeming willingness to keep them slaves so long as they are “her” slaves) make us cringe.While Jax is, as mentioned, the emotional core, that isn’t to say the other characters do not have their moving moments. Far from it (Though it is not a stretch to say that the most poignant scene involves none of the main characters at all, but an airship. Yes, I said an airship). And each character has at least one extended scene of intense action. All of them also make some pretty big mistakes, often leading to irrecoverable consequences and harm to if not themselves, those around them. For instance, thanks to that opening execution scene, we’re served early notice that Berenice is not some omniscient uber-competent spider at the center of a web of spies. She makes mistakes and those mistakes can lead to people dying.The strong characters, intriguing world, precise language — there are some lovely details throughout — , and wholly engaging plot (I’d go further with Jax’s storyline and call his compelling) combine to create a novel that is easy to recommend. That isn’t to say I don’t have some minor quibbles though. The world building is interestingly sufficient, but that’s about it, although I assume since this is labeled “Book One” that we’ll have more details filled in as we go. Father Vissar’s character disappears a bit too long perhaps at times. And the climactic scene at the end smacked a bit too much of TV/movie plotting in terms of everything having to go just right (though Tregillis redeems himself by not having things go just right). And some might complain that the ending resolves too little, though again, we are just at the start of the story here, so that one doesn’t bother me much.Those are, like I said, quibbles though. The Mechanical is a strong opening novel to the series, as is such as much for its thoughtfulness as for its basic storytelling elements of character and plot. One of my favorite aspects is the depth with which he has his characters discuss the big questions of free will and existence and consciousness. And also how he presents these big questions as inevitably roiling the world once the Clakkers are invented. Too often in science fiction we get societies with some brand new invention or alternate histories with steampunk abilities or clockwork men etc., and they’re fundamentally the same old society, just with new devices. But those sorts of changes don’t just affect the surface of a society; they would affect its core beliefs as well. You can’t create mechanical beings and not have people wonder then about, well, being. And wondering about being, as we’ve seen in history, leads to great turmoil, to violence, to out and out war, to the overturning of some institutions and the rise of others. It was a pleasure to read a book that acknowledges this.

"Aurora, by Kim Stanley Robinson, has major issues with pacing, characterization, and to some extent, plotting. Which would seem to make this review a no-brainer “not recommended.”  But if one can overlook issues of plot, character, and pace (and granted, that’s a Grand Canyon-level overlook), there’s a lot here to often admire and sometimes enjoy, and a reader who perseveres will I think not only be happy they did so, but will also find Aurora lingering in their mind for some time. (Note: While I don’t think anything revealed ahead will mar the reading experience, it’s pretty nigh impossible to discuss this book substantively without some plot spoilers. So fair warning.)Generations ago, a starship left Earth with plans to set up a colony in the Tau Ceti system. Aurora begins in the final stage of the journey, with the ship only a few years out. Early on we’re introduced to a young teen, Freya, daughter of the ship’s chief engineer, Devi. The novel moves quickly through the years as Freya grows older, documenting the problems the ship faces as landfall nears: a host of mechanical/environmental issues (power plant problems, crop failures, etc.), biological obstacles (especially island devolution), and social problems. With landfall, new issues arise as the ship’s population lands a small number of early settlers who begin building the colony and preparing it to receive the rest of the ship. Eventually, the colonists come face to face with the basic question of viability—is this mission even possible?  This problem — the social division it causes and its eventual compromise solution — drive the second half of the book.Much of the novel’s narrative point-of-view focuses on Freya, but more interestingly, the narrator, or perhaps more accurately, the “author” of the story is the Ship, tasked early on by Devi to “tell the story” of the mission. Ship is a relatively rudimentary AI at the start of the novel, but one who grows in consciousness and responsibility throughout the novel’s course. Thus Aurora is a coming-of-age story both for Freya and, more compellingly, for Ship, in addition to being a generation ship story.This choice by Robinson to have Ship “author” the text is at times delightful and at times frustrating. Ship’s early difficulties in composing a narrative allows for Robinson to play in the meta-fiction field for the first quarter or so of the book, as Ship tries to nail down basic storytelling concepts and techniques:  This is proving a difficult assignment … Lossless compression is impossible, and even lossy compression is hard. Can a narrative account ever be adequate … Summarize the content of their moments or days or weeks or months or years or lives? How many moments constitute a narrative unit? … What is a particular, what is important?Devi offers suggestions, and some complaints (Too much backstory!), and Ship after a good number of false starts, begins to find her narrative way, before bumping into the more complex issues of figurative language:  Clearly metaphors have no empirical basis, and are often opaque, pointless, inane, inaccurate, deceptive, mendacious, and in short, futile and stupid.  Nevertheless, despite all that, human language is, in its most fundamental operation, a gigantic system of metaphors.  Therefore, simple syllogism: human language is futile and stupid. Meaning furthermore that human narratives are futile and stupid.How much tolerance you have for this sort of thing will go a long way toward determining your enjoyment of the first 100+ pages. I confess that my patience was less than Devi’s, so that by the time she complains about how tedious Ship’s narrative was, I’d already been at that point for some time. I like the idea, I like the portrayal of the idea, and beyond my enjoyment of some of the “inner weeds” of narrative (Ship for instance has a nicely insightful point re the distinction between analogy and metaphor), I think all of it is integral to the Ship’s development of consciousness/being. But even getting that it was meant to be annoying, I could have done with if not fewer false starts, shorter ones.Freya’s story, meanwhile, the actual “plot,” isn’t all that compelling early on. There’s a nice scene that opens the book with her sailing with her father (effective in its characterization as well as a nice bit of foreshadowing), and then some rather perfunctory wandering from biome to biome during a rite of passage known as the Wandering. To be honest, I didn’t feel much for her, or the majority of the characters (most of whom were pretty thin) through to the end; none really felt alive to me, save one or two.It didn’t help that the story is interspersed with some, for me, over-long nuts and bolts description of how the ship worked. I’m glad Robinson didn’t just hand-wave the whole “how does this all work” question; I do like the science in my hard science fiction. And there’s no doubt the reader will feel like this could be exactly how such a mission would work. But still, four pages on the lighting were a bit much for instance (even if some of the description was absolutely beautiful). At one point a character says, “It must be like an endorphin, or a brain action in the temporal region, near the religious and epileptic nodes. I read a paper saying as much,” and I thought to myself, “I wish less of the book felt like that whole ‘I read a paper’ on it.’”  Even when major problems arise that should have driven a sense of urgency in the plot, including several acts of violence, it all felt a bit too academic, a bit too removed.So, pacing issues thanks to Ship’s narrative difficulties and long stretches of too much detail. Characters who fail for the most part to come wholly alive. And a plot that moves along but never really compels. What’s to like, right?Well, let’s begin with the character that does, ironically, come to life. Before our very eyes in fact. Ship. Her character arc is masterfully handled: from rudimentary AI that struggles with language, communication, empathy, and understanding, and that has a basic lack of self-awareness, to a fully conscious, feeling being that can experience (and convey) sorrow and humor. This development wasn’t simply conveyed through her monologue, which runs throughout, but through much more subtle means—the gradual change in pronoun usage, tiny baby steps toward that aforementioned sense of humor. By the end of the novel, I felt more for Ship than probably any character in the book.Another strong aspect of Aurora is its sheer thoughtfulness. One part of this is the fact that it is by far the most carefully considered depiction of a generation ship story I’ve ever read. Granted, it does at times become perhaps too carefully depicted, but still I appreciate the depth and seriousness with which he approaches the concept. Examples abound — the ways in which such a small population will suffer across generations due to its isolation and small size, the problem with differing rates of evolution between large-scale creatures (humans, livestock) and small-scale creatures (bacteria, viruses) over the time scale of a generation ship’s voyage, the very realistic (if somewhat depressing) discussion over the possibility of meeting other intelligent life in the universe or of human colonization of the stars.This latter was especially striking, as it runs counter to so much science fiction, which often begins with one or both premises (there are aliens to meet, we can live on other planets) as givens. Along those same lines (and here is another spoiler warning for plot as I’m about to discuss how they solve their biggest obstacle so you’ve been warned to not read farther if you care not to know), the decision by some to simply turn around, to return to Earth, was both a shock (I don’t think I’ve ever seen a science fiction story about a colony mission that said “Screw it, we’re going back!”) and a wholly believable and natural outgrowth of the plot up to that point. And this decision, and the depiction of their arrival back on Earth, was again, thoughtfully, rationally explored. And even as it depressed the hell out of me in some ways, because let’s face, most of us who read science fiction/fantasy don’t do it to be told that maybe we’ll never get to the stars and even if we do we’ll never meet anyone else out there—we do it because we already believe the opposite with every fiber of our beings; even as it depressed me, this section made me think both about the very real possibility that what these characters say might be right and also about why I have such a need to believe them wrong.In other words, it hit both head and heart; it made me think, and it moved me. And really, aren’t these the two things we ask books to do? Or at least, two of the most important?If I had my druthers, I would have made Aurora a much shorter novel, maybe even a long novella. I could see it being incredibly effective at about a 150-200 pages. Those few non-Ship moments of emotional power would stand out all the more, Ship’s arc could stay nearly entirely intact and thus remain powerful, and the high-concepts could still be explored without the interruption of needing a narrative plot. But since I’ve not been elected King of the Universe yet, I’ll take Aurora as it stands—an ambitious but too-long novel with some major issues that make its reading less pleasant than it could have been, even a chore at times, but that despite its flaws remains worthy of a recommendation for the way it lingers well after the final page is turned.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MKV2BW12QVPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316098108#wasThisHelpful","R2MKV2BW12QVPL","AFN32PGTZ31MV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFN32PGTZ31MV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a big fan of V.E. Schwab’s Vicious, noting in my review how in that book she had overcome the possible burden of overfamiliar concepts (it’s a folks-with-powers-who-have-some-gray-to-them) with supremely polished execution. Well, she’s pretty much done the same with her newest novel, A Darker Shade of Magic, which takes many of the usual fantasy tropes and again, just handles them all so smoothly that you simply don’t care much that you’ve seen them all before.The basic concept is a nicely focused tweak of the multi-verse model, with a series of parallel Londons: Red London, a vibrant, colorful city where magic and life are in balance; White London, a cruel dog-eat-dog world where people and magic are more at war, with people seeing magic as something to be conquered and used; Grey London, a dull, dirty version mostly drained of magic; and the not-to-be-spoken-of Black London, where 300 years ago magic caused a cataclysm that precipitated the other Londons to “shut the doors” between the worlds so as to escape Black London’s fate. Now, the only communication is between the monarchs of each city.Said communication takes place via the only people who can travel between the worlds — the Antari — who were always rare but since the closing of paths have become nearly non-existent. The main character, Kell, is attached to the royal family of Red London. The king and queen have adopted him like a son and their real child, Prince Rhys, and Kell are brothers in truth, though Kell chafes at the idea he is less “family” and more “possession.”  The only other Antari known, Holland, is the diplomat for the brother-sister rulers of White London — a sadistic and power-hungry pair who have no qualms about using magic to compel others to do their will, turning some into mere automatons.The precipitating event in the novel occurs when Kell comes into possession of a powerful relic of Black London, one that poses a great threat to both its holder and to the greater worlds. It also offers the kind of power people will kill for, and so Kell soon finds himself in  a race to try and destroy the artifact before it destroys him or his world, either directly or indirectly. He’s joined in this quest by Lila, a young pickpocket from Grey London who stumbled into the action thanks to her thieving and to her great yearning for something more, for a sense of adventure.The plot moves along briskly, smoothly, and at the perfect pace, with noisy action scenes nicely balanced by quieter character-driven ones. Schwab’s prose also sails along smoothly, carrying the reader effortlessly through the novel’s 400 pages. I read it easily and happily in a single sitting.The characters are nicely drawn, with complex emotions and backgrounds — nooks and crannies of personal detail some of which get explored and some of which merely mentioned, either as a background tapestry or perhaps to set us up for later adventures with these two.Lila is the familiar spunky-street-girl-orphan-who-takes-no-guff-and-whose-knives-are-only-slightly-less-sharp-than-her-attitude (future trademark on the SSGOWTNGWKAOSLSTHA acronym by the way). But you know, if we told authors they couldn’t use any familiar character types, the last new story would have been told millennia ago. We know Lila’s “type” but we don’t know Lila, at least not until this book, and she’s a lovely, fun individualized creation whose desperate desire for something beyond her life’s experiences runs like a constantly humming, painfully poignant current beneath her surface.Kell, meanwhile, is also fully realized, with his own secrets, his own longings and desires and flaws, and I like how Schwab isn’t afraid to have those flaws called out into the open by other characters. The villains are, well, villainy, with Schwab eschewing the “grey villain” trend in favor of all-out classical sadistic, power-mad, evil. And there’s something to be said for that. Schwab doesn’t fully ignore the benefits of greyness, though, serving up Holland as a nice bit of complexity, someone more betwixt and between.Interestingly, magic itself is a character in this novel, its role chillingly portrayed in several darkly menacing scenes and it’s one of the areas where Schwab proves that even working in familiar plot zones authors can bring their own striking bits of originality. I really enjoyed A Darker Shade of Magic, even if I can’t say I “loved” it. I had a few minor complaints. Lila’s unconventionality feels a little too untethered, even as unconventionality,  to her time/society, as does her speech at times. The story’s smoothness sometimes felt a little too smooth or easy, which I admit doesn’t make a lot of sense as a complaint, but I wouldn’t have minded a more complex structure of sort — a less straightforward, linear construction. Maybe some of this desire comes out of the familiarity of plot and character points (or maybe I’m just being a contrary hard-to-please jerk). Finally, the ending felt a bit rushed, maybe even a little anti-climactic.I did appreciate that the ending resolved the major issues, making A Darker Shade of Magic a novel that can happily stand on its own, even as it also clearly leaves room, and points to, further stories in this setting (one reason why even as I wanted more details about these parallel worlds I didn’t count that as a complaint; I assume those details are forthcoming in a later novel).Those above quibbles aren’t why the book didn’t rise above highly enjoyable; sometimes you just can’t pinpoint why one good book wows you and another good one doesn’t. But even if A Darker Shade of Magic  didn’t rise to that rarified level, I’ll quite happily pick up another book set in this world and look forward to more time spent with these characters.

"Pacific Fire is Greg van Eekhout’s sequel to California Bones, and like its predecessor, it falls solidly into the heist/caper subgenre of fantasy. I gave California Bones a 3.5, calling it a fun read, and fans of the first will find it at least equally enjoyable (I actually liked  Pacific Fire a little bit more), while those who have been wary of starting a new trilogy should rest assured they won’t regret this one. Warning — there will be some unavoidable spoilers for book one. Also, a reminder that Eekhout’s magic system of osteomancy is based upon the ingestion of the bones of mystical creatures (or the digestion of those who have eaten the bones) which instills the consumer with magical power.A decade has passed since the events of California Bones, and Daniel Blackland has been on the run ever since, trying to keep himself and Sam, his 16-year-old ward that he’d rescued as a young boy, alive in the face of constant pursuit from those seeking power after the Hierarch’s fall. The biggest of those include:  Otis, Daniel’s old crime boss and current mortal enemy; Gabriel Argent, the Hierarch’s great-nephew, now a powerful water-mage and semi-ally of Daniel’s; and Sister Tooth; a ruthlessly strong osteomancer. L.A. has been torn by turf battles since Daniel killed the Hierarch and ate half his heart, but now Otis has proposed a grand triumvirate among the three most powerful leaders, a triumvirate bolstered by the creation of the ultimate weapon — a recreated Pacific Firedrake. And to power this weapon, they need a source of great power, specifically Sam, the Hierarch’s golem.The caper aspect of the novel, then, is the attempt to break into the site of the dragon’s creation and destroy it before it “goes live.” But rather than just repeat the formula of his first book, van Eekhout broadens his purview. Thanks to Sam being an adolescent male who has been on the run his whole life and protected by his uber-paranoid guardian (with good reason as we see on multiple occasions), the novel also becomes a coming-of-age story and by separating the two early on, van Eekhout offers up two plots that differ in their foundation and tone, only to come together satisfactorily toward the end. Pacific Fire  also ratchets up the emotional impact, which is one of the reasons I liked it a bit better than California Bones.Sam’s story also adds a fun new character, Em, whom readers of book one will recognize (kind of), and whose banter with Sam brings some welcome humor into the book. As does Daniel’s old buddy Moth, who also adds a bit of meta when after one back and forth he notes, “I don’t like buddy movies.”Other characters from California Bones also reappear in fine form, as Daniel’s old team reforms, but we also see some characters from his deeper past, as well as get introduced in brief but effective fashion to new ones (one of my favorites being Mother Cauldron in a fun little scene). As mentioned, Gabriel Argent is one of the familiar faces, and I wish he had some more page time, as there’s a lot to like about his character:  his unique perspective on things, his different type of magic (water magic rather than osteomancy), his relationship with is aide-de-camp Max.The world-building remains both a plus and a minus, in that I really like the near-miss aspect of this alternate world, where L.A.’s transportation system is via canal rather than the infamous highways. On the other hand, parts still remain a bit befuddling. And as with California Bones, the ending felt a bit rushed and not quite wholly earned, or at least set up. But Pacific Fire easily overcomes these minor issues, leaving me looking forward to what happens in the third book.(originally appeared on fantasyliterature.com)","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B6X7VW5SOYBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LKO5JNS#wasThisHelpful","R2B6X7VW5SOYBH","AFN32PGTZ31MV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFN32PGTZ31MV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Fifty years on, and considering the host of wonderful performances Mahler's masterpiece has received, the combination of Klemperer, Wunderlich, and Ludwig rises above criticism.

"If Bartók weren’t so cherished in his homeland, would his early symphonic poem Kossuth have slipped beneath the waves? The same can be asked of other nationalistic composers—Sibelius, Nielsen, Enescu—who became the musical heroes of small countries. Sibelius’s Kullervo, an even more ambitious orchestral epic, was kept alive in Finland waiting for the rest of the world to notice that the composer’s early style demanded attention. I would say that Kullervo almost belongs to the world now, but not Kossuth. It’s rare for non-Hungarians to perform it, which adds a note of distinction to this new account by JoAnn Falletta and the Buffalo Philharmonic. Scanning past and present recordings, Herbert Blomstedt is her nearest rival. Pierre Boulez was willing to record the First Violin Concerto of 1907 but turned his back on Kossuth from four years earlier.  I’d argue that it’s the superior work, with stronger themes, more vitality, and hints of Bartók’s emerging genius as an orchestrator. What counts against Kossuth are two little things: it doesn’t sound like either Bartók or Hungary. If on first hearing somebody had told me the score was by Sibelius, roughly from the time of Kullervo, I’d have believed it. The swelling horn call that begins the work could evoke endless northern forests.  The actual subject is a firebrand of Hungarian independence, Lajos Kossuth (1802-1894), who was embroiled in the uprisings of 1848 that swept through royalist Europe (Richard Wagner was similarly caught up, and both had to flee when the revolutionary spirit failed). Biographers point to a 1902 concert where Bartók first heard Also sprach Zarathustra as a student. His enthusiasm for Richard Strauss led him to write a piano reduction of Ein Heldenleben, and Kossuth soon followed. Throw Liszt into the pot and stir vigorously.  The work is played in one continuous movement, like Zarathustra, but there are ten individual episodes woven together, following the Straussian model. Falletta leads a very convincing performance from live concerts in October 2013. For color, sweep, and pure excitement, it’s almost on a par with almost everyone’s top choice, Iván Fischer and the Budapest Festival Orchestra (Philips). If you can compete on the same footing with native Hungarians, you’ve accomplished something.  Kossuth lasts 20 minutes, so the fillers, taken from the same series of concerts, actually constitute the bulk of the disc. The first of the Two Portraits op. 5 is actually the Andante from Bartók’s First Violin Concerto, a lyrical elegy for the soloist with sympathetic murmurs from the rest of the orchestra, beginning with the strings. There are no technical demands on the violinist; here the part is beautifully played by Michael Ludwig, the concertmaster in Buffalo. The intended portrait is of “the idealized Stefi Geyer, transcendent and intimate.” She was the alluring violinist for whom Bartók wrote the concerto as a love offering in 1907. Unfortunately she didn’t respond, and her just desserts was the second portrait, a swirling, disdainful Scherzo-like miniature depicting the “cool, indifferent, silent Stefi.”  The program ends with the ambitious Suite No. 1 from 1905, when Bartók was 24. It was intended for Vienna as a display of his orchestral virtuosity. The materials vary from country dances and the Austrian national anthem to imitation Liszt and Strauss. Since it’s twice as long as Kossuth, the Suite No. 1 deserves to be called the major work here. Each of the five varied movements displays undeniable talent, but the pastiche of styles is almost comical. Bartók becomes like an all-purpose kitchen tool that slices, dices, chops, and grates, all in one. Happily, we know that he would go on to be a ferocious, wildly brilliant composer whose unique gifts changed twentieth-century music, so there’s no harm enjoying this tour of musical Europe from Vienna eastward. The Orientalism of the second movement, marked Poco adagio, is like a gypsy wagon stealing through Baghdad in the moonlight, a lovely thing.  It’s a pleasure to listen to this imaginative program, and the performances are impressive. I only wish the recorded sound was a little more close up and vivid.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GLXI464ZSN0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LWLZS6W#wasThisHelpful","R1GLXI464ZSN0C","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been a long time since Leonard Slatkin made a recording that reminds us of his promise as a young conductor--his conducting entered premature middle age, with few sparks of rejuvenation. Here we get the best of his musicianship in the first three movements of Symphonie fantastique and the Corsaire Overture. They are so musical and alive that I held my breath for the rest to rise to the same level. It doesn't, unfortunately. The Ride to the Scaffold and Witches' Sabbath are respectably done but with no special energy or involvement. When Slatkin lapses back into routine, you wonder if the orchestra was carrying him in the first three movements. This is a piece, after all, that French musicians know by heart.Even so, there are lasting virtues in this performance. As other reviewers consistently note, the recorded sound is dmeonstration quality, filled with inner detail and remarkably full and lifelike in the bass. The Orchestre Naitonal de Lyon, Slatkin's new ensemble, sounds very good: precise, subtle, and idiomatic. the strings are a bit thin, but everything else justifies high praise for them as more than a good regional orchestra. (I'm writing this review after hearing Slatkin's later Lyon recordings of Ravel, where the playing remains quite good but the conducting is lackluster.)  The bonus track of Un bal with the cornet solo that Berlioz inserted as a much later afterthought is interesting, but his first instincts were right--the cornet sound out pf lace, as if a Member of the Marine Corps Band has crashed Cinderella's ball.this is an ""it might have been"" recording of a work that has enjoyed not dozens but hundreds of recordings. The old Munch and Bernstein performances are hard to beat, and there's a new one from Mariss Jansons and the great Bavarian Radio SO that breathes new life into thrice-familiar music. The Slatkin is certainly enjoyable, even past the point where he switches to automatic pilot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YKDEZ3IBKMDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008N66KO8#wasThisHelpful","R2YKDEZ3IBKMDP","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In concert Carmina Burana is quite a production, and o disc it's a reliable product. Given the frequency of new recordings, it's astonishing that eugen Jochum's classic DG account still rules the roost. The secret is twofold: the conductor's feeling for the work and his unbeatable soloists. Here Leonard Slatkin blows hot and cold, keeping up the energy one moment and falling back on under-powered time-beating the next.  Carmina Bruana is instantly enjoyable, and yet Orff's Nazi ties as well as the music's garish simplicity has kept many famous conductors from recording it (Bernstein, Karajan, Solti, Klemperer, and Giulini head a stellar list of abstainers), so if you're going to do it at all, you should put your heart and soul into the music, as Slatkin doesn't.If you don't mind the rather civilized approach (mixed with bursts of terrific excitement), it's a matter of adding up the pluses and minuses. The recorded sound and orchestral playing by the St. Louis Sym. are excellent. RCA/BMG clearly wanted to create a sonic blockbuster. The chorus is large but sings accurately, despite some woolly diction.  They color their lines nicely, with suitable lustiness and delicacy as they are called for. Among the soloists, I was happy that baritone Hakan Hagegard puts such passion into his solos, and he's in splendid voice. Still, when it comes to portraying a vivid character, Jochum's Fischer-Dieskau is the model, and he too sings with passion. Hagegard's falsetto is impeccable. (The baritone solos were recorded quite wonderfully on a recital album by Peter Mattei that is highly recommendable.)A litmus test for superior recordings of Carmina is the tenor, who's stratospheric portrayal of the roasting goose tests everyone who attempts the part. Gerhard Stolze, a great character tenor, provided an indelibly grotesque account, but here he's rivaled in sheer vocal showmanship by John Aler. He sings so luridly that he almost loses control. Finally, thee's the soprano, and once again Jochum's Gundala Janowitz is nearly unsurpassable for her pure, unearthly tone.  She adds, as do the others, to the air of creepiness that lurks beneath the surface of the piece. In 1994 Sylvia McNair was in her prime, and she's lovely, with a melting  lyrical voice that's warmer than Janowitz's.In all, a very enjoyable version that deserves to be better known. I don't think any Carmina Burana recorded in the U.S. is likely to better it, but before deciding, I need to listen to Levine and Tilson Thomas. e.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3108CQWVS71IX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000003FH3#wasThisHelpful","R3108CQWVS71IX","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It may cause surprise that Harry Christophers leads a romantic Messiah that happens to use period instruments. But the Baroque, in art and in music, was floridly emotional, and the denatured HIP style that turns the Messiah into dry hardtack munched in a cold chapel are not remotely right. If emotionalism were the only criterion for an outstanding performance, this one would deservedly stand out - it was picked as first choice in BBC 3's Building a Library program.One can also point to the expert singing of The Sixteen, which has performed the Messiah over 150 times before recording it in 2008. they are an esteemed ensemble, and once you add a resonant hall to their strong singing, the choral sound is quite strong. Do not fear the anemia associated with many rival HIP versions. Period readings tend to suffer form fallen arches when the Hallelujah Chorus arrives, and I must admit that The sixteen are underpowered here, even if they are very musical and expressive. That's a small blemish amid a great deal of rousing singing.The real drawback here has to do with the vocal quartet (no countertenor as a fifth wheel). Tenor Mark Padmore is an icon among British Baroque singers, but he's a bit rocky in the treacherous combination of ""Comfort ye"" and ""Ev'ry valley,"" sounding hollow in the low notes and gargly in the fast passages. the other three soloist are graduates of the sixteen, and although I'm all in favor of an in-house Messiah, rival recordings boast stronger singers - here we are in the familiar territory of earnest oratorio style. each aria is done nicely but not much beyond that.The recorded sound is good, and the period orchestra plays well, although rather colorlessly since the instrumentation favors strings with little presence in the woodwinds. One oddity is that dynamics are leveled out, with minimal crescendo and decrescendo; this leads to a kind of stiffness that ill fits with the prevailing emotionalaity. In all, the main pleasure here comes from the chorus.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OJXH1FX8PTSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001C4802I#wasThisHelpful","R3OJXH1FX8PTSX","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""On Wenlock Edge"" is one of those magical documents of an age, where Vaughan Williams' music is perfectly attuned to the pastoral verse of A.E. Housman, capturing the Edwardian-Georgian mood in the same rich way that Elgar. ""Pastoral"" doesn't convey the depth of bitterness, longing, and sorrow that permeates this song cycle.  Mark Padmore's approach verges on overstating the work's aching edge, but he doesn't tip over into Bostridge's exaggerations. Everything is wonderfully in place: clear recorded sound, accomplished ensemble work from strings and piano, and above all Padmore's seasoned interpretation - he's inherited the mantle of Peter Pears if anyone has. I'm impressed that the voice remains strong and steady even as the singer turned 53 this year. I'd put his new recording at the top, along with Pears, Anthony Rolfe Johnson,  Ian Partridge, and Padmore's younger self.The rest of the generous (72 min.) program is less familiar. RVW's Ten Blake Songs alternate between the twin poles of innocence and experience; the cycle is very thinly accompanied by a solo oboe. Here Padmore encompasses the childlike songs with a lovely sweetness; he's not quite as memorable in the ""experience"" songs but still very good.  The composer wanted to usher us into Blake's ethereal mysticism, a very difficult thing to do. The result isn't a masterpiece, but who has done better? (Britten, once, in The Sick Rose.) The great poem ""London,"" where Blake gave us the unforgettable phrase, mind-forged manacles, is sung without accompaniment and is among the most effective settings.The oboe's rather mournful cousin, joined by a flute and string quartet, sets the elegiac tone of Peter Warlock's skillfully atmospheric cycle, The Curlew, based on poems by Yeats. Again we are in the countryside, but this isn't so much music of nature as music of solitary reflection. English listeners know the score much better than Americans. Because the instrumental interludes count for so much, it's a decided advantage that they are recorded so beautifully as here.  Finally, a 9-min. song, The End, by Jonathan Dove, born 1959. The tone is radiant mysticism, set to a poem by Mark Strand, a long lyric outcry with minimalist swaying in strings and English horn, like slow-motion Philip Glass. It's beautiful and effective, a real surprise.All in all, this is a memorable recital that any lover of English song will appreciate, even if he owns several versions of On Wenlock Edge already.Dove:The EndNicholas Daniel (cor anglais)Britten Sinfonia (members), Jacqueline ShaveVaughan Williams:On Wenlock EdgeBritten Sinfonia (members), Huw Watkins (piano)Ten Blake SongsNicholas Daniel (oboe)Warlock:The CurlewNicholas Daniel (cor anglais)Britten Sinfonia (members), Jacqueline Shave","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R265HFIBVT6LNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00COU07FC#wasThisHelpful","R265HFIBVT6LNZ","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This early album from the ginger-haired Daniel Hope validates his status as Menuhin's heir. Where Menuhin was forward-looking when he played Bartok and joined forces with Ravi Shankar, Hope is advocating Schnittke and moving beyond minimalism in various crossover CDs for DG. It's too bad that Schnittke's name is likely to frighten prospective buyers off. He managed, like his great predecessor Shostakovich, to express Russian soul under conditions of duress, to further the models of symphony, concerto, and chamber music in an original modernist vein, and to span conventional harmony and avant-gardism.The program consists of concertante works more than true concertos. Schnittke places a large emphasis on piano and harpsichord, sometimes leaving the violin in the background. Weill scores his concerto for a wind band that the violin often joins as equal partner. The other strain that unites Schnittke and  Weill is their absorption of multiple styles, from the baroque concerto grosso to modern jazz. As essentially an Expresionistic composer, Weill unifies the Violin Cto. through its quasi-Hidemith utilitarian mood, which is quick, impersonal, and anti-sentimental. I don't find the work inspired, but the long cadenza that turns into a dialogue for violin and trumpet is innovative. Otherwise, we are in the world of Hindemith's Kammermusik, which is too functional for me.Schnittke's two substantial works are the product of genius, however, and the only thing that keeps me form calling them masterpieces is that he worked at this high level much of the time. The Sonata for Violin and Chamber orchestra moves form dark to light, from near silence to a passionate outpouring, in an arc than any listener can follow emotionally, even if his post-Shostakovich idiom is tougher than Weill's. The sudden arrival of a sumptuous diatonic chord to ground the Largo is just one example of Schnittke's ability to move us. The Concerto Grosso no. 6 is a fascinating example of how to weave the past into the present. Much of it resembles Bartok's Divertimento or Stravinsky's Dumbarton Oaks Cto. in presenting new harmonies wrapped inside familiar forms. The utter calm of Takemitsu's Nostalghia features Hope in a seamless cantilena that must appeal to Hope's minimalist tastes.Hope is a special musician who stands out in the current landscape for his adventurousness and serious purpose. This is his most serious album, but that shouldn't deter you from experiencing what a modernist virtuoso like him - and Gidon Kremer, another strong Schnitke advocate -  is all about.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VJQZYX6QFF2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000IFQM#wasThisHelpful","R2VJQZYX6QFF2K","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"the Other Valery has put Valery Polyansky in the shade, but he deserves to be considered a major Shostakovich conductor. That's brilliantly evident in this superb pairing of the two Shostakovich Cello Concertos. Dating from 1959 and 1966, they are both post-Stalinist, but despite the fact that he survived the horrific tyrant, Shostakovich was susceptible to the exhaustion and depression that often accompany survival. The First Cto. is by far the more popular work; the Second has a larger orchestra and more fascinating colors, but without memorable themes and a prevailing mood of despair, it's a hard listen.What I love about this recording is that Polyansky and his excellent soloist, Alexander Ivashkin, work together to evoke other dimensions besides angst and exhaustion. this is vibrant music-making, allowing us to feel the soulfulness in both scores, but also flashes of exuberance and defiance. compared to the new, highly praised release by Truls Mork and Vasily Petrenko, who focus almost solely on bleakness, this one is far more moving in his expanded humanity.I treasure Rostropovich's classic accounts, especially an unruly live account under Tozhdestvensky on GGC Legends, and I'll keep the recordings of Mischa Maisky and Peter Wispelwey, who give big readings in the Rostroopovich tradition, but for me this reissue of the original 1997 release brings a new standard to both works. It's so imaginative and recorded in such superb sound that I can't imagine any lover of these two scores passing it up.  For those who like me are unfamiliar with Ivashkin, who emigrated from Russia to the UK and died this past January at the age of 65, he was a polymath of an extraordinary sort, the writer of twenty books, a conductor, and besides the cello, he ""also played electric cello, viola da gamba, sitar and piano,"" according to his Wikipedia entry. He's certainly remarkable here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3682W8CAK4L8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CLHMIY6#wasThisHelpful","R3682W8CAK4L8S","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I regret reading in a previous review that Truls Mork was afflicted with a neurological condition that threatened his career, so it's unfortunate to report that his tone in this recording is rather thin and wiry, a considerable loss from the rich tone of Rostropovich, who set the template for both Shostakovich cello concertos.  There's a shrill, shallow quality to the music-making in general in the first movement, taken in too much of a hurry. The second movement begins to capture the soulful quality that permeates the score, and here one can appreciate Mork's maturity - he's in his early fifties -  which reveals itself in posed phrasing and shaded dynamics. Petrenko keeps the line moving; melancholy doesn't sink into gloom.Like the Shostakovich Violin Cto., where the solo Passacaglia serves as a long soliloquy, the Candenza is this concerto demands deeply felt eloquence.  I don't think the thematic material is as compelling or memorable as in the Violin Cto., but rostropovich's personality was riveting.  I felt unmoved by Mork in this long (6 min.) solo, where he evoked loneliness but not much richness or soulfulness.  The finale is sharply angled under Petrenko, and here the cellist's wiry tone fit the biting tone of frenetic woodwinds. It's probably the most successful movement in this performance. I wish the whole experience contained more exuberance, not simply high energy.Although seven years isn't a long span, between 1959 and 1966, when Shostakovich wrote the Cello Cto. no. 2, again dedicated to Rostropovich, the idiom was sparer, gloomy, enigmatic, and angst-ridden. No surprise, this change has made the second work much less popular than the first.  Mork's lonely, inward style suits the score. In the concert hall the large orchestra and Shostakovich's varied colors create  a focus of interest that equals, or even goes beyond, the solo part. Petrenko has space to express his considerable gifts as a Shostakovich conductor. Still, it's one-dimensional to reduce the score to such lean bleakness. Tragedy is a robust medium, not an anemic one, and for all the virtues that other reviewers hear in this new Cd, I found it less than satisfying.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F4SFPLVYTBN7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOCRG4E#wasThisHelpful","R3F4SFPLVYTBN7","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For reasons unknown to me, the Philharmonia is the only major London orchestra to deny itself an in-house label. That function has been taken over by Signum, and to date a fairly sizable catalog has been built up featuring the Philharmonia's two most recent music directors, Dohnanyi and Salonen, along with mostly British guest conductors. Here we get the second installment in a live Mahaler cycle under Maazel, taped on concert in 2011.Maazel figures on the scene as en elder statesman, and his baton technique is legendary. So on the plus side, besides the exquisite playing of the orchestra, which is the most elegant in London, and the excellent recorded sound, admirable in its clarity and detail, we get Maazel's years of experience. Unfortunately, the passage of time hasn't eradicated his perverse streak. Why he of all maestros should have recorded three complete Mahler cycles - with the Vienna Phil. on Sony, with the NY Phil. on their download site, and ow this one - must leave the gods laughing.The straightest of these cycles is the one form New York, but it feels impersonal and proficient. This new one exhibits more passion, if that's the right word for Maazel's often strange emphases and tempo hiccups. Impersonality isn't entirely absent - I wasn't remotely moved by the heartbreaking Andante of the Sixth Sym., hurried along in dry-eyed fashion. The opening movement of the Fifth has vulgar touches and coarseness of expression. The straightest reading is the Fourth, but it feels impatient in the first movement and dawdles in the finale.I cannot pretend to admire Maazel as a Mahlerian, and the reviews at the time were both positive and head-scratching. If the virtues of the Philharmonia will give you enough pleasure to stomach Maazel's hijinks, this mid-priced set gives much to wonder at.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U7QL3GYKMJ5N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGRL1TM#wasThisHelpful","R2U7QL3GYKMJ5N","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This enormous box set of 15 Strauss operas can be bought for around $3 a disc, which undeniably makes it a steal. Devotees of Strauss's operatic style don't settle for only one performance of their favorite score; therefore, unless you are a completist, your interest will turn to how good these recordings are. They derive almost entirely from Universal's two labels, DG and Decca, that have exceptionally strong vocal histories.  There is little competition among the true rarities, such as Guntram and Feuersnot, and after decades of listening, I can't claim acquaintance with late-Strauss works like Die Ägyptische Helena and Die Liebe der Danae.But for the major works, there is only good news.  Many collectors would give the highest ratings to Solti's contributions here: Elektra, Rosenkavalier, and Frau ohne Schatten. The first two were originally issued in harsh ADRM digital versions, but Decca eventually atoned  by releasing excellent remasterings. Tastes differ, naturally, but I'd rank Sinopoli's two operas - Salmoe with Cheryl Studer and Ariadne auf Naxos with Deborah Voigt, as potential first choices in the modern era. these five operas are repertory staples, and the versions here would cost as much individually as the entire box set.Also first rate is Bohm's classic Daphne with Gueden, Wunderlich, and King - it has attained the status of a classic and remains, fifty years on, as most critics' top recommendation.  The Four Last songs, with additional orchestral songs as fillers, finds Jessye Norman in glorious voice, although I find Masur's conducting quite ordinary.  Lisa Della Casa owned the role of Arabella, and I think the compilers made the right choice in picking her live 1963 account under Keilberth with Fischer-Dieskau over the later Solti one.  The all-star Capriccio with Gundula Janowitz under Karl Bohm is also impeccable, rivaled only by Schwarzkopf's set on EMI - indeed, Schwarzkopf stars in two serious rivals for Rosenkavalier, Ariadne, the Four Last Songs, and for me, almost any note of Strauss she ever sang.The remaining recordings take me into no man's land. I've heard Sinopoli's Friedestag, and although it left little impression, it is generally considered the best modern choice. Everything else in this box set can only be accepted on faith, with the understanding that there are so few rivals that even a second-rate performance is probably a standout. Richard Strauss had an illustrious career, and if any of his operas has fallen away, there's usually a good reason. Late Strauss in particular can seem pointlessly garrulous and aimless.All told, there is such fine singing and conducting on these recordings that Universal has performed a selfless act to bundle it together at pennies on the dollar.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39YNVRL6AFN7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G4PV0H2#wasThisHelpful","R39YNVRL6AFN7M","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: On my computer Amazon is listing the CD format of this recording under another, mistaken heading, so I've transferred my review to the download version.The Saito Kinen is almost exclusively known to me under their founder, Seiji Ozawa, most recently in a box set commemorating the conductor's 75th birthday. Here the orchestra takes its first steps without Papa (Ozawa was still recuperating from cancer treatment), being led by the jack-of-all-trades British conductor Daniel Harding. Harding was a prodigy of the podium in his teens and became the protege of Simon Rattle, who had a similarly precocious start. Today Harding is young at 38, and to call him a jack of all trades is actually a compliment, since he is regularly invited to appear with all the eminent orchestras of Europe and America. His record of leading Richard Strauss isn't known to me, although I see a DVD of Ariadne auf Naxos from the Vienna State Opera (he recorded the Mahler Tenth with the Vienna Phil. on DG).Decca has given this live alpine Sym. state-of-the-art sound, in keeping with their traditions - they did the same for Herbert Blomstadt's thrilling account with the San Francisco Sym. As exciting as that CD remains, the Kaito Sinen ranks a notch higher, perhaps, on the international scale. as the PR blurb notes, the orchestra ""boasts the best Japanese players from the leading orchestras of Europe and North America as well as selected wind and brass principals from Berlin, Vienna, Philadelphia and Boston among others."" It shows.there are half a dozen excellent recordings of this showpiece vying for first place, ranging from Karajan anMehta with the Berliners to Haitink with both the Concertgebouw and LSO. Welser-Most, Wit, and Thirelemann are in the running, and if Vienna is your favorite orchestra for Strauss, they've recorded it Previn as well as Thielemann, both in thrilling sound. Harding keeps up with this cadre of excellence, and it may be that the sonics here are now a first choice. His interpretation is impeccable, lacking only the extraordinary sweep and authority of the Karajan, which was originally released in edgy, harsh early-digital sound but received a good remastering in the Karajan Gold series. For sheer exuberance I might put Fruhbeck de Burogs and Blomstedt a hair ahead, but their readings lack any subtle touches of phrasing that Harding does so beautifully here.As you can tell, the Alpine Symphony is a pet of mine, and I'm happy to welcome another exhilarating ride.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HPWVZIBHXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IJZP06W#wasThisHelpful","R3HPWVZIBHXS","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With almost equal weight the revolution in Bach performance occurred in Vienna under Nikolaus Harnoncourt and in England with various groups, prominently the Academy of Ancient Music, which according to the product blurb has amassed 300 recordings in its four decades on disc.  This fortieth anniversary St. John Passion represents the state of the art, more or less. Some achievements are undeniable. The instrumental playing is perfectly in tune, the ensemble expert, the singers well versed in neo-Baroque vocal style. Of course genuine Baroque style has been heard by no one living, so what is now dubbed ""authentic"" should more accurately be called ""scholarly.""Scholars aren't known for leading musical revolutions, yet they certainly did in this case. Audiences now accept small instrumental groups, light voices, literal readings of the score, and, to my ears, a thoroughly antiseptic lack of expression in the performance of Bach, even though he was fervently religious and at times tragic in his writing. No one can assess if mini-Bach is the ""correct"" style, only that the musicologists have prevailed. As for authenticity, that clearly has not been achieved, since no two recordings of Bach's major choral works sounds consistent; each conductor simply invents the tempos, dynamics, phrasing, and level of expression he favors.In the case of Richard Egarr's choices, they are a mixed bag. No surprise, most of his tempos are quick, and as is the rule, nothing sounds reverent or passionate.  Yet the famous opening chorus, Herr Unser Herrscher, is taken ludicrously fast even by HIPpity standards.  The Evangelist, a boyish-sounding James Gilchrist, doesn't rival the best in this role, his primary fault, besides a thin tenor voice, is that he skips over the tragedy of the Passion story, goaded by Egarr's jack-rabbit speeds and refusal to vary the pace with rubato. The Jesus of Matthew Rose sounds rather lugubrious to me. The women soloists are better, and one is impressed that they can deliver the music at such breathless Allegros.Bach left a great deal of room for interpretative freedom, relying on the general understanding of Baroque style at the time. Modern musicians fill in the blanks using taste, musical instinct, and talent. I find that Egarr so totally misunderstands the St. John Passion, mistaking a heart-wrenching tragedy for a summer picnic, that the result, however skillful, is a travesty more often than not.James Gilchrist (Evangelist), Matthew Rose (Jesus), Ashley Riches (Pilatus), Elizabeth Watts (soprano), Sarah Connolly (alto), Andrew Kennedy (tenor), Christopher Purves (bass)Academy of Ancient Music, Richard Egarr","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1856ZWEAQGSYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00II7Y5YO#wasThisHelpful","R1856ZWEAQGSYM","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is Part Two of ""John Adams does the Bible,"" the first installment being his Nativity oratorio, El Nino. Here the angle is liberaiton theology from south America, which directed the Church's ministry toward social justice and poverty. After a period of suppression under two conservative Popes, liberation theology has gotten a boost form the highly popular new Pope, who of course comes from South America and personally embodies a connection with the mass of humble Catholics in the region. Adams, on the other hand, is an immensely clever Harvard-educated composer whose career is a model of elitist success.This doesn't disqualify him from writing a heartfelt feminist passion, any more than Bernstein's Jewishness disqualified him from writing Mass, a multimedia extravaganza that serves as the obvious predecessor of The Gospel According to the Other Mary. Mass was a disaster at its premiere, while Adams's Gospel - backed up by the popular success of Golijov's mass-makret, Spanish-language Passion According to St. Mark - fits more smoothly into the groove of fairly innocuous political correctness. The music is just as accessible as Golijov's and on the whole less powerful and passionate.In short, a whiff of opportunism hangs over this Gospel. In his opera Doctor Atomic contemporary poetry and a sonnet of John Donne's was inserted into the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer at the Manhattan Project, and the tactic is repeated her, with feminist poetry, largely Latino, interspersed with a New Testament narrative delivered by two countertenors.  It's an effective device, no doubt more so when the audience gets dancers and a light show to go along with the score. I imagine The Gospel According to the Other Mary will achieve its full stature only when a DVD of Peter Sellars' complete future staging is achieved. Bernstein's Mass is quite effective when staged, in part because clumsy, vulgar, or overwrought musical passages get softened.I found Golijov's Passion vulgar in the extreme, which puts me in a decided minority. It's been a huge hit with concert audiences, creating the air of a raucous salsa party to ameliorate the churchiness of the Biblical text, which in any case was so thoroughly turned into music by Bach that few composers in the succeeding four centuries returned to it. If The Da Vinci code hadn't canonized Mary Magdalene, turning her into a feminist icon, I doubt that Adams would have given a fig for the Passion of Christ, his output being notably devoid of religious music. Promoting the Magdalene on the basis of a tiny handful of New Testament verses, and conflating her with the woman taken in adultery, for which there is no valid reference, is pure pop culture putting on its serious face.I've offered a preface that some readers will find splenetic, and I admit to some jealousy that Adams has been so overpraised for works that seem to me derivative of Philip Glass ad on their own merits glib. But the irony is that The Gospel According to Mary is actually the most effective musical drama I've heard from him, possibly including Nixon in China. The vocal writing is varied and emotional. There is almost no motorized minimalism of the windup toy type. Not having a printed text - my copy is a download - I can't really make out the singers' enunciation of the poetry. Although she has a powerful voice, lead singer Kelley O'Connor turns English into a soft mush. For the first time Adams also shows a care for melody, far more so than in Doctor Atomic, which presented long stretches of the most boring vocal writing I've heard form him, relieved by one number, Oppenheimer's aria set to Donne's verse.He's still guilty of a reluctance to edit himself. Too much music, especially the Biblical recitatives, is spun out by rote, which of course comes habitually when your idiom is founded on the deliberate repetitiveness of minimalism. Is the boredom intentional or not? I doubt that the question has a credible answer, but thanks to Adams's unusually adept orchestration, even his repetitions sound colorful. Unlike either Nixon or Atomic, this score creates a real atmosphere of shifting moods, which is a major reason for it working so well on CD, without visuals. (It's also much less challenging harmonically than Atomic.)Dudamel conducts with complete dramatic conviction, and both orchestra and chorus are in great form. I can't say that I found the soloists as magnetic as the local reviewers did, but perhaps that's asking too much.  Making a splash is only the first step in the survival of a score, and only time will tell, but this one sounds like a keeper.  The only thing that is likely to work against it is extreme length and a certain sameness that for some will turn to monotony in the second hour.  The fact that it doesn't seem religious in any conventional sense probably won't matter to many listeners.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QBUC5NUBB7UR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HGFILU8#wasThisHelpful","R1QBUC5NUBB7UR","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was so impressed by countertenor Iestyn Davies' portrayal of Oberon in Britten's Midsummer Night's Dream that I would eagerly have attended this recital at Wigmore Hall in February 2013. I rarely listen to the repertoire that Davies' voice is meant for (you can't love everything), but he has excellent technique and affecting musicality. This particular program is almost entirely devoted to English songs, and the accompaniments are engaging, since they employ a full complement of instruments, not just a keyboard. Vocal numbers are mixed with dances for instruments alone. There's a festive air abut the proceedings. The main body of songs are by Purcell, who of course wrote dozens of great songs that combine text and melody with touching felicity.My only criticism comes in works I know well, such as Come Ye Songs of Art (I first heard the countertenor version by Alfred Deller and his son Mark) where Davies somewhat shorts the joy and emotional exuberance that make the music soar.  Yet in ""If music be the food of love,"" he's sensitive and touching. For whatever technical reasons that are beyond me, countertenors can duplicate the range of a woman's voice but, for me at least, rarely evoke the same depth of feeling.

"This, the third go-round with the Mahler Second by financier Gilbert Kaplan, is promoted as a public service. Kaplan and an assitant have reduced Mahler's orchestration so that it can be played, they say, by chamber, community, and regional orchestras.  Was there actually such a need? Perhaps so. Kaplan's career as an obsessive devotee of this one Mahler work began as a human interest story: a music lover with enough money to hire a world-class orchestra, got to fulfill his fantasy of waving a baton like a real conductor. Nothing succeeds like success, and although he isn't taken seriously by professional musicians (two years ago the NY Phil. complained to management about having to play under Kaplan), his first recording became the best-selling Mahler album of all time, according to the blurb for this one, amassing sales of 200,00 copies.To date he has ""been invited"" by more than 65 orchestras to conduct the Mahler Second, of which a certain proportion must not have asked him to pay his own way. Such arrangements aren't discussed.  As for this performance, it's reasonable enough on its own terms. The chamber orchestration doesn't sound preposterously thin most of the time; Kaplan is better than a stick waver who's just trying to get through the score; and the Viennese forces play quite well. The recorded sound is excellent. But even if you choose to buy his account over all the great ones on disc, from Bruno Walter and Bernstein to Tennstedt and Jurowski, it seems like carrying coals to Newcastle.  There's no advance over Kaplan's previous two outings.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O9BWPZK0UJRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HI9IKYE#wasThisHelpful","R3O9BWPZK0UJRZ","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the past few decades the role of Isolde has been sung by any number sopranos without a true ""Isolde voice,"" but the excellent Strauss soprano Anne Schwanewilms sings parts in the range of Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, which makes me wonder if her foray into Wagner owes a great deal to the microphone. Lyric sopranos can get away with singing Elisabeth in Tannhauser, and Schwanewilms gives a gleaming account of the Greetings aria, where her alluring, bright tone works very well. Next comes the Wessendonck Lieder, which hardly any sopranos sing - it fits naturally into the range of mezzos and altos - but I guess that's what transpositions are for.These are deeply romantic songs that dwell on inner rapture and melancholy, a span of emotions that is familiar to anyone who sings Strauss. But it's possible to be successful in Strauss's songs almost purely on the basis of a beautiful voice, which Schwanewilms leans on a little too much here. She skates over the surface here; to hear the difference, one only has to turn to Jonas Kaufmann's recent recording, a much more moving account (its unusual feature being that these are almost always a woman's songs). There's little inward quality from Schwanewilms, I'm afraid.As for the Liebestod from Tristan, it's out-of-body music that a light, floating voice might encompass, even if the whole role would prove totally unsingable. By this point it's no surprise that Schanewilms sings it like Strauss, soaring effectively but not, for me at least, conveying the character's transcendence. Needless to say, the orchestra is held back to accommodate her. Throughout the program conductor Cornelius Meister is workaday, as is the Vienna Radio SO. When they play on their own in the Tannhauser Over. and the Prelude to Act I of Tristan, the results are forgettable.I'm a fan of this singer and buy almost all her albums, but this is one to pass up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R224ANUKZ8JZXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFEBXXW#wasThisHelpful","R224ANUKZ8JZXY","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even conductors can think of a masterpiece as a warhorse, and under that influence, they don't go out of their way to rediscover why a score became a masterpiece in the first place. Here Mariss Jansons breaks a long tradition of indifference toward the Symphonie fantastique. Every measure of the work is refreshed, listened to for every implied gasp, lurch, and fever dream of its hallucinating hero. The music is invested with liberal doses of Romantic spontaneity, finding intensity where other conductors find blah. In a word, Jansons is channeling his inner Charles Munch.The conductor's intent is revealed early in the fist movement, where Berlioz's rhythmic irregularities crowd in. Jansons accentuates the agogic pace and underlines the eerie orchestration. These two tendencies are extended into all five movements - one notices that even the straightforward waltz in Un bal seems ghostly and strange. More striking still is the pastoral Scene aux champs, where no one before Jansons, not even Munch, has found a way to inject an air of strangeness - after all, the whole score is meant to be terrifying and surreal. It's eye-opening to hear the shepherds' serenade turn into shrieks. The cause is helped by the conductor's urgent pacing; too often this movement has been slowed to a trudge.The really disturbing music belongs to the last two movements, of course, which depict a ride to the scaffold and a witches' black Sabbath. Since even the most staid conductors put on their Halloween masks for this music, it's hard to out-Herod Herod. Jansons doesn't try. He relies on exact ensemble to bring out the music's color, abetted by remarkably good sonics, the kind we've become used to from BR Klassik's concert recordings, surely the best on the market. The Bavarian Radio SO makes such a golden noise that the usual Grand Guignol isn't missed. Much the same can be said of the finale, but it's here that Jansons seems a bit foursquare compared to Munch's wild rise. there's not much else to criticize about this vivid reading. (Purists may object at the lack of repeats in movements one and four.)It was a stroke of programming genius to fill the CD out with Varese's Ionisation, scored for a huge variety of percussion plus ""high and low sirens,"" since like Berlioz he dreamt up his own fantastic sound world a century later. Purely as sound, the piece is eeriness piled on eeriness, and the result is deliciously unearthly, especially in this crystal-clear performance. In all, this CD is a total success, and after a similarly triumphant War Requiem from him, I'm beginning to reassess Jansons as a potentially great conductor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REYDIL3RUUX4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HPZZOIQ#wasThisHelpful","REYDIL3RUUX4E","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"New versions of Orff's enduring favorite appear at regular intervals, but as popular as Carmina Burana remains, few newcomers come close to venerable classic recordings under Eugen Jochum (DG) and Fruhbeck de Burgos (EMI), with a raft of other golden oldies (Stokowski, Ormandy, Previn) filling in the legacy. The score was never recorded (or taken seriously?) by the great lights of Solti, Karajan, and Bernstein, however. No matter, there's always another step to take in improved sound, since Carmina Burana has always served a double function as sonic blockbuster.This live account from Royal Festival Hall in April, 2013, doesn't aim for the gallery. In many ways it's a subtle, even strained performance, with especially clear singing from the excellent and apparently smallish chorus. They are among the best I can recall in this work, as is the demure children's chorus. As for the three soloists, they aren't starry by comparison with Fischer-Dieskau, Gerhard Stolze, and Gundula Janowitz for Jochum. No better trio has emerged in over fifty years. The solo singers here join in conductor Hans Graf's generally unexaggerated approach, but at a cost. Only a few of the characters really come to life with any vividness.There's not much galloping excitement, for example, in baritone Rodion Pogossov's rousing tavern song, Estuans interius, although I like his edgy Slavic timbre. The tenor is called upon to soar high in his range portraying the piteous swan as it's being roasted, and Andrew Kennedy does quite well, singing in tune with comic plaintiveness. He comes close to the grotesqueries of legendary Stolze in this song. The light lyric soprano of Sarah Tynan sounds pure and fresh in her four songs, and the high tessitura of Dulcissime doesn't remotely throw her off. But there's not much room made for characterization.I don't mean to damn with faint praise. The palm will always go to bold, garish recordings of a work painted in Technicolor. Still, it's appealing to hear an entry that focuses on the simple beauty of Orff's score, which this one does very nicely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38E557EONK2V4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3STS68#wasThisHelpful","R38E557EONK2V4","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By 1993 when this live gala was held, Claudio Abbado was probably past his probation period - although for some Berliners this never happened. He was still ""no Karajan"" but had definitely loosened up the right discipline of the Philharmonic in a positive sense, giving the players more individual leeway for expression. New musicians were entering the ranks, younger, with more women and non-Germans. He moved the orchestra's native repertoire toward Mahler while remaining strong in Bruckner, one of Karajn's best composers.This brief sketch permits us to see that Abbado was still on shaky ground with one particular composer, Wagner, who stood at the summit of Furtwangler and Karajan's repertoire.  He hadn't conducted a Wagner opera when DG gave him Lohengrin (1995)  - a real success as it turned out - and here he has at hand three eminent Wagnerian singers in Studer, Meier, Terfel, and Jerusalem. The result repeats the ""he's no Karajan"" theme with some justification. The opening Tannhauser Over. is delicate and a bit underpowered, far from the show of force one expects from the Berliners. I don't find it very convincing.When the vocalists appear, Abbado is more in his element - he was, after all, the music director of La Scala - and even though the accompaniments are just a touch recessive,  his singers are well supported.  Studer, Meier, and Jerusalem starred in Abbado's Lohengrin and are fie here, although her brief period in best voice was in sight and the Tannhauser aria a bit tremulous. Meier repeats as a superlative Ortrud in the Act I scene with Elsa, really singing the part withno yowling of the kind that's become common in the part - only Christa Ludwig among modern Ortruds sings at this level.The men aren't able to duplicate the thrills of Meier's singing, although Terfel, as you'd expect, if warmly authoritative in Wolfram's  Ode to the Evening Star and Sach's Lindenduft monologue.  Jerusalem appears only in the concluding duet from Act I of Walkure, from Wintersturme onward.  In his prime I thought Jerusalem didn't have enough voice for Siegmund and just enough for Lohengrin, but today only Kaufmann really surpasses him. Meier sings Sieglinde in her dramatic soprano mode and is again spectcular; Abbado too is fired up by the end.Two other orchestral excerpts, the Act I Prelude to Meistersinger and the Ride of the Valkries. Both are skillfully done,but if one turns to the program of Wagner excerpts done by Tennstedt and the London Phil. on the orchestra's house label, a wide gap opens up between this and Tennstedt's total involvement.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XCU88QX7H9RK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001GLJ#wasThisHelpful","R1XCU88QX7H9RK","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After its devastating history in the last half of the twentieth century, I hope Dresden has become a happier place. It was an optimistic sign when Thielemann introduced New Year's celebrations in 2010, scoring a big success by deviating form the Strauss family template and substituting the music of Lehar instead. Here for the third installment he switches to the lesser known Hungarian-Viennese operetta composer Emmerich Kalman (1882-1953), who arrived late on the scene to catch the golden age of operetta and is now unknown to the general public except for occasional revivals of his best work, Countess Maritza. There's more than enough delightful music form him to fill a bubbly New Year's program.In the past tenor Piotr Becxala and diana Damrau had been starry attractions, but on this occasion Damrau cancelled at the last minute, replaced by the experienced bu uncharismatic Ingeborg Schopf, leaving Becxala to carry the day vocally. His limpid lyric tenor is naturally beautiful, and even though he lacks the extra dimension brought to operetta by Fritz Wunderlich, Beczala sts the gold standard for today, and the audience loves his five solo numbers. The Staatskapelle Dresden is no doubt the most luxurious-sounding orchestra to take up Kalman. They are a delight to hear, if only Thielemann could have added an extra spark and more smiles here and there. No matter. This CD is a lovely addition to the tradition to the usual fare of Strauss.Here's the complete program.Kalman:Gräfin Mariza: OvertureHöre ich Zigeunergeigen (from Gräfin Mariza)Einmal möcht' ich wieder tanze (from Gräfin Mariza)Die Bajadere: IntermezzoHeia, in den Bergen from Die CsárdásfürstinWeisst du es noch (from Die Csárdásfürstin)Zwei Märchenaugen (from Die Zirkusprinzessin)Kaiserin Josephine: Ballett & EnsembleMein Traum, mein Traum (from Kaiserin Josephine)Wenn es Abendd ...

"Teldec got more mileage from their high-profile Bruckner cycle with Barenboim and the Berlin Phil., but hose performances sound ponderous and corporate beside the cycle under Inbal with his Frankfurt Radio SO.  A case in point is this vigorous Sym. 1 form 1987, using the ""Linz edition,"" which isn't significantly different from the ""Vienna edition.""  What's more important is that Inbal approaches the score as raw, exciting, and ready to be manhandled.  He may make the piece sound too rough for some, but far better that than to polish the surface, which exposes the various weaknesses and downturns in an inconsistent early work.The overall timing gives a fair idea of how energized this reading feels: 48 min. compared to 49 min. for Simone Young's excellent version from Hamburg and Karajan's 51 min. in his Berlin cycle on DG.  I especially like the variety of moods Inbal finds in the opening movement and his gravity in the adagio, which manages to remain lyrical and never somber - from the very beginning Bruckner's slow movements were a great strength, and his touch never left him.  Inbal attacks the opening of the Scherzo with a touch of ferocity and keeps the strong momentum going. The brass playing is somewhat rackety, and the bright, clear sound stings a little at loud climaxes, though. The finale is played for rough majesty, as you might say the whole symphony is.This is a dark horse in a race that has seen highly praised Bruckner Firsts from Jochum and Abbado, along with the more recent Young recording.  I consider it a find, along with an equally vibrant Bruckner Second.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BXFTHXBOLQPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E8PU#wasThisHelpful","R3BXFTHXBOLQPG","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When they headed the London Phil., both Solti and Haitink recorded the two Elgar symphonies, but Haitink explored a range of English music beyond that. As popular as Britten, Vaughan Williams, and Elgar are with audiences, I've always been mystified by their neglect at the hands of international conductors of the first rank. On this collection from the late 70s and early 80s the only international hit is the Enigma Var., and the Britten-Auden song cycle, Our Hunting Fathers, is basically unknown outside Britain - even there it's considered something of an oddity.Haitink is criticized for being too placid, but the program opens with a live Elgar  Introduction and Allegro that's lively and beautifully articulated. It could easily serve as a first choice, because the sound is better than on the sainted EMi recording under Barbirolli, and the reading itself is lighter and more lively. This is one of the masterpieces for string orchestra and deserves to be played everywhere.  The same light touch is used in the Enigma Var., which may catch some listeners off guard if they're used to Elgar as iconic Edwardian imperialist. The playing is accomplished (no doubt many LPO musicians were veterans of the Boult era), but I don't hear much emotional involvement on the conductor's part except in fits and starts. ""Nimrod"" brings no tears. The big moments are satisfying, to be fair. The great Decca recording under Monteux remains my favorite Enigma.Our Hunting Fathers is marked Op. 8, but Britten called it his true Opus 1. As a boy he'd gotten into trouble at school for writing an essay against hunting, and he returns to the theme here. To quote some online notes, he depicts ""animals' interactions with humans as pests, pets, accomplices, and prey: An anonymous ancient exorcism against rats, a mocking lament for a rich spoiled woman crying over her sick monkey, and a ""Dance of Death"" wherein a huntsman calls to his pack of dogs and falcons to urge them to capture their prey."" Auden helped the composer choose texts but himself only wrote some lines at the beginning and end.the five songs were written with a soprano in mind - later on, Britten's partner Peter Pears adopted it for tenor - and it's hard to imagine anyone giving a more sympathetic reading than the great Heather Harper, who  belonged to Britten's charmed inner circle of favored performers.  The vocal line isn't as high and demanding as in Les Illuminations, yet it is often quite emotional and dramatic, with moods varying form declamatory to satiric. Haitink throws himself into the orchestral effects, which are precocious from the young Britten. I almost want to say that you can ignore the words if they feel too preachy; there can't be many people who would reject the songs out of allegiance to their hunting fathers nowadays.In short, this CD contains two outstanding performances and one good one - it's well worth a listen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13UH93M4C0VZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00095L8XY#wasThisHelpful","R13UH93M4C0VZV","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Philharmonic has led the way among American orchestras in offering their entire season in download format, with amazingly good sound considering how deficit Avery Fisher Hall is in that department.  Here from Nov. 2013 is one of the stronger programs I've come across, combining two popular Strauss tone poems, don Juan and Zarathustra, with Christopher Rouse's Oboe Cto. (2004), a showpiece for the orchestra's principal oboist, Liang Wang, just as Rouse's Pulitzer Prize-winning Trombone Cto. did for their first-chair trombonist.Rouse divides his ten concerti - a big number - into somber and genial, with the oboe one being the latter.  As the notes inform us, the piece begins with a five-note chord in the strings that supplies the root for later melodies and harmonies (not that the casual listener could possibly guess, or even gain much after being told). More helpful is to know that the concerto's moods shift from dreamy to sensuous to colorful, Rouse says, alternating lyrical material with virtuoso passages. Rouse has established himself as something along the lines of an established British composer who knows how to remain modernist while fitting nicely into audience expectations. That's true here - the music skips along agreeably (I almost said clucks along - the oboe has a hard time escaping its birdlike timbre) with glittering percussion in the background, only to shift to other textures, perhaps a snippet of a tune with the harp as partner. Rouse is nothing if not facile, and it's good to meet a work that has a chance to possibly enter the repertoire. there hasn't been a successful oboe concerto since Strauss's, seven decades ago.On to the red meat, the two Strauss scores.  Don Juan is given a polished reading with impressive playing - the NY Phil.could be the least acknowledged of the world's great orchestras, I think -  but as so often with Alan Gilbert, his ability to extract great execution isn't matched by any passion. Don Juan is the splashiest music imaginable, and its'a shame when it doesn't swagger. As for Zarathustra, it's the same story. As a sequence of beautiful sounds, it's unimpeachable, but not much happens beyond that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30Y9Z7LA2XN00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I2Q4ZGO#wasThisHelpful","R30Y9Z7LA2XN00","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gergiev took young super flash pianist Daniil Trifonov under his wing for a stunning Tchaikovsky Cto. no. 1, and now hard on its heels comes another version with the conductor's favorite long-term keyboard partner, Denis Matsuev. He was the only pianist featured in the international broadcast of the opening of the new Mariinsky 2 concert hall. To say that a new recording of the Tchaikovsky First isn't needed doesn't suffice - there will always be an expanding shelf of new versions. Even if you own the Trifonov, it takes nothing away from this dazzling performance from an artist sixteen years more mature than Trifonov and gifted with exceptional powers of technical dazzlement and musicality - this is a commanding but never bombastic reading filled with lovely touches from both conductor and pianist. Nothing is routine; everything speaks with complete authority.It's true here, as with the Trifonov version, that the concerto is played as real music, not a warhorse to be banged through.  Critics have accused Matsuev of banging, but on the two occasions I heard him - and on this recording - he exhibits incredible power that brings the piano to its limit of loudness but doesn't cross over into banging.  There's a natural rise and fall throughout, adding variety and interest, all of it captured in excellent sonics for both orchestra and piano.  I'm especially happy that Matsuev doesn't fuss with the syncopation in the finale but turns it into an exciting rush. Horowitz in his prime was capable of tearing the roof off with the double octaves that cap the orchestra's slow, suspenseful buildup at the end of the finale, and Matsuev comes very close, in far better sound. It's altogether an astonishing performance that one could easily name as first choice in the modern era.As for the Second Piano Cto., I haven't heard a first-rate performance since the old Gilels with Maazel on EM (done with the cuts inserted by Siloti, not the complete score)I; there's an exciting Pletnev reading on Virgin that is unfortunately caught in tubby, blurry sound. So I had high hopes for Matsuev, who performs Tchaikovsky's revised version at full length (43 min.) - and he delivers beyond expectations. The piano part is filled with difficulties that Matsuev showcases in bravura fashion, while Gergiev keeps pace with an accompaniment that is far and away the best I've ever  heard. It's headlong and heroic in the fast outer movements, sensitive and engrossing in the slow movement, which has stretches that are almost a triple concerto thanks to  extended violin and cello solos.As much as purist have given the Siloti edition a bad name, the truth is that the old cuts were justified if you feel, as I do, that the material is stretched thin in spots. But that's a small matter when you hear a performance that sets a new standard on disc (besides being the first SACD recording of the Second Cto.).  I know that many listeners shrug off Gergiev's flood of recordings, but this one is a must-listen, for his contribution as much as Matsuev's.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3XVHVS90YFT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFTSRJK#wasThisHelpful","R3XVHVS90YFT7","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ABQ owed their pre-eminence to many qualities, but one of the most prominent was the power of their sound. They played with an intensity that astonished even the world-class soloists like cellist Heinrich Schiff when they joined in.  Not often was this power misplaced, but I think it is here. For decades the automatic recommendation for the frequently paired Debussy and Ravel quartets was the Quartetto Italiano on Philips, admired for the elegance of their delivery and sweetness of tone. To love that recording, or the fine French ones that have more recently appeared, is to be confronted here by the diametric opposite.These readings are about precision and detail, with almost no quarter given to charm. The finale of the Ravel sounds as if Bartok stepped in to make revisions.  The famed perfection of ensemble that was a trademark of the ABQ is everywhere in evidence, as is warmth of tone and individual virtuosity - no modern quartet, and perhaps none in the history of recordings, has been made up of four players who could easily have enjoyed solo careers. If you are a true devotee, the intensity and seriousness exhibited here won't seem misplaced, but I am almost a die-hard fan, and this recording, along with their Schubert C Major Quintet, are two ABQ readings I can hardly sit through.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BQUEPPX13N83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005AVMJ#wasThisHelpful","R2BQUEPPX13N83","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"this remarkably persuasive recording of the three Brahms sonatas was made in 2004, when the Hungarian pianist Tamas Vasary turned 71; it had been a long time since his time as a Chopin pianist for DG. Here he plays the prominent piano part as an equal partner of the violinist, and more. I'd say that his strong, imaginative pianism leads the interpretations, and since he is one of the best musicians I've heard in that role, the recital has a great deal going for it.The violinist Barnabas Kelemen, also Hungarian, was in his mid-twenties when the recording was made, after winning some gold medals at competitions.  His name was unknown to me, and in recent years he has been teaching at the Liszt Conservatory in Budapest, from which he graduated. He's extremely musical and fully capable of joining Vasary in finding more variety and color in these familiar three sonatas than one usually hears - so much so, in fact, that long stretches sound freshly imagined.  As a pairing, Vasary and Kelemen leave some famous recordings in the dust.  Nothing here is overly massaged or fussy - this is strong, direct playing that stands out because the two partners are so deeply involved.Since the recorded sound is very good and both instruments are captured in a natural perspective, there's reason to assert that this could be a first choice among modern recordings; I was engrossed from beginning to end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M7E51YB526GQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001Z3HNQ#wasThisHelpful","R3M7E51YB526GQ","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The rise of the female cellist seems to owe a good deal to baby-doll poses on the cover, which is nothing new to the-violinist-as-babe syndrome. But of course  du Pre and Natalia Gutman represented a striking musical heritage to inspire younger cellists, and they competed on the world stage without come-hither looks. It was du Pre in particular who pioneered a free, even reckless style of playing that lifted the cello into the realms of the glamoursly exciting, something Rostropovich achieved through jaw-dropping technique and exceptional volume, the cello being rather mild on its own, especially in a large hall.I heard Weilerstein in a very large hall - Royal Albert - where her tone was too small to make a strong impression, but here the engineers amplify the instrument so that it's louder than the orchestra; her first entry in the concerto is guns ablazing. I found it distracting even by the amped-up standards we've grown used to.  There's also a drastic mismatch between her fiery, freely phrased interpretation and Jiri Bìlohlavek's accompaniment, which is bland an foursquare. I've rarely heard the long orchestral introduction to the first movement sound so d dull, no matter if he and his musicians are Czech.Happily, Weilerstein is so fiery that the conductor joins in the spirit of her playing for the remainder of the movement.  It's the Czech way to approach Dvorak without the overlay of German heaviness, and this proves a virtue in the slow movement, where the sweet, relaxed sound of the orchestra blends in beautiful ensemble with Weilerstein, whose sensitivity in phrasing slow music is quite engaging; so is the way her phrasing breathes and sings. Like du Pre, she knows how to draw a spectrum of tonal color from the cello, although du Pre was more willing to scrape and scratch if the music demanded it. Weilerstein tends toward the school that permits nothing but beautiful tons. She certainly has them at her command.As if we need more proof that the Cellist is in charge, she ignores Bìlohlavek's moderate tempo at the start of the finale and hurries up the proceedings, a lead he soon follows. This movement is a forward-moving Allegro, but she is eager to take rhythmic liberties, shaping each phrase personally, again like du Pre, and since I would be happy to confine all my cello concerto recordings to du Pre's,  this kind of passion and expressive freedom appeals to me - and to an adoring public, I'd say. there's no denying that Weilerstein brings this thrice-familiar concerto alive, and the performance deserves highest praise. She doesn't deliver a routine note, even if the conductor rarely departs from the routine when he's on his own.the filers for cello and piano find Weilerstein in the company of a sympathetic partner, Anna Polonsky, and the engineers have reduced the cellist's tone to the fairly small, lyric sound she produces. Within this limit she's very expressive; her tendency in a selection of arrangements that are basically songs without words - a genre that Mischa Maisky had great success in - is measured and melodic. that will satisfy anyone who likes soulful cello music. I am more impressed by how she can take Goin' Home (the famous theme from the Largo of Dvorak's ""New World"" Sym.) and phrase it so musically that it holds one's attention from start to finish.In short, a charismatic young talent demonstrates again why she is considered so special.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TYPRUE6J71NG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GWMRSAU#wasThisHelpful","R3TYPRUE6J71NG","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The campaign in favor of Schumann's late works seemed like an act of charity when it began, since the composer's widow and heirs suppressed much of it and even went to court to prevent the Violin Cto. from being premiered. That work has had its partisans over the past few decades, but it was extremely rare to hear Schumann's later chamber music, which was considered evidence of his failing abilities as his mental deterioration advanced - he died in an asylum in 1856 at the age of forty-six from mental afflictions whose cause is still debated (it used to be claimed that Clara Wieck's father so vehemently opposed the marriage to Schumann because of suspected syphilis).  Some critics are harsh about works written as early as 1850, but Tetzlaff belongs to a group of world-class musicians, among them Martha Argerich and the Capucon brothers, who promote very late scores.Tetzlaff won praise and awards for a recording of the three piano trios released in 2011, and my reaction to this new release of the three violin sonatas (composed between 1851 and 1853) is akin to the one I had then. There are beautiful moments, especially in the first two sonatas, but Schumann's estate was right to worry - structure is loose, developments rhapsodic to the point of feeling aimless at times, and the melodies far below Schumann's best.  For me, this music is too simple overall to add to the reputation of a great composer.  At 19 min. and 17 min. respectively, the first and third sonatas perhaps sustain their invention, but the four-movement second sonata is 32 min. long, a length justified mainly by its many peculiarities.The best I can say is that Romanticism saw madness as being next to inspiration - a somewhat cruel view when you consider mental disorders from a medical standpoint -  and the weird and wild opening of Sonata no. 2 could be justified that way.  Argerich and friends are wilder in a live reading from the Lugano Festival on EMI, compared to which Lars Vogt's pianism feels fairly restrained. But he and Tetzlaff are among the elite of current German musicians, and there's no criticism to offer of their performances - for the Gramophone to name this CD the Recording of the Month can't be argued against.The best way to approach late Schumann is to fully absorb yourself into each score, one at a time, and then either accept or reject the musical idiom he wound up with, wildness, looseness, oddness, and feebleness combined.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DXX38634SZJV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EPRJ4A6#wasThisHelpful","R3DXX38634SZJV","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Gramophone anointed this performance of the Bruckner Fourth in a long, pompous review (the sonority of the Vienna Phil. was referred to as ""autochthonous""), but I'm not so sure. One cannot fault the orchestral playing, which is on a par with Karajan's two recordings of the work with the Berlin Phil. The smoothness of tone over a vast dynamic range, without the slightest harshness in the brass, is extraordinary. But Abbado tends to homogenize textures, and the effect is magnified by 1990 recorded sound that is congested at forte and above - on my system it's also dull unless the volume is turned up considerably. In concert the effect of Vienna's golden throat fully open is astonishing; here it's a little caramelized compared to the touches of grit and bite that bring Bruckner alive.Abbado applies suchcare to detail that it tends to put each bar under a microscope at the expense of momentum. This is especially evident in the studied slow movement, but my attention was already wandering halfway through the first movement. Abbado finally lets himself go in the Scherzo, just in time. Bruckner's major symphonies are so expansive that it takes a strong-minded conductor to pull them into shape by force. Klemperer was great at that; so were Karajan, Tennstedt, Furtwangler, and (sometimes) Celibidache. For me, Abbado doesn't belong in that select group, much as I admire his musicianship. My chief reason for keeping this fourth is because the other prominent modern recording with the VPO, under Karl bohm on Decca, doesn't appeal to me as much as to its many admirers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO8G1L81YMHRO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S5K2PS#wasThisHelpful","RO8G1L81YMHRO","A2AIMXT9PLAM12","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AIMXT9PLAM12?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Learn Game Programming with Ruby is a well-written, easy to read book for learning game programming.  It provides fully working code as well as starter files from the book's website.  The code is not always the best structured, but the beauty of software is that you can change it.  Mark Sobkowicz does a really good job explaining the concepts of the various types of games, and the examples do work as advertised.  I found that they were easy to experiment with for further learning.I would not recommend this as the first programming book that you pick up.  I have had experience with Ruby before, and I've been programming in various languages for almost 20 years.  I recommend Programming Ruby ""The Pick Axe Book"" as prerequisite material.  Ruby is not a difficult language to learn, and the Gosu library works as expected without any prior knowledge.I think this is a great place for people with fundamental Ruby knowledge to start their journey in game programming.

"As I’ve gotten more into headphones over the years, I have also come to appreciate what a good amplifier can do to enhance the performance of a good set of headphones.  I recently evaluated the M-Audio Bass Traveler, and I will give you both anecdotal and controlled experiment results to help you in making your purchase decision.I have a Sandisk Sansa Clip+ mp3 player, and it produces decent sound, but it isn’t capable of exercising a good set of headphones like my Klipsch Reference Series X7.  These headphones have a flat response, and I used the Bass Traveler on its flat setting.  Without question, I noticed more detail in my music than I did without them.  One my joys as a music listener is hearing something new in a song that I’ve heard hundreds of times before.For the controlled experiment, I used my MacBook Pro and my Sennheiser HD558 headphones.  These are rated at 50 ohms, and that is right in the middle of the target set of resistance that the Bass Traveler supports.  I used my standard headphone evaluation playlist below to get a feel for a broad range of styles.  I listened to them without the Bass Traveler and then with the Bass Traveler for comparison.When I used the flat setting, I noticed more detail in subtle places (e.g., “Chinese Democracy”) and busy songs (e.g., “Automatic Systematic Habit”).  However, I noticed the most improvement on “So What”.  This is an old, although remastered, recording, and with the volume at a lower level, the stand-up bass is hard to pick out without the Bass Traveler.  However, the Bass Traveler truly lived up to its name with the bass response on set to “H” on songs like “Chrysalis Heart”.  I generally prefer an unaltered sound, but I have to admit that it was impressive.  If you are a bass head who just isn’t getting enough out of your headphones, this is a fairly low-cost option (assuming that you made an investment in your headphones anyway) to squeeze more bass out of your cans.Overall, I’m looking for an amplifier to enhance my listening experience.  The M-Audio Bass Traveler does this admirably at a very reasonable price.  I recommend it without reservation.K'Naan - ""ABCs"" (bass)Delerium - ""Chrysalis Heart"" (bass)Guns `N Roses - ""Chinese Democracy"" (clarity)Evanescence - ""End Of The Dream"" (detail)Garbage - ""Automatic Systematic Habit"" (detail)Megadeth - “Sudden Death” (channel separation)Chris Cornell - ""As Hope And Promise Fade"" (clarity)Miles Davis - ""So What"" (jazz)Tchaikovsky - ""Moderato (Swan Lake, Act II)"" (classical)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SK3PAPKD9Z0K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X67G77O#wasThisHelpful","R2SK3PAPKD9Z0K","A1N5FSCYN4796F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5FSCYN4796F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our house is predominately a Mac outfit, but I wanted to have a Windows machine around for those rare times with it’s the only option - like accessing my work VPN.  I don’t need an overly high-powered  or fully featured computer to serve this purpose, and the ASUS M32AD seemed like a more than adequate choice for the task.Out of the box, there’s nothing out of the ordinary about this computer.  I connected my monitor and speakers along with the keyboard and mouse that come with it.  The initial boot and setup were smooth if somewhat slow.This is my first taste of Windows 10, and I think that Microsoft did a decent job improving on Windows 8 (although that’s not a very high bar).  To me, it seems like a blend of Windows 7 and Windows 8.  It is much easier to navigate, and I had no problem at all finding what I was looking for.However, apps are still sparse with Windows.  Most of them feel like a stripped down web browser (Fox News, WeatherBug, and Twitter to name a few).  The new actual browser, Edge, seems like a minor improvement over Explorer, but I still find Chrome to be faster.  The thing I was curious about was Cortana; however, this also feels immature compared to Google Now or Amazon Alexa.  The most frustrating thing to me was that Cortana only responded to “Hey, Cortana” about one out of every five tries.  Not surprisingly, it also only works with Microsoft apps meaning that you can’t control Chrome or use Gmail or Google Calendar on the web.  While you can connect these to the Windows apps, the experience is not as good and, in the end, not worth it.The one other thing that I found frustrating was Wifi performance.  My router sits only five feet away, but the connection was intermittent.  In contrast, my laptops and tablets connect from across the house with no issue.In the end, the ASUS M32AD is adequate for my needs, but I would not recommend it as a primary machine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYY50OZ55GFFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014QVM2AY#wasThisHelpful","RYY50OZ55GFFZ","A1N5FSCYN4796F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5FSCYN4796F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Made to Kill is a fun romp of a Noir novel featuring Raymond Electromatic - a robot detective turned hitman who winds up mostly being a detective in this story.  While one might expect a novel about a robot detective/hitman to be set in present day, that turns out to not be the case.  Rewind the clock a mere 50 years, and you've got the timeframe for the novel set properly.A good part of the story takes place in Raymond's head as he drives, walks, or generally has a look around.  This is a risky proposition for an author, but the story is DOA if the narrating character has a boring personality.  Rest assured, however, that Adam Christopher deftly avoids this trap.  Here are some of my favorite lines from Raymonds's thoughts:* ""The padlock on the gate was pretty big and strong but I was bigger and stronger.""* ""I assumed this was standard operating procedure for teenagers in an ice cream parlor when being given a free drink by a robot so I didn't argue.""* ""Fresco Peterman was smiling so much his cheeks pushed his big glasses up so high I wasn't even sure he could see out of them properly.""You might argue that these aren't laugh-out-loud funny, but they struck me as the kinds of things Bogart would say in an old movie.  I guess that is what made this novel so enjoyable to me - nostalgia.  I can see where this style of writing might not appeal to everyone.  This is a quirky novel that I had a lot of fun reading.  It goes quickly too at fewer than 250 pages.  If you are looking for something that isn't too taxing for a quick, fun read, I would recommend Made to Kill.  However, if you are in the mood for something meaty and serious, this is probably not for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O8HKL71YNQJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=076537918X#wasThisHelpful","R3O8HKL71YNQJW","A1N5FSCYN4796F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5FSCYN4796F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Friendship of Criminals is a crime fiction novel that is somewhat misplaced in the mystery/thriller genre.  I think the novel is also done a disservice when it is advertised in the product description as “explodes off the page with the crackling intensity of Scorsese's THE DEPARTED”.  To me the book started off too slow, and I thought there the amount of backstory was out of proportion for the length of the novel.  It gives a good sense of the Philadelphia mob scene, and the author does a decent job of conveying the scene.  I think that Glinski could write a compelling novel if he worked on pacing and balancing present day action with backstory.  You may well enjoy reading this, but you should not really expect explosive action or a taut thriller.  If you really dig mobsters and a slow burn, this might just be up your ally.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29Q8C1JPOFRPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250049962#wasThisHelpful","R29Q8C1JPOFRPW","A1N5FSCYN4796F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5FSCYN4796F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Signature Kill is the first of the Frank Behr series of novels that I’ve read, and it is also likely the last.  I read a fair amount of crime fiction, but nothing else that I’ve read compares to this in terms of gore, butchery, and depravity.  While I did finish the book, I considered stopping about halfway through.  The description of the killer (both his thoughts and his actions) was that disturbing.  In addition, I didn’t like Frank Behr as a protagonist.  He is a bit of a parasite himself given his tendency to use anyone he meets to further his case as a private detective.  There may be people who enjoy graphic murder and dysfunctional heroes, but I am not one of them.  I did not like this novel, and I can scarcely recommend it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWEQZRDXQIFVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385532555#wasThisHelpful","RWEQZRDXQIFVU","A1N5FSCYN4796F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5FSCYN4796F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Good:Nice AppearanceLong Battery LifeConfigurable NotificationsVariety of Watch Faces and AppsEasy SetupThe Bad:CostOverall:  The Pebble Steel is a bit of a luxury item, but it performs well and looks nice.Setup:  The Pebble Steel comes with the watch and charging cord; however, it is up to the user to supply the charger that accepts a USB connection.  If you are like me, you have plenty of these from other devices.  However, if you do not, just know that you will need an additional accessory just to get up and running.  The watch charged in a couple of hours, and then it was on to the pairing process.  I installed the Pebble app on my Samsung Galaxy S5, and it was easy to get connected.  Android is all about notifications, and the Pebble app lets you control which ones go to the watch on a per app basis.Watch Faces:  The Android Pebble app is where you go to get watch faces (and apps) for the Pebble.  I wanted my Pebble to look like a normal watch, and I went with the analog watch face that comes from the factory.  While that may seem boring, Pebble has a wealth of others to choose from including various bands and TV shows.  You can choose as subtle or outlandish as you desire, and the bottom line is that you have choices.  There are also composite watch faces that include weather, notification counts, and other items too.  However, be advised that everything that updates the display has a cost in battery life.Apps:  The Pebble Store has a number of apps to choose from too.  While there are many for weather, sports, email and text responders, I chose to keep things simple.  I have Dashboard (controls phone toggles), Here To There (gives estimated travel time to saved destinations), and Trello (list management such as shopping lists).  There are also apps for Evernote and Wunderlist, but I found the Trello watch app worked best for shopping lists.Usage:  I bought my Pebble for a pretty specific purpose.  I keep my phone on vibrate during working hours (at a minimum), and I often missed calls or text messages.  With the Pebble, I am able to see when I get a call or a text, and the information display provides useful information to me on the spot.  I can see who contacted me along with the contents of text messages.  I also like that I can dismiss/ignore phone calls from the watch.  The other notification that I have sent to my Pebble is calendar reminders.  It is handy to see where my next meeting is without having to pull my phone out.  Finally, I find it much easier to manage the shopping list without having to constantly unlock my phone.  As you may have gathered, the Pebble Steel is a pure convenience for me albeit one that does what I want it to quite well.Battery Life:  Battery life is heavily dependent on usage.  I have consistently gotten the 5-7 days as advertised.  However, user who have every email notification sent across along with sports scores and weather alerts should expect their mileage to be less.Looks:  You may be wondering why I went with the Pebble Steel over one of the Android (or even Samsung) options available.  This is purely a matter of personal taste, but I thought that the Pebble Steel provided the right feature profile in a watch that didn’t look like a toy.  The Android watches stand out too much in my opinion - especially with nicer clothes.  The Pebble Steel is a watch that you can wear just about anywhere without drawing undue attention.Conclusion:  I like the Pebble Steel, and I am glad that I bought it.  However, I’m not sure that it merits the full retail price.  I bought mine on a Black Friday Lightning Deal, and I had a $50 gift card too.  That made a discretionary purchase a little easier to justify.  I think smart watches will catch on when the consistently reach a price below $100 - at least for a usage profile like mine.

"Markus Gartner’s ATDD by Example is a good primer/introduction to acceptance test-driven development.  In keeping with the theme of the book, the first two parts of the book are example based.  Gartner gives a simulated dialog and development sprint in part one, and he “pairs” with you the reader in part two.  Finally, in part three he gives high level guiding principles for ATDD.  Gartner’s book is a quick read, and it is best suited for those new to the topic.  One group that will gain a lot from this is traditional testers who are moving into an agile development environment.  Developers who are looking to improve their testing knowledge can also find what they are looking for as well.  Those who are looking for an in depth treatment would be happier with BDD in Action by John Ferguson Smart.  I would also recommend BDD in Action as an excellent follow up to this book.

"The Patriot Threat is the latest installment in Steve Berry's Cotton Malone series.  I've read a few of the other books, but I've missed the last few.  Are you in the same boat or perhaps even a new reader?  No worries!  While Malone, Stephanie Nelle (his sometimes boss at the Magellan Billet), and (fictional) President Danny Daniels were familiar characters from prior novels, there is very little prior knowledge required.  Compared to prior novels, this one is about as close to standalone as I've read in this series.If you are a fan of the series, Berry has his usual mix of historical background and nasty villains.  Malone uses a balance of super spy combat and intellect to make his way through this latest adventure.  As with other novels in this genre, one does have to suspend a certain amount of reality for some of the action.  However, this is fiction, and I don't have a problem with that.  I found it also an eerie coincidence that the main foe is a lunatic from North Korea.  While this book doesn't use absurd comedy like The Interview, it doesn't paint North Korea in a very good light - not that it should be required to do so mind you.  I found the usual transcontinental plot with a dash of history satisfying.  It is a fitting entry into the series, and I look forward to more from Steve Berry and Cotton Malone.Overall:  B","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19TJQKGW3V5I0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250056233#wasThisHelpful","R19TJQKGW3V5I0","A1N5FSCYN4796F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5FSCYN4796F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Zagg Folio Case for 10"" Android and Windows tablets is a device that was full of potential that fails on build quality.  I have see others who have Zagg keyboards for their iPads, and I was quite surprised by the cheap feel of this keyboard case.  This is sad because it is otherwise a decent keyboard.  Unlike most universal tablet cases, this one has a design that doesn't put harsh plastic or metal on the corners to hold it in place.  The spring design in the bottom of the tablet compartment does a nice job of holding the tablet in place, but it has a rubber cushion where it touches the edge of the device.  The list of positives gets short from here.  The keys on the keyboard are small and the keyboard is very bouncy.  It is almost like a trampoline for your fingers!  (OK, I'm exaggerating a bit, but I couldn't resist a little hyperbole.)  The keys are also small with an unnatural border on the sides that is almost an inch.  It calls to mind all the negatives from the first generation netbooks, but we are five plus years removed from that time!  The biggest killer, however, on the build is that my tablet and top half of the case wobble when I use the touch screen.  There is no danger for the tablet, but I don't see this holding up to daily use.There are a couple of other positives.  The pairing and setup process is easy.  I was able to follow the instructions without issue the first time.  All of the special keys worked as expected with my Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5.  Also, this is a larger 10"" tablet, but there is probably a half inch to spare on both sides.In the end, this keyboard case is maddening.  Some features are well designed and executed while others are maddeningly poor.  As an alternative, I would point users to either your tablet brand specific keyboard case (if there is one), or one from Logitech.  For fellow Tab S 10.5 users, the Logitech option is the way to go with.

"The Three Emperors is the latest installment in the Ethan Gage series, and it is the fourth that I have read.  I won’t bore you with plot summaries, so here’s what you need to know.  While you don’t need to read all six of the previous novels, I would strongly recommend that you at least read The Barbed Crown first.  The previous book ended with a great deal unresolved that lays the groundwork for this story.  This will sound vague, but it is difficult to describe without giving away too much.  The first half or so of The Three Emperors is a bit challenging due to some creative use of literary device on the author’s part.  Trust me, though.  You will have your “aha!” moment, and it will all fall into place.  I struggled to read more than a chapter at a time for the first half because I found it a bit ponderous.  However, it picks up the necessary steam once you reach the Battle of Austerlitz.  If you stick with it that far, you are golden.  The rest is a thrill ride that fans of the series have come to expect, and I felt sufficiently paid back for my investment up to that point.  The ending is quite satisfying, and that is all that I’m going to say at the risk of giving something away.  If you’ve read it, I’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments below.

"The Parrot MiniDrone is a fun little RC ground vehicle.  Parrot made an interesting choice that potential buyers should be aware of.  It does not ship with a remote control, but you must supply your own by way of an iOS or Android device.  I installed the FreeFlight 3 app on my Samsung Galaxy S5, and it provides a rich experience.  In addition to touchscreen controls, I was able to see the drone’s camera output on my phone.  The link between the drone and the phone is through a Wifi network that the drone broadcasts.  I found the range to be about four houses down from mine before I lost the signal and the drone stopped.  The controls worked well turning the drone left or right by 90 or 180 degrees depending on the input from the user.  It can also jump up or complete a long jump.  Battery life is as advertised, and it works indoors on carpet just as well as on concrete outside.  The yard was more than it could conquer, but that was really the only limitation I found.  My dogs had mixed reactions to it.  One chased it while the other one ran away from it.  If you try it with your pets, respect their reaction to it.  It is a cool little toy for kids of all ages.

"American Spirit is a book that profiles a number of small/independent/craft distilleries across the country.  James Rodewald interviewed people from each of the ones included in the book, and he did a great job of providing a unified voice to the collection of stories.  I found it to be of particular interest because it begins with three distillers in my home state.  In addition I learned about new spirit makers from New York, Las Vegas, and Oregon among others.  The debate among distillers is “what counts as a craft spirit?”  Some start with “neutral grain spirit” made by other distillers and use it as the base for their spirit.  Others start from the very beginning with the raw ingredients.  There are no labeling requirements, and some are more transparent than others.  I will be trying some of the whiskies that I’ve discovered in American Spirits.It is also worth noting that this book is visually pleasing as well.  The paper is heavy, and the type and graphics look sophisticated.  It is informative, but it would also make a nice coffee table book.

"Woman with a Gun is the second novel that I’ve read from Phillip Margolin.  It is a murder mystery in the classic sense, but it has an interesting twist.  The story centers on a novelist writing a murder mystery based on the portrait on the cover of the book.  Margolin also wrote is story based on the cover of the book.  This has the potential to be pretentious, but it is actually a great story.  The plot sequencing is a bit different as it starts in 2015 then travels back in time a couple of jumps to set up the actual murder.  The characters such as the would-be novelist Stacy Kim and attorney Jack Booth are very well done.  There were enough twists in the plot that Margolin kept me guessing until he revealed the true killer toward the end.  This phrase gets overused, but I don’t apply it lightly to Woman with a Gun.  It was hard to put down.  I usually take about a week for a novel around 300 pages.  I finished this one in 3 days.

The only thing I would like different is the scent.  It is surprisingly strong for a lotion that is billed as lightly scented.  I would not want to use it when I would be going out because it is a fairly girly smell  My wife really likes it, but you wouldn’t want to use it before guy’s night.  Other than that, it is great.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MYDOOK0DQ1R3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0GT3XK#wasThisHelpful","R2MYDOOK0DQ1R3","A1N5FSCYN4796F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5FSCYN4796F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Golden Hour is Todd Moss’ debut novel.  It is an international political thriller that deals in which Dr. Judd Ryker works to reverse a coup d’etat in Mali according to his theory that it must be done within the first 100 hours - the “Golden Hour”.  I enjoyed the book, and it moves quickly for the most part.  The plot is a bit convoluted at times, and there were a couple of points where I had to reread a few pages to sort things out.  I thought that the resolution was well done, and I think that the best thing Moss can do is keep writing.  He has the potential to be a five star author, and I look forward to his future work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWG7AOVYKLQPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399168605#wasThisHelpful","RWG7AOVYKLQPN","A1N5FSCYN4796F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5FSCYN4796F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve been eating different bars from Kind for a number of years, and I was curious when I saw their new “Strong and Kind” line of products.  The premise is a higher protein version of what loyal Kind customers have been accustomed to.  The flavor of this particular bar is also a little different.  Whereas most of their prior products had more of a dessert flavor, these are more of a pure salty snack with a spicy kick.  Honey Smoked BBQ tells most of the story, but I’ve already hinted at the rest.  This is a spicy BBQ flavor that the ingredients (which include multiple types of peppers) confirm.  Here’s my shot at giving you a comparison of the flavor.  If you have ever been to Buffalo Wild Wings, the flavor of this bar is close to their Honey BBQ.  It is no sickeningly sweet BBQ.  It packs a little heat/spice.  While they won’t burn your mouth, it may be more than some expect from a product with “honey” in the name.  Overall, the flavor is balanced, and it is a fine higher protein product from a brand that I trust.  I highly recommend the Strong and Kind Honey Smoked BBQ snack bars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KA69TXJHQ96E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JA9LD3K#wasThisHelpful","R1KA69TXJHQ96E","A1N5FSCYN4796F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5FSCYN4796F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Dromida Ominus Quadcopter is my first RC copter; therefore, I will give you the novice perspective.  I liked that it comes fully assembled, and it is almost ready to fly.  You do have to charge the battery that goes in the Ominus, but that doesn’t take very long - maybe an hour or so.Once I had everything ready to go, I took the Ominus and the controller out to my driveway/sidewalk.  It was easy to pair the controller and the Ominus.  I took the instruction sheet out with me so that I had something to refer to while I was getting the hang of the controls.  I got the hang of the basics pretty easily, but then I got a little over confident.  It is easy for the Ominus to get away from you if you are not experienced.  I wound up within 10 feet of the pond in my neighborhood before it went down hard.  What happened was I let the Ominus get too high, and I got disoriented with which direction it was facing.  Everything I did seemed to send it higher and further away from me.  The only reason I still have mine is luck.  After I retrieved it, I went back to the driveway, and I was much more conservative with it until the battery ran out.  It advertises about 15 minutes, and that’s roughly what I got out of it.With all that being said, this thing is flat out fun.  I still have a long way to go to master all the controls, but it is addictive.  I have the battery charging, and I can’t wait to take it out again.  That’s right - a grown man acting like a kid again.  Your teen may love it, and they might even be a better pilot.  However, you only have to be a kid at heart to enjoy the Ominus Quadcopter.  It is a great outdoor hobby that I expect to enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26EPGEJVWJ0AJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHLAETQ#wasThisHelpful","R26EPGEJVWJ0AJ","A1N5FSCYN4796F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5FSCYN4796F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had previously tried the Vega Chocolate Cherry Almond meal replacement bars, and I was curious when I saw that they had a separate line of protein bars targeted for workout recovery.  This is another Vega product with premium ingredients at a premium price.  While there is no price currently on the Amazon product page, the go for $2.50 per bar at my local Whole Foods.  That is a pretty steep per unit price, but the difference in ingredients over competitors such as Odwalla and Clif is substantial.The taste of these is OK.  I am not a huge fan of coconut, but the flavor is not very strong compared to the chocolate.  There are also not very many pieces of coconut in a bar, and it is nothing like a Mounds candy bar in that regard.  While the taste is not my favorite, I don’t mind it.  I do like the benefits that it has to offer as a post-workout recovery snack.  I also like that it gives the benefits without any weird chemicals.This is a product for gym rats who are serious about their nutrition and are willing to pay a premium price.  If that is you, this is a good candidate for you.  Given the relatively high price, I would recommend trying to get one at a local store first to try them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GBQKB47K7411/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZO6CQ4#wasThisHelpful","R3GBQKB47K7411","A1N5FSCYN4796F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5FSCYN4796F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Philips Sonicare Powerup Battery Toothbrush is an entry level offering.  I have been using the Flexcare+ model with UV sanitizer for a number of years, but I was always hesitant to travel with it.  I was worried about either losing it or damaging it in my checked luggage.  However, I didn’t have the same reservations with this toothbrush that is about 10% of the retail price of my primary toothbrush.First off, it stood up to the rigors of being in my checked bag with no issues on a recent trip.  I did separate the brush head and take out the batteries when I packed them.  Risk, however, is not the only thing that decreases with this toothbrush from the Flexcare+.  The Flexcare+ and the Powerup both have two minute cycles, but that is where the similarities stop.  The more advanced model has signals to help you spend an even amount of time in each zone of your teeth based on top/bottom and front/back.  You are on your own with the Powerup.  The Flexcare+ also has five different modes including one that is slower for targeted gum care.  The Powerup is single mode.  The Flexcare+ is rechargeable, whereas the Powerup is battery powered.  The other major difference is that the Powerup is significantly more forceful.  To compare the difference, the Flexcare+ is like a tremor that barely registers while the Powerup is the most violent earthquake known to mankind.  Some may find it too strong.  It doesn’t bother me, but it is noticeably different.In the end, the Powerup does a good job of getting my teeth clean.  It is a bare bones, entry-level model that I like to use for travel purposes.  Others who should consider this are those who are looking to step up from manual toothbrushes.  If you are hoping for something more advanced, this isn’t the toothbrush for you.  You will need to invest more money to get more features.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EMIKPUNZU3V3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NL2AOPU#wasThisHelpful","R2EMIKPUNZU3V3","A1N5FSCYN4796F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5FSCYN4796F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Vega Chocolate Cherry Almond bars establish a new benchmark for companies like Clif and Odwalla to strive toward.  I have used similar products from the other companies based on their preference for natural and organic ingredients.  I don’t use these as meal replacement bars per se.  These are typically my mid-afternoon or after workout recovery snack.So, why does Vega raise the “bar” as it were?  While Clif and Odwalla go out of their way to use good ingredients, Vega seems to take the approach of cramming as many of these as possible into a tasty bar that is under 300 calories.  There are things in these bars (such as broccoli) that I wouldn’t touch if you cooked them and put them on my plate.  However, they are nicely masked beneath the flavors of chocolate, oats, and almonds.  The only thing some may want to consider is that the cherry flavor is not very strong.  If you are looking for a subtle hint of cherry, this is what you need.  I find it more than satisfactory.There is one catch.  Based on current prices (please verify as time goes by), the Vega product is about twice as expensive as what you get from Clif or Odwalla.  Is the higher cost justified?  If you compare the ingredients, there is a definite difference.  If you want the best ingredients, you must expect to pay more.  Your decision comes down to how much you are willing to pay for the best of the best.  Hopefully, I’ve giving you some information to help make that choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23U04RERQ4PSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGDOPKK#wasThisHelpful","R23U04RERQ4PSJ","A1N5FSCYN4796F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5FSCYN4796F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried a number of different K-Cup coffee varieties over the last couple of years, but the Sumatra is my first from Cafejo.  I was pleased with the results from these K-Cups.  While it isn’t the “best coffee ever”, they do achieve an above average flavor.  I have had plenty of K-Cups that fail miserably; therefore, do not underestimate the importance of this.  The flavor is rich, as one would expect from a dark roast, but it is never bitter.  The word that best describes the flavor to me is balanced.  As a bit of an aside, I had written off Sumatra coffee because I thought Starbucks (brewed in store, at home, or any other format) was just plain awful.  If you have similar thoughts, you should know that the taste of this coffee has nothing in common with the Starbucks variety - at least in my opinion.The quality is there with the Cafejo Sumatra K-Cups.  If you can find these in the $0.50 to $0.60 per K-Cup range, I would rate them a definite buy.  Those who enjoy a rich yet balanced dark roasted coffee will not be disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E2R4OGEML0AL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JNAMBXW#wasThisHelpful","R1E2R4OGEML0AL","A1N5FSCYN4796F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5FSCYN4796F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Bissell Bolt Ion XRT is great to have for spot duty - especially on hard surfaces.  It also has a detachable hand vacuum reminiscent of a Dust Buster.  It is very easy to setup and use.  The pieces connect without issue as expected, and it took about 2 and  hours to reach a full change as my unit arrived fully charged.I found it easy to use for touch up duty in the kitchen and dining room.  We have a buffet that sits a few inches off the ground on its feet, and the bending hinge in the XRT was handy in being able to reach under there.  Previously, we had to move the buffet to clean under it.  The EdgeReach feature is also nice for cleaning along the baseboards in the kitchen.  I also like the easy access to the speed adjustment.  I was going over one of our throw rugs that tends to slide, and I needed to lower the speed of the XRT in order to keep from moving the rug.The hand vacuum is also very nice.  It has a good crevice attachment for getting down in furniture and other narrow areas.  I was using the brush attachment on the couch cushion, and I discovered quickly that there was a lot of dog hair on there.  I had to pull the dog hair out of the brush bristles by hand.  Overall, it performed well.Cleanup is pretty easy, but I was surprised at how much dirt and gunk there was from a test drive.  I took advantage of the fact that the filter is washable, and it everything went according to plan.The Bissell XRT is a nice unit to have around the house for spot jobs, but it will not serve as your primary vacuum.  It is too small, and I don’t expect its charge would last on a house of any size.  It would be great for dorm rooms.  It serves a distinct purpose, and it does it well.

"The Frigidaire Professional Convection Toaster Oven is my first convection oven.  I have had a series of four-slice models from Black & Decker, but I was intrigued by the claim of oven results at near microwave speeds.  My typical uses are toasting bread and cooking frozen pizzas.As a new convection oven user, I needed guidance on how convection ovens are different.  As of today, this is not on the product page.  It is also not included in the product manual, and the Frigidaire website doesn’t know about this product yet.  I turned to Google, and I found some general guidance that convection ovens typically require reducing the cooking temperature by 10-15%.  Timing adjusts were said to require some experimenting.  In other words, get ready for some good old trial and error.For regular toaster oven users, the main difference in controls is the inclusion of convection versions of bake, broil, and reheat.  When I made my morning toast, I used the normal bake/toast setting, and things worked as expected.  When I compared it to my old toaster oven, the bread toasted faster and more evenly.  This is a larger unit, and the faster toasting is not unexpected.  For pizza time, I did use convection bake.  The package says to cook at 425 for 12 minutes.  The magic formula in this oven is 375 for about 8 minutes.  For reference, my old toaster oven took about 20 minutes at 425 for the same product.  Those are great results!  How can you argue with less than half the time at a lower temperature?Granted, my use cases are not that advanced, but this unit shows a lot of promise.  I would like to see a little more guidance from the manufacturer, but that is the only complaint that I have.  I would recommend using some low risk meals to get the hang of cooking with a convection oven.  Also, don’t forget to complete the “burn-in” step prior to use.  This thing smells awful when you burn off the dust and oil from manufacturing, storing, and shipping.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8TBKT5UW5P3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MFLBM2C#wasThisHelpful","R8TBKT5UW5P3T","A1N5FSCYN4796F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5FSCYN4796F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the Seventh Generation hand soap.  I tried the Mandarin Orange and Grapefruit variety.  As I become more conscious of the chemicals that I come in contact with, I turn to Seventh Generation to provide natural alternatives.  I have used their kitchen sprays in the past, and I have been pleased with their results their too.  I can say that their hand soap is just as reliable of a product.  The scent is not overly strong, but I it is present enough to be pleasant.  It lathers just like you would expect soap to, and there really isn’t a lot that suggests this is a different kind of product from run-of-the-mill soap.  I see this as a neutral factor, but this soap is not quite as thick as something like Softsoap.  However, I don’t think it really matters.  It is not so thin that it will run between your fingers.

"Dark Spies is the second novel that I’ve read in Matthew Dunn’s series featuring Will Cochrane - the elite CIA/MI6 joint operative.  I am also a fan of the Cotton Malone series and the Sigma Force novels as well.  Let me say that this is quite possible the best novel I’ve read from any of these three spy novel series.  I won’t bore you with a rehashing of the basic plot points because you can get that from the product page.  For me, it is the combination of storytelling and pacing that is almost otherworldly.  The story was compelling and intense.  I thought I had it figured out, but the resolution chapter near the end threw me a curveball that I didn’t see coming.  Cochrane is now my favorite covert operative in fiction.  He takes it in the shorts in a major way in this novel, but Dunn did something that really made him over the top sympathetic to me.  As Will is off fighter for his very existence, his neighbors who have flats in the complex with his band together to replace his fairly expensive collectables after his place is completely trashed.  You will have to read the book to fully appreciate this, but Dark Spies is written in a way that I really connected with me.  It is more that just a wanting the “good guys” to win sort of thing.  Spy thrillers don’t usually make such a deep connection no matter how compelling the story is - and this story is also compelling.  I can’t recommend Dark Spies enough.  It is in a league of its own.Overall:  A+","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C5VDXNMEXLDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062309463#wasThisHelpful","R3C5VDXNMEXLDT","A1N5FSCYN4796F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5FSCYN4796F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update  9-29-15DREEM sent me a new, revised case.  It is vastly improved over the original.  I have never had a manufacturer respond to my critique by actually changing a product -- this is quite impressive.  The new case is slightly bigger, better protecting the iPhone, since the bottom and top of the inner sleeve is wide-open.  A big improvement.  It's also slightly wider, so you can store 3 CC's in the case and still close it!The biggest improvement however is the strength of the magnet holding the phone in the case. You will have to judge for yourself how useful it is to be able to remove the inner portion to take photos, and reattach via a magnet.  This is not a big deal for me, it takes perfect photos w/o being removed.  If you do remove the phone for any reason, you must reattach it to the case dead-center to fully protect it on all 4 sides, so please be aware of this.This is a beautifully made case, with quality materials and manufacturing. I had to add some stickers to the outside leather, only because it is slick.  It's too easy to drop simply by having it slip through your fingers. It rains a lot in Hawaii, so the outside of the case can easily get wet.Why did I give it 4 instead of 5 stars?  One reason, weight.  With the necessary stronger magnet, it is a bit heavier than before.  This is not a big deal for me, but my wife noticed.  I will leave that judgement to you.  In order to get the quick attach/detach feature, you need a strong magnet, it's that simple.  If you are wondering how it will affect CC's stored in the case, so far, I have not had any issues with this, but I will report back if I do!  UPDATE: After 2 weeks, all my CC's are fine, the stronger magnet has no effect on them at all.Original review:I really hate giving one star reviews. I rarely do it.  This is a very well made case -- quality materials and construction. The magnetic closing clasp is ingenious, and works 99% of the time.If you put more than 2 plastic credit cards in it, it's borderline too thick to close.  Add some cash and it won't close.  Why they didn't make it a tad thicker is beyond me, it's a wallet case. I also can't understand why the case itself is so close to the dimensions of the iPhone. A case is supposed to protect the phone, yet this case is just barely bigger, with the top and bottom of the phone completely unprotected, due to the inner ""protective"" sleeve being wide-open there.  Also, the inner sleeve is rock-hard polycarbonate.  While indestructible, it absorbs little shock.  Silicone sleeves are better.This brings me to my main point.  Everybody (ok, only men, my wife clarifies), drops their phone at some point, especially if the case is semi-glossy slippery like this one.  I've dropped this one twice in a week. Both times indoors, about  5' onto a carpeted floor.  Both times, the phone popped-out.  If this happened on a sidewalk?The iPhone attaches/detaches from the case via a magnetic strip inside the back flap of the case.  Neat idea, very poorly executed.1) The magnet isn't strong enough to hold the big iPhone 6+ in it's protective case if you drop it, defeating the purpose of a protective case. I've had the phone detach a few times from the case simply by opening it!  Do they test their products in the real world?2) Since the case is only slightly bigger than the iPhone, you better put it back perfectly within the case when it detaches, (intentionally or not), or else a part of the phone is exposed, thus defeating the purpose of a protective case. There is no guide, tab, whatever, to let you know it's re-attached dead-center.I really wanted to like the this gorgeous case, but after one week, I must replace it. No doubt it will result in a broken screen, it's only a matter of time...","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSZWU66S17GUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y9OL4R6#wasThisHelpful","RSZWU66S17GUI","A3D6JJHCWI4RFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3D6JJHCWI4RFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a strange faucet.  The color won't match anything else in the bathroom.  Antique Copper?  Brass is common, but copper?  The color isn't so overpowering that you can't work with it, but it will not truly match anything else.  My sink is white, drain satin,  counter white marble, it looks fine.  If you have an above-counter bathroom sink, this is a worthy consideration. The height is perfect, the flow, amazing.  Certainly not a water saver, it pours into the sink at an amazing rate. Our pressure is nothing special.  It's noiseier than most, but not obnoxiously so.  This is common for all Chinese-designed waterfall faucets.  Psfter's excellent designs are silent, but more than double the price, I have both.It looks great, it's easy to install, and the components seem well made.  I bought top-of-the line water hoses, but I always do that.  Gripes?  Weak instructions.  I can only guess that I installed the joystick correctly.  Occasionally, when you turn it off, the small round metal cover that hides the valve top under the joystick, won't flop back down all the way.  Not that big a deal, but annoying.  A simple tap and it goes back down. I think I can resolve it one way or another....It is a very unique faucet design.  Its not for everyone, but we like it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZIC6EHE5U7XK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ECSMKZE#wasThisHelpful","R2ZIC6EHE5U7XK","A3D6JJHCWI4RFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3D6JJHCWI4RFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The following review has been copied and pasted from my review of the AM08 fan,  because they both performed equally.I hate writing reviews like this, specially for a brand I love. I've been using Dyson vacuums for a very long time, so I had very high hopes for this air multiplier, unfortunately, it didn't perform, in fact, a $40 Lasko fan beat it.I waited for a mild hot day, so when a 90 degree day finally arrived, I was excited to test this unit and see if it was worth the price. It does move a decent amount of air, but even at its highest setting (10) it barely cooled a small room, which forced me to use the much much cheaper Lasko, which moved a lot more air with just about the same amount of noise.So besides the below than average performance, it also a bit loud and using the remote can be very tricky, since the receiver is located at the very bottom of the unit, which means, if you're in bed, chances are, you won't be able to adjust the swivel or speed without having to sit up, lean forward and point the remote to the bottom of the unit.The fan is very cool looking and a lot easier to clean, but that alone didn't justify keeping it.

The pup would constantly cross paths with the Lab and I would find myself in the middle of a leash cluster trying no to trip and fall.But now that I'm using this leash, I am loving my daily walks with both my girls. Each end has length adjustments, which is great for keeping the eager pup in line; when she tries to wander off, she simply can't and falls back into the walking pace of the older, leading dog.The leash is surprisingly well made, I wasn't expecting much at this price, but I was wrong, it is well stitched and composed of quality nylon. The handle/loop is padded on the inside so handling to large dogs is not a strain on you and your hands.I honestly can't find anything wrong with this product, it is exactly as described and at an incredible price.If there's something I could change, it would be to add a second handle/loop at the base, for those moments when I need to restrain my dogs firmly, which I have needed when we encounter aggressive dogs and/or people who are afraid of dogs and don't feel comfortable walking by you unless your dogs are held very close to you. I wouldn't mind paying more for a double handle version of this leash.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PY1OZIWA0E2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRVBW12#wasThisHelpful","R2PY1OZIWA0E2P","A298GL2D0BHGKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298GL2D0BHGKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you own a Roomba sweeping robot, then there's a few things you should know about the Braava, which I didn't until I got it.First and foremost, the Braava can NOT be programmed, meaning, you have to manually set it on the floor before each use, activate the GPS cube and turn the machine on for sweeping/mopping.This isn't a bad thing, but something to keep in mind before you buy the Braava.Now, here's what you get in the package: 1 Braava unit of course, 2 attachments; one used to attach dust mop cloths and one used for wet mopping with also has a reservoir for cleaning solutions; 1 base charging station, 1 AC power adapter, 2 dust mop cloths, 1 wet mop cloth, 1 GPS cube (won't interfere with other wireless devices in the house) and 2 instructions booklets. Now the review itself...I'll be honest, I only bought this unit for its mopping ability. Since I already own a Roomba, which does an excellent job at sweeping/vacuuming my dogs fur from off the floor, I wanted the next step, which is to keep my wood floors sparkling clean.The Braava does a good job at mopping, not excellent, but good enough to make a difference. You won't see a huge difference until you start using it on a daily basis, but let me explain. Before buying it (Braava), I would let the Roomba do its thing, and I would follow (not every time) with a Swiffer wet unit or similar product, achieving a clean result. But as a pet owner, unless I did this routinely, my floors would not always look their best, I mean, I wasn't always in the mood to mop the floor, but since my Roomba is programmed to sweep/vacuum everyday at the same time, at least my floors don't have fur all over.So the Braava is now my daily mopping routine, which makes a huge difference, again, the first time it didn't seem like it did a great job, but only because I hadn't mopped the floors in a couple of days, add that to hundreds of wet, dusty paws, dripping tongues, etc, the floors needed a good rubbing. After the second day of using the Braava, I noticed a huge difference, the Braava performs great.The way it works is this: you fill the included mopping base with your choice of cleaner and warm water (you can use cold), damp the mopping cloth and attach it to the mopping base, turn the Braava and GPS cube on and an hour later your floors are clean.The way the mopping functions is quite simple. The tank/reservoir has a ""wick"" which gets soaked with cleaning solution and in constant contact with the mopping cloth, thus transferring a decent amount of fluid onto the floors as it mops.Now, the dry mop or dust mop, is good for well, dusting floors, so do not expect it to lift/suction crumbs, etc. Think of it as a dust mop, it will drag whatever is encounters, so if your floors have intricate corners/spots, you may not see great results. Wet mopping on the other hand, won't be affected.So after owning this unit for 1 month, I can honestly say, it is a winner, even with the lack of programmability, I am now using this on a daily basis, which gives me time to do whatever I please, I can watch TV, play video games or simply enjoy my backyard with my dogs, while my floors are being cleaned. Now if they could only invent a unit that could dust my entire house, I would be set.I hope this review helps you at least a bit. Take care.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CNJ2G3FHZIH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DCCYD6U#wasThisHelpful","R1CNJ2G3FHZIH3","A298GL2D0BHGKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298GL2D0BHGKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're on the fence between iGotTech and the ""Bug-off"" brand, let me describe how they differ from each other, since I have both.They are both made of the same mesh material, durable, strong yet flexible enough for easy opening.The iGo has a better closure, since it has magnets running the entire length of the screen. The Bug-Off has 2 sets of magnets, one at the very bottom and one at the middle, which can be problematic, specially if the magnets catch at an angle, leaving a small gap, increasing the chances of bugs getting in.Installation is pretty much straight forward with both brands, easy and done within 5 minutes. The iGo comes with a roll of Velcro which has adhesive tape underneath it, so to install it, you have to glue the Velcro to your door frame, the screen also has Velcro, which then attaches to the one installed on the frame.Here's where in my opinion, the Bug-Off has the upper hand, since is uses Velcro, but only at 3 spots which are attached to both sides of the door frame, the top section uses a spring loaded rod, which does a better job at holding the screen, since it uses pressure against the door frame to stay in place, and which after months of use, has withstood the brute force of 2 large dogs. Plus, if you ever want to use the screen on a different door, you can simply retract the rod and use it on a different frame.The iGo didn't fit my 36x80 door frame, let me rephrase that, it actually fit, but would not close entirely, it wasn't wide enough, so the screen was stretched out, making it impossible to have a sealed closure.So which should you get? I say, it depends on your needs. If you are planning to use this screen on a single door without ever moving it and have no large pets, then the iGo is for you. On the other hand, if you want to occasionally use the screen on a different door and have large pets, then the Bug-Off is for you.Another point noting, iGo carries only one frame style screen, single door opening. On the other hand,  Bug-Off has different styles, including French doors (for dual or single open doors).","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z7BGKTHEXI0E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZNOHTW#wasThisHelpful","R2Z7BGKTHEXI0E","A298GL2D0BHGKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298GL2D0BHGKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The new version, does not include the adapter, which means you cannot longer charge your 3DS. The older version fit the 3DS and the adapter plugged into the game pad. Now it only fits the pad.

"Just so you know, this review is mostly about the outer design (Art) and not the lighter itself, which is of great quality as any Zippo lighter.For those of you considering this lighter for its  unique art, let me warn you, this is NOT an engraved image, but a 3D decal, which means it can easily peel off and completely disappear when used every day, specially if kept inside a pocket.I couldn't tell from the pictures, which do a poor job at showing the true nature of the art. If you're looking for an engraved style such as the ""Jack Daniel's"" version, then look elsewhere, 'cause this isn't one.Again, the 4 star review is for the deceiving pictures of the lighter, which make the art look engraved.

"This mouse is by far the nicest looking gaming mouse I've ever owned. The construction is that of Razer's standards, same materials with a very nice finish and overall, a sturdy peripheral.What's great about this mouse is the ability to accommodate right and left handed gamers, DPI switching can be done on the fly with the 2 middle buttons, side buttons assigned to your liking.Most of you, including myself, probably bought/will buy this mouse for the mechanical adjustments that will allow you to increase the mouse length and boom. The length can only be done with the included screwdriver and the boom with a small turning knob found at the very back of the mouse, right under the palm rest. It also includes  a set of side wings, which are great for reducing pad drag. I tested this during FPS sessions and it made a huge difference.The mouse uses a single AA rechargeable battery that can only be removed by first unscrewing the length adjustment (with the included screwdriver). So, I wouldn't recommend going through the trouble of swapping batteries, specially during online sessions. SIMPLY unplug the USB cable from the receiver base and plug it into the mouse itself for charging on the fly. BUT THIS IS WHERE TROUBLE STARTS, hence the low review score.Now that I've covered the basics, let me explain to you why this beautiful beast is now on its way back to Amazon. Two words...Razer Synapse. An extremely buggy piece of software that has been nothing but problems, at least for me. This is my THIRD razer mouse, the first 2 were Mambas, Yes, I bought two, the very first version, then the latest; both quit working after about a year..from the cursor not moving to the mouse simply not charging.So the Ouroboros Elite was working fine until I had to recharge it on the fly....which went fine, I was able to continue gaming without a problem, but once I went back to wireless mode, the cursor simply stopped working; the DPI adjustment and side buttons still worked, but NOT the cursor. I tried re-pairing it with the base, but nothing. I plugged the USB into the mouse again, and it started to work....so basically, I had bought a wireless mouse that didn't want to move on wireless mode. I restarted my PC twice and shut down the software, which seemed to solve the problem. All good right? Not really, I plugged the USB directly to the mouse, once again, to test and make sure the previous issue wasn't a one-time bug, but ended up with the same problem....So, after the bad experience with BOTH my Mambas, and now with the Ouroboros, I couldn't take any chances, specially since I only had it 4 DAYS! I didn't want to end up with a pretty & useless paper weight after the 30 day return period had ended. Quite honestly, at this point, I'm not even sure if it is the software, as I stated above, or the mouse itself, but either way, I'm not risking $100 of my hard earned cash.One more thing worth mentioning and for which I have to give props to Razer, I used the ""Feedback"" option, which can be done from the software interface and the very next day I had a rep email me, which was great. But having sent Razer my mouse (Mamba) once before in the past, which resulted in an endless exchange of emails, ranging from my mouse never arriving, to actually arriving, but not having an RMA to having one...and 3 months later finally getting it back and still not working properly, I have decided that at this point, I am officially giving up on Razer. I've been a PC gamer since the days of MOHAA and have never had so many issues with a brand. Third time's the charm though.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K1RS79VDOD5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EWEHI5K#wasThisHelpful","R1K1RS79VDOD5E","A298GL2D0BHGKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298GL2D0BHGKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This travel bag is well made, from the stitching to the quality of the materials. The speaker fist perfectly, without wiggle. It can house the speaker by itself or with the official Bose soft cover. The front compartment holds the AC plug perfectly as well, it is deep enough so the wire won't stick out, the front pocket closes with a velcro.The locking mechanism is simple, yet effective. You simply place the cord around the Bose logo metal piece and you're done. I've thrown this travel bag inside my back pack and so far, the speaker and AC have remained inside the bag.If you're on the fence between this and the cheap version not made by Bose, let me at least give you my honest opinion, in this case, the $45 is well worth it.

"I probably spent close to 3 days reading reviews, tech specs and overall customer satisfaction about this speaker, so when I finally took the plunge, I was extremely satisfied and still am.The amount of power this speaker outputs is simply amazing and hard to believe. You get a deep, warmth sound, punchy bass and well balanced mids and highs. I tested it with a variety of sound genres, from rap to techno to acoustics; all sound amazing. (Lee Dewyze's ""Black Bird Song"" from TWD sounds amazing)At $250, you get the speaker of course, wall charger, cradle and travel bag; you can charge the speaker directly with the wall charger or plug the charger into the cradle and place the speaker on it. It also has a 3.5mm jack for devices that do not support blue tooth, at the bottom of the unit, you'll find a charging connector for the cradle and micro USB port, which is meant for and only for software updates.You can pair multiple Blue-Tooth enabled devices, but in order to switch from one to the other, you have to go to the device Blue-Tooth settings and ask it to connect to the Bose.Unlike other speakers at this price range, this one lacks NFC (Near Field Communication) which allows users to simply tap the devices with each other, for instant communication. But again, I listened to other speakers at this price range (yes the Pill as well) and none had near the sound clarity, bass and power the Bose has. At max volume levels, the Bose did not distort sound at all, which is something the competitors suffer from.The build quality is as good as its sound.The shell is made of aluminum, the buttons are rubber and very responsive, underneath the unit, you'll find a rubber pad, which works as a tiny stand, but also houses the battery. The uni has its weight, but it's not too heavy and only adds to its overall sturdy feel; this unit is built well and made to last.As for battery life, I've gotten about 7.5 hours at mid to high volume levels. Charging takes about 3 hours, but as I mentioned above, the wall charger fits perfectly in the front pocket of the travel bag, so charging the speaker on the go, shouldn't be a problem.Signal range is also amazing, rated at 30 feet, I did not experience any interference, even with walls.The travel bag is simply perfect; the front pocket is meant for the wall charger and does a great job at keeping it safe. The main compartment houses the speaker, which can be stored with or without the Bose official sleeve.Nothing more to say really, trust me when I say this, you won't be disappointed with this speaker. I did hours upon hours of research, demo testing, etc., and can honestly tell you, this is probably the best speaker you'll ever own.FINAL NOTE ABOUT AUTHORIZED RE-SELLERS.Be very careful when buying Bose or any other brand for that matter. They will NOT honor any warranty, unless you purchase the item directly from them or an AUTHORIZED re-seller. I bought mine from Huppin's (fulfilled by Amazon). Huppin's and Amazon are both AUTHORIZED dealers.The speaker measures:2.25"" wide2"" Height7"" Long (a bit over)Hope this helps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAUZWKK46FZIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EOI7MZ0#wasThisHelpful","RAUZWKK46FZIB","A298GL2D0BHGKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298GL2D0BHGKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"3.5 score.I have to fair and honest about this product and though it protects your Shield, to an extend, it does have a design flaw.Firs the good;Applying it onto the screen is actually pretty easy, just like any other screen protector, align, peel off the under wrap, place on the screen as you remove the wrap.The company includes 3 ""dust removers"" which are basically three thin film patches that you can wrap around your finger or place on the palm of your hand to remove dust particles left behind from the initial cleaning.They also include more than a handful of post installation dust removers that are basically stickers used to lift the screen protector and slide under it to remove dust particle left behind after installation.Now the bad;This is the MAIN reason why this product does not get a 5 star rating. IT DOESN'T cover the screen completely. You pretty much have to CENTER the screen protector to get the most of it. Mine has about 3 mm of unprotected screen surface on all sides. So, you pretty much have to be careful when storing the Shield so the unprotected areas are not scratched.Also, but not such a big deal, at least not to me, the included cleaning cloth, is not an actual cloth, I'm not even sure what it is, but I decided not to use it, 'cause I had the feeling it would damage my screen, it isn't soft at all.Finally, the bubble remover is simply a thick, but not thick enough, piece of cardboard, which is pretty useless at removing bubbles, since it quickly bends out of shape. I prefer to use a credit card.Summary,At this price, this isn't a bad deal, but it isn't perfect either. The fact that it doesn't fit the Shield to its true size, is quite a disappointment. I suggest you either keep looking or be aware that this won't protect your tablet completely.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FE8V3Y6TL5PB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M9W4MS8#wasThisHelpful","R2FE8V3Y6TL5PB","A298GL2D0BHGKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298GL2D0BHGKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me start my saying that my needs for a Sweeper as a traditional home owner, are simply and realistic.This unit has just the right amount of power to blow debris, leafs and even mulch. After mowing my lawn, I take this puppy out and have no problem sweeping clippings and other debris off my driveway and various areas around my front and back yards. Wet leaves are a bit tougher and may require you getting really close with the sweeper; if the leaves are wet and stuck to the ground, then you may have to shake them off with your foot first and then sweep them with G-Max.This tool works uses very little power from the battery, even at full blast;I have the battery powered mower which uses the same battery and even after mowing both my yards, I'm able to use the sweeper on high power without the battery dying on me.It is light, but depending on which battery is used with it, you will feel a difference in weight, but nothing that will cause fatigue.It has a power switch and dial. The power switch starts the sweeper and the dial controls the different speeds/power.The main nozzle is removable and it also comes with a removable tip, which has a low and high settings, which directs the air at a different angle for a  higher/lower air flow.Again, as a home owner, I'm pleased with my purchase. If you are looking for something basic with enough power for  house chores, then look no further, this is it. On the other hand, if you are looking for a heavy duty sweeper/blower, then go for the gas models, they have a lot of kick for heavier work loads.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24TZW7B18CYBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D3KJN34#wasThisHelpful","R24TZW7B18CYBW","A298GL2D0BHGKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298GL2D0BHGKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gustaf's Dutch Licorice is probably THE best licorice I've had and you won't be disappointed by its flavor, texture and overall quality. The Firm and Slightly Salted are simply amazing, and so are the regular. I'm not a big fan of the double salt, IMO the extra salt overpowers the licorice flavor too much.Why the WARNING? well, here's what happened to me (May 2014)I ordered the Slightly Salted directly from Amazon, but I got the regular non salted flavor. This item ""can not be returned"" to Amazon, so after a quick phone call, and thanks to a very helpful CSR, I got a replacement shipment right away, which was delivered in two days time. BUT, once I opened the box, what did I find? The non salted flavor...AGAIN. So there's definitely something wrong going on at the Amazon warehouse, since the wrong item has been sent to me twice in a row.So as a WARNING to you, and specially if you're looking for the slightly salted flavor, hold on for a while before purchasing this item, at least until Amazon sorts things out, or you'll be on the same boat as me with a LOT of licorice on your hands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UXVS035MCJ10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ETZU2U#wasThisHelpful","R3UXVS035MCJ10","A298GL2D0BHGKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298GL2D0BHGKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Up until a few days ago, my biggest lawn enemy was the dreadful crabgrass, hard to kill and even harder to take out from its roots. I was using the painful method, on my knees, small crowbar and depending on the size of the crabgrass and how deep its roots are, it would take me from 5 to 10 minutes to take it out... each!!So I found the Fiskars Uproot Weed and Root Remover...I don't care how long this has been around, I just know one thing...it's what I've been looking for.As I mentioned above, my main pain on my butt has always been crabgrass, reason being, my neighbor doesn't take care of his lawn, and so it is covered with them, somehow they end up on my yard and each year is the same pain for me to get rid of them...UNTIL NOW. So let me give you a simple tip for removing crabgrass (trust me, this afternoon I removed about 20 of them):You want to make sure you know where the root ball is, so spread out any actual grass around the weed and follow the weed's branches; Crabgrass is tricky, you may think you have the Fiskars lined up to the center of the weed, but you may be wrong, crabgrass tends to flatten as it grows, and so the root ball is always off from what you may perceive as the ""center"" of the weed; after moths of being plagued by this pain in the butt weed, I've noticed that its roots are usually spread out, so even with this wonderful tool, you'll most likely have to go in twice or even three times to remove a single crabgrass bunch. However, the younger the weed is, the less roots it has and those usually take only one time with the Fiskars, again, if you first locate the root.Of course, not everything is perfect, and here are a couple of cons about this tool:First, a mix of plastic and metal construction. I heard and felt some straining on the tool when I was removing a very mature crabgrass, but luckily, the tool did not break.Second, and this is more of a WARNING than a con. Since you are removing the weed entirely with its roots, you will leave a HOLE in the ground, more even so when removing crabgrass, since its roots are a mix of curled up hardened roots (again, depending on maturity). So be ready to fill up the holes with dirt. If you have an infestation, I suggest you get some grass seed, some soil and patch up any big holes you leave behind.Other weeds such as dandelions and leafy weeds are easily taken out without much of an impact on the ground. Needles to say, those weeds don't have a prayer...but don't get me wrong, like the title of my review says, with Crabgrass, it is trickier, but does the job.All in all, I couldn't be happier, this is a wonderful invention and has saved me the huge pain of dealing with weeds, literal pain. My back thanks you Fiskars and my neighbors even more, 'cause I don't curse anymore...if anything, they now probably think I'm nuts, since I was literally laughing as I took each weed out! ha!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AF4ZSZBDLESR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030MIHAU#wasThisHelpful","R2AF4ZSZBDLESR","A298GL2D0BHGKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298GL2D0BHGKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of my review says it all. My ""DT-990-Pro-250"" headphones fit perfectly. I almost go the XXL, but I'm glad I didn't. There's no wiggle room for the headphones to move or pressure on them. The case includes a nice Velcro strap which does a great job at keeping the headphone cord neatly wrapped, even with the coiled cord from the DT-990-Pro-250. Inside, you'll also find a sewn-in zippered side compartment, which I'm guessing, can be used to store USB cables for amps, etc. The case also includes a nice metal snap-hook, so it can be attached to the case's built-in hand-strap for carrying on or in a backpack, etc.The case itself is very well made. Hard shell, not flimsy at all. A great purchase. I don't regret it and neither will you.

"I'll be honest, I had below average expectations for this tiny speaker, but any doubts and or low expectations I had, have been blown right out of the water.I have tested this speaker with the Galaxy Note 3 and iPhone 5s and I must say, I am impressed. This has balanced highs and lows. At full volume, I didn't hear any distortion, music sounded just as good.The speaker opens with a counter clock-wise motion and closes the opposite way. It has 3 buttons (internal), volumex2 and power.It has two ports, both 3.5mm, one used for recharging the speaker and one for connecting other ZX100 units for a fuller, louder sound. It has a 5"" cord with a 3.5mm connection, which is the standard for mobile devices. The cord itself rests under the speaker, inside a groove, which holds it tightly.It includes a carrying pouch.This is NOT a blue tooth speaker. It MUST be physically connected to your device at all times.In conclusion, I don't regret this purchase, it is a great little speaker with plenty of bass, highs, mids and without distortion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GXN2ECX5JGHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A80VVIC#wasThisHelpful","R1GXN2ECX5JGHC","A298GL2D0BHGKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298GL2D0BHGKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this case for my wife's new iPhone 5s and so far she loves it. She's very picky about this sort of things, and her NOT complaining about it, is a great sign.She's told me so far the case holds her phone all day long, while holding it to view emails, in her purse, bag, etc. Placing and removing the phone from/into the case is very easy and stays in place. The credit card pockets are also a huge hit with my wife, she loves having everything in one location. The magnetic flap hold the case closed and so far it hasn't failed. The included stylus is not the greatest, but I wasn't expecting it to be anyway. The wrist strap is well made, holds the case and hasn't failed either. Something you should be aware of, the case is not made of real leather, it feels more like fake leather, but it has strong stitching and does not feel cheap at all.I bought this case directly from Pandamimi-The Great Case Company, here at Amazon, and even though shipping did not qualify for Prime, I had the case at my door step within 7 days.

"Bought it for the PS4 to charge the controller and it works perfectly. At 10 feet, this cable provides more than enough room to comfortably charge your PS4 controller while playing on the couch.

"These are well made, from the drivers housing to the cable, I have no complaints, BUT the fit isn't exactly for active sports such as mountain biking or running. I tested these puppies while biking on pavement, and they performed poorly, they kept slipping out of my ears. While on a trail, the result was even worse. I had to remove them all together. I think the mixture of sweat and vibrations is why these could not stay in place. I followed the instructions, tried different shapes with the memory wire, but none was able to hold them in place while in motion. Of course, if you stand still, they do hold on, but that defeats the purpose.As for sound, well, sadly, they don't sound great either. They sound like their price, cheap. Muddy highs, decent mids, but distorted bass and/or lacking, depending on the genre.After using these, I gave them away. I tested and bought these instead: Bose MIE2 Mobile Headset  which work better than any in-ear headphones I've used. They fit inside the ear bowl and sound AMAZING, but of course, cost more than 5 times than the Sport-Fi M6.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZEH0CB6XFIUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0038W0K2K#wasThisHelpful","R1ZEH0CB6XFIUT","A298GL2D0BHGKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298GL2D0BHGKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not a contractor, I'm simply a home owner who needs an affordable, reliable tool to use from time to time when DIY projects come along. The JS515 fits the bill and more. For starters, this saw is well built; sturdy plastic contruction with a metal plate. It also has a built-in, magnetized blade compartment that truly comes in handy when doing projects. It accepts T & U Shank blades and has a dust blower out the back. It includes one T-shank blade.If you're thinking about this and an ORBITAL jigsaw, let me clarify something. If you are not a professional contractor or won't be cutting a LOT of wood, you DO NOT need an orbital saw. The orbital is meant for quick, NOT so clean cuts, meant for heavy volume.Here's another tip, the blade you see pictured, is a T-Shank blade, so try to buy T-Shank blades and DO NOT buy the one suggested by Amazon ( Black & Decker 75-626 Assorted Jigsaw Blades Set, Wood and Metal, 24-Pack )...those are U shank blades and so ARE SHORTER than the one included with this jigsaw. I made the mistake of buying them and ended up with blades that are almost an inch shorter than T-shank, which limits what you can and can not cut depending on thickness.BUY THESE instead: Bosch T10CHC 10 Piece Bosch Shank Jigsaw Blade Set With Pouch These come with a nice little nylon flat pouch and do a great job. Plus they fit exactly as the one pictured with the jigsaw.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VREVBZIB2IES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CL4ZHK#wasThisHelpful","R1VREVBZIB2IES","A298GL2D0BHGKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298GL2D0BHGKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I couldn't give this product a 5 star review, even if it is sturdy, but let me explain why.First, the good. The unit is well built, but to a degree (but more on that later). Setting up didnt' take long and after it was all put together, I didn't notice any wobble or loose ends.The coat hooks really compliment the overall look and give it a good finish.I calculate the weight to be around 50lbs.Now, here's what I didn't like about this unit.First, and I'm sure at this price it is a given, this piece is not made out of solid wood, it is compacted saw dust.Second, you will need to install it on at least 3 studs, due to its weight.This entire piece slides into a back piece (the one attached to the studs), but this back plate doesn't  include the hardware to hang it.So, you'll need to buy anchoring crews. NOT plastic or butterfly anchors. You need 2 1/2"" anchor screws. I don't think Amazon sells that size screws, but you can check your local hardware store. Look for "" The Hillman Group Wall Dog"", which has a capacity of 250lbs (ON SOLID WOOD), you will also need a 3/16 wood drill bit.I also noticed that the back plate was not leveled, whoever cut it, did not do a straight cut (a few mm, but noticeable when checking with a level).All in all. The unit  looks great, but I wish they had included the hardware to mount it. After all, I was able to buy a 25pk of Wall Dogs for about $7 locally. Good luck.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8F4KWTY1ERVD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003D2374I#wasThisHelpful","R8F4KWTY1ERVD","A298GL2D0BHGKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298GL2D0BHGKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATE #2: [June 07/2013], after following the suggestions from the Asus tech, I put the router through some tests while trying different channels, but unfortunately, the results were the same; random speed drops; this seemed to be more of an issue when more than one device was connected on either channel. As I stated before, I see the speeds go from 65mbps to below 10mbps. The most drastic drop occurs in the 5GHz, where I can reach speeds of up to (on my alienware laptop) 207mbps to a sudden drop to 5mbps. Also, I noticed that the unit runs very hot, I know I said this before, but this time, after carefully inspecting the router, I noticed the ports were hot enough to burn one's finger.I'm not sure if I got a lemon, but this unit, together with the upgraded antennas that I bought, will go back to Amazon, I will try the non AC unit, since I've heard it performs a lot better than this.UPDATE: TODAY [June 05/2013] I also tried changing the channel, as suggested by the ASUS rep., so I'll run some tests and will update again with the results. I should mention though, I have tried changing channels before and had mixed results. Still, I'll run tests and update again.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I've had this router for about 3 weeks now and so far it has performed below average.Setting up the router is actually quite easy and the GUI interface is nice and easy to navigate, plus it has a lot of features that other routers I've owned, didn't have.But that's about all the good I can speak of about this router.It's signal is the worst I've seen. I live in a small 1000sqf home and this router fails to cover it, unless there's a straight line of sight between the router and the devices. At times the router's signal will simply drop for no reason, so I will see my connection speed at 65 mbps, then it drops to below 10 mbps. That's with the 2.4GHz, the 5GHz is even worse, but that's kind of expected with the 5GHz, since it is known for that, regardless of the brand of the router.I even bought, not ONE, BUT THREE Asus antennas (Asus WL-ANT-157 Antenna ), thinking it would solve my problem, but that didn't help at all. So, if you think the $25 antennas will help, let me tell you, they won't.I also tried changing the bandwith but no dice. I even bought a floating shelf for the router alone, so it would be higher, out of other frequencies, etc, but that also didn't help.At this point, I have two options, return the router and get the previous non AC model, or forget Asus all together. Any suggestions are welcome.I don't mean to put Asus down, I have other Asus products, mainly MBs, which work great, so I was expecting the same from this, but I've been sadly disappointed.Note: this router runs EXTREMELY HOT.Note 2: I'm currently using these cables: Tripp Lite N201-020-BK Cat6 Gigabit Black Snagless Molded Patch Cable RJ45M/M - 20 feet. CAT6 has a wider margin for signal strength over long distances and should be considered (and I strongly recommend), specially when positioning your router or any other device through long distances. The above link is for a 20 footer, but there's different lengths and ALL at a great price and awesome quality. None of that cheap crap that ships with this router or any other router for that matter.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGNEJ38H56A3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008ABOJKS#wasThisHelpful","RGNEJ38H56A3L","A298GL2D0BHGKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298GL2D0BHGKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm writing this review using the AmazonBasics Bluetooth Keyboard on my Kindle Fire HD.So far, this keyboard has exceeded my expectations; I was afraid that writing with it would somehow be cumbersome, but even with my big hands and chubby fingers, I'm able to write without much of an effort. The keys are spaced perfectly and are not flush, which in my opinion is what makes typing so easy.The keyboard is light, weighing mere ounces and compact enough to carry in my hand with my Kindle.I have not used it with any other android devices yet, but for those of you, whom own a Kindle Fire HD, this thing will be perfect. It has a ""Home"" icon that will take you back to your main Kindle screen, where you can navigate icons and options with the keyboard arrows. It also has a ""Menu"" icon to quickly access settings on your web browser. A search icon is also included and a ""back"" button to go back to the previous page. It also has volume buttons for when watching movies or listening to music.Pairing the keyboard to your kindle or other android device is very simple; the instructions are clear and easy to follow and I was able to pair it to my HD in just a few seconds. Which brings my next point, the range and connectivity are spot-on, and I have not encounter any issues.The keyboard measures:Just under 10.5"" long, 4.5"" wide and about 0.5"" at it tallest point, since it sits at an angle for better, more comfortable typing.All in all, I'm extremely happy with this product, the pop up keyboard no longer appears on my screen when I'm searching or typing, giving me a full view of my browser and other applications.Travel Stand: simply put, sturdy, well made and snaps close.

"I've been testing this unit for the past week, putting it through numerous test, but unfortunately, it didn't perform as I had expected.Let me start by mentioning the pros of this unit:First and foremost, customer service, I contacted them once and I was given top notch service and the staff was knowledgeable of the unit.The unit can be used as a bridge and as an extender at the same time, in my case, I was able to use it to extend my wifi signal and hard wire (plug) a Denon 1912 receiver at the same time.The touchscreen of course, a huge plus that makes configuration easy and pain free.Small footprint.But here are some facts that you should take into consideration before you buy this unit:No gigabit ports. The Almond has megabit ports and so speeds are bellow today's standards, even Netgear's cheap routers have gigabit ports.No dual chanel.When in range extender mode, you can't change channels, which can be problematic in areas where there are a lot of wifi signals and the speeds will not go above 65mbps when two or more units are receiving its signal. Also, while in extender mode, most of the units functions are not available.I also noticed its signal drop in range while in router mode, at times I would only get 1 bar and then full, back and forth.So after I tested this unit in a small house (about 1000sqf) with mixed results, I decided to return it, because it simply did not perform as promised.I suggest you wait for Securifi's Almond+Hope this helps.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LK3IFW312RNO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087NZ31S#wasThisHelpful","R3LK3IFW312RNO","A298GL2D0BHGKZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298GL2D0BHGKZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I jumped at the chance to review this item when a sample was offered for a fair evaluation.  My wife just loves things like this.  I guess it's a holdover from the old disco days.  But this really is a party in your hand.  Music and lights that you can use for virtually any occasion.  First  off the unit is surprisingly robust and well made for its small size. It's profile is: 5.5 x 4.5 x 4.5 inches and weighs just less than a pound.  You might not expect quality sound and lighting out of such a small package but the Erilgpowht really delivers!You can use it to get FM radio or connect your phone or MP3 player to play music stored on your device or from services like Pandora.  Like some of the other reviews I found the FM radio transmissions to be a little inconsistent.  Definitely worked better outside than inside.  But honestly this is something that I play my Pandora on.  The sound is good.  Not great but Good.  I mean for $20 you are not expecting Bose quality sound but this does out perform other more expensive blue-tooth speakers I have tried out.  Not the deepest bass...It won't rock your bones but it's fine for smaller gatherings.The LED lights combined with the rotating quality as well as the many faceted clear cover created a dazzling display of lights to let you put on your own disco light display or to set the right mood for specific parties like Christmas.  It can play for about 3 - 5 hours on a full charge which is OK but nothing to write home about.  But for $20 you really can't go wrong with this item.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMCVKX1E96KJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YEE1YYY#wasThisHelpful","RMCVKX1E96KJT","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wait...what is this?  When I was expecting a lap top cooling pad i was naturally expecting to get the typical lap-top sized pad that your laptop rests on top of and cools with a couple of fans.  What is this thing?  It almost looks like some sort of external backup drive.  But Ahhh...it is not.  In reality this is the laptop cooling pad.  In fact this device from Opolar should not even be called a pad because it really isn't and they is what throws people off.  This device is only about 2"" x 3"" and attaches to your laptop via a USB cable.  you can set the item where ever your laptops vents are located...either side or rear.  It attaches fairly securely to the vent as long as your laptop is sitting on a table or desk.  It's not going to work all too well if you are literally using it on your lap where the surface is uneven.  if you move the laptop you have to reposition the cooler.What is does is attach to the vent and literally pulls the warm air out of your laptop.  Its claims are that it can cool your laptop anywhere from 10 to 40 degrees lower within just a minute.  I had nothing to measure my laptops internal temperature but i definitely noticed a difference.  The fan speed is adjustable and runs quietly although my traditional lap top pad is actually a little more quiet than this but not a big deal.  if you don;t like the regular pads because of their bulkiness, the Opoloar is definitely a viable option and is much more easy to transport since it can fit into a pocket of your laptop bag.I was provided a sample for a fair and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ROK2O08F7FK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014WH4QPQ#wasThisHelpful","R3ROK2O08F7FK1","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Stuffed Snake!  well hey who can't love plush animals, right?  Sure you have your teddy bears and your puppies and things like that...but how about a stuffed plush snake.  this is made by the Peterpan shop and is perfect for young kids who think just a bit outside the box or even for a person who loves snakes.  The snake is 60"" from end to end but what I love is the fact that you can coil it up and sit him on a bed or the sofa.  He sits in his coil and his head rises several feet above the center with his crazy eyes and forked tongue coming out of his mouth.The item seems to be quite durable to stand up to the kind of play abuse a young child will give it.  I love the bright green colors and spots.  Kind of reminds me of the snake from Disney's Jungle Book cartoon.  I actually got this guy and gave it to my 3 year old nephew.  He thought it was very funny.  quite a nice item.  Maybe a bit on the pricey side but its unique!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y0RD732W7YEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0130BXFIO#wasThisHelpful","R1Y0RD732W7YEZ","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not sure if the peppermill craze is what it was 10 or 15 years ago but it is still a nice item to have around the house for fresh meals.  I love to use a variety mix of peppercorns and that is what I used my mill for as opposed to just standard black peppercorns.  I really love the stainless steel construction of this unit and its look. It looks like a very highly priced item but at around $25 it is quite reasonable think.  The unit operates on four AA batteries so you know it is fairly powerful for a pepper grinder.The mill is adjustable to get the courseness that you want.  Just push the button on tom and grind away! I found that it works quite well and there was no sticking of the grinding gears.  It really worked well!  The item is easy to take apart to clean and to change out the batteries.  The glass portion is made of acrylic shatter proof glass making this unit quite tough and durable. The grinding gears are made of ceramic and do a great job and will not rust.  I have ceramic knives that I love. iKoo also provides a lifetime warranty so that is another strong selling point to this item.Great item.  Must have for any kitchen.

"I only find that i need a meat thermometer maybe a half dozen times a year but they are always still nice to have.  fore years I have relied on the cheap manual ones that you cook with your meat or put in when you want to check.  but those seem to have a short life when exposed to heat so given the opportunity to try out this one I decided why not.  The probe itself is about 6"" long so you can get it down inside the meat such as in the thick part of the thigh of a turkey.  Thanksgiving is coming up.The probe is attached to a steel braided wire that is 38"" long and goes into the digital display readout.  This means you can monitor the temperature of your foot by running the thin wire outside of your stove and looking at the display without ever having to open the oven and loose the heat.  now that is very cool.  This is designed only to measure the temp of food, not the oven temperature but has a range from 32 degrees all the way to nearly 500 degrees so that is very impressive.  Especially helpful is that you can program the unit to send out an alert once the desired temperature is reached.  I tried this out and also tested against an old manual meat thermometer and found the accuracy just about right on...within a few degrees.  I really like this item.  every home cook needs to have this in their kitchen","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EOD69U9JOF2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013A81VW4#wasThisHelpful","R2EOD69U9JOF2N","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've noticed that my doctors and hospitals have been going back to the old manual blood pressure testers as opposed to the electronic ones.  when i inquired they said they felt them more accurate.  So I was unsure about testing this one out.  Luckily my sister in law is a nurse so when she came over recently i had her bring her manual gauge to test both side by side.  Not only on me, but my wife, kids and a few other people there.  Of course blood pressure can change within just a couple of minutes but I found that the LotFancy tester was surprisingly accurate.  the differences were merely about +/- 3 to 4 each time.  and we probably tried it out at least a dozen times and hours apart.  The pulse meter was also accurate.It runs on AA batteries but can run on DC power but you will need to supply your own adapter as it does not come with one.  the meter is comfortable to use and comes with easy to use instructional manual.  The unit comes with some neat little memory features although to be honest I have not toyed with any of those as of yet.  We all have pretty good blood pressures in our household but it is still a nice thing to have around and check occasionally.

"Washcloths are generally not an item you put a whole lot of thought when buying.  I suppose you find something to match your bathroom colors and then you buy them.  But trust me when I say these washcloths will change the way you think about such an everyday, mundane item.  These washcloths are made from 100% bamboo.  I know what you are thinking...bamboo is not known for being soft and pleasant to the touch.  well I don;t know how these do it but these washcloths are super soft.  They remind me a bit of the kind of soft cloths that you would use when washing your car.  They are absolutely incredible!  And being made of bamboo means they are eco-friendly.Despite the fact that they seem thin and don't have the sort of shag that premium wash cloths have these things are incredibly absorbent.  You really will not believe the amount of moisture that these things can absorb.  While these are great for everyday use, the makers have desinged them specifically for babies.  they are completely Hypoallergenic and contain no dyes or chemicals making them safe for use on your baby.  So yeah we do not have any babies anymore in our family but these are wonderful to shower with.  they feel like you are washing your body with fine silk.  The claim is that they get softer wwhen wet and with usage and they seem to be right!I love these washcloths.

"Not long ago I tested out a similar spy-type item, this one being a keychain.  Now a keychain isn’t a bad item to have a secret camera in but it’s certainly more conspicuous than a pen.  I mean if you’re in a meeting chances are you’re going to look rather silly clicking buttons on your keychain. And frankly it did not work well at all.  It was sometimes wonky to operate and ceased charging after only a few uses. The SpyCrushers spy pen on the other hand is just out of a James Bond movie.  It looks like a good quality ball point pen being black with silver accents.It charges with a mini USB to USB cable.  Once charged (about 6 hours) you are ready to go.  The pen has three functions:  first it can take standard, high res photos.  Second, it can take 720p video.  And third it can operate as a webcam.  Actually call it four functions as yes, you can use it as an actual pen.  Once turned on a single press of the button on top of the pen will take a picture.  The camera lens is right at the top of the pen, just above the pen clip.  The opposite side has a recessed status light.  Pressing the button once snaps off a picture.  Holding the button down for 3 seconds will cause it to begin taking video.  Give it one quick press to stop the video.  For Webcam usage, connect it to your computer via the included Mini USB cable and locate the spy pen under your devices menu.Operation is simple and smooth.  Now…the status light stays on with a tiny green light so if you are REALLY looking to spy then you have to be careful.  If you lay the pen down on a desk or table you want to make sure the side with the light is facing you and not outward.  Fortunately if you are holding the pen and taking pics or video the status light will be facing you as the lens is on the opposite side.Taking photos is tricky.  Obviously you want to be subtle but you also have to make sure you are aiming correctly or else you might find yourself snapping a picture of a desktop instead of the person.  It takes a bit of practice.  Picture quality is nice but not dazzling.  You really have to keep a steady hand when snapping a pic and hope your subject remains steady as well or else you get a blurry pic.  I was actually more impressed with the video.  It was surprisingly crisp and had no issues when moving.It stores pics and videos on an 8GB MicroSD card meaning its easy to pop into your phone for uploading or sharing if you like.  And of course you can hook to your computer to download as well.  The one thing I would suggest is that the Pen clip is on the same side as the lens.  Meaning you can’t clip in on to your shirt collar and take video unless you want an up close and personal video of your collar bone.  If they can redesign and put the clip on the other side, that would be great.  Overall a nice fun item.  Be careful you don’t get caught.I was provided a sample for my unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FJDQQU0WSANL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J3CL3Q6#wasThisHelpful","R1FJDQQU0WSANL","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is no excuse. There is absolutely no excuse now as to why Warner Brothers and DC Comics cannot make Alan Moore and Brian Bolland’s “The Killing Joke” into an animated film (UPDATE: DC has officially announced that it is coming, see here). Justice League: Gods & Monsters proves that “The Killing Joke” is just on the horizon. Clearly, a division has been made in Warner’s DC Animated Universe. On one hand, you have Teen Titans Go! and on the other, Justice League: Gods & Monsters. It is a great time to be a fan of these characters and where DC is going to take us.Justice League: Gods & Monsters marks the return of Bruce Timm to the DC Universe. The man is responsible for shaping our collective perception of how the animated DC Universe should look and sound. The story of Justice League: Gods & Monsters is his own and is set in a universe very different from the one we know. In this universe, General Zod’s son is Superman (voiced by Benjamin Bratt). Kirk Langstrom becomes the Batman (Michael C. Hall) and not Man-Bat. Finally, Wonder Woman (Tamara Taylor) does not hail from Paradise Island, but is, in fact, Bekka, one of the New Gods. They are still heroes, just with a darker approach to how they handle their business.Strange assassins in this universe are killing off the world’s top scientists. They appear through Boom Tubes (transportation devices used by the New Gods) and leave each victim with incriminating evidence implicating the Justice League. The United States government is already on edge with the Justice League and feels that their methods are too violent. They are also beginning to suspect that the Justice League will one day take over the world.In the course of the story, Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman have their unique origins revealed to the audience. Superman was raised my immigrant workers in the US and saw that people only understand force. Wonder Woman left her home after a horrific family coup. Batman, was injected with nanites combined with his own bat formula in hopes of curing himself. It made him incredibly powerful, but he craves blood. Where the story turns personal is when Superman hires one of the scientists to help unwrap Kryptonian technology and the man is brutally murdered. Batman investigates the murder and finds a connection to Will Magnus (C. Thomas Howell), creator of the Metal Men and life long friend to Kirk Langstrom.  All the previously murdered scientists have a connection, they have all worked for Lex Luthor (Jason Isaacs).Our characters are dark, yet still heroes. It is an interesting approach to the icons we know so well, but it makes for a great story and debate. What if Batman was really a monster? If Superman was raised by good people under the boot heel of another, how would that shape his perception of justice. What if you were betrayed by everyone you cared about, but still wanted to do the right thing? These are interesting characters and, hopefully, this is just the first story in this universe. Batman Beyond started off as an animated series and leaped to the comics. Anything is really possible.Justice League: Gods & Monsters is a great twist on familiar characters in a completely unfamiliar universe. At no time did the Bruce Wayne or Diana Prince as we know them appear. You expect there to be some connection or hero from our universe to be the main villain. This just wasn’t the case. The run time of 76 minutes is staggering because there is so much story here that you’ll wonder why Timm isn’t spear-heading the live action DC Universe. This was one of the best Elseworld stories I have ever experienced. It never held back and followed through with all of its characters. Bruce Timm and his team have set the bar very high once again.This is not a film for the kiddies. In fact, it may be the closest thing that DC’s Animated Universe has ever delivered to an R rating. The unholy Trinity of this story eliminates an early threat so violently, that most parents will turn it off. I’ve seen a lot of these animated films and nothing prepared me for this. As a fan and a critic, it was completely refreshing. Just don’t let the kids watch it.If you are discovering DC Comic’s Elseworld premise for the first time, there is a great special feature titled “ALTERNATE REALITIES: Infinite Possibilities” on the Blu-ray. Hopefully, with the success of this film, we will see “Gotham by Gaslight”, written by Brian Augustyn, “Holy Terror” by Alan Brennert, and “Red Son” by Mark Milliar soon. My only complaint on the whole Blu-ray experience is that the animated episodes in “DC Comics Vault” are on the lighter side. Clearly, Justice League: Gods & Monsters needed the 5th episode of the first season of the World’s Greatest SuperFriends titled “Universe of Evil”.Justice League: Gods & Monsters Blu-ray and Blu-ray Deluxe Edition contain the following special features:ALTERNATE REALITIES: Infinite Possibilities – Justice League: Gods & Monsters falls into a category of storytelling where our well-known characters and the worlds they inhabit are re-imagined. This documentary explores the various attempts by writers to have a little fun and tinker with the characters, resulting in exceptional storytelling that posed thought-provoking questions to audiences.CALCULATED RISKS: The Making of Gods and Monsters – Justice League: Gods & Monsters was an idea that pushed the boundaries.  It began with that challenging question writers face: “What haven’t we seen before?”  Bruce Timm and Alan Burnett audaciously answered that challenge, resulting in a fresh and exciting film that forces us to think differently about the DC Universe.The New Gods – Encore presentation of 2010 documentary about Jack Kirby’s New Gods.A Sneak Peak at DC Universe’s Next Animated Movie – An advance look at the next DC Universe animated feature film.Bonus cartoons from the DC Comics VaultJustice League: Gods & Monsters DVD contains the following special features:A Sneak Peak at DC Universe’s Next Animated Movie – An advance look at the next DC Universe animated feature film.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TTU2VYD69UPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPHDB42#wasThisHelpful","R3TTU2VYD69UPN","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gremlins, Innerspace, Explorers, and The ‘Burbs are to name but a few of the gems that Joe Dante has given us. When I heard the premise of Burying the Ex and saw that Dante was directing it, I was all in. His films are always quirky and entertaining. What has always struck a chord with me and his films, is that he truly loves movies (see Trailers from Hell for more proof). Again, this premise of a girlfriend dying and coming back as a zombie was too good to pass up.Max (Anton Yelchin) is in a very mature relationship with Evelyn (Ashley Greene). She doesn’t put up with Max’s dead-beat half-brother, Travis (Oliver Cooper), just like you wouldn’t. Max decides that it is time he and Evelyn move into together, but quickly learns that this was a mistake. Evelyn has mommy issues as well as an insane desire to make sure the planet is completely green. Max, who works in a horror costume store, decides it is time to break up with her. He picks the time and place and is on the verge of doing the deed when Evelyn is killed by a bus. She then comes back from the dead and wants their relationship to continue.Not your normal comedy or zombie film, but at least the third in a new developing sub-genre called  the “zombedy”. The “how” is a Satan Genie that might as well have been lifted directly from the Twilight Zone. The “why” is because Max and Evelyn make a promise to be together forever, a promise she intends to hold him to. The zombifying of Evelyn is really only a metaphor and the story could have just as easily transpired with her being alive and crazy and not letting go. The whole point of the story is that Max has to man up and break up with her. The one down side to this film is that it feels like it takes forever for him to actually do this.As it is with any comedy, there is usually a third character involved that shows our protagonist how good life could be. This character arrives in Olivia (Alexandra Daddario). Introduced early on the film, while Evelyn is still alive, she helps illustrate just how possessive Evelyn is becoming. A second encounter reveals that Olivia and Max are perfect for each other and the dilemma of a zombie stay at home ex-girlfriend plot has to play out.As I mentioned before, the point of the film is Max getting the balls to break up with Evelyn, officially. Here may be an instance where perfect on screen chemistry really hurts a film. Anton Yelchin and Alexandra Daddario nail their scenes in such a way that you want to see the whole story of what happens between the violent climax and the leap to our characters final destiny. In may ways, this film may have been stronger as an actual Twilight Zone or part of a TV horror anthology. Yet, those seem to be too few these days.Burying the Ex is not bad film in the slightest. If you are fan of Joe Dante, zombie films, and even romantic comedies, you will enjoy yourself. You’ll just keep asking yourself why Max can’t pull the trigger or cut off her head. Bliss is clearly waiting in the wings.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13I21XQ6YV0TI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WZNPT5Q#wasThisHelpful","R13I21XQ6YV0TI","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wyrmwood: Road of the Dead hails from Australia and as we know, the Aussies have their own way of doing things. Now the film itself borrows heavily from a great Australian filmmaker, George Miller (Mad Max Saga), and for this we are truly thankful. See, not only do we get a new take on the zombie story (not the Mad Max part), we get a character that controls zombies with their mind.Wyrmwood: Road of the Dead begins with three separate stories. Writer/ director Kiah Roache-Turner brings us up to speed on Benny (Leon Burchill), Brooke (Bianca Bradey), and Barry (Jay Gallagher) as they try to survive, make sense, and find their way in the first days of a zombie world. Each tale is different and puts these characters on an inevitable path to better understanding their new roles as the world falls apart.The majority of time is spent with Benny and Barry as they travel to find Brooke, Barry’s sister. It’s hard not to see the cliche in one character’s desire to find his family. Then again, in that situation, wouldn’t you do the same? Where the story is at its best is with Brooke. An artist by profession, she is the soul survivor of a photo shoot gone wrong. Brooke is captured by the government and experimented on. While she remains uninfected, we quickly start to see that the government has little interest in rallying those with immunity. They are more interested in why these people are immune.Much like A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors, we have a character that can give the zombies a run for their money. Brooke, while being experimented on, discovers she can control the zombies. This becomes the means to her escape and really takes the zombie movie to a new place. I found myself loving the adventures of Barry and Benny, but they didn’t really propel the story forward. The apocalypse fantasy is always a great one to think about. Watching these guys supe up a truck, find out the zombies are emitting a new form of fuel, and learn perhaps a biblical reason for the zombies is fun, it has just been done before.When the film was over, I felt as if I had just finished the third part to a four part story, which is to say Wyrmwood: Road of the Dead has a few loose threads. It has to be taken into consideration that the film was shot only on weekends and over 4 years. It is a kick-ass ride and a journey I recommend that you take. Jay Gallagher’s broken hero looking for his sister is a character you can stand behind. Leon Burchill supplies the right comic relief for any person in this extreme situation. Rounding out our heroes is Bianca Bradey, who locks you with only her eyes in the majority of her scenes. I just wish I could have seen what happened to them next.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F8ZAYBLUBHSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X8ROPM6#wasThisHelpful","R2F8ZAYBLUBHSW","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Pierce, was based upon a real series of murders that took place in Texarkana (Texas and Arkansas) in the late 1940s by a masked man known only as The Phantom.  The film was an early example of a modern slasher film, predating Halloween (1978) by a couple of years.  In that film, the killer was never found or identified.  A showing of the film around Halloween has gone on to become a tradition in the Texarkana area.townCut ahead to modern day Texarkana, sixty plus years after the unsolved murders and a new killer, wearing the same gunnysack mask begins stalking the citizens of the small town.  Jami (Timlin) and her boyfriend Corey are parked out on a remote “lover’s lane” area when they are attacked by the killer.  Corey is killed but Jami escapes and the town is instantly overtaken with fear at the prospect the killer has returned.But of course, it could not possibly be the same man who would now be near 90 years old.  After two more murders the town calls in the Texas Rangers for assistance, led by Ranger “Lone Wolf” Morales (Anderson).  Jami, now living with her grandmother (Cartwright) after the deaths of her parents in a tragic auto accident, begins her own investigation with former classmate Nick, even interviewing Charles Pierce, Jr.(O’ Hare) the son of the original film’s director who has his own theory of who the killer is, revealing a previously forgotten victim of The Phantom.As Jami and Nick try to piece together the events and names from the present to those of over sixty years ago, the bodies begin to pile up.  The killer copycats the original Phantom by murdering his victims in the same way, such as attaching a knife to the end of a trombone, thrusting it repeatedly into the back of a man while playing his dirge.Even though the film is set in 2013 Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon captures a nostalgic feel.  Modern day conveniences are shown, but moderately.  The police still are outfitted in 70s/80s style uniforms.  But the film looks a little too pristine and lacks the raw energy and grittiness of the original.  The other misstep is in eventually revealing the killer.  What made the 1976 film so unnerving is that the killer was never identified, leaving the residents to believe that he could possibly still be living among them, patiently waiting to strike again.  There is a fair amount of gore in the film, certainly much more than the original.The cops portrayed in the movie are among the most useless you’ve ever seen.  There’s a lot of talking, a lot of meetings, and a lot of cleaning up after the scenes of the murders, but there isn’t a whole heck of a lot of investigating going on, particularly when two high school kids can get further along than the entire department.  The police end up as little more than window dressing.On the positive side, the film benefits immeasurably from a fantastic supporting cast.  Brilliant character actors Ed Lauter (The Longest Yard) and Edward Herrmann (The Lost Boys) appear in what would be among their final film appearances before their passing in the past year or so.  Add to that Gary Cole (The Brady Bunch, American Gothic), Veronica Cartwright (Alien), and Denis O’Hare (American Horror Story, True Blood), and the young leads are surrounded by an enormously talented group of veteran actors.  Only Anthony Anderson, known more for lighter, comedic roles, seems out of place.While not a classic, this meta-sequel doesn’t tarnish the image of the original and is a cut above other similar films that have been released recently and hopefully drives people to watch the 1976 film.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PWBCE2ARVZUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VU2L0QU#wasThisHelpful","R3PWBCE2ARVZUM","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of my favorite lower budget horror films of the past few years was 2012’s The Pact, an imaginative and original thriller/supernatural horror written and Directed by Nicholas McCarthy.  The first thing you have to know about the sequel is that McCarththy is not involved and that is NOT a good thing.  The sequel is written and directed by the team of Dallas Richard Hallam and Patrick Horvath.The Pact 2 picks up just a few weeks after the first film in the wake of the bloody rampage of a serial killer Charles Barlow, known as “The Judas Killer.”  June (Luddington) is a crime scene cleaner and aspiring artist living with her boyfriend Daniel (Foster) who is a patrol cop.  A new murder occur which as striking similarities to the Judas Killer’s MO which causes the police to fear there is a copycat killer.  An FBI profiler named Ballard (Fischler), wrapping up his work on the Judas Killer work and decides to investigate.  June meanwhile is having nightmares of murders and sees the first victim in her dreams.pact coverWhen June’s mother becomes another victim of the copycat, she learns that events from her past have set her up as a target for the killer.  Now haunted by the spirits of the two victims, June is desperate for help and reaches out to Annie Barlow (Lotz) who was responsible for killing Barlow in the first film.  The pair attempt to reach out to the spirits for aid before the killer can get to June.The fact that Nicholas McCarthy was not involved in the sequel indicates to me that he told the story he wanted to tell and there is no reason to revisit the events.  Someone else obviously felt differently but the fact is that while The Pact 2 is not a bad film, there was simply no reason for a sequel.  Hallam and Horvath lack McCarthy’s skill for subtle horror and instead go for a bushel full of “gotcha” moments when one of the gruesome spirits shows their face.  They employ this tactic over and over until you expect it around every corner.  The story is needlessly muddled with sub-plots which ultimately play no importance in the story.Caity Lotz and Haley Hudson reprise their roles from the original film with Hudson again playing the spooky psychic, Stevie.  Lotz, who played The Black Canary in the TV series Arrow and will play White Canary in the upcoming Legends of Tomorrow, looks positively bored as she basically sleep-walks performance.  Hudson was again creepy and kooky as Stevie in a role that was far too short.  Patrick Fischler (Mad Men) was terrific as the quirky FBI Profiler Ballard and he steals the show.The Pact 2 is a needless sequel but it has some positives however it helps to see the original first.Blu-Ray ExtrasThe Dark Hereafter (18:00) – A making of/behind-the-scenes feature.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU7G6W9KQCZ0K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VYL4RIA#wasThisHelpful","RU7G6W9KQCZ0K","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love anything LEGO…LEGO sets, LEGO video games, and now of course we have LEGO movies, the latest of which is Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League: Attack of the Legion of Doom.  And yes, that is quite a mouthful!  Like the videogames, LEGO animated are always filled with wit and lively characters that put many live action films to shame.attack 3Justice League: Attack of the Legion of Doom is set in the early days of the Justice League, just after the team is formed.  The JLA’s villains, knowing that none of them can individually take on the league, decide to start their own team.  Led by Lex Luthor, they hold “tryouts” for other villains, challenging them to complete a wickedly fun and slapstick obstacle course.  Now, Luthor, Black Manta, Cheeta, Sinestro, Gorilla Grodd, and Captain Cold join forces to form the Legion of Doom.  However, little does the rest of the team know that behind the scenes Darkseid is actually in control and pulling the strings of Luthor.The attack a secret government installation known as “Area 51” because it is not the old 51 but the “New 52”, get it?  The film is filled with little inside jokes like that which makes it perfect not only for kids but for adult comic book fans as well.  They steal a capsule containing the imprisoned Martian J’onn J’onzz.  Luthor convinces J’onn that the JLA is evil and enlists his aid to defeat them.  In their darkest hour the League finds themselves branded as outlaws and has to save the Earth and their reputations and stop The Legion of Doom.If you’ve played the LEGO videogames, particularly those featuring the DC Comics superheroes, there is simply no way you are not going to enjoy this movie.  It is part animated feature and part videogame come to life.  It features many of the elements that make the games so fun such as the block building action and crazy gadgets that would make any mad scientist drool with envy.  And the many sound effects that you are familiar with from the games are incorporated into the action.  The action is wild as hero battles villain throughout the government facility, power plant, and on the city streets with dazzling and often side-splitting special effects.But all of this would be mere window dressing if it were not for the fabulous characters.  The LEGO versions are tongue-in-cheek caricatures of their comic book versions.  Superman is extra goody two-shoes’ Batman is especially grumpy; The Flash is obnoxiously enthusiastic; and Green Lantern is extra, umm…douche baggy.  The interplay between the characters keeps things humming along in spirited fashion.  Green Lantern and the Flash engage in a juvenile game of trying to outdo each other, all to try and impress Wonder Woman.attack 2The voice-acting is provided by some of the stalwarts of the animation and videogame industries including Nolan North (Batman), John DiMaggio (Lex Luthor),  Troy Baker (Batman), Nolan North (Superman), and Josh Keaton (Green Lantern).

"There comes a time when a premise is just enough to get me to watch a movie. Here, we have Frankenstein’s monster running amok during the American Civil War. It sounds as if it would almost be a story told by Mike Mignola and featuring his creation Hellboy. Throw in a mad scientist, a reluctant time traveler and a Robin (as in Batman’s sidekick) esque Igor and you have something no one has over conceived of before. Is this genre cocktail worth your while?Army of Frankensteins suffers on multiple levels from acting to special effects. The story itself takes a great liberty with history, but then again so did Quentin Tarantino’s Inglorious Basterds. However, in this case, one can’t be so forgiving. Alan Jones (Jordan Farris) is on the verge of proposing to his girlfriend when he is abducted, harvested for organs, and then inadvertently sent back to the Civil War. He arrives in 1864 (which is incredibly important) to discover that “Frankensteins” from the multiverse have arrived. Alan must help Igor (Christian Bellgardt), the very same person who did the aforementioned crimes against him, to set the time stream right. As it was in Back to the Future, Alan potentially could erase his own existence if Solomon Jones (Rett Terrell) doesn’t marry the freed slave/ nurse, Virginia (Raychelle McDonald).The army of Frankenstein’s creations all look exactly the same. This means that the multiverse really isn’t as diverse as we would think. In reality, it is just a simple way to have one actor, Eric Gesecus, play the same monster over and over again on a digital stage. This is one of the many sore thumbs of the movie. It was obviously shot digitally for time and money’s sake, but it lacks any artistic flair, which is the complete opposite of the end title sequence. There are times when the film is perfectly well lit and looks as if it was shot in a field with a cell phone. This is in great contrast to the saccharine love scenes of the film in both the past and present.Camera tricks and special effects really aren’t the problem here. Neither are the store bought mustaches, beards, and brand new Civil War equipment. It is, after all, 1864 and everyone looks like they just rolled out their newest duds for the shoot. I doubt that there was even one real Civil War re-enactor in the whole movie. The main problem with Army of Frankensteins is the story. Alan and Igor are supposed to believably suddenly trust one another. Why? They both want to get home. We are given some of the love story between Solomon and Virginia, but Virginia throws herself at Alan in one scene and we have to ask, again, why? That scene really is the final nail in the coffin if you even made it that far into the film with any hope that it could get better. I pressed on only to find out that President Lincoln is off to Ford’s Theatre a year early (historically, it should be April 14th, 1865) and meets his death in a different way. Again, Quentin Tarantino has changed history, but here they jump the gun completely for no reason. We have monsters other than Frankenstein’s creation, steam punk weapons, even a balloon ride, and it’s just all so boring.The concept here sounds fun, but every once of fun is sucked dry by all those involved save one, Christopher Robinson. Robinson, who plays John Wilks Booth, really does relish in his dark moment in history.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ4KKTMQFUIA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YT9IX16#wasThisHelpful","RQ4KKTMQFUIA9","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Northmen: A Viking Saga is a 2014 historical action film by Swiss director Claudio Fäh whose resume includes Hollow Man 2 and Sniper: Reloaded.  The film follows a group of Viking warriors who have been exiled from their homeland and end up on the shores of Scotland when their ship capsizes.  The group of a dozen or so is led by Asbjorn (Hopper) the son of their former ruler.  He is played by Tom Hopper who has starred in such BBC TV series’ as Doctor Who and Merlin.northmenThe Vikings manage to fend off an attack by Scottish soldiers and capture Inghean (Murphy), the daughter of King Dunchaid.  Asbjorn intends to hold her for ransom in order to guarantee his men’s safe passage off enemy lands.  The King sets a group of Carpathian mercenaries on their trail led by the blood-thirsty brothers Hjorr (Skrein) and Bovarr.  The brothers see the princess as a possible hindrance to their continued employment and have no intention of returning her alive.The motley band of Northmen finds themselves on the run from the mercenaries and their only ally is an unnamed warrior monk (Ryan Kwanten of True Blood).  The Vikings begin a desperate trek across the fortified Scottish landscape, hoping to reach a boat that they can use to make their escape.First and foremost the central flaw in the film finds the savage Viking warriors doing more running than fighting.  One can guess that the thin budget prevented any sort of grand scale battles so we get a thinly-plotted story of this small band in constant retreat, fighting only when cornered, and then we are talking very small scale fights with a handful of combatants on each side.We learn nothing of Kwanten’s “warrior monk” character at all.  Why he decides to help them is never fully explained but he does have a very cool tower with a cool fire trap that they use to keep the mercenaries at bay so they can make one of their many retreats.  He’s also a highly skilled fighter with his quarter staff.When the Vikings finally do stop the engage in combat the fight scenes are exciting, bloody and fairly well choreographed.  There’s a bit too much use of slow-motion but at least no one breaks out their Kung-Fu as is often the case in lower budgeted historical action films.  The make-up and costumes look outstanding if not entirely historically accurate.  This can be excused somewhat as the Vikings have to make do with what weapons they can scavenge after losing most of theirs when their ship capsized.The performances are passable but ultimately forgettable.  Tom Hopper is fine in the lead role although most of the others are stock characters.  They are also hampered by stilted dialog and forced dissention within their ranks.The entire focus of the film is off target.  The film sort of reminded me of the cult gang film “The Warriors” from the 1970s with a group lost outside of their territory and on the run, trying to make it home.  Of course, this film is nowhere near as good as The Warriors but it’s worth a short diversion.Blu-Ray ExtrasNorthmen: A Look inside a Viking saga (12:00)","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS861FWTAMZ3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZCHTQGA#wasThisHelpful","RS861FWTAMZ3B","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This film might have more appropriately titled “Claws” as it is basically “Jaws” with a grizzly bear playing the part of the shark.  Of course there actually WAS a film called “Grizzly” back in 1976 which was sometimes known as Claws.  That was the Golden Age of animal attack movies.  Films like Grizzly, Prophecy, Orca, Manitou, and Day of the Animals all sought to cash in on the popularity of Jaws.grizzly 2Into the Grizzly Maze (originally entitled Red Machine, then changed to Endangered and later to Into the Grizzly Maze) is a throwback to those films of the 70s although with a surprisingly robust cast.  For a film that checks in with a budget of a mere ten million you wonder how they afforded the combined talents of James Marsden, Thomas Jane, Billy Bob Thornton, Scott Glenn, and Piper Perabo.  The film was released on VOD before getting a very limited theatrical release and now arriving on DVD.In a small Alaskan town a large and intelligent grizzly is wreaking havoc.  After several people are killed by the bear, the sheriff (Glenn) orders his deputy Beckett (Jane) to locate the bear.  Beckett, a former hunter, has now become protective of the local bears, tagging and tracking them and making sure poachers are dealt with severely.  While he wants to try and disable the bear with tranquilizers and relocate it, he has to contend with a local hunter, Douglas (Thornton), who is convinced the bear is a rogue and is intent on killing it.Beckett also has to deal with his estranged, ex-con brother Rowan (Marsden) who has returned to town after many years in search of a friend who has gone missing in a section of the forest known as the Grizzly Maze.  Also thrown into the mix is Beckett’s deaf wife Michelle, a conservationist who is in the woods taking wildlife photos.If you remember those 70s films I mentioned you will no doubt remember that most of them were pretty bad and Into the Grizzly Maze certainly lives up to that standard.  While it’s fun to watch all of these talented actors interact with each other they are trapped in a film that is just plain silly and downright clumsy.  The Grizzly bear, while certainly fearsome, isn’t a 25 foot great shark that can swim at 40 mph and disappear beneath the water.  This bear spends most of its time lumbering about and yet these guys, who have grown up hunting since they were kids, and who have hunted bears, can’t hit the broad side of the barn, even when armed with high-powered rifles with scopes.But if just one of these jokers could shoot straight the film would have been over in the first half hour because the plot is so thin.  There is a continual loop of the hunters encountering the bear and either running off or causing the bear to go running off before they encounter it again 15 minutes later.  It culminates in an ending so silly that even the SyFy channel would call foul.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34YA09DBLYHNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z9HSA42#wasThisHelpful","R34YA09DBLYHNS","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Call it 2 1/2 stars.  If I was searching for a quick description of Extinction I would call it 28 Days Later meets 30 Days of Night although unfortunately it is not on a par with either of those films.  Extinction stars Matthew Fox (Lost) and Jeffrey Donovan (Burn Notice, Fargo) co-star in this zombie apocalypse that is too short on action and too long on family drama.extinctionWe are thrust into the middle of a zombie infestation with two men, Patrick (Fox) and Jack (Donovan) and a woman named Emma and her infant.  The infection is similar to that of the type seen in 28 Days later where the victims turn almost immediately into blood-enraged monsters.  Their bus is attacked by infected leaving them to fight their way to safety.  In the process, Emma is bitten, dooming her.  Cut ahead some 9 years and the two men are living in the perpetually snow-covered town of Harmony where it seems the zombies have finally died out.  The baby Lu is now a child and living with Jack.  Despite the fact that Patrick lives right next door the two men no longer have a relationship.Much of the early and middle part of the film explores the strange dichotomy between the two men.  While Jack lives as normal an existence as possible and raising Lu.  Meanwhile Patrick broadcasts a nightly radio show every night to…no one.  Spinning records and rambling incoherently as the isolation begins to take its toll on his sanity.  The two men do not speak and, in fact, Jack becomes agitated when he sees Patrick talking to Lu.While off scavenging supplies in a neighboring town, Patrick encounters the first zombie he’s seen in years although this one is different.  The zombies have evolved over the years to adapt to the colder, snowy climate with thicker skin but are now blind and hunt by sound and smell.  Their bite also no longer infects victims.  Soon the single zombie turns into dozens as they descend upon Harmony to attack the survivors.Extinction had an interesting premise but it was fumbled badly by Director Miguel Ángel Vivas.  The film checks in just short of two hours and is easily twenty minutes too long.  The reason for the tension between Jack and Patrick takes far too long to resolve and frankly is not that interesting.  The world has undergone a cataclysm and these two guys are giving each other the silent treatment yet still living next to each other in town.  The middle part of the film drags interminably.  I found myself playing with my phone, waiting for anything to happen. Nine years hardly seems to be enough time for zombies to have evolved to their new climate.  Since these are adult zombies they would have been around before the outbreak.  There seems little reason for their bite to lose their infection spreading ability.Vivas attempts to salvage the film in the final 20 minutes by staging an all-out assault on Patrick’s house by scores of zombies and if you haven’t already lost interest the final part is at least bordering on exciting.  In the final analysis, however, there’s too much drama and not enough zombies to raise this above mundane.DVD ExtrasThere are 8 very short featurettes including a behind-the-scenes piece and several very short items on visual effects, creature design, and the main characters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAQ8WVVZPJ8BY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010R3ILY6#wasThisHelpful","RAQ8WVVZPJ8BY","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There was a time not too long ago that video stores were as common as the corner gas station.  The mom & pop video stores of the early 1980s gave way to major chains like Blockbuster and Hollywood Video.  It was the golden age of the VHS rental.  It was before the Internet, and before on-demand and streaming services would eventually run the major chains out of business.  One could wander the rows of these stores for hours trying to find a weekend’s worth of entertainment.  Often times the decision on what films to rent was based on one thing…the cover of the VHS tape.In those days, VHS boxes were the equivalent of 1930s pulp magazines.  They featured lurid covers depicting gun-toting tough guys, scantily-clad women, and blood-drenched gore.  The more provocative the better and nothing was off limits.  VHS Video Cover Art explores this amazing, bygone era of VHS box art whose shelf life was literally shorter than the stores from where they were rented.Author Thomas Hodge is himself an illustrator of film art who designed posters for movies like Hobo with a Shotgun, The Heat, and The Innkeepers.  Hodge, a UK resident, gained access to two of the UK’s biggest VHS hoards to compile the book.  Hence the reason why most of the box art in the book comes from UK releases.  Over 240 VHS Box covers are pictured in the book (both back and front covers).  In nearly every example the front cover has an illustration while the back cover generally features scenes from the film along with the usual plot summary.The book is divided into six sections by genre: Action, Comedy, Horror, Kids, Sci-Fi, and Thrillers.  The covers in the action section all seem to follow the standard format of a hero or heroine with big muscles holding an even bigger gun, surrounded by explosions or fire.  If some of the titles are unfamiliar to you, don’t beat yourself up.  Quite often film titles were changed in their overseas releases.  So for example the film depicted in the book called Deathline was released in the U.S. as Texas Godfather.  IMBD is quite handy for looking up these films.The 1980s was also the golden age for the teenage raunchy, sex comedy.  These poorly written and poorly acted films were little more than a reason to present 90 minutes of T&A and damn, were they popular!  What catches your eye immediately though is that the overseas releases frequently featured nudity on both front and back covers.No genre took advantage of shocking covers more than the horror genre.  If I had a dollar for every lousy horror film I rented solely based on the cover…Demons, maniacal killers, zombies, and monsters leapt off the covers and put you in a stranglehold, demanding to be rented.  Covers to films like Neon Maniacs, Slaughterhouse, Sorority House Massacre, and the Stuff, brought back memories both good and bad of Friday nights in front of the TV with your girl on your arm.The names of many of the artists who did these covers have been lost in time but their work lives on.  As Hodge notes, should you be lucky enough to find these films at a garage sale or flea market, make sure you grab them as the collector’s market for the films of this era has grown tremendously and some titles can command several thousand dollars.VHS Video Cover Art is a museum book.  Hodge doesn’t give any information on the titles other than title, distributor, release date and artist (where known) but the book is still a wonderful trip back to an age that will never come around again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L6UZDKPXMA6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764348671#wasThisHelpful","R1L6UZDKPXMA6G","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Herb Trimpe was one of those longtime comic book artists who never got the recognition they deserved when they were working.  However with his passing in April of this year, Trimpe is finally getting his just due as one of the greats in the field during the 1970s and 1980s.  This brand new book from the fantastic TwoMorrows Publishing explores the life of Trimpe along with his long and diverse career in comics.trimpeThe bulk of the book features a book length interview between Herb and writer Dewey Cassell.  Trimpe was born in New York and served in Vietnam.  It was there where he first discovered Marvel Comics in the mid-1960s. He took his work to Marvel where then Production Manager Sol Brodsky hired him immediately, assigning him to several of Marvel’s western comics.  Trimpe discusses those early days, the famous Marvel Bullpen, and those legendary story sessions with Editor-in-Chief, Stan Lee.Trimpe became best known for his long run on The Incredible Hulk which started in 1968 on issue #109.  During the run Trimpe co-created characters like Doc Samson, and most famously…Wolverine!  Trimpe talks about Stan popping his head into the bullpen one day and just asking, “Hey Trimpe.  Do you want to draw The Incredible Hulk?”  The interview section on The Hulk is the longest as Trimpe shares his many memories of working on the character and co-creating Wolverine along with writer Len Wein.Trimpe was a mainstay at Marvel who worked on just about every title the company put out.  He worked on a number of licenses properties at Marvel including The Shogun Warriors, G.I. Joe, Planet of the Apes, Indiana Jones, and Godzilla.  The authors include sections on these various properties, highlighting Trimpe’s involvement.  While Cassell handles the interview with Trimpe, his co-writer Aaron Sultan interviews a number of Trimpe’s contemporaries including John Romita, Joe Sinnott, Roy Thomas, John Buscema, and Herb’s son Alex.Like so many older artists, Trimpe found himself being edged out of work by younger, more popular artists in the 1990s.  He shares his thoughts on being let go by Marvel after 29 years, providing a diary-like narrative of the events which eventually led to his unceremonious firing via a letter from Fed-Ex in 1996.  Never one to let life get him down, he relates how he found new meaning to his work by teaching art in high school and serving as a Chaplin at Ground Zero after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.The book concludes with an amazing gallery of his artwork in both color and black and white which succinctly epitomizes his skill and ability to adapt as an artist.  Although Herb never worked for DC, one of the pieces in the gallery is a commission piece of the Justice Society of America which is very cool.  Finally there is an index to his credits not just at Marvel but for the other companies he worked for as well.Trimpe passed away just as this book went to press and it serves as an informative and heartfelt tribute to a true professional.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D3I353RXDCUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1605490628#wasThisHelpful","R1D3I353RXDCUU","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"the Art of Rocksteady’s Batman takes a look at the groundbreaking videogame franchise that set the gaming world on ear when Batman: Arkham Asylum was released in 2009.  This massive, hardcover book takes a look at the series from concept art to finished design.The book is divided into three parts.  Part one looks at how the small, and relatively unknown studio, Rocksteady, became involved in the project and made their pitch for building the dark and gritty world of Arkham Asylum.The next three parts make up the vast bulk of the book, each one focusing on the three chapters in the trilogy.  In each part, author Daniel Wallace opens the curtains to let fans get a glimpse of the interior workings of Rocksteady.  Wallace gets the inside scoop on the making of the games direct from the source.  For Arkham Asylum that was Art Director David Hego who talks about the designs of the heroes and villains.  DC Comics worked hand-in-hand in the design including artists Jim Lee and Carlos D’Anda.  You’ll see their concept drawings side-by-side with the competed 3D renderings.  Equally important was the design of Arkham Asylum itself.  This section is filled with glorious, full-color paintings of the facility and its brooding, terrifying interiors.  You’ll also read about the game’s fighting system, programming, and reaction from play testers and fans.Arkham City moved the game outside of the claustrophobic environment of the Asylum to give Batman (and players) and entire metropolitan area to explore.  Game Director Sefton Hill guides readers though the design of Gotham City, from its unique architecture to its transportation systems, and its many landmark buildings.  You’ll see how character designs were modified and Batman’s gear was upgraded and improved to face the many new challenges.Next up is the latest entry in the series, Arkham Knight, the concluding part of the trilogy.  One again, it is Game Director Sefton Hill as our guide as Batman must face off against his most deadly foes in a Gotham City that has been thrown into chaos.  Gotham is brought to life like never before in the final installment.  Once again a multitude of new gadgets and vehicles were designed to utilize.The book is jam packed with hundreds of color images that fully captures the incredible artistic and design detail that was needed to bring the dark world of Arkham Asylum and Gotham City to life.  I have reviewed a lot of these art design books over the years and while they are always gorgeous and feature stunning images, sometimes the content/page count is a little slight.  Not so here…this book clocks in at a stout 304 pages making it well worth the $40 cover price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OYEH4GGFFFIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=141971385X#wasThisHelpful","R3OYEH4GGFFFIS","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife has been wanting one of these expandable hoses for some time. Ohuhu makes these hoses in several different lengths and this one expands to 50' which is great for keeping either the front or back yards.  One thing that this one has that the other 150' Ohuhu hose doesn't is the 8 in 1 spray nozzle.  the nozzle has a dial that you can turn to spray the hose in 8 different patterns depending on your needs.The hose fills and expands quickly, almost like magic and again the lightweight nature is its major advantage over the rubber hoses. once the water is shut off the hose contracts on itself to make it easy to roll up and store away. Despite its lightweight, the jacket is made of a tough, polymer material that stands up well to being dragged across our driveway. Of course, we have only used it for a few weeks now so time will be the true test to see if this stands up over the long haul. Will it be able to handle our diverse michigan seasons where it can get sweltering hot in the summer but then be below freezing for months at a time during the winter. I certainly hope so! Unlike our rubber hose, I think we will store this one in the garage during the winter just to be safe and because it is so lightweight the moving it around is easy for me, my wife or my kids.I think at $35 with the nozzle this is indeed a fine bargain and a very good hose.  I was provided a sample for my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R265YY6BZGL5GK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CU1YQE#wasThisHelpful","R265YY6BZGL5GK","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So here is the thing with this sleeping bag. We all know sleeping bags are big and bulky.  If you're just having your kid over a friends house for an overnight or something like that maybe you don;t mind big and bulky because you're not taking a lot of other stuff.  But if  you are going camping or backpacking and carrying your gear the last thing you want is to be weighed down even further.  This is where the Ohuhu sleeping bag really comes in handy as a valuable item.when this bag is folded (with some effort) and put back into its carrying bag, it is only about 12"" by 5"".  Now that is small enough that it can actually fit into a backpack or a duffel bag and be easily carried.  at under 2lbs you will barely notice you are carrying this compared to the traditional sleeping bags.  Because it is made of nylon on the outside and filled with polyester it is very lightweight and resistant to water.however being lighter weight does have its drawbacks.  it isn't nearly as padded as traditional bags so you may need a phone pad or use this lying on a cot or something if you want to be more comfortable at night.  It's also not going to work well in cold temps.  They suggest an ideal of now lower than 59 degrees and even that might be pushing it so its probably not the best choice for fall or winter outdoors.  on the other hand its perfect for Summers in the back yard.The bag isn't real large so if you are above average height or weight it might be too snug however you can actually buy two of these and zip them together to make one larger bag so that is a unique idea.  At $35 it is a reasonable price and a solid buy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GNHC4X7SSFMS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012VS8J5Q#wasThisHelpful","R1GNHC4X7SSFMS","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was provided a sample for review.  Now THIS is a genius item.  People wonder how others become rich and it is with items like this.  This Gecko Parasheet Bach Blanket will change everything you know about what a beach blanket was.  Ok so Beach Blankets...you take them to the beach and you are walking in sand.  you step on your beach blanket and you get sand all in it's fibers.  You go into the water and come out and lie down on your usual sort of cotton beach blanket and soon the blanket is soaked and you are just sitting there on a soggy, sand-filled mess.With its nylon construction, this item doesn't absorb the water like regular towels or blankets do.  It will dry in minutes and sand is easily brushed right off.  This already makes it better than any other regular beach blanket but there's so much more.  The corners  have sand pockets which you fill with sand to keep the blanked weighted down while you are in the water or getting a hot dog or whatever.  no more worrying about the towel blowing away.The Gecko Parasheet is quite large, 7' by 6.5' so two people can easily lie down on it.  yet it is thin and lightweight enough that it can be folded down to fit into the tiny 6' x 8"" carrying bag that comes with it.  You can easily fit it in a beach bad or clip it on to your purse or even a belt with the clip that comes attached to the bag.  But this item is also versatile.  Take it to the park for picnics or two watch a fireworks show or wherever.  You can put it in your car to cover your seats to keep them cool on hot days and even hang it up to use it for shade.  A truly genius item.  I love this and its a great value as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34J6O2ET2MBDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WZP6QRO#wasThisHelpful","R34J6O2ET2MBDV","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This truly is a 1950s Retro dress.  It has that look of 1950s film that is dressy without being too dressy.  I mean you could see a woman back in the day wearing this to a soda shop or out for a nice dinner.  I think it is that versatile.  The dress comes in an entire rainbow of different solid colors as well as floral prints and even polka dots for a truly retro look.  It is basically a sleeveless dress.  it has cap type sleeves which just cover the shoulder. I think it looks best on a woman of thin to moderate build but that is just my personal opinion.It comes in 6 sizes from small to 3X.  I got a small as a gift for a friend who is petite and she said it fits great.  The material feels quite comfortable and its not too heavy which is a good things since my friend lives in Georgia.  its materials allow for a bit of stretching for a comfortable fit.  The dress is pleated although it comes shipped in a plastic bag rather than in a box so you have to expect it will arrive a little bit creased.This is a dress that would look great on a woman who is wearing pearls and high heels.  Its a very nice dress for a moderate price and both my friend and I am very impressed.  I was provided a sample for my honest opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11SW898N0CN3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0122YKNBW#wasThisHelpful","R11SW898N0CN3H","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was sent a sample for my honest review. My wife has never been one to wear a lot of jewelry and she's way more concerned with the look rather than the price. That said she really loves this cute little snowflake necklace. It is about 18' in length. the snowflake charm is 18K Rose Gold plated with 13 sparkling cubic zirconias comprising the charm.for such an inexpensive item the necklace and charm looks to be quite well made. I love the craftsmanship and design of the pendant which makes it look like a far more expensive item than it is. This makes a nice alternative to the platinum plated necklace that Bamoer sells as the Rose colored gives it a different look.  The stones really catch the light and sparkle with brightness. This is a nice accent piece for causal or dress.

"Perhaps more than any other type of genre, horror has a legacy that is handed down through the generations and becomes the inspiration for new horror writers and filmmakers.  The legacy of horror is at the core of this fun and fantastic new book from Schiffer Publishing.  John Edgar Browning (and boy is that a name that exudes horror) takes readers on a trip down horror’s memory lane from the silent era to the present and collects the memories of leading horror writers, editors, anthologists, and historians who wax poetic about some of their favorite and most influential horror films.Some of the noted commenters include Ramsey Campbell, David Drake, Don Glut, Marvin Kaye, Kim Paffenroth, David J. Skal, Brian Stableford, Tony Timpone, and F. Paul Wilson, to name just a handful.  In all there are nine chapters covering the decades of the 1920s to the 2000’s, along with a foreword by David J. Skaal and an afterword by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro.Each chapter features still pics or original movie poster of the film in question along with the commenter’s memories of that particular film.  These also feature some views of rare overseas versions of posters or lobby cards.  But these are not just vaporous comments about how they saw it as a kid, blah, blah, blah, but generally more of a discourse on why the film is so important along with liberal doses of interesting anecdotes such as Leslie Klinger’s comments on the Spanish language version of Dracula from 1931 and why he feels it is vastly superior to the Tod Browning/Bela Lugosi version.For me the book works not only as a scrapbook of horror movie memories, but also a tome collecting images of hundreds of original film posters.  Lastly, Browning features a comprehensive list of suggested reading for horror fans of both fiction and non-fiction books written or edited by his vast roll call of contributors.  Whether your tastes run from the Universal horror classics, 1950s giant monsters, the Hammer horror films, or today’s modern slasher films, this is a book you’ll be happy to add to your library.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GF9X42IRSUZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764340824#wasThisHelpful","R2GF9X42IRSUZ3","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lovely Molly is written and directed by Eduardo Sanchez.  If that name sounds vaguely familiar, you may recall that Sanchez also wrote and co-directed the phenomenal indie hit The Blair Witch Project and then went on to do, well, not much.  Sanchez hauls out a lot of the old plot devices and tricks for Lovely Molly but they all seem tired and have a distinct “been there, done that” quality to them.Molly, a recovering heroin addict has just married Tim and moved into her late father’s country house.  Tim is a truck driver and thus is on the road a lot, leaving Molly alone in the big, brooding house.  Molly begins to experience a rash of chilling experiences including ghostly whispering and sobbing, doors rattling and opening by themselves, and visions (hallucinations) of something terrifying.Molly continues to descent into madness and terror and behaving erratically including simulating being raped at work which she believes was real.  She begins stalking her neighbors, spying on them with her video camera, watching both mother and daughter.  As her family tries desperately to help her including older sister Hannah, Molly falls back into her addiction and soon is beyond help.Is Molly possessed by something evil in the house?  Is she haunted by the spirit of her deceased father?  Or has she just gone mad?  Sanchez hints at all of these as possibilities but that’s all he does is hint…tantalize, but never does he fully embrace molly’s true problem.  The blu-ray offers several featurettes which explore each of these possibilities and one even claims that cast and crew experienced strange happenings at the real life Maryland country house while filming but I suspect that was just Sanchez trying to sell the film’s premise much like he tried to do with Blair Witch.Lovely Molly isn’t particularly chilling or suspenseful.  It has a woefully slow pace which had me nodding off a couple of times.  It does have a couple of fine performances, particularly from Gretchen Lodge as Molly but this one is strictly a rental if there’s nothing better available.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3897BS8SYREWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007UQ8IT2#wasThisHelpful","R3897BS8SYREWB","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pulp magazines were considered the lowest rung of the literature ladder.  They were the successors to the penny dreadfuls and dime magazines of the 1800s.  They were produced using the cheapest possible paper.  Often times, the writers and artists who worked in pulps did so under pen names because of stigma that came with working on such fantastic stories.  But that artwork, once considered so disposable is now highly sought after today both in the form of the magazines themselves as well as the original artwork.This was an industry dominated by male artists like Virgil Finlay, Frank R. Paul, Edd Cartier and others, but perhaps the greatest pulp artist of all was a female artist, Margaret Brundage.  Brundage’s art became notable for working on perhaps the most famous of all pulp magazines, Weird Tales.  But it was not only working on Weird Tales that Brundage was fortunate to work on but also the fact that she did the covers for many of the Weird Tales that featured Robert E. Howard’s Conan the Barbarian.Vanguard Production’s fabulous books looks at Brundage’s incredible career in pulp art which featured some of the most shocking and lurid covers ever seen; covers that depicted full nudity and scenes of bondage and torture not only for Weird Tales but also Magic Carpet and Golden Fleece.  Brundage drew covers depicting Howard’s barbarian hero for stories like The Devil in Iron and Queen of the Black Coast and while they are a far cry from the depiction of Frank Frazetta’s considered the standard of all Conan artists, Brundage got there first.The book features a rare, 1973 interview with Brundage who was in her 70s by this time and had all but been forgotten.  She talks about her life and career in the pulps, particularly working for Weird Tales.  The book also includes every cover she did for Weird Tales.  But this is actually two books in one.  The second part, written by J. David Spurlock called “The Secret Life of Margaret Brundage” looks at a facet of her life which till now was largely unknown, that of a key player in counterculture and activism in worker’s rights and racial equality.  Spurlock uncovers incredible details about the her life which goes well beyond her career as an artist.Vanguard has never failed to enthrall me with their incredible line of books and The Alluring Art of Margaret Brundage is another winner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F4M0E39Y8B9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1934331503#wasThisHelpful","R1F4M0E39Y8B9M","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What kid hasn’t gone to bed at night thinking there was a monster lurking under his bed or in his closet?  Under the Bed expands on that idea but fails to actually run with it.  Teenager Neal Hausman has returned home after living out of state with family for two years.  Neal was sent away by his father, Terry, after the death of his mother in a fire, which local gossip blames on Neal.Neal’s reunion is not a happy one.  His always angry father is on him constantly to group and be a man, and his new stepmom is trying too hard to get to know him.  All Neal cares about is his little brother Paulie.  He discovers that Paulie is being tormented by the same evil entity that lived under Neal’s bed, turning his nights into living nightmares.  Dad dismisses the boy’s claims of monsters as foolish nonsense, locking them in their room at night.  But there is something underneath their bed, something which creeps out and forces the boys to sleep on their dressers at night.  They have to destroy the creature before it destroys their family.Under the Bed is an interesting concept but Director Steven C. Miller and Writer Eric Stolze fail to do much with the idea.  Unlike similar films like Darkness Falls or The Boogeyman, Under the Bed fails to develop much of a mythology to capture the viewer’s interest.  What is the monster?  Where does it come from?  Why is it haunting these two particular boys?  Those questions are never answered and as such, the film plays like an extended episode of Goosebumps.  Furthermore Miller contradicts himself when in one part, Neal says the monster is bound to their beds, but in another, the creature harasses stepmom Angela in the garage laundry room and later shows up at the neighbor’s house when the boys are spending the night.The two leads Jonny Weston and Gattlin Griffith do a strong job throughout, particularly in conveying the sense of stress that comes with sleep deprivation but they simply are not giving much to work with.  Add to that cheap creature effects and Under the Bed should have remained there permanently.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19TWDEX74GA6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C2R122Y#wasThisHelpful","R19TWDEX74GA6Q","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Ghost Rider Marvel Select figure features the Johnny Blaze version of the character which has always been my preferred version.  He comes dressed in his blue jumpsuit with black gloves and boots.  Marvel Select is always first rate when it comes to paint jobs and Ghost Rider is no difference.  Unlike many of the more mass market action figures that are often lacking in details, this figure has a first rate sculpt and paint scheme.  Not only are folds molded into his pants and coat but the folds are accentuated by black paint to emphasize the texture and shading in the outfit.  The outfit is also sketched with smudges and scrapes to reflect Johnny Blaze’s profession as a stunt motorcyclist.Ghost Rider’s head is the strongest aspect of this figure.  Look at it closely…the skull itself is painted in a light gray color as opposed to white.  The teeth are incredible and outlined in fine, dark lines.  There are flecks of darker gray or perhaps even brown throughout the skull which gives the head an aged look.  Ghost Rider’s head is shrouded in flames that is molded in a translucent orange plastic and highlighted with yellow paint that makes the figure appear to glow when in front of a light.  The flames however are going backward instead of straight up as if he’s riding his motorcycle and the flames are being blown back.Ghost Rider is articulated at his neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles.  The hip articulation only allows the leg to move forward and back, not out and in which does limit the posability a bit but is also fairly standard.  Movement of the head is limited by the wide color of his suit as well.  Ghost Rider comes with a base that is a flaming piece of road that features four hands reaching up out of Hell and through the road to try and grab him.  One of the hands actually fits over his foot when put onto the base which lends to the look that he is being grabbed by a minion from Hell.  The base has the same kind of translucent orange plastic with yellow flame highlights.Now some people have complained that a problem with the figure is that it does not come with a motorcycle.  Adding a motorcycle would also have added to the cost I think.  Ghost Rider has to get off his bike often to fight so I don’t have a problem with this exclusion.  And again, the base with the fiery hands makes it great for display.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R197SAM4V7GP1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NVLJP6#wasThisHelpful","R197SAM4V7GP1E","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hey look all of us who are action figure fans love Marvel Select figures from Diamond Select Toys but if you missed them upon initial release the only way to get them was on the secondary market and often at inflated prices.  Thankfully Diamond Select sees fit to throw collectors who missed these figures a bone now and then by re-releasing some of these classic figures.  This time are giving us Ghost Rider and The Green Goblin.The Green Goblin is the original John Romita version which was inspired by the cover to Amazing Spider-Man #39 from 1966 featuring a triumphant Green Goblin with Peter Parker, exposed as Spider-Man, tied up and helpless.  The Goblin comes with his Goblin Glider which fits onto a display base, pumpkin bomb, and satchel.  The first thing that stands out about this figure is the maniacal look on the Green Goblin’s face.  His bright yellow eyes are wide and crazed as he smiles a tooth-bearing grin.  Meanwhile, Peter Park has a grimace of pain on his face as he struggles to free himself.The detail on the Goblin is fantastic, with small raised dots on the green portions of his body to give the look of scales that are mixed with bulging vessels on his thigh and bicep muscles.  His purple shirt, boots, gloves and hat have a textured look with folds and touches of black paint to bring out the shading.  With 12 points of articulation, GG isn’t as articulated as other Marvel Select figures.  He is jointed at the neck, shoulders, gloves, wrists, waist, hips, boots and ankles.  The only problem with the figure is that he’s molded solid at the knees in a permanent crouch which means that he’s only going to look right if posed on his Goblin Glider.  I’m not crazy about that but at he does have a good amount of flexibility when put on the glider.  Otherwise he’s looking as if he’s crouching down to take a dump.  In the crouched position he stands about 5” tall and the wingspan of the glider is a little over 6”.The Peter Parker figure is molded solid so it has no movement and is about 6 ” long.  Parker is dressed in white dress shirt and green pants (green pants?) which are torn open to reveal his Spider-Man costume since this was the issue that The Green Goblin discovered Parker’s secret Identity.  Thus, while cool, the Parker figure is a mere accessory.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R164ILO1EPWPM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006JFV8G#wasThisHelpful","R164ILO1EPWPM9","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Demented is another entry into the zombie film genre, this one drawing its inspiration from films like 28 Days Later where the “zombies” are actually people who are infected with a rabies like disease making them crazed and attacking anyone they see with abandon AND full speed but also meaning they can be killed as normal humans are as opposed to just shooting them in the head.  The Demented has a couple of things going for it that other low-budget films of similar ilk do not. Often times in zombie films we hear about the infected being the result of some viral or biological outbreak but rarely do we see it actually happen.  This is not the case with The Demented.Six college friends have gathered at the friend Howard’s home in Louisiana (while their parents are away) for a weekend of sun, fun, and beer.  Howard receives a call from his father about a possible terrorist attack along the Gulf Coast but the phone goes dead before he can gather any details.  Soon after, a missile strikes in the distance, causing a plume of green smoke to mushroom up on the horizon.  As the group of friends debate their next move the first indication of trouble comes in the form of a dog with a chewed off ear and flies buzzing about its head that attacks them, causing them to take refuge in the house.  Soon after, several salivating maniacs come crashing through the windows of the house, scattering the group.  As the small group of friends takes refuge in an upstairs bedroom, they realize that they have to somehow get to their car and get away to find safety.I mentioned a couple of things that the film has going for it…the second is that the infected stand absolutely motionless when they don’t have a target on which to focus.  In this regard they are similar to the Nurses in the Silent Hill videogame and film franchise.  This adds an element of creepiness to the infected as there are several scenes where the group attempts to sneak by them while they are motionless.  Director/Writer Christopher Roosevelt keeps the action moving for the most part, giving us just enough character development even though it might be stereotypical such as the white kid who is going to be a lawyer while the black kid is the football star.  There’s an unnecessary bit of drama involving one of the girls sleeping with another’s boyfriend that ultimately goes nowhere.The male actors are frankly boring and wooden in their delivery but the female leads including Kayla Elwell (The Vampire Diaries) and Sarah Butler (I Spit on Your Grave) are vastly superior and fun to watch.  The makeup effects are strictly bargain basement but the infected run so fast that you rarely get a decent look at them anyway.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AFGFHUTOKASM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CC31UJI#wasThisHelpful","R2AFGFHUTOKASM","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There’s an old saying that if you can’t dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them will bull***!  After watching Twixt, I’m not sure if Director Francis Ford Copplola has dazzle me or baffled me…I suspect it’s a bit of both.  Coppola returns to the horror genre as Director for the first time since 1992’s “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” in this offbeat supernatural thriller about a child killer, vampires, and the ghost of Edgar Allan Poe.Val Killmer plays a struggling horror-writer named Hall Baltimore who cranks out cheesy, low-brow horror novels after having been praised as a hot new talent earlier in his career.  In some ways Baltimore mirrors Kilmer’s own acting career which has been treading water since having starred in several major roles in the 80’s and 90s.  Baltimore arrives in a small, off-the-beaten-path town for a book store signing only to find that the town’s bookstore is located inside the hardware store.Baltimore meets the town sheriff Bobby LaGrange (Bruce Dern) who fancies himself a horror writer and wants to collaborate with Hall on a story about a mysterious serial killing in the town and the mysterious body he has in his morgue with a stake driven through the victim’s heart. Baltimore is plagued by the usual troubles…financial worries, alcoholism, a demanding editor, as well as dealing with the tragic loss of his daughter in a boating accident.  Hall is also battling writer’s block, desperately trying to find a new direction for his next book.He may have found it in LaGrange and the strange town.  When he sleeps…or gets knocked out…Hall begins to have strange nightmares…Meeting a ghostly young girl named “V” (Elle Fanning) as well as the spirit of Edgar Allan Poe.  This dreamland is created by cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr., with an ethereal quality that is filmed primarily in black and white but with splashes of color thrown in such as the lips and cheakbones of “V”.  The film has a similar feel to 1988’s “Lady in White” with its combination of supernatural horror and small town murder mystery.Poe acts as Baltimore’s guide through the dreamworld, revelaing the horrors of a pastor who murdered several children in the 1950s to keep them from becoming corrupt…and of the one girl who managed to escape—“V”.  Coppola throws a lot of elements at the viewer:  V, Poe, the serial murders, Sheriff LaGrange, and group of gothic punks who LaGrange believes are vampires.  Twixt tends to be muddled with all of these elements but somehow they still coalesce into an above average filmKilmer is perfect as the life-weary writer.  Bruce Dern, a veteran for over 50 years does crazy character actor as well as anyone.  Fanning and Ben Chaplin as Poe, round out an eclectic supporting cast.  And in a bit role, Don Novello plays Melvin who maintains the town clock.  Novello is best known for playing Father Guido Sarducci on Saturday Night Live in the 1970s and 1980s.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27D9VMULGFNQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CLFS8JW#wasThisHelpful","R27D9VMULGFNQ6","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sarah (Kate Bosworth) has invited her childhood friends Lou (Lake Bell) and Abby (Katie Aselton) to return to a remote island off the Main cost that they once spent time at in their youth.  She leads them there to try and repair the estranged relationship between the two women after Lou had slept with Abby’s fiancée years earlier.  While camping, the girls meet three younger men who have come to the island to hunt.  The men reveal they are all former military vets who were dishonorably discharged for an incident in the Middle East.  A drunken Abby begins flirting with Henry, leading him off into the woods.  But when he tries to rape her, Abby hits him in the head with a rock, accidentally killing him.  Now, Henry’s two friends Derek and Alex are out for revenge against the three women, hunting them down on the tiny island.Black Rock is another one of these empowered women fighting back films similar to I Spit on your Grave and Girls Against Boys.  This one falls somewhere in the middle of those two films being not nearly as good as I the former but not nearly as awful as the latter.  The problems are numerous.  First, Aselton, who also serves as the film’s director, does a poor job of building sympathy for her character.  Henry actually ignores several of Abby’s drunken advances before she runs off to the woods to go to the bathroom and uses a flashlight to get his attention and lead him into the woods.  Once there, it is she who throws herself at him.  Ok, Henry ignored her demands to stop but why even play the scene like this to begin with?  Why create shades of grey in a film that has such a predictable plot?Even worse, the characters are not very bright.  One can hardly imagine these guys surviving in a war zone when three trained ex-soldiers, armed with high-powered rifles and shotguns, can’t manage to find three unarmed girls from the suburbs…and CANNOT tie them up well enough to keep them from escaping when they do capture them.  Derek has several opportunities to kill the women but prefers to be a two-bit melodramatic villain and preen gleefully.  If he had a mustache he would no doubt have been curling it in his fingers.  The female characters are irritably predictable.  Despite their feud, Abby and Lou finally make amends, bonding in the buff in a gratuitous nude scene that was completely unnecessary.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXC9H1AW1NNSA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPN933U#wasThisHelpful","RXC9H1AW1NNSA","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"17-year-old Eli has moved with his parenets from the city to the backwoods of Kentucky to work on the depleted farm of his father’s boyhood friend, Waylon (Brad Douriff).  Eli’s father Bud is angry and abusive both to him and his mother.  After one of his verbal and physical assaults, Eli runs into the woods where he meets a pretty and mysterious local girl Amanda.  The two are immediately attracted to each other and form a bond.  However when Eli finds an old fenced in area of the woods, Amanda warns him not to enter.When Eli mentions meeting Amanda to Waylon, the normally affable man becomes enraged, telling Eli to stay away from her.  It is soon revealed that everyone from Waylon, to Amanda, to Eli’s parents are harboring old secrets that have been buried for years.  When Eli disobeys Amanda by climbing the ancient fence, he finds the body of a young girl, hung by her neck in a tree.  It is now Amanda who becomes infuriated, threatening to harm EliLast Kind Words is a slow-moving, low energy supernatural thriller that never engages the viewer.  The plot is predictable and doesn’t try to hide it.  On top of that it’s just plain silly and loaded with padding that makes it seem even longer than 87 minutes.  A sub-plot with Eli’s old girlfriend sneaking out from the city to visit him is a prime example of an added plot threat that serves no purpose other than to up the running time.The acting is also substandard by everyone involved including the veteran Douriff.  I know he has specialized in these off-kilter roles for decades but just when you thought he might have a chance to play a more normal role, he makes the predicted turn to bat-crap crazy.  Spencer Daniels who plays Eli, is an experienced young actor with a cherub-like face but he doesn’t have the mettle to carry the bulk of the film as he is being asked to do.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L4MXSOJRTK6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJB2GDI#wasThisHelpful","R2L4MXSOJRTK6H","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in 2010 as “Shelter” overseas, the film was retitled “6 Souls” for its U.S. release.  Julianne Moore is a psychiatrist named Cara who has specialized in debunking claims of multiple personality disorder.  She receives a call from her father, Dr. Harding (Jeffrey DeMunn of The Walking Dead) who is also a Psychiatrist about a patient he wants her to see.  She meets David (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a wheelchair-bound young man.  When David receives a call from Dr. Harding, he immediately transforms his personality into a man called “Adam”, who is able to get up out of the wheelchair and walk without any problem.Cara looks into the histories of both of the man’s personalities, convinced he created the personality after reading about them in newspapers.  Yet when she tracks down David’s mother (Francis Conroy of American Horror Story), and has her meet the man, he knows details about David’s life that he could not possibly know.  Things grow more terrifying as David begins to display other personalities…personalities of people who have recently died.  As she begins to doubt her theory, her investigations take her to the rural hill country where she meets a blind old woman called “Granny” who reveals that David is something much more terrifying than simply a man with a mental disorder.I enjoyed 6 Souls for about the first two-thirds and then it sunk like a stone.  There was nothing wrong with the introduction of the supernatural elements of the story until they became a convoluted mess about fire and brimstone preacher in the 1910’s who lost his faith in God and became possessed by an evil force that is never clearly defined.  The last twenty minutes of the film is just about beyond comprehension that leaves you shaking your head over what just happened when it concludes.  It’s too bad…the film had some promising elements and is bolstered by an exceptional cast but ultimately tries to get too cute for its own good.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWGHFC4MOXB24/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C7T0EPS#wasThisHelpful","RWGHFC4MOXB24","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book takes a look at another one of 2013’s summer blockbusters, World War Z.  This book presents a huge volume of production art, design sketches, storyboards, and full color photos presented alongside of the film’s full shooting script which makes it quite a bit different than the Pacific Rim book reviewed above.The book takes you through the various settings in the film such as Philadelphia, The huge flotilla, Korea, Jerusalem, and Wales.  Qutotations from Director Marc Forster, as well as the Second Unit Director, Visual and Animation effects Supervisors, and cast members.Presenting the book with scripts is cool but doing so takes away from a lot of the behind-the-scenes info you get in the Pacific Rim book.  All of the art is fantastic but it has the feel more of a scrapbook than one that is truly informational. Even the last couple of sections dealing with the zombies and green screen films are more just collections of photos and stray comments as opposed to any comprehensive data on the productions.While it’s certainly a gorgeous book to look at, there’s probably not enough here for film fans to truly sink their teeth into, no pun intended.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37I83342V1JAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781168857#wasThisHelpful","R37I83342V1JAM","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Making of featurettes are common extras on DVD and Blu-Ray releases but with the release of Guillermo del Toro’s Pacific Rim, we get a behind-the-scenes “making of…” in book format.  This 160 page, full color hardcover book from Insight Editions documents the production of this big screen blockbuster from concept to finished product.Del Toro himself provides the book’s Foreword and writer David S. Cohen takes you on a tour of the film’s production.  We meet Travis Beacham, the screenwriter and learn about the development of the script and its influences in the Giant Kaiju films of Japan.  You will meet the characters in the film in photos, concept art, and text detailing their vital statistics like height, weight, birthdate, rank, etc…But of course whe most people are going to be interested in are the monsters and the mechs.  The book is filled with fantastic art and photos of both including a ton of pre-production sketches, storyboards, and concept art.  It also includes their backstories and vital stats.Making the book geared towards collectors is the number of re-production items included in the book such as ID Badges, blueprints, stickers, anti-kaiju Propaganda posters.  Sections also detail stunt work, special effects, principal shooting, post-production, and so much more.  There is just a wealth of information in the book that is a great accompaniment to the film itself.

"If you grew up in the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s then you are a proud “monster kid”.  You grew up in the Golden Age of great monster magazines like Famous Monsters of Filmland, The Monster Times, and comic magazines like Creepy, Eerie, Vampirella, Nightmare, and Witches Tales.  You also grew up in the golden age era of horror film hosts.  In that era nearly every big city, and many smaller cities had a locally produced program, usually Friday or Saturday nights which showed old horror films and was hosted by various quirky and crazy characters.You had Zacherle in Philadelphia and later New York; Morgus in New Orleans; Chilly Billy in Pittsburgh; Ghoulardi in Chicago; and Count Core De Vol in Washington, DC, to name just a few.  One of the earliest on the scene was Chicago’s Shock Theatre host, Marvin who debuted in December 1957.  Don Glut’s book takes you back to those days from a fan’s first hand perspective.  So taken with Marvin there is a picture in the book of Glut at his 14th birthday party, dressed exactly like Marvin in all black complete with turtleneck sweater and sunglasses.Glut is able to transport readers back in time over 50 years to that fateful night in 1957 when Marvin hit the airwaves.  Glut’s memory is so sharp and vivid that you can picture yourself sitting up close to that black & white TV as Marvin opens the show by descending the cellar stairs to welcome the viewers.  Glut even recalls what films were shown each week…or at least he has done his research.  Glut delves into the early beginnings of horror hosts around the nation and how Chicago got its own part of the Shock Theatre pie.Glut’s reminiscences are aided by the inclusion of dozens of archival photographs from the show, including promotional shots, behind-the-scene shots, and stills taken directly from the show.  There’s even one with a young Glut meeting his idol.  Glut takes you from beginning to the bitter end when the show was canceled in 1959 despite a voracious letter campaign to save it.  Glut even includes several of these letters in the book.  Glut concludes with a fond look at the last show and follows that up with history of what happened to Marvin AKA Terry Bennett, after the show left the airwaves.For fans of old horror films or old horror movie hosts, I cannot recommend this book any more emphatically.  Glut takes us back to an era that will never come around again.  An era when movie monsters were cool and horror movie hosts were even cooler.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU70XJJEB1V1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078646805X#wasThisHelpful","RU70XJJEB1V1X","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to magazine work I always associate Richard Corben first with Heavy Metal.  But before he worked for that magazine he did some 40 stories for legendary magazines Creepy & Eerie from Warren Publications.  Now, all 40 of Corben’s groundbreaking stories are gathered together in this huge 300 plus page hardcover tome, courtesy of Dark Horse comics.  Once again, Dark Horse steps up to the plate and brings classic work back into the light.The 40 stories include both black & white and color stories with full story credits and a gallery of Corben’s Creepy and Eerie cover gallery.  If all you’ve ever seen is Corben’s color work, you are in for an incredible treat.  Corben was always known for his vibrant and innovative use of color but his black & white work takes on the same lush quality in its shades of gray tones.Some of the stories are written by Corben while others are written by some of the top comic writers of the 1970s like Doug Moench, Bill Dubay, Gerry Conway, Jan Strnad, and Bruce Jones.  While Coren could certainly do a terrifying turn in his stories he could just as easily make you laugh such as in “Lycanlutz” where a goofball middle ages scientist arrives at a tiny realm plagued by a werewolf and promises to rid the land of the best with his special fleas.A darker look at the werewolf comes in “Change…into something more comfortable” about a werewolf who terrorizes a town on Halloween night but runs into something much more dangerous than him.  The story called “The Hero Within” seems like it might have been the basis for the Corben segment from the Heavy Metal film called “Den” where a young boy escapes into a fantasy world where he is a powerful warrior.  One of the true highlights is Corben’s adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven” which is a gorgeously illustrated and haunted piece of work.From cover to cover Creepy Presents Richard Corben is a work that showcases one of the true living legends of the comic medium.  Most of these stories have not seen the light of day in some 40 years which is far too long.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AO3AN4FUS1SZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595829199#wasThisHelpful","R3AO3AN4FUS1SZ","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Long before the Internet and television, people got their entertainment at home from the radio.  From the 1920s to the early 1950s radio was the primary source of home entertainment.  You could get music, comedy shows, adventures, drama, westerns, and horror.  One of the most successful radio horror and suspense show was Inner Sanctum which ran from 1941 – 1952.  The weekly show broadcast horror and suspense that featured some of the most popular actors of the day including Boris Karloff, Frank Sinatra, Orson Welles, Helen Hayes, and Peter Lorre.Longtime comic artist has now brought Inner Sanctum to comics with this terrific little hardcover graphic novel that adapts several of the original radio shows.  Most of the tales run 8 – 10 pages and are very reminiscent of the old Warren Magazines like Creepy and Eerie.  This should not some as a surprise since Colon did a lot of work on those same magazines back in the late 1960s and 1970s.  These are also typically EC Comics-styled stories that come with an ironic twist at the end.Some of the tales include “Death of a Doll” in which a reporter is investigating the murder of a young woman who was found dead clutching a baby doll which says the words “Kara-Nana”.  But what do those strange words mean?  In “Alive in the Grave” a man steals the wallet of another man who drops dead in the street of an apparent heart attack.  When he gets home to check the wallet’s contents he finds a card explaining the at the man who apparently died, suffers from a cataleptic condition that makes him appear to be dead. “The Horla” finds a man who is haunted by a spirit that is unseen by anyone else, eventually driving him to madness and suicide.Colon’s art is perfect for the subject matter.  The book is in black and white and his smooth, fine line artwork takes full advantage of the medium.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16R961749G36W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1561636142#wasThisHelpful","R16R961749G36W","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Vault collects a three issue mini-series written by Sam Sarkar with art by Garrie Gastonny.  The mystery of the supposed treasure hidden on Oak Island is one of the most enduring treasure hunts in history.  Treasure of the Knights Templar?  Pirate Treasure?  Non one knows because as of yet no one has ever found anything.  Sarkar’s story is based on the legend although it moves the action to a North Atlantic Island called Sable Island as a team of researchers and treasure hunters are on the track of another hidden trove that holds a connection to Oak Island.There are similarities into what they find there not only with Oak Island, but also a strange connection to the pyramids in Egypt.  A treasure trove is indeed found although the team continues to dig after uncovering evidence the island has an even deeper secret buried.  They then uncover a hidden chamber in an ocean cavern and locate what appears to be a giant Sarcophagus.  The object is hauled back to their base for examination and a scan shows what appears to be the skeleton of a large humanoid figure however the bones are far heavier than a human’s, leading the team to believe that it is actually some sort of statue. They make the fateful decision to open the Sarcophagus, and unleash an ancient terror from what they realize too late was an actual prison.The Vault is a sci-fi horror in the tradition of Alien with a dash of perhaps some Lovecraftian horror thrown into the mix.  I admit to always being intrigued by “mystery package” films.  Part of the fun is guessing what is inside and that’s what I like about The Vault.  But one the contents of the Sarcophagus are revealed the story loses some of its luster.  It’s just not a very interesting monster and while its origins are hinted at, answers are few.  Ultimately the payoff is a let down after Sarkar built up the suspense nicely.  After starting out with something unique the story ended up being standard monster fare.  Garrie Gastonny’s art is solid although nothing about it stands out particularly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NGNT0QSV28CT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607064855#wasThisHelpful","R3NGNT0QSV28CT","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When a film has all sorts of film festival laurels on its cover I immediately get a bit suspicious.  But in the case of Take Shelter, the plaudits don’t come from some fly-by-night film festival but rather Sundance and Cannes…the cream of the crop.  This isn’t an easy film to classify.  It’s not a traditional horror film although it has its horrific elements.  Certainly it is party psychological suspense and drama.  Its difficulty in categorizing is one of the things that makes it so unique.Curtis (Michael Shannon) is a blue-color crew leader for a construction company, living with his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and deaf daughter Hannah.  He begins experiencing troubling dreams and hallucinations of an impending apocalyptic storm as well as his being harmed by people he is close to.  He wakes up sweating and gasping for air as the dreams become more terrifying.  They begin to affect his performance at work and his relationship with his family.  Curtis’ mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia when she was in her mid-30s and Curtis fears he is heading down the same path.He becomes obsessed with building an underground storm shelter, even as he becomes the object of derision in his small-town community.  But is Curtis truly going insane?  Is a he precognitive?  Or is a higher power sending him these visions?  These questions are what gift-wraps Take Shelter into a thoroughly engrossing film.  Director Jeff Nichols builds the tension with a powerful yet subtle hand.  Curtis seeks help from a counselor for his troubles so he is aware and deeply concerned that he will end up institutionalized like his mother.  Yet even though he is aware of his problem, that does not curb his obsession to work on his shelter, day and night, even at the cost of his job.Michael Shannon gives an incredibly deep and thoughtful performance worthy of an Oscar nomination has this film been more well known.  We can identify with him because he is like most of us, just an honest, hard-working guy trying to provide a good life for his family when fate intervenes and throws his life out of whack.  Jessica Chastain, who was recently nominated for both an Oscar and Golden Globe for her performance in “The Help”, provides a solid co-star as the strong, supportive wife.  Take Shelter is one of those “small” films that absolutely deserves to find a bigger audience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U9KV902DTMVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006PGL7OQ#wasThisHelpful","R2U9KV902DTMVW","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Boy I really love Roger Corman’s films.  Never did a Director do so much with so little.  But Camel Spiders is bad even for a Corman film, even though he serves only as the Producer.  Camel Spiders have become the stuff of urban legend over the past 20 years of wars in the Middle East.  In truth they are not technically spiders despite the name but their large size have given them a near mythical reputation for terrifying the bejeezus out of people.  But here the plot becomes so incredibly silly from the beginning and turns these hand-size bugs into the size of medium dogs.The film begins in an unspecified desert in the Middle East (think Afghanistan) as American soldiers are in a firefight with enemy forces who again are unspecified but think Taliban. As the bullets fly the giant spiders crawl out of the ground to see what the commotion is and proceed to kill the enemy soldiers, dragging the bodies away leaving the Americans, and we the viewer, completely puzzled.  The commanding officer Captain Sturges is wounded and earns a trip home, along with the body of a fellow soldier killed in action.  But a handful of spiders hitch a ride home in the soldier’s coffin, ala Arachnophobia.As the Captain and Sgt Shelly Underwood are transporting the body through the Arizona desert (which looks suspiciously like the Middle Eastern desert but one’s just like the other, right?) their truck crashes, spilling the coffin and its stowaways which have grown much larger.  The soldiers are lead into town by Sheriff Beaumont (C. Thomas Howell).  While having lunch at the local diner, the restaurant comes under attack by the spiders which have hulked up to the size of an average terrier. What’s more these things have a bite which instantly kills their prey.  Now, these spiders are not said to be the result of radiation or a military experiment gone awry.  No, we’re supposed to believe they have always been there and been this large.  And you thought Afghanistan was a crappy place to live before!  The survivors flee to an abandoned industrial plant to make a final stand against the horde of Solifugae (that’s the technical name for the species…never let it be said I don’t do my homework).Camel Spiders is about as dumb a film as you could ever be unfortunate enough to encounter.  Bad dialog delivered by bad actors with CGI that makes most SyFy channel films look they were produced by George Lucas.  This is videogame quality CGI circa the mid 1990s as the spiders don’s so much walk along the desert floor as they do glide.  Conveniently the soldiers had a crate full of assault rifles so they could arm all the civilians.  Yet as they are fleeing in a pickup truck have of them are aiming up in the air.  I double-checked…none of the spiders were flying.  There are times when you see a character totally surround by the spiders and in the next scene the spiders are gone.  Even worse, the fate of two college students who were fleeing the spiders is never resolved.  It’s like they ran out of film so said “ah screw it!”This is pure, disposable entertainment.  40 – 50 years ago this is the kind of film that was shown as part of a double feature in less prominent theaters or drive-ins.

"The description on the cover to 7 Below describes it as “A supernatural thriller in the vein of The Ring and The Grudge”…Yeah…not so much.  The decent cast includes Val Kilmer, Luke Goss, and Ving Rhames in a haunted house thriller that is far too short on thrills for most horror fans.  A group of five tourists are traveling in taxi van when the driver is spooked by an apparition in the road and crashes into a tree.  Ving Rhames is Jack who lives nearby and gives the group a ride back to his home to avoid an oncoming storm.Kilmer’s character Bill was injured in the crash and he’s put in a bedroom to rest.  Fortunately for him one of the travelers is a doctor and another is a med student.  Jack keeps insisting the group must remain at the house due to the “terrible storm” although Director Kevin Carraway does a terrible job of convincing viewers that this is anything worse than the average thunderstorm.  Despite tornado warnings the group is constantly going outside where there barely seems to be a breeze.  Adam, the Med Student does try to leave but finds a tree blocking the ONLY road.  He does however find Courtney, a convenience store employee and brings her back to Jack’s farmhouse.Soon all of the guests are seeing and hearing things…children laughing, and the specter of a young boy murdering his sisters with a knife.  They are trapped within the house, repeating a cycle of violence that began 100 years ago, Jack creeps around the house spouting ominous lines like Bela Lugosi out of an old horror movie.  I love Kilmer, Goss, and Rhames.  They’re a lot of fun to watch but boy did they step into one horribly scripted and senseless production here.Carraway pulls out every last horror film cliché he can think of…the block road preventing escape, a car that mysteriously becomes disabled, phantoms appearing in a mirror or in bed with one of the characters, etc…I have no clue as to what Ving Rhames’ character was supposed to be and then Carraway mucks things up with a terrible ending.  Outside of some fine, although massive scene-chewing performances, there’s little reason to watch this snooze-fest.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12UKRJ2OXOTZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006WQHP4A#wasThisHelpful","R12UKRJ2OXOTZ0","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, Xavier Gens reduces humans to their basest, primal instincts in his tale of survivors of a nuclear attack in New York City.  Gens offers no explanation at all for the attack that begins the film.  Who’s attacking us and why?  We never do find out.  All we know is a group of people rush to the basement of their apartment complex, which the building super Mickey (Michael Biehn), a former firefighter, has turned, into a bomb shelter.  The survivors include brothers Josh (Milo Ventimiglia) and Adrien and friend Bobby; Marilyn (Rosanna Arquette) and her young Daughter; and Eva (Lauren German) and her boyfriend Sam.After the initial shock of the attack the will to survive begins to take over.  Mickey will not let anyone leave the basement for fear of the radiation fallout and things quickly become contentious within the group as they bicker over the next course of action and deal with sharing a small space.  Up to this point The Divide is moving nicely and even though there’s virtually no development of any of the characters beyond the basics, you can see their attitudes adjust to the stress.Gens derails the film when a handful of soldiers dressed in hazmat suits bust in the door, steal Marilyn’s daughter and attempt to kill the rest.  Somehow, they manage to kill several heavily armed and trained soldiers…yeah right.  And then manage to figure how to outfit and utilize the high-tech suits…yeah right again.  Josh puts on the suit and leaves long enough to find that the enemy…whoever in the Hell they may be…are performing experiments.  An ID badge has a name that is Asian but is spelled out in English so go figure.  If Gens wasn’t going to reveal who was behind the attack then why even include this in the film?  It’s a clumsy break in the tone of the film.Once locked in the shelter again the survivors fall apart…fighting over dwindling resources, torturing and raping each other in a Lord of the Flies apocalyptic scenario.  Frankly I had lost interest.  The characters are all extremely unlikable and were given no reason to root for any of them.  Mickey’s background of being a firefighter and having a family at the time of the 911 attacks is hinted but never developed.  There are some strong and intense performances, particularly from Biehn and Ventimiglia.  And Arquette is over-the-top crazy as the mom driven over the edge.  Too bad Gens didn’t give us a reason to care about any of the characters.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11SIM8K46FH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007549W62#wasThisHelpful","R11SIM8K46FH7","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Wicker Tree is a semi-sequel to The Wicker Man, and by that I mean the original, 1973 film, not the God-awful Nic Cage 2006 remake.  The film is written and directed by Robin Hardy, the man who directed the original film so there’s definitely a nice pedigree to start with, but unfortunately there’s not much else.A former Britney Spears-style pop star, now turned Christian Evangelist singer Beth Boothby, is sent on a mission along with her cowboy boyfriend Steve to Scot to preach the gospel of the Lord.  Once there they meet Lord and Lady Morrison who greet them warmly but almost immediately reveal their insidious plans for the two hayseeds from Texas, robbing the film of any hint of suspense.  The villagers go out of their way to be nice but Beth and Steve seem to be the only ones who can’t figure out that the village is looking at them like hungry diners eyeing a turkey on Thanksgiving.  They share with Beth and Steve the myths of their Celtic Goddess Sulis which the pair of Christians find reprehensible.We basically know what will eventually happen to the pair about 20 minutes into the film and thus have to sit through nearly an hour Beth singing hymns and the villagers singing Scottish folk songs while Steve begins to have a crisis of faith after being tempted by the local shrew.  The impression leaves you with the feeling that Hardy has a rather low opinion of Americans, lumping us all into the category of being slang-talking rednecks and simpletons.  The intimation is that they could not find any locals stupid enough to be duped into being a sacrifice for a pagan ceremony so they decided to get a couple of dumb cowpokes.The Wicker Tree is especially disappointing in light of the terrible Wicker Man remake from which Hardy completely distanced himself.  You’ve have thought this was going to be his triumphant reply to the remake, particularly since its been 21 years since his last film.  But in the end the film falls with a quiet and dull thud.  The only saving grace is a cameo by the great Christopher Lee, who starred in the original movie, playing a similar but different character.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MFUFREZA2OSH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073U2ETK#wasThisHelpful","R1MFUFREZA2OSH","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Frankenstein Theory is a classic case of a great idea but with lousy execution.  The film’s premise is that Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein was a fictionalized account of real events.  Professor Jonathan Venkenheim believes that the story was true and was based upon the accomplishments of his ancestor, Johann.  His theory got him suspended from his university and now, to prove his theory and to clear his family name, he goes on a quest to get evidence of the Frankenstein Monster’s existence.He heads to the northern most part of Canada with a documentary film crew in tow, recording every moment and giving the film a quasi-found footage quality.  They first meet a man who claims to have had an encounter with the creature.  They hire a guide named karl who leads them to an old, abandoned Yurt (think cabin) where at night they hear strange baying and growls outside.  Jonathan attributes it to the monster although the rest of the crew is skeptical…despite the fact that they seem to freak out over the slightest noise.When one of their snowmobiles is vandalized overnight, Karl leaves to track down whoever did it which continues the horror genre’s long tradition of stupidity by supporting characters.  Raise your hand if you think we ever see Karl alive again.  The film continues in this tiresome fashion with the crew being freaked out and Jonathan insisting that the creature is feeling threatened by their presence so naturally he wants to pursue the creature.The Frankenstein Theory reminds me of one of those old 1970s docudramas where they search for Big Foot but the only thing the audience searches for is the exits.  There’s no payoff, we never get to see the monster except for some vague, fleeting glimpses.  I mean come on, even a low-budget film can produce decent makeup effects if you try hard enough.  What we get is a big guy wrapped up in animal skins.  Oohh…scary!  The Frankenstein Theory is painfully slow and boring.  The only character we care about—the monster—is one we never get to see.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HK2NJTW8IRKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AJXO5I6#wasThisHelpful","R3HK2NJTW8IRKG","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cary Elwes stars as Jeff Matthews, an American businessman who is visiting Bangkok with his Thai wife and son.  After leaving the airport they are in a horrific auto accident which leave’s Jeff’s wife and son dead and him in a coma.  When he finally wakes up, he finds that he is haunted by grisly visions of spirits who are imploring him for aid.  Jeff eventually seeks the aid of a spiritualist who help him.  She tells him that he has left a part of himself in the spirit world.But to free himself from the hauntings he has to let go of his family but doing so involves battling demonic creatures who seek to keep his family’s souls for themselves.  Matthews eventually meets another American who also lost a family member to the demonic creatures.  Warren Mills (William Hurt) is a fellow American and kind of an old hippie sage who agrees to lead Matthews to the Hellgate in order to finally put his loved one’s souls to rest.  But to do so he has to cross over into a spirit dimension populated by slavering demons who want to keep him there.Hellgate is a very low budget film and apparently what budget they did have went to Elwes and Hurt because it certainly didn’t go towards any convincing visual effects.  What effects the film does have comes mainly in the way of makeup.  A lot of it is typical Asian-style horror makeup…you know, women with long dark hair and dark eyes popping out to provide cheap scares. The “demons” look more like zombies with mouths dripping in blood and pale eyes.Elwes and Hurt are old pros and give fine performances as you would expect but they are caught up in a production with bad material which crawls at a snail’s pace.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32V3NL1NC6LON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AADAENA#wasThisHelpful","R32V3NL1NC6LON","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With two major, big screen films in our review section it is instead this direct-to-video release that earns the best review of the week.  Penny (Pell James) and Alex (Johnathon Schaech) have escaped the hustle and bustle of the big city and bought a home in the country to raise their baby.  Their newborn is up all night crying, however, depriving the young parents of sleep.  Anyone who has dealt with a baby who won’t sleep at night knows full well that it is a nightmare unto itself!  Alex finds working on his music to be impossible due to the demands of little Tanner.The stress overwhelms the couple.  They snipe at each other over the smallest things, and when a construction crew begins to work on a new home nearby, it makes their days as sleepless as their nights.  But with the sleep deprivation come horrifying visions.  They see a bedraggled woman in their home who seems to have bad intentions for their baby.  They dismiss the sightings as hallucinations brought on by the lack of sleep.  Hiring a babysitter to watch the infant at night fails when the babysitter disappears when they awake in the morning.  As the sightings become more terrifying, and the sleeplessness takes hold of the couple, they are at each other’s throats, blaming one another for all their problems.Dark Circles is a fine psychological terror that could have been much better had it not tried to make the film a supernatural horror.  You are left to guess through much of the film if the woman they are seeing is a ghost, a hallucination, or real.  But when this issue is revealed it makes many of the previous sightings virtually impossible from a logical standpoint, depending upon how much stock you place in BOTH parents hallucinating about the same woman.Still, there is enough to like about the rest of the film.  The film rests almost solely in the performances of the two leads since one of the two is in just about every scene and both Pell and Schaech do a marvelous job of portraying parents pushed to the brink by their lack of sleep.  I can tell you I spent many a nights pushing one of my sons through the house in a stroller at 3:00am to try and get him back to sleep and it’s not a fun experience.While not overly terrifying there are a few jump out of your seat moments but the true terror lies in how real this situation can become.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AXXR4XFUXH91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BLF9FLI#wasThisHelpful","R3AXXR4XFUXH91","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Looking to ride the wave of the popularity of the Twilight series, Beautiful Creatures runs the playbook in predictable fashion.  Small sleepy town?  Check.  Mysterious new kid in school who belongs to the creepy local family?  Check.  Local kid falls in love with the new student?  Check.  The only different here is that the sexes of the lead actors are swapped.Lena Duchanne arrives in Gatlin, South Carolina hearing the whispers about her family’s alleged involvement in witchcraft and Satanism.  While she’s ridiculed by most of the heavily religious Christian students, Ethan Wate is immediately attracted to the new girl.  Following her back to her family’s stately old mansion, he meets Macon Ravenwood (Jeremy Iron), the family patriarch who founded the town.Macon warns Lena to have nothing to do with Ethan but Ethan pursues the forbidden romance and learns that Lena and her family are all casters and as Lena’s 16th birthday approaches she will either become good or evil.  Think of it like the Hogwart’s Sorting hat.  Lena’s mother Sarafine (Emma Thompson) arrives in town intent on pushing Lena to the dark side while Ethan and his family friend Amma (Viola Davis) tries to keep her on the path of good.  Added in his some hokum about Ethan and Lena having a fatal attraction curse that dates back to the Civil War which will almost certainly turn Lena evil.Beautiful Creatures is Twilight without the ambition if you can believe that.  It doesn’t have nearly the mythology built up that Twilight does and throws its elements at you like a guy trying to hit the lever on the dunk tank at a carnival.  One out of ten might hit the mark if you’re lucky.  And just when it appears things can get any more muddles, along comes Amma to reveal that she is a seer who is the keep of a vast underground library of lore to find a spell which can dispel the curse.Irons and Thompson are enjoyable to watch even when they are chewing up the scenery but there’s little else to recommend about Beautiful Creatures.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3519S0NJE64E8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009AMAGQM#wasThisHelpful","R3519S0NJE64E8","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Part Sci-Fi and part supernatural horror, Dark Skies treads a fine line between both genres but never fully commits to either in this hodgepodge production.  The Barrett Family begins to experience strange happens in their quiet suburban home.  Ad first its minor things like food being spilled out of the refrigerator or photos being removed from picture frames but soon the events become more chilling an dangerous.  A flock of hundreds of birds flies into their house, family members begin sleep walking and stand unresponsive outside.Lacy (Keri Russell) has a viewing at a house for sale. As she's pitching the house to a couple, she becomes unable to speak and enters a trance. She walks towards the glass door and begins to bash her head repeatedly against it before waking up in her bed without any memory of how she got there.  Most terrifying is that a shadowy figure is seen standing over the children’s bed.So ok, there’s some terrifying stuff going on and that should be enough to carry the film but Director Scott Stewart apparently didn’t feel this was strong enough so he adds in a lot of filler melodrama.  The husband, Daniel is out of work and struggling to pay the bills, teenaged son Jesse is beginning to experiment with drugs, etc…But everything begins to fall apart when Lacy begins to do some research on the internet and finds other families who have experienced the same phenomena.She tracks down and expert (J.K. Simmons) who just happens to live nearby mind you, and he spills the beans with little sense of style, matter-of-factly telling the Barretts that they are experiencing alien visitations and there’s little they can do other than make it so difficult on the aliens that they move on to another family.  Gee, and I thought they were going to invite them for dinner.  Keri Russell does an admirable job but can’t save the ending from falling apart under its own weight.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ORDS7R4IBU9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEIYG98#wasThisHelpful","R3ORDS7R4IBU9A","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One almost sure way to tell you’re watching a low-budget and usually bad horror film is when you have a maudlin and overly dramatic musical score, especially when it comes during the opening credits.  One point against The Frozen (not to be confused with 2010’s “Frozen).  Emma and her boyfriend Mike are on a winter camping trip into a remote mountainous area when their snowmobile crashes and becomes inoperable.  They walk back to their tend to try and figure out their next move.  Do they try to walk back to their truck or try to fix the snowmobile?Well our intrepid little couple chooses a third option which is basically to do nothing but wander around their camp and bitch at each other.  In the meantime they spot a mysterious man staring at them who disappears when they try to approach him for help.  Brit Morgan as Emma does a credible job as the stressed girlfriend who is keeping her pregnancy secret from Mike.  You may remember Morgan from a recurring role in HBO’s True Blood.When Mike disappears Emma begins seeing other strange, ghoulish people and having terrifying dreams.  Now I hate playing spoiler but The Frozen is little more than a remake of Carnival of Souls with nary a hint of that cult classic’s atmosphere.  Very few will likely be surprised by the twist ending.  There’s a fine line between building suspense in a film and just moving along too slowly and Director Andrew Hyatt in his debut at the helm hasn’t quite figured out the difference yet.There are some good scenes at the beginning and end but the middle is filled with a lot of dull padding and you have to struggle to keep up your interest.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11429H0L0Y9CK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009B8YZOO#wasThisHelpful","R11429H0L0Y9CK","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Monster kids, those kids who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s are very familiar with monster model kits.  Who didn’t have Aurora or Revell model kits back in the day.  While acting as an homage to those great kits of that era, Mark C. Glassy kits is actually aimed at garage kit enthusiasts.  The Garage Kit hobby took off in the mid-1980s as fans literally began molding their own kits in their garages or basements.  So popular was the hobby that magazines like The Amazing Figure Modeler began popping up to service the burgeoning industry.Soon there were a dozen or so manufacturers of these kits like Horizon, Monsters in Motion, Screamin’, Halcyon, and Resin Crypt.  Glassy, who holds a PhD in biochemistry, traces the origins of the GK industry and also provides details on the creation process for aspiring modelers.  He also goes into all the details you need in terms of your tools, paints, glues, putty and clays, electronics, and more.Next Glassy takes the reader on a step-by-step instructional tour of molding your model, pinning and gluing the pieces together, sanding, building dioramas, painting, color and effects, and displaying.  Now this makes up the first 30 pages of the 200+ page book.  The bulk of it takes a look at hundreds of garage kits featuring fantastic photography.Glassy sorts these in chronological order, beginning with the kits that covered the silent age of horror and sci-fi.  Glassy first gives notes about the film that the kit is based on and then provides the kit credits: Sculptor, manufacturer, and details on how each piece was created.  The silent era films covered include classics such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Nosferatu, and The Phantom of the Opera.From there we move into the Universal classic horror films of the 1930s and 1940s: Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, Bride of Frankenstein, etc…next is the classic sci-fi films of the 1950s like The Day the Earth Stood Still, War of the Worlds, The Thing from Another World, and Them!You cannot help but marvel at the incredible skill of these artists and sculptors.  Whether you are a modeling fan or just a fan of the films, this is a gorgeous book to own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N05PKW34RA28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078646884X#wasThisHelpful","R2N05PKW34RA28","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Creep Van is set and shot in the Detroit area where I am from and it’s always great to have films shot in your area.  Creep Van is one part 1970s comedy “Car Wash”, one part evil car movie, and one part SAW…how’s that for an eclectic stew?  Campbell is a down on his luck guy whose life is complicated by not having a car.  After failing at several jobs the only employment he can find is at a Detroit car wash.Like the 1970s comedy “Car Wash” part of the charm of Creep Van is that the film is populated with a diverse group of goofball characters.  Campbell’s two co-workers are pothead slackers; his roommate wears Luchador costumes and has sex with women in a doghouse; and then there is a small-time gangster/Swami who runs a hippie-like cult and apparently sells pot on the side.The absurdity of the characters and situations is contrasted by a mysterious, rundown old van whose owner has turned it into a deathtrap on wheels.  Metal blades come down and slice victims in half in the windows; pulleys attached to the seatbelts squeeze the life out of seat occupants; spikes shoot through the back of the carseats to impale people; and, well, you get the picture.The Creep puts a “for sale” sign on the van to attract his victims and Campbell finds himself caught up in the deadly game when he calls about buying the van.  Soon he an new girlfriend Amy are fighting for their lives against the man and his van of horrors.Separately as a straight horror or straight comedy there are a couple of good films here.  The problem is the two elements don’t blend all that well.  Despite some excessively gory kills it’s hard to take the action all that serious with the rest of the silliness going on.  Add to that there’s some serious gaffs.  Brian says he lives in Mount Clemens (a suburb about a  north of Detroit) yet when his roommate is killed the cops say they are from the Detroit Police Department…but they are driving Wayne Country Sheriff cruisers.  And while the car wash he works at is supposed to be in Detroit, we clearly see a sign in the background that reads “12 Mile Rod” which would place it four miles outside of the Detroit city limits.So ok, unless you’re from the area you’re not going to notice these mistakes but it still means lazy and shoddy filmmaking as all of these elements would have been easily fixable.  The performances aren’t terrible.  Some, like Collin Bernsen as Swami Ted, are quite fun.  Ultimately Creep Van is just too uneven to rise above mediocre.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ72M8Q96HDEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009GCIIKM#wasThisHelpful","RQ72M8Q96HDEI","A2JP0URFHXP6DO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JP0URFHXP6DO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beginning in 1965, Bob Dylan had a stunningly prolific, 14-month-long explosion of revolutionary creativity that produced three masterpieces: the folk-rock album ""Bringing It All Back Home,"" the blues-rock album ""Highway 61 Revisited,"" and the sublime fusion of the double album ""Blonde on Blonde."" This is the point in his career during which he ""went electric"" at the Newport Folk Festival, scandalizing folk purists and transforming popular music. For the fiftieth anniversary of this ""annus mirabilis"" and the twelfth issue in the seemingly endless Bootleg Series, Sony has pulled out all the stops. More than 100 heretofore unheard studio recordings – demos, rehearsals, false starts, breakdowns, outtakes, and alternate takes from the New York and Nashville sessions – have been assembled in this chronological six-disc, seven-hour set. It includes a 120-page hardcover book with essays and rare photos.Available exclusively at the BobDylan website is an exhaustive limited-edition collection (18 CDs and nine vinyl singles, with 379 tracks and over 20 hours of music, a 170-page large-format book, and copious memorabilia) that will set you back a cool $600. It contains every moment of tape, every fragment and misstep and mumble, no matter how trivial or indispensable, and even a few impromptu folk and country duets with Joan Baez in a London hotel room. Casual fans will probably prefer to avoid repetition and save money, so the low-priced, two-disc set of highlights may be enough for them: 145 minutes of previously unreleased Dylan, 33 astonishing cuts, for only $15!But many true fans will want to invest $100 in this deluxe box to hear multiple (two to four) takes of some of Dylan most iconic songs, from the earliest, ""Love Minus Zero / No Limit,"" to the last, ""Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands."" You'll get ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" (with the occasional fumbled lyric), ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" (which he abruptly cuts short on one track, groaning, ""The drumming's driving me mad! I'm going out of my brain!""), ""Highway 61 Revisited"" (with and without the familiar siren whistle), ""Visions of Johanna"" (much faster and louder than the album version), ""Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat"" (featuring buzzers and car horns as sound effects), ""Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again"" (first taken at a slower pace than on the album), ""Just Like a Woman"" (with a Bo Diddley beat), and ""Desolation Row"" (which becomes an epic solo of more than 11 minutes). There are alternate versions of ""Positively 4th Street,"" ""Absolutely Sweet Marie,"" ""It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue,"" ""It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding),"" and much more.Rarities abound, such as the brilliant outtakes ""I Wanna Be Your Lover,"" ""Farewell, Angelina,"" “If You Gotta Go, Go Now,"" ""Sitting on a Barbed Wire Fence,"" and ""She's Your Lover Now."" Just before he performs “I’ll Keep It With Mine,” Dylan tells engineer Tom Wilson the song's not called ""Alcatraz to the Ninth Power"" and then comes up with the title ""Bank Account Blues."" None of these tunes made it to an original album, but some of their lyrics did, embedded in other songs. Despite the potential for tedium, the most interesting disc might be the one with 20 takes of ""Like a Rolling Stone,"" from its earliest incarnation, featuring a waltz tempo, to its final version, as well as takes that isolate the vocals and individual instruments.The quality of the recordings is uniformly excellent. Some are just Dylan with his guitar, harmonica, and piano, but for the rest he is accompanied by such great musicians as Mike Bloomfield on guitar, Al Kooper on organ, and members of The Hawks (soon to be renamed ""The Band""): Robbie Robertson on guitar, Richard Manuel on piano, Garth Hudson on organ, and Rick Danko on bass. Levon Helm appears playing drums on few tracks, John Hammond Jr. can briefly be heard on guitar and piano, and John Sebastian pops up on harmonica and bass. Numerous additional sidemen are represented.There's a lot of studio chatter and incomplete takes and amusing false starts, but for the most part, this is a wealth of wonderful music replete with Dylan's characteristically complex, clever, oblique, poetic lyrics. These performances give the listener invaluable insights into his process and the changes he went through as he refined and polished his work.

"Beginning in 1965, Bob Dylan had a stunningly prolific, 14-month-long explosion of revolutionary creativity that produced three masterpieces: the folk-rock album ""Bringing It All Back Home,"" the blues-rock album ""Highway 61 Revisited,"" and the sublime fusion of the double album ""Blonde on Blonde."" This is the point in his career during which he ""went electric"" at the Newport Folk Festival, scandalizing folk purists and transforming popular music.For the fiftieth anniversary of this ""annus mirabilis"" and the twelfth issue in the seemingly endless Bootleg Series, Sony has pulled out all the stops. Heretofore unheard studio recordings from the period – demos, rehearsals, false starts, breakdowns, outtakes, and alternate takes from the New York and Nashville sessions – are being released as a six-disc, seven-hour set (over $100 on Amazon, with more than 100 tracks, including 20 different takes of ""Like a Rolling Stone"" and a 120-page hardcover book).Available exclusively at the BobDylan website is an exhaustive limited-edition set (18 CDs and nine vinyl singles, with 379 tracks and over 20 hours of music, a 170-page large-format book, and copious memorabilia) that will set you back a cool $600. It contains every moment of tape, every fragment and misstep and mumble, no matter how trivial or indispensable, and even a few impromptu folk and country duets with Joan Baez in a London hotel room.For a lot of folks, though, too much repetition becomes tedious, so a low-priced, two-disc set of highlights may be enough for them: 145 minutes of classic Dylan for only $15! He sings and plays 33 of his iconic songs, from the earliest in this chronological set, ""Love Minus Zero / No Limit,"" to the last, ""I Want You."" One could wish for a couple more of the cuts on the deluxe editions, like ""It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue,"" ""It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding),"" or the outtake ""I Wanna Be Your Lover,"" but so many great ones are here.You'll hear ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" (with a few fumbled lyrics), ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" (which he abruptly cuts short, groaning, ""The drumming's driving me mad! I'm going out of my brain!""), ""Positively 4th Street,"" ""Highway 61 Revisited"" (without the familiar siren whistle), ""Visions of Johanna"" (much faster and louder than on the album), ""Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat"" (featuring buzzers and car horns as sound effects), ""Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again"" and ""Just Like a Woman"" (both taken at slower paces than their album versions), ""Absolutely Sweet Marie,"" and much more.""Like a Rolling Stone"" and ""Desolation Row"" each get two takes; one of the former has a waltz tempo and one of the latter is an epic solo  of over 11 minutes. Rarities abound, such as the brilliant outtakes ""Farewell, Angelina,"" “If You Gotta Go, Go Now,"" ""Sitting on a Barbed Wire Fence,"" and ""She's Your Lover Now."" Just before he performs “I’ll Keep It With Mine,” Dylan tells engineer Tom Wilson the song's not called ""Alcatraz to the Ninth Power"" and then comes up with the title ""Bank Account Blues."" None of these tunes made it to an original album, but some of their lyrics did, embedded in other songs.The quality of the recording is uniformly excellent. About half of the first disc is just Dylan with his guitar, harmonica, and piano, while for the rest he is accompanied by such great musicians as Mike Bloomfield on guitar, Al Kooper on organ, and members of The Hawks (soon to be renamed ""The Band""): Robbie Robertson on guitar, Richard Manuel on piano, Garth Hudson on organ, and Rick Danko on bass. Levon Helm appears playing drums on one track, John Hammond Jr. can briefly be heard on guitar and piano, and John Sebastian pops up on harmonica and bass. Numerous additional sidemen are represented.There's occasional studio chatter and several incomplete takes and amusing false starts, but for the most part, this is a wealth of wonderful music replete with Dylan's characteristically complex, clever, oblique, poetic lyrics. These cuts give the listener invaluable insights into his process and the changes he went through as he refined and polished his work. The box also includes a 60-page booklet with dozens of contemporary photos, two lengthy essays by a music journalist and a scholar, recollections by Al Kooper and others, and full track notes.""The Cutting Edge"" is a revelatory cornucopia of genius that deserves a place next to the original albums, and the ""Best of"" set may so delight you that you decide to take the plunge and buy one of the pricier, more comprehensive collections. When Dylan electrified his sound, he electrified music fans the world over and fundamentally altered the world of music. He really was the cutting edge.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZVMDZIQQ54EQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015JXIA2W#wasThisHelpful","R1ZVMDZIQQ54EQ","A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This preposterously alarmist book is a prime example of the ""straw man"" fallacy, which seems to be author CJ Werleman's principle métier. He makes a long series of wildly exaggerated over-generalizations or blatantly false statements about a few btes noires like Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and the late Christopher Hitchens. After quoting these ""new atheists"" out of context and giving their words the worst possible interpretation, he rails against them as if they represented all atheists or were political or religious leaders. They're a vicious, treacherous menace, he fumes, militant radicals who demonize faith and promote a fiendish purge or extermination of the faithful. These ad hominem attacks are both ridiculous and a mirror image of what he himself is doing: peddling fear, albeit of atheists, and offering hope of subverting a diabolical agenda.Demons and devils don't exist, of course, except in the imagination, but religious fanatics certainly do, as do the gullible sheep they lead into perpetrating and becoming the victims of slaughter. And a fear of the real and extremely brutal atrocities they commit is made manifest in horrible headlines every single day. When did you last read a news story about atheists starting a war or going on a killing spree? But atheists have no hope of abolishing religion and don't contend they do. We're not white supremacists or Zionists or imperialists as the slavering blurb on the cover promises. Neither fanatics nor fools nor caricatures, most of us are intelligent, reasonable people of all political and philosophical stripes who accept that superstitious impulses, while they may be eliminated in individuals, are ineradicable from humanity and can only be ameliorated.Atheists are not prone to simplistically dividing the world into good and evil as so many of the religious are. Rather, they see that unquestioned beliefs and supernatural stories that cannot be tested or confirmed are dangerous and, in many cases, ""anti-science, a motivator of violence, and adverse to progress"" as Werleman puts it in one of his repetitive diatribes. Nor do atheists seek to force their ideas upon anyone. They oppose harmful religious nonsense and those who spread it, yet they don't propose suppressing freedom of speech or sparking a pogrom. Anti-religious genocides are not committed by atheists, as the author posits in another hyperbolic harangue, but by people who have substituted one monstrous faith for another.It's curious that Werleman, an avowed atheist and serial plagiarizer (see his Wikipedia page) who has written several books critical of religion, should be so eager to mischaracterize atheists. For instance, he claims that many of us believe religion to be the cause of all the world's evil, but no atheist I know or have heard speak would make this absurd assertion. Unless you're a ranting right-wing fundamentalist who is unconcerned with honesty or accuracy and only looking for ammunition in your endless and utterly vain quest to convert or discredit the nonreligious, please don't waste your wages on this poorly-written pack of pulpy paranoia.Atheists don't presume to have sole possession of the truth. On the contrary, we regularly test our ideas and are willing to discard any that don't square with observable reality. We are always learning and do not ignore evidence, unlike religious extremists who have seemingly turned off their rational minds and blindly accepted ancient myths and their manipulative salesmen. I doubt Werleman is as impervious to reality as the hyperventilating zealots who imagine a world made perfect under the totalitarian control of their imaginary gods. I suspect the explanation for this comically incompetent 300-page screed is much simpler. The author is no different from any other polemical pundit or pandering hack: he's just looking to gin up controversy and publicity and sell a few more books.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFBW4GM0CETPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1908675349#wasThisHelpful","RFBW4GM0CETPU","A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Black Stallion"" is a poetic work of art, a moving story both gentle and exciting, and a feast for the eyes and ears that has finally gotten the 4K digital restoration and sumptuous Blu-ray treatment it deserves. It will surprise no one that the fine folks at the Criterion Collection are behind it. This 1979 production is a must-see for lovers of both cinema and animals. It was adapted from Walter Farley's 1941 novel for children, directed by Carroll Ballard in his feature debut, and executive produced by Francis Ford Coppola, who was a classmate of Ballard's at UCLA.You will cherish this tale of a boy (played by Kelly Reno) and a jet-black Arabian stallion who survive a wild storm and shipwreck, are rescued from an uninhabited island, and are trained by a surrogate father (Mickey Rooney) to become a championship racing team. Some of the most powerful moments and breathtaking natural sequences occur on the island as the boy and his horse become lifelong friends, but the racing scenes are undeniably thrilling and rewarding as well.These images were captured by cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, who supervised the gorgeous restoration. Thousands of imperfections were removed to create the cleanest picture possible, and the colors pop, though there remains noticeable grain from the original film print. Along with Rooney, Robert Dalva was nominated for an Oscar for his perfectly paced editing. The lush, mesmerizing musical score was composed by Carmine Coppola, the producer's father. Of course the soundtrack has been remastered for crystal clarity.Numerous extras accompany this release, including five short documentary films by Carroll Ballard, with introductions by the filmmaker. The shorts were produced in the 1960s and 1970s, range from 11 to 47 minutes, and cover a variety of topics: pigs, a house cat, a bull rider, centenarians, and crystals. While interesting, I don't consider them essential. Also included are an insightful 47-minute conversation between Ballard and film critic Scott Foundas, a 21-minute interview with Deschanel, and a 7-minute feature in which Mary Ellen Mark talks about her on-set photographs. The original theatrical trailer, an essay by film critic Michael Sragow, and a 17-by-11-inch color poster round out the presentation.Interviews with the actors would have been appreciated, but are completely absent. Of course Rooney, whose epic career of nearly 90 years included the classic film ""National Velvet,"" and Hoyt Axton, the country music great who played Reno's father, are no longer with us, but Reno himself, who had only a brief movie career, and Teri Garr, who played his mother, could have participated. Minor shortcomings aside, the glory of the film is indisputable. I give this new Criterion box my highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38GZZL9A5BOPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W69F2LK#wasThisHelpful","R38GZZL9A5BOPQ","A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Amazon Echo is a sleek black cylinder, just over nine inches tall and three inches wide, that marries the radio on your nightstand or kitchen counter with the Internet. It functions like a voice-activated iPod, but it has speakers instead of headphones, microphones that detect spoken commands even across a large room, and a clear, Siri-like voice that can answer basic questions and stream the music, radio stations, and audiobooks you request. It's not yet what I would call a fully mature technology, but it's a step in the right direction, and it's enjoyable to use.Echo makes a nice, low-cost sound system for a small apartment or any room in your house. Because it's connected to the cloud, the tower can play songs from your Amazon Prime Library or Prime Stations, iHeartRadio, TuneIn, and online radio stations as well as music from your phone or tablet, Spotify, Pandora, and other services. Streamed audiobooks are available from Audible, too. It's able to perform a variety of tasks: report the time and weather and traffic, give you news briefings from NPR, the BBC, the Economist, and other outlets, compile to-do and shopping lists, define and spell words and suggest synonyms for them, set a timer or alarm, respond to certain basic reference inquiries, tell jokes (most of which are pretty lame), and other fun stuff.Don't expect Echo to answer anything except the simplest questions, at least for now. It can report the score of last night's game, convert dollars to euros and miles to meters, and tell you things like the diameter of the Milky Way, the names of Humphrey Bogart's wives, and the date of the Battle of Hastings, but inquiries requiring research, like stock prices or world records or translations, are out. Its capabilities will improve over time as it is automatically updated, but it's fairly limited in scope at this point. This virtual assistant is more of an enjoyable novelty than a useful tool, and you are one of thousands of beta testers feeding its cloud-based brain with raw data about what people want to know and hear. Keep your expectations low, and you may be pleasantly surprised.The two relatively small, heavy, downward-facing speakers inside the tower produce pleasing, room-filling, omni-directional sound. I find they work best for voice and for such music as classical, jazz, blues, folk, and country rather than loud rock. They're ported to increase bass response, but they won't replace the wall of sound your stereo speakers put out. Don't blast Led Zeppelin at top volume; you'll only distort the music and risk damaging the unit.You control the volume verbally or by turning a ring at the top of the cylinder. The ring lights up in various pretty colors that move around to indicate it's listening or responding. If you have a soft voice or are too far away, you can control the sound by pressing the buttons or speaking into the microphone of the remote, which includes a magnetic holder that can be attached to metal surfaces (an adhesive strip is also included). On the whole, Echo is remarkably good at understanding anyone, but you have the option of giving it further voice training in the Echo App on your PC, tablet, or phone. Connecting the unit to your wi-fi is relatively painless as it's swiftly and automatically detected when you first sign in on the app setup page.Unless you switch its microphone button off, the tower is always listening for its ""wake-up word,"" either ""Alexa"" or ""Amazon,"" or waiting for you to press its ""action button."" You have to use the wake-up word or action button before every command or query, and you can't yet select other words or voices. As with an iPhone, talking to Echo is akin to a game of Simon Says that regularly produces non sequiturs and apologies for its lack of comprehension, especially if your sentences are complex or longer than a few words. When stumped, it opens a Bing web search (generally a Wikipedia entry) in the Echo App on your computer or hand-held device (it won't consult Google). This app keeps a record of all questions, responses, and lists, and it allows you to choose music providers and tweak settings.Some folk will surely wonder whether Amazon is listening for things they don't want it to hear, but I'm extremely skeptical about any secret conspiracy. The company has neither the manpower nor the motivation to eavesdrop on so many people. If Amazon violates our privacy, it will lose millions of customers and billions of dollars as a result of bad publicity and lawsuits. And the NSA is certainly capable of doing amazingly scary stuff, but if you really think the U.S. government is spying on you using Echo or your TV or the microchip in your head: hey, get a grip!Since I own a Kindle Fire, belong to Amazon Prime, and purchase music online, I'm clearly the target demographic for this device. No doubt Amazon hopes Echo will increase music sales. At a price of $99 for Prime members, it was too tempting to pass up, though I'm not sure I would have spent a full $199 for it. You might want to wait for it to get a bit smarter or add more functions. For example, an ability to handle phone calls and take dictation would be obvious advantages, and there's no reason it can't offer trivia games or, as I've already mentioned, stock prices, world records, and translations.

You have to use the wake-up word or action button before every command or query, and you can't yet select other words or voices. As with an iPhone, talking to Echo is akin to a game of Simon Says that regularly produces non sequiturs and apologies for its lack of comprehension, especially if your sentences are complex or longer than a few words. When stumped, it opens a Bing web search (generally a Wikipedia entry) in the Echo App on your computer or hand-held device (it won't consult Google). This app keeps a record of all questions, responses, and lists, and it allows you to choose music providers and tweak settings.Some folk will surely wonder whether Amazon is listening for things they don't want it to hear, but I'm extremely skeptical about any secret conspiracy. The company has neither the manpower nor the motivation to eavesdrop on so many people. If Amazon violates our privacy, it will lose millions of customers and billions of dollars as a result of bad publicity and lawsuits. And the NSA is certainly capable of doing amazingly scary stuff, but if you really think the U.S. government is spying on you using Echo or your TV or the microchip in your head: hey, get a grip!Since I own a Kindle Fire, belong to Amazon Prime, and purchase music online, I'm clearly the target demographic for this device. No doubt Amazon hopes Echo will increase music sales. At a price of $99 for Prime members, it was too tempting to pass up, though I'm not sure I would have spent a full $199 for it. You might want to wait for it to get a bit smarter or add more functions. For example, an ability to handle phone calls and take dictation would be obvious advantages, and there's no reason it can't offer trivia games or, as I've already mentioned, stock prices, world records, and translations. And how about a feature that allows you to replace the alarm with a reminder memo?There are many, many as-yet unexplored or unimplemented possibilities, but my family and I are enjoying Echo thus far!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10ZO9XR5G4NCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X4WHP5E#wasThisHelpful","R10ZO9XR5G4NCY","A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Enlightenment label, based in the UK, has been releasing multi-disc boxes containing some of the finest jazz ever captured. Most of these artists originally recorded for the Blue Note and Prestige labels, but copyrights for performances of the 1950s and early 1960s have expired in Europe, so prices on these boxes are very low and jazz aficionados are the winners. Must-have sets in this series include Clifford Brown, Bill Evans, Lee Morgan, Horace Silver, Max Roach, Quincy Jones, Ahmad Jamal, Eric Dolphy, and others, but none are any more essential than this one, a complete collection of the first nine albums that bear Sonny Rollins' name, produced between 1953 and 1956.Rollins was at the first of many peaks in his career during these Prestige sessions, which began when he was only 23 years old. They are presented in chronological order on five CDs, including his towering hard bop masterpiece, ""Saxophone Colossus."" You can hear Rollins developing into a jazz giant as he plays with other giants and absorbs their lessons, among them trumpeters Miles Davis, Art Farmer, Kenny Dorham, and Clifford Brown; pianists Thelonious Monk, John Lewis, Kenny Drew, Horace Silver, Ray Bryant, Red Garland, and Tommy Flanagan; drummers Max Roach, Roy Haynes, Art Blakey, and Philly Joe Jones; and fellow sax men Jackie McLean and John Coltrane (on the superb album ""Tenor Madness""). Company doesn't get any better than this!A caveat: this is not ""The Complete Prestige Recordings,"" the pricey, now-out-of-print box released in 1992, which had seven discs and numerous takes not included on the original albums. These are the cuts found on the original albums only, reproduced in high fidelity. Here is a track listing with timings:Disc 11 The Way You Look Tonight (5:16)2 I Want to Be Happy (7:44)3 The Stopper (3:00)4 Almost Like Being in Love (3:26)5 No Moe (3:32)6 In a Sentimental Mood (3:21)7 Scoops (2:16)8 With a Song in My Heart (3:09)9 Newk's Fadeaway (3:15)10 Time on My Hands (2:43)11 This Love of Mine (2:27)12 Shadrack (2:35)13 On a Slow Boat to China (2:41)14 Mambo Bounce (2:25)15 I Know (2:33)Disc 21 Moving Out (4:28)2 Swingin' for Bumsy (5:45)3 Silk 'n' Satin (3:58)4 Solid (6:25)5 More Than You Know (10:47)6 There's No Business Like Show Business (6:18)7 Paradox (4:56)8 Raincheck (5:58)9 There Are Such Things (9:28)10 It's All Right with Me (6:08)Disc 31 I Remember You (3:08)2 My Melancholy Baby (2:45)3 Old Folks (2:53)4 They Can't Take That Away from Me (3:00)5 Just Friends (2:48)6 My Little Suede Shoes (2:48)7 Star Eyes (9:06)8 I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face (4:50)9 Kids Know (11:35)10 St Thomas (6:43)11 You Don't Know What Love Is (6:24)12 Strode Rode (5:11)13 Moritat (10:03)14 Blue Seven (11:10)Disc 41 Ee-Ah (6:56)2 B.

"""How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying"" was first staged in 1961, and the film was released in 1967, neatly bookending the ""Mad Men"" era. Even at that time, corporate conformity, stupidity, sexism, nepotism, brown-nosing, and backstabbing were ripe for satire, and this technicolor cartoon of a movie perfectly captures the comic spirit of the times. It winks at the audience with subversively farcical characters and correspondingly broad performances from most of the original Broadway actors.The cast is led by the irrepressible and irresistible Robert Morse as J. Pierrepont Finch (that's F-I-N-C-H), an ambitious window washer who finds love and climbs to the top of the ladder by being as endearing as he is Machiavellian. Hilarious stereotypes abound: the clueless president of World Wide Wickets, J.B. Biggley (Rudy Vallee); his lazy, whining, tantrum-throwing nephew, Bud Frump (Anthony Teague); his sexpot mistress, Hedy LaRue (Maureen Arthur); and his domineering executive secretary, Miss Jones (Ruth Kobart). Michelle Lee plays Rosemary Pilkington, Finch's secretarial love interest, and she's cute as a button.Frank Loesser, who wrote both ""Guys and Dolls"" and ""How to Succeed"" with Abe Burrows, gives us glorious music and infernally clever lyrics that are sure to make you laugh and keep you humming long after the film is over. The bouncy score includes the memorable songs ""How to,"" ""The Company Way,"" ""A Secretary Is Not a Toy,"" ""Been a Long Day,"" ""Grand Old Ivy,"" ""I Believe in You,"" ""Brotherhood of Man,"" and more. The choreography by Bob Fosse is a continual delight.This breezy romp deservedly won seven Tony Awards and a Pulitzer Prize during its long run in New York City, but I must dock the film a star for cutting several terrific musical numbers from the stage version and the DVD a star for lackluster presentation on a bare-bones disk. The low-resolution image deserves a thorough cleaning and a Blu-ray release -- with a few extras, please!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4Q2KOJZNTQZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=079284484X#wasThisHelpful","R4Q2KOJZNTQZ3","A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How is it possible? An 11-year-old kid from Indonesia has fully absorbed the ideas and techniques of some of the greatest masters in the history of jazz. He plays with the fluency, dexterity, subtlety, and imagination of someone who has been studying for many years, yet he's done this primarily through exposure to recordings. Yes, he's prodigiously gifted to begin with, but he brings more to the keyboard than that. He brings creative ideas of his own. He brings genius.Only five years after first touching the piano and three years after being discovered by Herbie Hancock, Joey Alexander presents eight standards and an original piece on his debut album. The bebop improvisation of Thelonious Monk (""'Round Midnight"" and ""I Mean You') and the modal jazz of John Coltrane and McCoy Tyner (""Giant Steps"" and the title track) are clearly among the strongest of Joey's many influences, along with Duke Ellington, Bill Evans, and others. He possesses a deep understanding of their melodies and harmonies, their phrasing and rhythms. This is part of what led Wynton Marsalis to become a mentor and New York Times critic Nate Chinen to call him ""a thoughtful musician as well as a natural one, with a sophisticated harmonic palette and a dynamic sensitivity.""The brilliant sidemen in the trios on this CD -- drummers Ulysses Owens and Sammy Miller, bassists Larry Grenadier and Russell Hall -- add complexity to Joey's compelling readings of Billy Strayhorn's ""Lush Life,"" Rodgers & Hammerstein's ""It Might as Well Be Spring,"" and Dizzy Gillespie's ""Tour de Force,"" on which he's also joined by trumpeter Alphonso Horne. He wraps up the album with an exquisitely delicate solo interpretation of Arlen & Harburg's ""Over the Rainbow.""Phenomenal talent and astonishing maturity aside, there is always the danger that precocity may be exploited to the detriment of the artist or the art, so one hopes the kinds of pressures Joey is living with now will not lead to burnout. With the care and encouragement that the cream of the jazz world has given him, though, I think it's safe to say he will continue to grow and develop as a performer and we will be hearing from him for many years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E9T5JBKLUXG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZE3W0C#wasThisHelpful","R3E9T5JBKLUXG2","A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kirsty MacColl, daughter of the renowned Scottish singer-songwriter and political activist Ewan MacColl, was quite successful in her own right in Britain during the 1980s and 90s. She released five studio albums (""Kite"" and ""Titanic Days"" were favorites of mine), two compilation albums, and a set of live recordings from BBC1, yet she unfortunately received relatively little notice in the U.S. This new anthology nicely sums up her wide-ranging compositions and performances, including pop, rock, new wave, country, folk, and world music. It's not chronological, instead blending 43 tracks from various phases of her career into a pleasing whole, an ample sampling of hits, b-sides, and rarities.MacColl not only wrote most of her own songs, she also wrote for Tracey Ullman (""They Don't Know"") and sang on many records by the likes of Robert Plant, Alison Moyet, Simple Minds, Talking Heads, Big Country, The Smiths, and others. ""All I Ever Wanted"" presents multiple tracks from each of Kirsty's own albums, together with a couple of live performances, including ""He's on the Beach"" and ""A New England"" with Billy Bragg. Since most of her UK hits were not particularly popular on this side of the pond, I'll list a few of them. You may have heard ""My Affair,"" ""Walking Down Madison,"" ""Fairytale of New York"" (with The Pogues), ""There's a Guy Works Down the Chip Shop Swears He's Elvis,"" or covers of The Kinks' ""Days"" and Carole King's ""Keep Your Hands Off My Baby.""Just after the release of her fifth studio album, the wonderfully diverse ""Tropical Brainstorm,"" inspired by Latin music and her trips to Cuba, Kirsty MacColl was tragically killed by a speed boat while swimming with her family in the Caribbean Sea off Cozumel, Mexico. Remarkably, no fewer than eight posthumous anthologies have appeared, but this is her first two-CD collection, and she deserves it. It's full of delightful surprises like the hilarious ""In These Shoes?"" (later covered by Bette Midler) and ""I'm Going Out with an Eighty Year Old Millionaire,"" and it comes with a colorfully illustrated 32-page booklet and a lengthy essay that give listeners an in-depth look at her life and times.

"This imported set of five of Coen Brothers' movies on Blu-ray, currently selling for just $23, offers a unique brand of comedy at an exceptionally  low cost; the discs are playable in all regions. The first three come with full complements of extras, but the last two (""Barton Fink"" and ""Intolerable Cruelty"") do not, tempting me to dock the collection a star in my rating. However, the overall greatness of the films and the excellent value in this package prevent me from doing so.The Coens are a prickly pair of daring auteurs whose sometimes affectionate and often misanthropic takes on humanity are not to everyone's taste. They write for their favorite actors, among them George Clooney, John Goodman, John Turturro, and Steve Buscemi, who repeatedly appear in their ensembles, providing them endlessly wry dialog and deliciously clever irony.The films:The critically praised but bleakly comic ""A Serious Man"" (2009) deals with a quest by a physics professor (Michael Stuhlbarg) to understand the purpose of his life, one continually beset by misfortune and absurdity. As his family, career, and finances disintegrate, the professor turns to his Jewish faith for a consolation that is questionable at best. The story inevitably brings to mind the biblical book of Job.Set in Washington, DC, ""Burn After Reading"" (2008) features a terrific troupe of actors: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, and John Malkovich. They play arrogant, avaricious, duplicitous, sex-obsessed, and downright stupid schmucks who collide with one another and with fate in myriad combinations and permutations. Spy thriller meets Laurel & Hardy and riotous misadventure ensues.Cult classic ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998) is as odd as they come, a gleefully profane and hallucinatory story about bowling, mistaken identity, and mind-altering substances. Its characters include a philanthropist, a pornographer, a police chief, a Vietnam veteran, a farmer's daughter gone bad, a gang of German nihilists, and the ultimate slacker, indelibly portrayed by Jeff ""The Dude"" Bridges. He's joined by an all-star cast: John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore, Ben Gazzara, Tara Reid, David Thewlis, Sam Elliott, and others.The surreal, paranoid ""Barton Fink"" (1991) is an atmospheric cross between Franz Kafka and William Burroughs. John Turturro plays a playwright-turned-screenwriter suffering from writer's block and John Goodman plays his insurance agent neighbor at a run-down hotel in Hollywood. Under pressure to complete a screenplay for a studio, Fink finds inspiration in a very dark source. What's in the box? That's for you to figure out!Finally, there's ""Intolerable Cruelty"" (2003), which concerns a high-powered divorce attorney (George Clooney) and the beautiful gold-digger he falls for (Catherine Zeta-Jones). This is a very funny, take-no-prisoners battle of the sexes in which only the most relentlessly scheming character can win.My recommendation:Buy this collection. If you add the similarly low-priced -- and similarly wonderful -- Blu-ray anthology ""From the Minds of the Coen Brothers"" (""Blood Simple,"" ""Fargo,"" ""Miller's Crossing,"" and ""Raising Arizona"") and a few individual films (""O Brother, Where Art Thou?,"" ""No Country for Old Men,"" and ""True Grit""), you will have the 12 Coen movies that I think matter most, a weirdly enthralling mix of comedy and tragedy imbued with mystery, poetry, and genius.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z10732JRE4Q6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OW7U7U#wasThisHelpful","R2Z10732JRE4Q6","A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an odd pairing of dystopian sci-fi movies.""Children of Men"" is a five-star adaptation by Spanish director Alfonso Cuaron of the novel by English writer P.D. James. It presents a grim, haunting future in which human beings have ceased to produce children and society has descended into a state of hopelessness and lawlessness. Amid this crisis, a woman becomes pregnant, and she must be taken through a violent no-man's-land to a place of refuge where mankind may be rescued from its infertility. There is both action and humanity in this story, which causes the viewer to both fear and care for its characters. The actors, led by Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, and Clare-Hope Ashitey, are all brilliant.On the other hand, ""Repo Men"" (not to be confused with the hilarious 1984 film ""Repo Man"") is a two-star movie at best, a big, dumb cliché that wastes fine actors -- Jude Law, Forest Whitaker, Liev Schreiber, and Alice Braga -- on one-dimensional characters. The gruesome story concerns a future in which people are charged extortionate prices for replacement organs, which are then ""reposessed"" when the buyer can't make payments. It blatantly steals elements from much better films like ""Blade Runner"" and ""Brazil.""Both of the Blu-rays in this compact case contain plentiful extras including director commentary, numerous featurettes, and deleted scenes. Since this set is being offered at the same low price as the single-disc edition of ""Children of Men,"" I give it four stars, deducting one for the fact that viewers will be tempted to waste their time on the second disc.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EYVIR955PKV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C7MW5JS#wasThisHelpful","R1EYVIR955PKV","A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why Motown kept this spectacular, history-making night of musical entertainment locked in their vaults for over 30 years is a mystery. Though LP, VHS, and LaserDisc recordings exist, no DVD of it was released until 2014, when one-, three-, and six-disc editions came out with hours of retrospective interviews, rehearsal footage, and featurettes; there's still nothing on CD or Blu-ray (though the image quality of the show really doesn't justify a Blu-ray release). The live two-hour television special, recorded in Pasadena, California, in March of 1983, both honored Motown founder Berry Gordy in the 25th year of the company's existence and benefited research on sickle-cell anemia. Hosted by comedian Richard Pryor, it featured prime performances by Motown's greatest stars (only Gladys Knight and The Pips were absent). The show won Emmy and Peabody Awards and was nominated for a Grammy.Among the program's many highlights are Michael Jackson doing ""Billie Jean"" and his first recorded moonwalk, Marvin Gaye singing ""What's Going On"" in one of his final performances (he was killed less than a year later), a wonderful Temptations/Four Tops ""battle of the bands,"" and a reunion of Diana Ross & The Supremes on ""Someday We'll Be Together."" There are long medleys by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Stevie Wonder, and The Jackson 5, and hits from Martha Reeves (""Heat Wave""), Mary Wells (""My Guy""), Junior Walker (""Shotgun""), The Commodores (""Brick House""), and José Feliciano (who pays tribute to the dying Jackie Wilson with ""Lonely Teardrops""). A couple of young, lesser-known acts round out the program: DeBarge and High Inergy.Non-Motown performers take the stage, too: Linda Ronstadt for two lovely duets with Smokey Robinson (""Ooh Baby Baby"" and ""The Tracks of My Tears"") and Dick Clark to talk about how the television show ""American Bandstand"" helped break Motown to a wider audience. Very oddly, the antic British pop star Adam Ant pops up singing the Supremes' ""Where Did Our Love Go,"" during which Diana Ross impulsively comes out on stage to dance with him, but that's really the only misstep in an otherwise perfect show. You'll learn a lot about the history of Detroit's preeminent record label, listen in on a songwriters' round-table, watch clips of Motown movies hosted by Billy Dee Williams, and see many archival music clips. The excitement of the audience and affection the artists feel for one another is palpable. Nothing has ever matched it or will ever match it for Motown fans.For those considering a purchase, your choice depends on how devoted a fan you are. The one-disc edition includes the extended version of the Motown 25 concert, a making-of featurette, and a performers' reunion featuring Smokey Robinson, Duke Fakir of the Four Tops, Otis Williams of The Temptations, and executive producer Suzanne de Passe. It should be enough for most casual fans. The three-disc set offered on this page adds a Marvin Gaye rehearsal; featurettes about Gaye, The Temptations and Four Tops, and the Motown company; a reunion roundtable with director Don Mischer, writer Buz Kohan, de Passe, and other executives; and more of the reunion with Robinson, Fakir, and Williams as well as Claudette Robinson of The Miracles and Martha Reeves of Martha and the Vandellas.The deluxe six-disc box, available from Time-Life, is only for die-hards and completists.

Though LP, VHS, and LaserDisc recordings exist, no DVD of it was released until 2014, when one-, three-, and six-disc editions came out with hours of retrospective interviews, rehearsal footage, and featurettes; there's still nothing on CD or Blu-ray (though the image quality of the show really doesn't justify a Blu-ray release). The live two-hour television special, recorded in Pasadena, California, in March of 1983, both honored Motown founder Berry Gordy in the 25th year of the company's existence and benefited research on sickle-cell anemia. Hosted by comedian Richard Pryor, it featured prime performances by Motown's greatest stars (only Gladys Knight and The Pips were absent). The show won Emmy and Peabody Awards and was nominated for a Grammy.Among the program's many highlights are Michael Jackson doing ""Billie Jean"" and his first recorded moonwalk, Marvin Gaye singing ""What's Going On"" in one of his final performances (he was killed less than a year later), a wonderful Temptations/Four Tops ""battle of the bands,"" and a reunion of Diana Ross & The Supremes on ""Someday We'll Be Together."" There are long medleys by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Stevie Wonder, and The Jackson 5, and hits from Martha Reeves (""Heat Wave""), Mary Wells (""My Guy""), Junior Walker (""Shotgun""), The Commodores (""Brick House""), and José Feliciano (who pays tribute to the dying Jackie Wilson with ""Lonely Teardrops""). A couple of young, lesser-known acts round out the program: DeBarge and High Inergy.Non-Motown performers take the stage, too: Linda Ronstadt for two lovely duets with Smokey Robinson (""Ooh Baby Baby"" and ""The Tracks of My Tears"") and Dick Clark to talk about how the television show ""American Bandstand"" helped break Motown to a wider audience. Very oddly, the antic British pop star Adam Ant pops up singing the Supremes' ""Where Did Our Love Go,"" during which Diana Ross impulsively comes out on stage to dance with him, but that's really the only misstep in an otherwise perfect show. You'll learn a lot about the history of Detroit's preeminent record label, listen in on a songwriters' round-table, watch clips of Motown movies hosted by Billy Dee Williams, and see many archival music clips. The excitement of the audience and affection the artists feel for one another is palpable. Nothing has ever matched it or will ever match it for Motown fans.For those considering a purchase, your choice depends on how devoted a fan you are. The one-disc edition on this page includes the extended version of the Motown 25 concert, a making-of featurette, and a performers' reunion featuring Smokey Robinson, Duke Fakir of the Four Tops, Otis Williams of The Temptations, and executive producer Suzanne de Passe. It should be enough for most casual fans. The three-disc set adds a Marvin Gaye rehearsal; featurettes about Gaye, The Temptations and Four Tops, and the Motown company; a reunion roundtable with director Don Mischer, writer Buz Kohan, de Passe, and other executives; and more of the reunion with Robinson, Fakir, and Williams as well as Claudette Robinson of The Miracles and Martha Reeves of Martha and the Vandellas.The deluxe six-disc box, available from Time-Life, is only for die-hards and completists. It adds a Stevie Wonder rehearsal; featurettes on the history of Motown, the Motown sound, and Smokey Robinson and the Miracles; a complete songwriters' roundtable from 1983 featuring Mickey Stevenson, Norman Whitfield, Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, Eddie Holland, Harvey Fuqua, and Ron Miller; interviews with Robinson, Whitfield, Holland-Dozier-Holland, Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson, and others; an entire disc devoted to interviews with every executive, engineer, writer, and agent that Motown could round up; and a large, colorful booklet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PJL587C9Y8GH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9OPA56#wasThisHelpful","R1PJL587C9Y8GH","A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the invitation of the Kremlin, Billy Joel took the first large-scale rock tour to the Soviet Union in 1987, performing his greatest hits in Tbilisi, Moscow, and Leningrad as a good-will ambassador to a nation in the throes of change. In doing so, he became one of the powerful cultural influences that brought about the dissolution of that nation. Gorbachev introduced perestroika in 1986 and added glasnost in 1988, so Joel's concerts were of a piece with the new freedoms and opening to the West that transformed the Soviet bloc.There are several ways to buy the concerts: as a two-CD set, as a DVD or Blu-ray, or in deluxe editions which pair a DVD or Blu-ray with the CDs. The audio recordings present 11 tracks that weren't on the original LP, called simply ""Concert,"" while the video discs include seven songs not on the original VHS release, entitled ""Live From Leningrad."" The sound and picture are excellent, as are the performances of Billy and his band. Although he strained his voice a bit early on in the tour, he managed to overcome the problem and put on exciting, energetic shows.The 75-minute Showtime documentary added to the deluxe editions makes a strong argument for buying one of them. It captures the warmth, intimacy, excitement, and chaos of the tour, offering not only numerous clips from the concerts but also behind-the-scenes activities, a travelogue, and meetings with Russians. The many people involved (family, band, crew, producer, translator, and others) reflect on the pains and pleasures of the experience. Billy took his then-wife Christie Brinkley and baby daughter Alexa along; young Russians embraced them wholeheartedly and they reciprocated the feelings.

"With the exception of an overlong and rather turgid military epic, ""Battle of the Bulge,"" this is a strong collection for Henry Fonda fans. It presents the actor in movies with a range of themes and fine supporting actors like Jack Lemmon, Charles Laughton, Walter Pidgeon, Burgess Meredith, Gene Tierney, Robert Ryan, Dana Andrews, James Cagney, and Vera Miles. Great directors are also represented in Alfred Hitchcock's suspenseful crime drama ""The Wrong Man"", Otto Preminger's superb political piece ""Advise and Consent"", and John Ford's entertaining wartime comedy ""Mister Roberts.""All four DVDs offer trailers and other extras including commentary on the Preminger and Ford films and featurettes on the other two. ""Mister Roberts"" has excerpts from Ed Sullivan's TV series ""Toast of the Town,"" paying tribute to the actor, and from the documentary ""Fonda on Fonda,"" covering his work on the play and the movie. (For your information, this low-priced set, containing four separate cases in a slipcover, has been re-released in a single compact case and re-titled ""Turner Classic Movies - Greatest Classic Legends Film Collection: Henry Fonda."" Many buyers will prefer this repackaging as it reduces the bulk of the box by three-fourths.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23S987AC64SSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007I6ITU2#wasThisHelpful","R23S987AC64SSG","A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Time Bandits"" is a weird and amusing fairy tale of a boy named Kevin who escapes from his technology-obsessed parents after six dwarfs burst through his wardrobe door. They've stolen a map from the Supreme Being and are intent on plundering the past, but they're pursued through time by the Evil Genius, meeting Napoleon, Robin Hood, Agamemnon, and other characters historical and fictional.This intensely phantasmagorical spectacle is a must-see for children, children at heart, and fans of Terry Gilliam's singularly playful, satirical vision. He lets his imagination run riot, producing a film full of humor, action, adventure, and special effects. It features splendid performances from a cast that includes Ian Holm, Ralph Richardson, Sean Connery, and members of Monty Python.Hundreds of Amazon reviewers have contributed reviews of this classic fantasy -- both glowing and dismissive -- but nearly all of them have been for earlier editions on VHS, Laserdisc, DVD, double DVD, Instant Video, HD Instant Video, etc. As usual, all of them are lumped together on a single page. The few who have purchased the Blu-ray praise the film but don't tell you what's on the disc. I will.The 2014 Criterion release is the version to get. It contains a pristine restoration personally supervised by Gilliam as well as full-length audio commentary by Gilliam, co-writer Michael Palin, and actors John Cleese, David Warner, and Craig Warnock. The picture is clean, sharp, and colorful, and the remastered sound is crystal clear.There's also a new documentary featuring production designer Milly Burns and costume designer James Acheson, a conversation with Gilliam of over an hour filmed at the 1998 Midnight Sun Film Festival, and a clip of actor Shelley Duvall on the Tomorrow show in 1981. Rounding out the package are a gallery of photos, a trailer, and an essay by film critic David Sterritt.My highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27YHG9QZLRMU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NMUCHNS#wasThisHelpful","R27YHG9QZLRMU7","A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Formerly known as ""The Signature Collection"" and packaged in a big box containing four separate cases, this ridiculously low-priced set of four DVDs now comes in a single compact case with all of the same bonus features on the earlier collection, including making-of featurettes, vintage cartoons, theatrical trailers, subtitles in English, French, and Spanish, and more. If you want to understand the affection that fans have for Lauren Bacall, the film icon who passed away only this year, this is the set to get.Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall acted together in four terrific movies, all of which are here. Their collaboration began with the World War II drama ""To Have And Have Not,"" a 1944 feature by director Howard Hawks that saw the screen debut of the 19-year-old Bacall, a sultry siren who smoldered her way into the hearts of nearly every American man. Her fabulous face, provocative slouch, fierce independence, and the immortal line ""You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and blow"" persuaded Bogie to help the French fight the Germans, adding intrigue and action to romance. They also seem to have convinced him to divorce his third wife and marry Bacall in 1945; he widowed her in 1957.Hawks cast the couple again in 1946 for his rendering of Raymond Chandler's infamously convoluted noir novel ""The Big Sleep,"" a book with a plot so complex that it required three writers, including William Faulkner, to draft the screenplay. Bogie plays one of his most iconic roles, the cynical private eye Philip Marlowe, who is hired by a wealthy family to solve a case of blackmail but who descends with Bacall into a dangerous mix of mystery and murder.In 1947, they were paired in another stylish film noir, ""Dark Passage."" Bogart escapes from San Quentin and meets Bacall, who becomes his only ally when he's framed for murder and has plastic surgery to give him a new face. Agnes Moorehead does a marvelous turn as a vicious harridan.Finally, Bogie and Bacall were reunited in the deliciously suspenseful 1948 movie ""Key Largo,"" adapted for the screen by director and screenwriter John Huston from Maxwell Anderson's 1939 play. As a hurricane approaches, a sadistic mobster played by Edward G. Robinson holds three people at gunpoint: an ex-GI (Bogart), a hotel owner (Bacall), and her invalid father-in-law (Lionel Barrymore). You know from the start this is going to be good.These four classics, emblematic of post-war American cinema, are replete with gripping storylines, riveting dialog, perfect chemistry, and fine cinematography, delighting the mind as well as the eye. There's even a 1945 pre-release version of ""The Big Sleep,"" together with a short feature comparing it to the final version. Radio lovers can listen to a 1946 Lux Radio Theater Broadcast of ""To Have and Have Not"" with the original cast.I emphatically recommend this anthology if you want DVDs, but I for one am waiting for it to come out in a Blu-ray edition to go with my copy of ""The Best of Bogart Collection"" on Blu-ray. That set assembles ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941), ""Casablanca"" (1942), ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" (1947), and ""The African Queen"" (1951) in a single box with loads of supplements, and I endorse it equally strongly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGT4OIHJ1R562/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MH8IV0O#wasThisHelpful","RGT4OIHJ1R562","A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Europe gave us opera; the United States gave us musicals. They are quintessentially American: brash, joyful, and kaleidoscopic. In their 20th-century heyday, the likes of Cole Porter, Frank Loesser, Stephen Sondheim, and the duos of Rodgers & Hammerstein, Lerner & Loewe, and Kander & Ebb created classic Broadway productions that utterly entranced a nation. Their music and lyrics became America's soundtrack. While those days are gone, the magic and music remain, so young folks who may have only heard echoes of them on the TV show ""Glee"" need a cultural primer.This anthology of 25 CDs includes nearly all of the essentials, and it's bargain to boot! It's not for aficionados like me who already have these Tony-Award-winning shows in our libraries, but it's the motherload of musicals for any new fan, and one hopes it will whet the appetite for some actual theater-going or at least some viewing of the film versions. Most are original cast recordings, many of them also Grammy winners, but a handful are revivals (""Anything Goes,"" ""Carousel,"" ""Guys and Dolls,"" ""The King and I,"" ""Man of La Mancha,"" ""Oklahoma!"" and ""Show Boat""). The box includes a booklet with period photos, brief summaries, and track listings for each disc.Just look at some of the hits and stars you will hear in glorious stereo:1. ""Tomorrow"" and ""It's a Hard-Knock Life"" (""Annie"" with Andrea McArdle and Dorothy Loudon)2. ""You're the Top,"" ""Easy to Love,"" and ""I Get a Kick Out of You"" (""Anything Goes"" with Patti LuPone)3. ""Willkommen,"" ""Tomorrow Belongs to Me,"" and ""The Money Song"" (""Cabaret"" with Liza Minnelli and Joel Grey)4. ""If Ever I Would Leave You"" (""Camelot"" with Julie Andrews, Robert Goulet, and Richard Burton)5. ""If I Loved You"" and ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" (""Carousel"" with John Raitt)6. ""Razzle Dazzle"" and ""All That Jazz"" (""Chicago"" with Jerry Orbach, Gwen Verdon, and Chita Rivera)7. ""One"" and ""What I Did for Love"" (""A Chorus Line"" with Donna McKechnie)8. ""Ladies Who Lunch"" and ""Being Alive"" (""Company"" with Dean Jones and Elaine Stritch)9. ""Tradition,"" ""Matchmaker,"" ""If I Were a Rich Man,"" and ""Sunrise, Sunset"" (""Fiddler on the Roof"" with Zero Mostel)10. ""A Bushel and a Peck,"" ""Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat,"" and ""Luck Be a Lady"" (""Guys and Dolls"" with Nathan Lane)11. ""Everything's Coming Up Roses"" and ""Let Me Entertain You"" (""Gypsy"" with Ethel Merman)12. ""Aquarius,"" ""Easy to Be Hard,"" and ""Good Morning, Starshine"" (""Hair"")13. ""Before the Parade Passes By"" and ""It Only Takes a Moment"" (Hello, Dolly!"" with Carol Channing)14. ""The Company Way,"" ""Been a Long Day,"" ""I Believe in You,"" and ""Brotherhood of Man"" (""How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying"" with Robert Morse and Rudy Vallee)15. ""No One Is Alone"" and ""Children Will Listen"" (""Into the Woods"" with Bernadette Peters)16. ""Getting to Know You"" and ""Shall We Dance"" (""The King and I"" with Darren McGavin)17.

"These 12 albums, produced in the space of seven years, are the first group recordings under the leadership of the piano genius Bill Evans, a man revered in the annals of jazz for the groundbreaking invention and impressionistic beauty of his music. He not only covered many of the greatest jazz standards; he also wrote a number of his own such as the breathtakingly lovely tune ""Waltz for Debby.""Though he continued producing dozens of wonderful albums until his death in 1980, the sets in this collection must considered his artistic peak, a flourishing of creativity that inspired the many legends with whom he played, among them George Russell, Charles Mingus, Cannonball Adderley, Art Farmer, Chet Baker, Lee Konitz, Warne Marsh, John Lewis, Jim Hall, Kai Winding, Oliver Nelson, Tadd Dameron, Benny Golson, and perhaps most importantly Miles Davis on the 1959 album ""Kind of Blue.""Evans' trio recordings are brilliant, a complex interplay of exquisite sympathy and sensitivity that must be experienced to be understood. Words simply don't do them justice. His bass players included Teddy Kotick, Sam Jones, Percy Heath, Chuck Israels, and especially Scott LaFaro, while his drummers encompassed Philly Joe Jones, Connie Kay, Shelly Manne, and the amazing Paul Motian. All are studio albums with the exception of the live ""Sunday at the Village Vanguard."" He also plays with guitarist Jim Hall on a duet album entitled ""Undercurrent"" and with Hall and trumpeter Freddie Hubbard in a quintet on ""Interplay.""At just over a dollar per album, this anthology is an unbelievable bargain, made possible by the fact that European copyrights last only 50 years and by the ability of a CD to hold two LPs, for a total time of just under eight hours of music on six discs. It's not perfectly comprehensive, since a couple of albums from this period (""On Green Dolphin Street"" and ""Nirvana"") are not presented, and it doesn't have several tracks added in later CD editions, but what a wealth of indelible music is here!

"For most of the 20th century, the movie music greats, many of them transplanted Europeans, naturally drew from the classical canon: Max Steiner, Alfred Newman, Bernard Herrmann, Elmer Bernstein, Ennio Morricone, John Williams, Maurice Jarre, John Berry, Nino Rota, Jerry Goldsmith, and so on. Some of them, like Aaron Copland, Miklós Rózsa, Sergei Prokofiev, and Dmitri Shostakovitch, were first and foremost classical composers. As the cinema approached this century, however, its composers began to diversify greatly, drawing from so many traditions -- jazz, rock, folk, and other genres -- that it became very hard to categorize them. Ry Cooder sounds nothing like Danny Elfman or Randy Newman or James Horner or Hans Zimmer or anyone else, for that matter.Since the 1960s, Cooder has been producing music of an enormously eclectic range, from traditional to modern, on his own and in collaboration with the likes of Captain Beefheart, Eric Clapton, The Rolling Stones, Van Morrison, Neil Young, David Lindley, John Hiatt, Nick Lowe, The Chieftains, and The Doobie Brothers. He is clearly influenced by such deeply American traditions as bluegrass, delta blues, Tex-Mex, Dixieland, and gospel, but he blends them together with other musical strains (including Hawaiian, African, Latin, etc.) to create unique soundtracks.This collection presents complete film scores from seven movies that Cooder scored in the 1980s and 1990s. They come on seven CDs in thin sleeves, contained in a sturdy case. Three of them (""The Long Riders,"" ""Paris, Texas,"" and ""Crossroads"") are fine films in their own right. The others (""Alamo Bay,"" ""Blue City,"" ""Johnny Handsome,"" and ""Trespass"") are far less memorable, but the music is never less than inspired. The box is very different from the 1995 release ""Music by Ry Cooder,"" a two-CD sampler from 11 different movies. Both are recommended; your choice, I suppose, depends on how big a fan you are. But if you love film music, you need Ry in your collection. He really is one of the greats.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36J0H6R08Q8XE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M97MWUI#wasThisHelpful","R36J0H6R08Q8XE","A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ex-Army Ranger Dare Connors has experienced more trauma and violence than one person should ever know in a lifetime. Freshly discharged from the Army, he’s taking things slowly as he adjusts to his new civilian life, living with his best friend and working as an auto mechanic. But nothing could have prepared him for how Berkeley Holtz would bring him to life. He’s drawn to her immediately—and is immediately shot down.Berkeley is no shrinking violet. She’s grown up in a military household, surrounded by the rigid military expectations and she has no interest in keeping military part of her life long term. So when Dare appears at her restaurant looking the look and talking the talk, she puts him immediately in his place. Only…it’s not that easy. Dare is not easily dissuaded and not easily resisted. When they keep turning up in each other’s paths, eventually Berkeley takes a chance on this sensitive, sexy hero and their relationship takes off.I really liked Berkeley and Dare. They were adorable together and completely likeable people separately. I appreciate a strong heroine, and Berkeley—though she was being pulled in several different directions by the people she loved—never let herself be bullied or walked over. Dare is all alpha protective without ever being controlling or overbearing. I was impressed by how Diana Gardin pulled that off—it was one of my favorite things about him. He wanted Berkeley to be her own person, but God help anyone who looked at her sideways. That right there? That’s the formula for sex on a stick.There were some times when the pace moved a little slowly for me. I felt like Dare’s Ranger experiences maybe deserved more attention, and may have added a lot more to the tension between Dare and Berkeley. I was a little doubtful about how the conflict was going to play out, but in the end it was emotional and suspenseful with a resolution that made my heart happy.Overall, I really enjoyed the whole package here. There’s a little bit of suspense, some hot and heavy scenes, and a surprising number of banter-y moments that gave me a chuckle or left me with a huge smile on my face. Last True Hero is a great foundation for this exciting new series, and I’m completely invested in finding out what comes next! ~ Shelly, 4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAYA8X9ATNVL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01719E8QY#wasThisHelpful","RAYA8X9ATNVL8","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am having a moment with Licked. Several, in fact. On replay in my head. How could I not? It has a retro-cool lady, sassy ice cream, tickle-your-funny-bone humor and not one but TWO swoonworthy, panty-melting, perfectly lickable, men. Oh, and the feels, people. It has the feels.Please, PLEASE, don't be like me and nearly overlook this fabulous book. Because despite my cover lust (gorge) and my author curiosity (Brooke Blaine is new-to-me but I've heard many good things), I nearly got tripped up by the blurb. Triangles...not my favorite shape unless it involves some three-way action. But NEVER FEAR. This is a true rom-com (it reads like your favorite movie, no lie), where the triangle is played beautifully. For laughs, for love and for want of propelling the story. It wasn't rip-your-heart-out-and-make-you-bleed; it was oh-they're-perfect-I'll-take-one-off-your-hands.Ms. Blaine gave me funny. Wild. Cute. A little angsty. And a whole lotta sexy. (Also, boozy ice cream cravings). Cameron and Hunter. *Sigh* I won't lie and say I didn't think about a little ménage action to make Ryleigh's choice easier but it worked this way too. Because if someone still needs a HEA, then I get another book from this excellent new series. And there are SO many options for what could come next. Ryleigh's friends...pick one, Ms. Blaine. I'm in, no question.Why? Because Licked got me right in the funny bone—and in the feels. There was more than one watery smile (big smile, just a little water) when her sweet words, loveable men and delicious ice cream came together to give me my moment(s). So, please—PLEASE—if you've made it this far through my review, get Licked. It's wonderful.Now, back to my moment (and replaying it over and over in my head.) ~ Beth, 5 stars~~~Oh, my goodness. I have been utterly and completely charmed by this book. It's like this perfect cocktail (see what I did there?) of lighthearted, smart humor, adorable, swoony moments, and hot, hot sexy times that made my heart race and my Kindle smoke. And all those things were mixed together with some hilarious and delicious sounding ice cream concoctions—which were basically my secondary character crushes in this book. I'm not even lying. That ice cream was dead sexy.I am a huge sucker for romantic comedies, and was drawn to this sort of unique storyline even though I was a little wary of the love triangle. Love triangles often end with me having a Kindle-smashing moment. They sort of stress me out. Not this one though! I am happy to report that this one was brilliantly and beautifully done. It was adorable, really, watching the relationships in this book develop and deepen—even the conflict never felt overly wrought.Licked is just fun. Full of swoony moments punctuated with actual laugh-out-loud moments (and there are many), and just a teeny bit of angst, which really only serves to intensify that swoony butterflies feeling. Mostly, this book is a recipe for heart happiness.This whole story was simply perfect. I want to gush about it for days, but it's impossible to do that without giving anything away. So, in the interest of remaining spoiler free, you'll have to take my word for it. Or—better yet—see for yourself! You won't regret it! ~ Shelly, 5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VRU6X7J4462K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017UPRQWC#wasThisHelpful","R2VRU6X7J4462K","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not usually drawn to alternate point of view stories. However, I loved The Education of Caroline (the original telling of this story) so much, and found it so richly layered that I wanted to see the layers from the other side. Sebastian has such a wildly emotional, intense journey I knew that I needed to read his story and experience the book through his eyes. I wasn’t disappointed.If you haven't read The Education of Sebastian and The Education of Caroline first, you should. You'll for sure want to read The Education of Sebastian before starting Semper Fi as it provides important backstory, and an understanding of the history and intensity of Sebastian and Caro’s feelings.Semper Fi follows the same timeline as The Education of Caroline. Thus, after a torrid and intense love affair ended with a devastating blow, Sebastian and Caroline have spent ten years apart before being unexpectedly reunited. A lifetime has passed since they last saw each other, and the time apart changed each of them in such profound ways that they are now essentially strangers. That is, strangers who still feel a connection to each other, a deep pull toward one another. Even after all the years and miles and emotional devastation that separated them, once they are reunited, there is no turning back.This is the story of Sebastian and Caro’s journey back to each other, and of their fierce love that never lets go. No time, no distance, no career assignments or any other curveball that life throws at them (and there are many) can keep them apart. Their reunion is slow, and agonizing—but also intense, beautiful, scorching, and heartbreaking, and so incredibly emotional, I don't even know what to do with these feels.The most emotionally charged pieces of this book revolve around Sebastian's experiences as a Marine. Jane Harvey-Berrick put us right inside his head and we experienced everything with him—the good, the bad, the lusty, the breathlessly romantic, and the ugly. It felt authentic and left me feeling a little bruised and weary—and I loved every moment of it. It's fitting, then, that profits of this book support the military charities, Felix Fund (UK) and EOD Warrior Foundation (USA). It's the most beautiful, touching, and appropriate epilogue that Ms. Harvey-Berrick could ever have given this book. ~ Shelly, 4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22E568QPT4SN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VIALM2#wasThisHelpful","R22E568QPT4SN5","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh, how I loved spending my weekend catching up with this fabulous group of friends. This time around we have Melody in the spotlight—a bright, shiny, “cop interrogation” spotlight that’s making her a bit uncomfortable with her life choices and rash decisions. See, Mel is all about instant gratification—she’s not a patient person, especially when it comes to her pleasure, and yeah, she really likes to… err, come.To prove to her best friends she’s in “control” of things, Melody accepts the bet from her best friends that puts her ladybits on hiatus for a few weeks. Which is perfect timing for Mel to become reacquainted with Jared Myers. And of course, now all she can think about is all the dirty things she’d like to do to and with one hot-as-hell, sex-on-a-stick Jared Myers.But good things come to those who wait, right? Yeah, except the waiting may just kill both of them…Sigh. I just love these characters. Melody. Damn, she’s one stubborn, seize the moment and f--- the consequences personality. Until now. Now when she’s finally opening her eyes to the world around her, she’s realizing that her group of friends really are moving forward with their lives. Sarah and Drew are together and Caroline and Patrick are living together. Sure, the girls are still her best friends and best confidantes, but something is missing. She’s just not sure how to deal with this new reality and it’s hilarious and heartwarming to see her work through things.Jared is swoonworthy. And he and Melody are so alike it’s scary. Their relationship is full of laugh-out-loud witty banter and crazy moments. Trust me when I tell you to not be drinking or eating when you read this because you will spit food and drink. And don’t even think about not reading this in one sitting—you’ll have to know how the bet ends.

"This book! THIS BOOK! It was everything! I couldn’t put it down. I just wanted to keep reading. I didn’t want to have to actually function and adult today because I was so lost in Ben and Fallon’s story!“You’ll never be able to find yourself if you’re lost in someone else.”I literally don’t even know what to say about this book because it was just that good. It made me laugh. It made me cry. I wanted to throw my Kindle at least five different times. And I just couldn’t stop until I got to the very last word.“Fallon, we’ve been dating for two hours now. I can read you like a book, and right now I do believe that book is full of erotica.”I don’t want to spoil any of the story by telling you about it. All I can say repeatedly is READ THIS BOOK! READ THIS BOOK NOW! It was amazing, heart-wrenching, heartwarming, heartbreaking, fantastic, and so much more. It is by far one of the best books I have ever read. There were so many unexpected moments. Seriously, READ THIS BOOK! ~ Tiffany, 5+ stars~~~Wowzers!  I had no idea what I was getting into when I BEGGED to read November 9! I wanted to read it because he was a writer and I love writers.  My heart is fluttering all over the place.  Tears.  Aches.  Love.  OH, THE FEELS!When Fallon and Ben meet, it’s her last day in LA.  She’s moving to NYC.  But that day, they decide to meet each year the same date to continue the novel Ben decided to write.  Each year brings something different, until Fallon becomes unsure of all of it.“You’ll never be able to find yourself if you’re lost in someone else.”This struck a nerve!  What woman hasn’t been told to ‘be yourself or be who you are’ first?  This doesn’t mean you can’t fall in love, or have another person be part of your journey that is life.  How amazing would that be!  Love is a special thing that each and every person should be able to experience.“I have to do this.  I have to force myself to make a life before the one I’m not living swallows me whole.”Oh, my goodness.  I think I stopped, closed my Kindle and started crying.  This.  Just this.  I need to scream, ‘YESSSSSS!’ Anyone who has doubts about their life, or is in the middle of making a huge life change (like I am), will understand this!  I have to do this.  Five very simple words with such strong meaning.“I can’t.  I tried, but I think I’d have to go to AA or something.  You’re just part of my chemical makeup now, I think.”When I dream of love, this is the feeling I want.  I’ve only been in love once and at that time, I couldn’t imagine living without the person.  But it wasn’t the all-consuming love.  The kind where you think of them first.  Where you want to be a better person and are willing to forgive and forget just to have them in your life.  That’s the kind of love I want.Now… CoHo has won me over.  I fell in love with Fallon and Ben.  I laughed with them, I cried with them and for them, I loved with them and loved them, and I wanted to help them.  I wanted to do anything I could to make sure they found their way back to each other—no matter what!  I don’t know if there are enough stars or words to express how I feel about this book, but if you want amazing, you’ll get it with November 9.

"Ahhh!! YEEESSSSS!!! Mike’s story! I was so excited to read this book. I loved Forever Red, Nate and Lia’s story, and so wanted for Mike to get his own. And Ms. Adams has answered those prayers!We met both Mike and Molly in the first book. Mike is Lia and Nate’s best friend, and head of Nate’s security. Molly was a young country star, just starting out when Nate took her under his wing.After Nate and Lia got married, Mike had a hard time so he left the tour. He couldn’t be around them every day, watching their love. However, Lee was still his best friend and when she called, he answered.“At the end of the day, one thing we can agree on. Less is more than my best friend; she’s my constant, the light in my dark, and the one person I can always count on.”So, when she asked him to come back to the tour and be Molly’s security, he said yes.I adore Molly. She is sassy and feisty!“Hell, when you lived with a gaggle of men or as I like to call them, my flock of cock, in a rolling house the size of a dorm room, you tend to see more than you want.”Though, in this book, we got to learn a lot of her secrets that I was quite surprised by. It just made me love her and her strength even more!Mike and Molly knew each other and were friends before he started working for her, but neither one expected the attraction between them.“I craved her. I had to have her. I was so unbelievable f---ed.”The two of them together were sizzling! I really loved watching both Mike and Molly figure out who they are, what they want, and how to get it. They both had tragic pasts and were able to get past them together! This book was the perfect blend of sweet, sexy, funny, and action! And that epilogue—perfection!!I LOVE, LOVE, LOVED how much of Nate and Lia and the rest of the ‘Bama Boys that we got in this story! I cannot wait for Noah and Emily’s story!! ~ Tiffany, 5 stars~~~Michael Carson had his heart broken when his best friend, Lia married his other best friend, Nate Kelly. So, he does what he needs to and checks out for a while, needing time to think and decide what to do now.Molly has been called every name in the book due to the media always overanalyzing and taking things out of context, thinking she's trying to ruin Nate and Lia's marriage. But that is just so far from what the truth really is. One thing is for sure, Molly needs better security detail and Lia knows it, so she goes out to get back the best...Mike Carson!I liked Mike and Molly’s chemistry, yet at times I didn't feel they were really connected—especially when he would call her little one, kid and so on, even after they had been intimate. Other than that, and that annoying ex, whom I really wanted to reach out and smack, I loved how Mike and Molly found love with one another. Though, I was thrown off when Molly’s past came barreling at her, and my goodness, Ms. Adams, you had me in tears!There is plenty of hotness, drama and mystery but, most of all, hope...

"I have no idea how to express what this book did to my heart. It started with a bang of laughter—a literal laugh-out-loud moment that had me all excited for this funny book. And it was a book with many lighthearted, laugh-out-loud moments, but it wasn't just a funny book. It was so, so much more than that.Look, I'm not usually a crier. I mean, sometimes a tear will escape or I'll have a little sniffle, but it takes a LOT to make me ugly cry. A lot. I don't like feeling like my emotions are being manipulated and so I sort-of turn off when I feel like I'm being led down an emotionally treacherous path. But, God damn, Karina Halle snuck one in on me. And I don't want to scare you off this book because while some of that crying was because my heart was f---ing breaking all over the place, some of it was because of the breathtaking beauty of this love story, and how amazingly, beautifully told it was. I would read words and gasp and think ""Holy shhhh—this feels like falling in love. Exactly like it."" And then my eyes would leak some more.So? Where do I begin? How do I even try to capture how big this story was? To say it is a Beauty and the Beast story (which I love) seems to be trying to put it in a box into which it doesn't wholly belong. Lachlan is a beast—he's built like a sequoia tree, tall and broad, bearded and tatted (delicious, and irresistable). He's all male, all heart, and chock full of demons. He's so complex and deeply layered—his demons at constant war with his big, beautiful heart. It was impossible not to love him, but also impossible not to kind of hate him a little bit too. I hurt for him. I ached for him. I wanted to punch him in the nuts and shake some sense into him, and I wanted to fold him in my arms and soothe the pain away—all in equal measures. He was amazing. I fell so completely in love with him; his compassion, his brokenness, his unflinching humanness.Kayla has been known for being all lighthearted and fun times. Nobody's really scratched beneath the surface with her before. She is deathly afraid of love, of opening her heart to someone and all the consequences that come with that. But she was completely powerless against Lachlan's charms (such as they were). She fell so completely in love with him, like it wasn't even a choice. Like his being in her world was the only way her world was ever going to exist, and her getting on board with her love for him was the only possible outcome. She soothed Lachlan's inner beast and she was strong when he was weak. I love a strong heroine. I love someone I can rally behind—who doesn't create conflict and doesn't lose all sense of herself when the conflict rears its ugly head. Kayla was perfect—her unapologetic humanness and Lachlan's humanness call to each other and in the end, they find their home in each other.This book is intensely emotional in a way I was not expecting. It is, by turns, breathtakingly beautiful, scorching hot (and I'm not using the term scorching lightly here; the sexiness of this book probably deserves its own paragraph, maybe even its own review), painful, heartbreaking, redemptive and sweet. It's....stunning in its honesty, its intensity, and its beauty. I loved every minute. ~ Shelly, 5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R368IUSL21DZVP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OQN4AC#wasThisHelpful","R368IUSL21DZVP","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve really enjoyed this group of friends—this dirty, sexy and funny group of friends—from book one through to now, the end. And this final book is a fun, tense and sexy way to wrap up their stories!After facing tragedy and coming out stronger than ever, six friends are ready to move on with their lives and face the future…together. But just when things seems to be perfect, life takes a bitter turn, friendships are rocked and hearts are broken. Will they all survive with their bonds, their lives and their loves intact? Or are they on the final road to Hale?This was actually a really interesting way of structuring a final book in a series. Instead of a novella focusing on one couple, or a fourth couple being introduced, Marie James has given us this story from six POVs—one for each of the members of this core group. And I loved that. Seeing this dramatic ending from all sides was, at times, a little confusing (I tend to get excited and read ahead, and forget to check who is talking at any given time, whoops!) but also, totally awesome. Added bonus, if you’ve read this story from the start and you have a favorite (*cough* Kaleb *cough*), you know you’re going to get to spend a little more time with them before it’s time to say goodbye.To Hale and Back cleverly takes all the story-lines and brings them back around so any lingering questions are answered, all allegiances are clarified and each happily ever after is solidified. It’s perhaps a little OTT, but the sex is sexy and plentiful, the characters heart-breaking at times and lovable at others, and the friendship between the six main characters rewarding.I am sad to see the end of this series, but so happy to have read it. Ms. James, you have a fan in me, and I will be back for more from you in the future! ~ Beth, 4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QKPV4839OYU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016CR88WQ#wasThisHelpful","R2QKPV4839OYU3","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love having a go-to author that I can always rely on to bring me a sweet romance. Sometimes, in the rush of the real world, all you really need is a little escape into a small town and a little old fashioned true love. This series began in the first book with the graduated high school alumni’s gathering to save their small hometown's high school football program. Defending Hearts picks up not long after the first left off, so it gives us an insight into how everyone has been doing since reuniting, and in some cases, falling in love.Alex, jet-setting, danger laughing, high profile photo journalist was such a genuinely good and likable guy. He becomes part of the family almost immediately—helping with the dishes, liking the dog, humoring Gram. How can you not like a man who loves the dog and the grandmother? He's considerate, he respects Gretchen, and even admires her! Gretchen was a good match for his adaptability because of her unwavering personality. She was a determined sort, and as such, the kind of woman who makes happen the things that she wants to happen! When the two decided to come together and finally acknowledge those sparks flashing between them, it's sexy and sweet.Another favorite of mine was the lack of overblown angst. Par for the course, Alex and Gretchen have things they have to work out to be together. There's a little heartbreak going on when they think these things are going to be insurmountable, but it's not over the top. It's adult, and it felt very real. There is almost nothing I like better in a book than adults being adults. It keeps things much more realistic, and makes it easier to stay immersed in the world.I also love the town! There were visits from the quirky citizens, conversations with the bigger secondary characters, such as the Coach and his wife, and what looks to be a well-executed build-up to some of the underlying plot lines, and the main romance for the next book—the kind of build-up that adds to the main story while making me anxious to read the next one.I love being immersed in a series that makes me feel like part of a community, like part of a little world all its own. Like part of the family. This is Shannon Stacey's talent, and I am grateful! ~ George, 4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6YZ3HCO8N07G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI028JK#wasThisHelpful","R6YZ3HCO8N07G","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pretty In Ink was fun, flirty, filthy and exactly what I needed for a quick, palate cleansing read!Stevie and Wilson are polar opposites. She’s a tattoo artist, covered in ink. He’s prim and proper and wears $400 loafers. He’s the epitome of uptight, she likes bikers, rough and ready, party hardy types. But what if what she’s always wanted isn’t what she needed?This is a story of looking beyond the surface. When you look underneath the clothes and the inked skin, you never know what you’ll find. Stevie was stunningly gorgeous. Wilson needed Stevie in his life, even though he may not have known it. And she needed him in her life.The chemistry was off the charts. The banter was fun, and the donuts…well, awesome It’s amazing how when you open yourself up and don’t expect anything, the right person may fall into your lap! Just be open to the time and the place.There are certain words that were part of Stevie's vocabulary that I just can’t imagine any woman saying but I was able to overlook it, because maybe she’s just a bit more crude than other women. It’s a bit of her charm, but oy, I still can’t imagine it. Wilson’s history could also have been developed a bit more for me. I think I just wanted MORE!!Scott’s writing is fun, the editing was good, I didn’t see any major problems; I just wanted to know more about these two! ~ Heather, 4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6PW2BNDIN0DU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0178VNZ2I#wasThisHelpful","R6PW2BNDIN0DU","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m in love! Adriano is even hotter than Luca, and I wasn’t sure that could happen for me!Adriano falls for Cam early on in the the Chicago Syndicate books (For Fallon and For Luca are #1 and #2) but until his book we don’t really understand the dynamics of that love. He’s a tough, hard, Syndicate man. He loves hard, fights harder and takes care of those close to him. And when Cam disappears so does Adriano’s heart. The best part of this book is watching him come to the realization that Cam is part of him—lock, stock and barrel. He can’t let go of her. He’s willing to change his life for her.She learns so much about herself in For Adriano. In the beginning she doesn’t know up from down, right from wrong, or who to trust. But her heart leads her back to Adriano.The banter, the feels, the angst of this book made it an amazing, fast-paced, fabulous, five star read for me. The Syndicate gets in your head…the men are strong alphas who take care of their own. They sacrifice themselves for those they love. They will kill, maim, and more if it’s called for. But their women are kept safe at all costs.This is the perfect love story. Hard hitting action, angsty love, alpha men unknowingly changed for their woman. So many working parts, I can’t wait for Cam’s story! Give. Me.

"Megan and Zachary have migrated to the ocean for the same reason—they’re both hiding from traumatic events in their past. Megan is nursing fresh wounds while Zachary has been holed up far longer, his wounds more grievous, and left to fester for far too long. Zachary has a reputation in the small community, he’s reclusive and rude and not to be bothered. Yet, Megan feels drawn to him, a pull that she’s unable to resist. The harder Zachary pushes her away, the more determined Megan is to break down his walls. Eventually, and with the help of her dog Dixie (and Dixie’s immediate love affair with Zachary’s dog, Elliot), Zachary lets down his walls, inviting Megan into his life—a place that has been empty for him for a long time.Once Megan begins knocking down walls, she doesn’t stop. Zachary has been deprived of so many things for so long that having Megan opens up this raw need—need for love, for touch, for Megan. Their attraction and their feelings are intense. These are two broken people who have found some sort of salvation in each other. There is such beauty and tenderness here, laying like a balm over their gaping wounds and deep mistrust. Megan breathes life back into Zachary and in turn, Zachary gives Megan a sense of home, a reason to trust herself again, and a deeply profound love.It is, of course, not all smooth sailing, and Melanie Moreland will break your heart into a million pieces. Then, she’ll craftily and lovingly piece it back together, infusing it with hope and happiness. Watching the transformation of Zachary, and the evolution of his relationship with Megan was a beautiful, heartwarming thing. My heart ached for them, in the very best way.I am a sucker for Beauty and the Beast stories and this one was no exception. It's lovely and emotional, heart-breaking and redemptive.

"If I could give 1000 stars to Songbird, I would! Feels, oh the feels! This book made me cry, laugh, fall in love, dream, wonder and hope—and those are the emotions I can articulate.Devin is the strong, silent type. Callie is creative and loving. One weekend, full of drunken wedding sex, leads to oh, so much more. Two pink lines and everyone’s world has changed. I’ll admit, I was a bit speculative about reading a book about “wedding sex” and what happens after, since I already have my favorite book with that scenario, but this is so different.Devin falls hard—head over heels in love with Callie, but fights it every step of the way. He’s not sure about his feelings or what they mean for him. Callie is determined to take care of herself. It’s ingrained in her to not depend on a man.""What was once in pieces is finally whole.Just like my life.Just like my heart.""—This is my favorite part of the book! This gives me hope. I’m not going to lie, some days my heart is hard and reading this, I want to believe in love.“Love makes you equal.”The truth behind this is AH-MAZING!Sydney Logan ripped my heart out, stomped on it and put it back in, a bit jagged but believing in love. Ready and willing to accept it. Since stalking is frowned upon, she may find herself with LOVE mail via her email box soon! ~ Heather, 5 stars~~~“For you, there'll be no more crying.”Oh, there was crying. Gentle welling of tears, but tears nonetheless. I initially wanted to read this book because of its title. Songbird is one of my absolute, all-time favorite songs—and just the mention of the word brings the beautiful lyrics to my mind. I couldn't NOT read this book, with that title. And I was so wonderfully surprised to find my song, a song that means so much to me, in this book. In Devin’s perfect nickname for Callie. And in one particular, sweet moment shared—one that ensured that for me there would be more crying. The good kind. Because this book touched my heart.“For you, the sun will be shining.”And shine, it did. I felt bathed in light as I read this wonderful book. Sappy, perhaps, but Songbird made me feel good—smiley, happy, light and swoony—even as Callie and Devin negotiated their unconventional relationship. It wasn't perfect, and there were times I wanted to rail on Callie for her stubbornness, but it was so damn right, I couldn't put this book down. Even now, writing this review mere minutes after I read the last page, I'm loathe to walk away from this book. I want it to go on forever. Or, at the very least, become part of a series so I can re-visit Devin and Callie, maybe through the eyes of their friends *cough Lorie and Owen cough*“And I feel that when I'm with you,It's alright, I know it's right.”So right, y’all. Everything is so right about this book. The on-point humor, the reactions, the friendships, the heartbreak, and sweet, tender, gentle, romantic, amazing Devin. Oh, Devin. From Player to Papa—it's maybe not a new story, but in this telling, it's spot on. He's perfection, and I love him in all his forms, from his f--k-ups to his triumphs, from his stubbornness to his over-protectiveness, I fell head over heels for this man. How could I not? He was delightful. Persistent. Kind. Maybe a little cocky, and not always ready with the smart words, but such a good balance for Callie.“And the songbirds are singing, like they know the score.”I definitely know the score. I'll give you a hint, it's five out of five—a top rating for a book that I’ll long remember. I suspect this one is going to stick with me for quite some time, especially when next Songbird plays on my iPod. And why wouldn't it? From its perfect title, to its brilliant characters, to its charming and refreshing storytelling, it is one hell of a book.

"Oh, Boomer. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways… Hot. Sexy. Strong. Hot. Commanding. Kind. Hot. Good with kids. Good at dancing. Hot. All-around bada--. Oh, did I mention hot? Im’ma take a leaf out of Rayce’s book here—HATE. Except, clearly, I don't. This guy may be my new fave bad boy—and I've loved them all pretty freaking hard, so that's saying something.With his brother and sister each living their own happily ever after, Boomer Steele’s been wondering if maybe it's his time. But maybe not…he's got scars inside, after all. It only takes is one girl—scratch that, one WOMAN—however, to taunt him, sass him, slay him, and he's thinking of keeping her.But Rayce doesn't want to be kept. She's no girly girl, and love can only end in heartbreak—that's what her crappy life has taught her. She doesn't think she's good enough for big, bad Boomer, anyway, no matter how determined he is to prove her wrong.When her life converges with his, though—and they're living under the same roof—well, it's only a matter of time before things go BOOM!Chrome: With a Heart Forged in Steele covers a fair amount of time—and Rie Warren, that bada--, sassafras author, does a good job of bridging it (and the other Carolina Bad Boys books) with this summer’s Bad Boys of Retribution MC series—even if I occasionally felt this one might have fit in better with the latter series. There’s a lot of internal thinking happening here, and less of the playful banter I love SO HARD from the previous CBB books (don't get me wrong, it's definitely there, and it's definitely awesome), and yet, this book was a true delight to read. I just loved being in Boomer’s head, seeing him grapple with his attraction to, desire for, need to protect Racy Rayce. It was delightful, it was fun and holy hell in a handbasket, it was dirty, sexy, kinky HOT.Chrome was deeper too. (Ha! And I don't just mean during those aforementioned dirty times…) It touched on a tricky subject, and not everyone reacted the right way all the time, but they reacted in real ways, and that's what matters. Rayce was…human. Strong, but also very vulnerable and it was beautiful to see her open up to Boomer. Her situation was…bad. Wrong, but handled in a respectful way; showing that, despite what you see, unless you're willing to look deeper, you'll never really know what someone is truly feeling, thinking, living.It's great to be back with Ms. Warren’s Bad Boys (of all persuasions). It was rewarding, enjoyable and special to get to spend some more time with the boys and girls that we've loved in the past—there's some hella good moments when the crew are all together, just being their bada-- selves—just as it was awesome to hang out with Boomer. Sexy, hot, kind, good with kids, protective Boomer. Hate. Not. ~ Beth, 4.5 stars~~~Step aside everyone, I have a new book boyfriend. He’s big, tall, sexy-as-sin, tatted-up biker heaven and even has a furbaby. Boomer Steele, you’ve stolen my heart with your wit, your love of friends and family, and just by being an all-around sexy, swoony, wonderful human being.Boomer has been taking care of everyone in his life, from his brother and sister after their parent’s untimely deaths, to the members of the Retribution MC. He’s pretty much selfless, until he meets Rayce and decides it’s a damn fine time to be selfish and put himself first, because he wants Rayce in a big way. But she’s not going to make it easy for him. No how. No way. Boomer’s going to have to work at it—work at winning Rayce’s trust and her heart.Rayce is a gorgeous, grease monkey who moonlights as a motocross racer. She’s a member of Josh Stone’s crew at Stone’s garage and certainly can hang with the boys. Sure, Rayce is one tough cookie on the outside, but her center is warm and gooey, especially where Boomer’s concerned. But with her past inhibiting her future, Rayce needs to find out if Boomer really is the man of her dreams or if the nightmare life she’s been living is her destiny.Sigh. I loved Boomer and Rayce, both together, when their banter and sparks led to their unbelievably hot, sexy times, and separately. They come across as real; they’re vulnerable, tough, snarky, sexy, funny and introspective. They’re magic together both vertical and horizontal. Because when I say hot sexy times, I mean “melt the sheets, panties are a waste of time, where’s my husband” sexy times.I love how Rie bridged the Bad Boys of Retribution MC series with Chrome: With a Heart Forged in Steele and how we got pieces of Josh and LeeLee and their babies, Nick, Brodie, Ashe and Cat.Handsome’s book is next.

"So apparently, Not That Easy is actually the second book in this series. I did not know this, nor did I have a problem reading this one, so it is definitely a standalone. I will be going back to read book one though, just because I enjoyed this story so much!Not That Easy was a hilarious read! Ellie lost her virginity at the age of 21 (this is what the first book is about), not because she was saving herself, but because she couldn’t find someone attractive to be with.“Because I’d been a virgin until the ripe old age of twenty-one. It wasn’t out of choice. All I’d wanted to do was break my hymen, but no one vaguely attractive had offered.”So Ellie decided, along with her friends help, that she was going to “slut” it up. She was going to date online and have one-night stands and earn lots of orgasms. But of course, nothing went well for Ellie.“He thought my pubes were spiky. They hurt his penis. My motherf---ing pubes were ruining my life yet again.”Her dates were absolutely hysterically. If it could go wrong it did. I literally laughed out loud more times than I could count while reading this.“I was a complete b---h. A b---h with a rubber lost in her pussy. Karma 1, Ellie 0.”And although this story was funny and mostly about mistaken sexual escapades, it was also about learning how to be secure in who you are and what you want. Not to be afraid to stand up for you, no matter what others think. While at times, Ellie’s naivety and insecurity got annoying, I also know that many twenty-somethings have these same issues. I really enjoyed this story and hope to see more of Ellie’s story as well as more from this author! ~ Tiffany, 4 stars~~~Ellie is a single girl, just out of college, and working for an online magazine as an unpaid intern. She has only had one sexual partner and is very unhappy about it.When she gets a brilliant idea for an article she can write about casual sex for work, her boss reluctantly gives her the go ahead. What she doesn’t expect is how hard “casual sex” can truly be.Ellie is a bit immature at times, but she is also very young and has led a very sheltered life. I was not in love with her for some parts of this book, due to a few decisions she made that affected not only her, but all of her friends.However, this story had me laughing, and sucked me in. I loved reading about Ellie’s journey to find herself and the elusive O. Her “flat mates” are her friends and sometimes get plowed over in her journey.

"Ahhh, it's not just the Water's Edge I'm on... Nope, I'm on the edge of a cliff, having just finished reading (and cussing out the author) Wet, and am now desperately in need of the conclusion to West and Sadie's saga. Like, yesterday.A chance encounter on a beach, a rescue gone awry and doughnuts... Oh, and an arrogant, sexy man she should definitely stay away from. That about sums up Sadie Mullins' morning—and how she came to get entangled with West Montgomery.This book, y'all. I got the end, and was all, 'noooooooooooo' but also completely 'YESSSSS'. Yeah, there was a lot of drawing out of words over here. Because man alive, I enjoyed reading it. It was funny, smart and left me grinning—cliffy or not.The love/hate thing West and Sadie had going on was super fun—playful, sexy and totally on-point. I love that kind of storyline—enemies to lovers, almost. Although, more frenemies than enemies. This couple were just sassy and snarky and cocky and HOT whether they were play-fighting or flirting...or both.Wet starts with a bang. An interesting, different prologue that really set-up Sadie's predicament and set her on the path to finding West. I do wish it'd been brought up again—even in passing—because although it was quite clever, I'd almost forgotten about it by the end. I'm guessing, though, it's going to play a bigger role in the next book. I certainly hope so.There’s just so much to like about this book, and this series. Including (especially) the friendships, which are absolutely engaging—I'm going to need a book for Rue and Grady, Wyatt, Theo...and I could probably go on.

"Whoa. This. Book. I think it might be knocking out The Submissive as my favorite in the series. Let me tell you why…Abby and Nathaniel West are now happily married. Living, loving, enjoying their two young children. They've carved out time to be Master and submissive. But after ten years, there is a bit of a dimming of their spark. Abby and Nathaniel absolutely love and adore each other, and their “playroom” time is still amazing and gratifying, but Abby’s fantasies and Nathaniel’s assumptions may just rock their foundation to the core.Abby’s much more comfortable in her skin and her role in the D/s dynamic. She’s not afraid to share her fantasies and desires. Nathaniel wants nothing more than to fulfill and meet all of Abby’s sexual needs. And Abby’s revealed she’s ready for more play in BDSM. After all their years together, Nathaniel thinks he knows Abby almost better than she knows herself. But does he really? Will he really take her as far as she wants to go or will he push her to where he thinks she’s desiring?I love this series. And I love this “real” take on Abby and Nathaniel’s relationship, now in it’s tenth year. It’s rare that we as a reader get to “see” what’s going on with a couple this far into a relationship. Like all relationships, a D/s one takes a lot of work, love and nurturing. Sometimes relationships get stale, predictable and it takes a lot of effort and communication to get the spark back. I love how Abby and Nathaniel aren’t afraid to fight for what they want—especially when all they want is each other.What I want now is Sasha and Cole’s book. I need a Dom to make that happen. ~ Missy, 5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE6K0L40WRJI3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI02A0C#wasThisHelpful","RE6K0L40WRJI3","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Craig Lanaghan is a flirt and a player—two things that come easily to him as a bartender at a local club. He’s also the exact type of guy for whom Rain Alexander has no place in her life. Rain has a pretty solid set of criteria for the man who she’ll take a chance on, and Craig doesn’t tick any of her boxes. When the two meet while she’s on a revenge mission to take down her sister’s sleazy ex-boyfriend, she immediately catches Craig’s interest.Craig has no interest in a lasting affair. The bachelor life has served him well, and his bartending gig ensures that he’s never lonely. However, when Rain Alexander walks into his bar, all bets are off. He’s drawn to her in a way that he’s never experienced before. She’s a throwback to another era, a little salty, and a whole lot intriguing, and Craig decides he’s going to draw her out of her shell.This is a really sweet story about two people who need to look past the exterior faade and find the tender stuff inside that binds them together. Craig takes his time bringing down Rain’s walls, and in the process lets down a few of his own. They learn that maybe they’re not so different after all and once they let each other in, they are swoony and sweet and hot—way hot.I really enjoyed this short, sweet story. I didn’t always understand Rain—and sometimes she hovered just shy of the line of becoming unlikeable to me. But I adored Craig; he’s irreverent and flirty and fun, but also protective and sweet and persistent. Together, they make each other better—they smooth out each other’s wrinkles, making it impossible to not love everything about them.Wonderful, lighthearted and swoony, this novella packs a punch of steam. But its true charm lies in the push/pull between Craig and Rain, and the path they take to realize the true love they’ve found in each other. I loved their relationship with each other, and the relationship they had with their families, who are quirky and hilarious, added a wonderful depth to this short little story.If you’re already a fan of the On Dublin Street series, you’re going to love this sexy, sweet addition.

"Sugar and spice and all things nice, right? Well, maybe not all things nice. Because some of the things in Sugar were dirty. Kinky. Sweet. And some were a little sad. But all of them made this reading experience a very nice one…Siobhan Malloy is not in the market for love. The café owner, and hobbyist Burlesque dancer, is in her mid-thirties and still recovering from the mistakes that changed everything for her when Charlie O’Halloran barrels into her life. He brings excitement, passion—and maybe even dreams of the future—but even with their successful business and personal relationship growing, Siobhan can't escape her past—or his. Especially not when it comes crashing into their present, and threatens everything…Sugar was just another book for me when I started reading. Don’t get me wrong, it was good—engaging, with an interesting hook, fun characters and a lot of thigh-clenchingly good, panty-melting moments (that first dance, though…WHOA!) But I wasn't exactly wowed by it; I liked it, but didn't love it. I enjoyed it, but didn't feel like I couldn't put it down. The writing was good—I never struggled with the story, despite not having read book one in this series— and the ‘B---- Talk’ ladies all felt personable and real. And Charlie? Well, Charlie was a dirty, kinky delight. And still…I didn't feel blown away—more like, happily cruising through the story.But then…there was a small ‘twist’—nothing major, but I loved that moment. It was clever, the way the author foreshadowed it without giving anything away. It was smart, the way she handled the revelation and the characters’ reactions to it. It was unexpected and I was impressed by it. It elevated the entire reading experience for me, and ensured I'll look out for more of this series in the future. So yes, Sugar had spice and was definitely nice. Very nice, indeed. ~ Beth, 4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W9W2ELBYBLTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI0B77Y#wasThisHelpful","R2W9W2ELBYBLTP","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll admit, I was first drawn to this book because of the couple almost-kissing on the cover. There was just something kind of beautiful about them, and I wanted to know their story—whatever it might be. The blurb, sucked me in. And then, the actual book? Wound me up, made me laugh, and hooked me on this new series.Once tied to the bed by her argyle socks, now her protector… That's Curran O’Brien, Philly cop, and man trying to get his career back on track after one tragic night has him sidelined. Being given the task to babysit the Assistant DA’s intern seems like a step backward for Curran, but when he sees Contessa Newart, it doesn't seem so bad.Tess hasn't forgotten the night of flaming passion she shared in college with Curran. But she's on a specific career path, and with her controlling father trying to force her life in a direction of his choosing, she really doesn't want to get involved again—even if she's falling for Curran…hard.When danger comes to Tess’ door, and the case she's working on puts her in the line of fire, Curran finally has the chance to prove to his superiors that he's still fit for the job—and to show Tess he’ll keep her safe at any cost.I was more-than-pleasantly surprised by Once Kissed. Cecy Robson is a new-to-me author, and she's already got me addicted. The chemistry between Tess and Curran was so much fun; playful, sweet, affecting and downright sinful at times, this couple was easy to fall in love with. Ms. Robson balanced Curran’s frat boy humor and needling tendencies well with his kind nature and need to protect, just as she balanced Tess’ prickly, shy exterior perfectly with her soft, loving heart and shattering backstory.And what a backstory it was. It could have been trite or overworked, but it wasn't. The way this author worked through Tess’ issues, and illustrated how a grown woman could be in her situation was well-handled. The story, as a whole, was well-written, a touch suspenseful and heart-pumping, and laugh-out-loud funny at times. I did, admittedly, find some of the jumps forward just a little jarring on one or two occasions—although I can fully appreciate why it was done and the story was no less for it.I'm really excited about the O’Brien Family series. Because some of my favorite parts of this story came about when the brothers and sister (all of whom have AWESOME names, BTW) were playing around, bantering, joking and being silly siblings together. I'm also excited at the prospect of going back and getting acquainted with Ms. Robson’s previous series, the Shattered Past series, from which a couple of characters made cameos in fun, memorable, but not hard-to-follow ways; the connections existed and felt authentic, and never like you'd missed something, or someone, by not having met them before. Kudos to Ms. Robson for that.

"Tough Enough made my heart beat fast, tears run from my eyes and my heart break… And then, it was put back together.Katie has lived a hard life. She suffered at the hands of a monster and has reinvented herself as a way to survive. Rogan is a Hollywood star who recognizes something in her, and won’t take no for an answer. I couldn’t read this book fast enough. From when I started it, to the moment I finished it, the expanse of time was short. Just a mere four hours or so. It didn’t feel like that long—I was transported to the town of Enchantment, where both our Hero and Heroine take refuge.It was easy for me to fall in love with Katie because I have many of her same thoughts and feelings. She’s real and relatable, and I love her growth throughout the book. Rogan is hot, hunky and semi-unobtainable? But is he really? If you are true lover of love stories, this is for you!

It was such a sweet, emotional journey!This is the second book in the Tall, Dark, and Dangerous series and I loved it even more than the first. It is Keifer Rogan’s story. Keifer had a hard life growing up, but overcame all of that to become a champion MMA fighter and actor.“Fight to survive. Fight to live.”Katie Ryland has also had a hard life. She is hiding herself and her secrets in a small town called Enchantment working as a make-up artist. She is quiet, shy, and doesn’t open up easily.Rogan is one of the many actors to grace Katie’s chair. But from the very first time, she can tell that he is different. Slowly, he helps Katie open up and trust again. It was such an amazing transformation!This book really had it all! It was sexy and sweet. The chemistry between Katie & Rogan was off the charts hot.“I could drink come from you like wine. Sweet, creamy wine. But not this time. This time,” he explains, his voice gruff and sexy, “I wanna feel you squeezin’ my c--- when you come.”It was sad and emotional; learning both Katie’s and Rogan’s secrets was hard, but it really helped you see why they are the way they are. It had action and drama. I read it in one sitting and couldn’t get enough!

"Hard Beat grabs ahold of your heart and doesn't let go until the very last word.Tanner Thomas is a foreign war correspondent for a major network. He’s lived on the edge of the cliff—thriving on the energy and adrenaline from the rush of breaking the story. But after a recent tragedy, Tanner’s trying to find his center, his place in the world and to move forward even though he's haunted by his past. Then, he meets Beaux, and his world turns on its axis.Beaux Croslin is the new photojournalist assigned to Tanner. She’s not only absolutely stunning, she’s an extremely talented photographer. As Beaux and Tanner get closer, the sparks fly—burning up the sheets. Beaux’s unwillingness to talk about herself or her past, and Tanner’s inability to let secrets lie, puts them both in danger. And with Tanner’s tenacity, he’s determined to find out if what they had in the desert is real or just circumstantial.Hot, sexy, happy, sad, this standalone, though part of the Driven series, ticks off all the boxes. Ms. Bromberg’s ability to write such well-developed characters that immediately lure the reader into their world is phenomenal. Beaux and Tanner were amazing, heartbreaking, drool worthy for their friendship and love for each other.Tanner. Damn. I loved his vulnerability and his chivalrous nature—wanting to take the blame when there was no true blame to be had. And Beaux was pretty damn kick ass too. I. Loved. Every. Word. ~ Missy, 5 stars (really more like 500)~~~Holy hell! This story ripped my heart out! It had my glued to my seat until the very last page.Tanner Thomas, Rylee’s brother, is a foreign correspondent/journalist. He has been in the Middle East for the last ten years, off and on, and is very good at his job. He is constantly in dangerous situations and loves the buzz and adrenaline he gets. He usually has a photographer with him, but due to unforeseen circumstances, his partner, Stella, is no longer with him.Enter Beaux ‘BJ’ Croslyn. She is a rookie and Tanner’s new photographer. The two have an instant connection and are constantly pushing each other’s buttons.“She’s such a contradiction. Elegant with the mouth of a trucker and a body made for sin. No wonder I’m intrigued and pissed simultaneously.”The connection between the two is magnetic. It takes them time to finally give in to their attraction, but when they do it is hot.“I crush my lips to hers. Savoring her taste. G----mn it. It’s everything I don’t want but crave all the same because it tempts me and calls on me to have more.”This story had so many twists and turns that I did not expect. I loved how Beaux and Tanner were constantly pushing and pulling against their attraction. It was sexy, sad, emotional, and full of drama.“She’s my little piece of Heaven in this land full of Hell.”K. Bromberg’s writing is addictive and sucks you in from the very beginning.

"Ahhhhh, an M/M read from Jay Crownover? One that bridges my beloved Marked Men with the Saints of Denver? GIMME. NOW. <<-- Essentially all the words I was capable of when I found out about it. And now I'm done, my words are more like, ‘I want more. Now!’Dominic Voss and Orlando Frederick both know what it is to suffer. Dom’s trying to get to back to full fitness and his job on the beat—a job that defines who he is—after a life-threatening injury, while Lando has closed himself off to the idea of love after the worst kind of ending to his relationship with his first—and true—love.They weren't supposed to be more than therapist and patient—Lando’s job was to put Dom’s broken body back together. But their intense attraction means that Lando isn't the only one doing the healing…if he can break down his barriers, Dom might just have a chance at mending Lando’s broken heart.Is it January yet? Because I raced through this steamy, emotional novella and now I'm done, I'm so ready for more of this new series. Leveled was an excellent introduction to the Saints of Denver, with a couple of little Easter Egg moments to tease what's to come—and it included cameos from some of those Marked Men characters I didn't (still don't) want to say goodbye to, giving a bit more closure to fans of the original series. Not that you must have read those to be able to enjoy the story of Dom and Lando. Knowing a little of their respective back stories made it easier to get invested in this story for sure (as well as a grip on the relationships that pop up between these characters and their friends/family), but nonetheless, I think you could get by without. Wonderful.And speaking of wonderful, there were a couple of moments, in particular, that packed a real punch for me—and one of them didn't even directly involve the main couple. Instead, it served as a reminder about the importance of forgiveness and love. And that's really what this book is about. Accepting what's happened, and trying not to let it affect what's to come. Dom’s trying to heal his injury, Lando needs to mend his broken heart, and they both need to embrace the future—whatever it holds.I loved Dom and Lando’s story, and was thrilled that Ms. Crownover gave them a second chance at life and love. Seeing them struggle to find balance with one another—to heal and move on—was fun, sexy and rewarding. This couple just worked together, and I only wish it could have been longer, since it's STILL not January yet…and I really, really wish it was… ~ Beth, 4.5 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18CPF1SCYFITE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016U5C0HO#wasThisHelpful","R18CPF1SCYFITE","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I sure am a sucker for the brother’s best friend books and this is one of the best I read. *Sigh* And it had a vagina heartbeat—can’t get much better!I have to be honest and say I was a little hesitant to read about horse racing. It has never interested me and I have never been on a horse, but I am a huge fan of the author, as well as the other angle, and I am so glad that I read it.Jock is the story of Tessa, aka Midge. She has been fighting her whole life to be something different. She has always dreamed of being a jockey and with her small size it is the perfect job for her. Though, it comes at a high cost.“He doesn’t want to go. He wants to fight. He wants to matter. He doesn’t want to go. He just will. Because to fight and do things that matter, sometimes you have to go.”Jace is Tessa’s older brother, Lawrence’s best friend. He is been around since she was born. He has been her protector, her savior, and her friend. Tessa has crushed on him for a long time and when Jace finally allowed himself to see her as a woman, it really opened his eyes.“I wanted so much of her, all of her. I wanted to touch her and consume her, kiss her, make love to her…love her. Was it right? No. No, it wasn’t. But it definitely didn’t feel wrong either.”I couldn’t put this story down, I had to know what was going to happen. I loved the entire cast of characters, especially the Brooks family! It also really enlightened me into the world of horse racing and how competitive a sport it is; how much a jockey goes through just to ride a horse. It was sweet, sad, funny, and steamy. This was another fantastic read from Ms. Foss! ~ Tiffany, 4.5 stars~~~There probably aren't too many people sitting around and thinking, ‘Do you know what would be sexy? A book about horse racing and jockeys!’ The fact C.M. Foss did—or at least, I'm fairly certain that's how this book came about, and not because of a love of the sport or anything so mundane as that—just proves something about this author. She's creative, she's funny, and she knows how to get right into your heart.Tessa Brooks is on the brink of making in the male-dominated, rough and tumble world of horse racing. It's been no easy task, but the years she's invested in it are finally about to pay off. During those tough years, her brother’s best friend, Jace has been one of her strongest protectors. She's crushed on him, desired him, and talked to him about her goals. And now, after all this time, it seems they're finally going to give it a shot.But what will Tessa do when it turns out that the man she wants might just be the thing stopping her from achieving her lifelong dream?Circle of truth time? Yes, I think so. I actually finished this book several days ago. Normally, I am not so tardy with my reviews, but I couldn't work out what I wanted to say. And, in actual fact, I still pretty much have no idea. Jock was…an experience. A good one—a great one even. One I can't quite explain. But I'm going to try… (Better be ready for run-on sentences, people!)You know how reviewers say books are a “roller coaster”? (I'm so guilty of this; it's just an easy way to talk about the ups-and-downs). This book was more like the Disney monorail. It takes you to wonderful places, but it never goes to crazy-high heights and stomach-dropping lows. It eases around the track, same pace, same level of feeling and enjoyment, none of the terror. And I liked that about this book—it was easy, but not simple. C.M. Foss had me constantly moving and thinking, on a low simmer. She had me falling for the characters, worrying about them, questioning their decisions, and angering at their choices, their reactions and their mistakes. But she did it at such an easy pace—oh, man, I know I am missing the chance to use some choice horse puns here—that I didn't know until I was done how much this book had truly reached me.Jock wasn't really what I was expecting—but it was funny in a way I've come to recognize as Ms. Foss’ signature style, emotional on a level I didn't even truly recognize until I started trying to explain it, and it was sexy with a little swoon. Seriously, a book about a jockey…who'd have thought?! ~ Beth, 4 stars~~~Tessa Brooks is tough as nails. I mean, she's the youngest of six which has left her with a thick skin due to years of teasing and joking from her older siblings. But her toughness goes deeper than that. She's single minded and driven, and this girl is going to dominate the horse racing circuit come hell or high water. That is, if she keeps her feelings for her brother’s best friend from leading her completely off course.Jace Hitchen is basically a member of the Brooks family. He's known Tessa since she was born, and he's always felt fiercely protective over her. As she blossomed into adulthood, his feelings blossomed with her—he just wants her to give him a chance. Jace also is single minded and driven—and he's set his sights on Tessa.This story is so rich and beautifully told. The banter between Jace and Tessa is adorable and authentic, adding a depth and playfulness to their relationship that is sometimes missing due to Tessa's single minded focus on her career. The entire Brooks family wormed their way into my heart—boisterous family dinners, place cards, merciless teasing and all.I am not terribly familiar with horse racing and so I appreciated the Author's Note included in this book, which provided some insight to why Tessa was the way she was. But even with that information, I struggled sometimes to understand her decisions and I wanted to wring her neck on more than one occasion. It’s a testament to how wrapped up in the story I was that I wanted to bop her in the head and tell her to stop being such an idiot—like she was my own little sister. I mean, it was plain to see that there could never be another man for her than Jace. He is patient and giving and understanding in a way that most people would not be capable of, especially when consistently met with Tessa’s steadfast resistance.God, I loved Jace. I loved his smart mouth. I loved how steady and sure he was even when everything was falling apart around him. I loved the safe haven he gave Tessa, even when it wasn’t the kind of haven she was looking for. He just kept trying until he got it right. He's just…wonderful.I basically devoured this book, pausing only to wipe the grit from my eyes and try to correct my double vision—the side effect of staring at my Kindle too long. It was a tougher story for me in that I struggled to understand and empathize with Tessa, but it gave us a brutal, unflinching look into the life of a jockey and so it all felt so authentic and real, and it paid off so wonderfully.Beautifully and engagingly written, I literally couldn't put it down. Jock is sweet and swoony, humorous and heartbreaking. If you're looking to take your feels on a ride, this is a sure bet! ~ Shelly, 4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FBA4BZZ0FROY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017E8OHKY#wasThisHelpful","R2FBA4BZZ0FROY","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, first of all: SQUEEEEEEE!!!!Sorry, sorry. It's just—I'd forgotten how much I love this series. And then, at about the 3% mark, I was like ""I am SO FREAKING IN LOVE WITH DEX"". And then I remembered the last time I fell in love this quickly—it was while reading The Friend Zone (Gray *swoon*). Let’s just say that the witchcraft Kristen Callihan works on my heart is still mighty powerful.Fiona (Fi) Mackenzie and Ethan (Dex) Dexter have met before. Several times, actually. Fi's older sister (Ivy) is married to Dex's old college teammate (Gray *swoon*), but Fi never really saw Dex as anything more than her brother-in-law’s best friend. Dex, on the other hand, has had his eye on Fi for ages. He can’t get her out of his mind. When they meet up while visiting Gray and Ivy, Dex decides it's time to make his move.I don't even know where to start because everything about this book was fantastic! Dex—the brawny, rugged, “lumbersexual” (more biker than NFL ballplayer)—is quiet and intense. The effect of all this is damn near hypnotizing; a fact with which Fi would concur, as he reels her in quickly and marks her heart, permanently and indelibly. Up to this point, Fi had been known as the flighty one, and nobody really took her seriously. Dex is like a breath of fresh air. He gets her. He makes her feel safe, and provides her a safe haven to just be who she is. In turn, with Ivy, Dex can let all facets of himself rise to the surface. She’s the only one who gets all of him. She’s his soft landing, the safe harbor against all his storms. Together they're just sexy, sweet, and exquisitely tender.Naturally, it can't be all smooth sailing. Their relationship is tested and it's heartbreaking and emotional. I felt like this book went a little deeper than the ones before. The issues were bigger, the emotions ran higher, and everything felt ramped up and more intense. I was completely glued to my Kindle, reading frantically to figure out how it was all going to work out. My heart took a beating but—my God, you guys—it's so good.As always, a big chunk of the charm of this book is due to the camaraderie among the players. The boys we first met in college are all NFL players now. They mostly play for different teams, but there's still plenty of hysterical and bro-mantic chatter. There truly is a secondary romance in these books—between the guys—and it's just as wonderful and rewarding to witness as the primary romance.Gah! I didn't want this book to end! I want to live in Dex and Fi’s world, be a part of their little circle of solid friendships, scorching hot relationships, and ridiculously adorable bromances. The Game Plan was another A+ addition to this series for me. Sexy, smart, emotional, gripping, and punctuated with laugh out loud humor and breathtakingly tender moments, this book was utterly addictive and wholly satisfying. ~ Shelly, 5 stars~~~I've binge read the Game On series this week. And oh, what a week it's been. Drew and Anna… I loved them. Gray and Ivy? Yes, those are tears of laughter AND hurt. And now, Ethan and Fiona—what else is there to say except, PERFECT.All it takes is one moment—a challenge, a beard, a drink or two and a knee-weakening kiss—and Fiona Mackenzie is caught by Ethan Dexter. Ethan Dexter, the tattooed, bearded, rumored-virgin NFL center, and man that's totally NOT her type.Not that Dex is going to let that stop him. He's always in control, and has always given his absolute focus to his passion, football. Except now he has something else he wants to direct his focus on—winning over Fi. It's not going to be easy, living in different cities, leading different lives. But Dex is looking for his one, and now, he's got a plan to make his Cherry see that she's it…I bow to Kristen Callihan. I love the way she writes, creating these perfect characters, telling these fantastically fun, scorching hot and quietly emotional stories. And doing it in unexpected ways. With each of her books, I've sat back and experienced awe as she creates a moment and twists it in a way that takes it from Oh, I bet I know what's going to happen next to Holy moly, this is so right…I LOVE this! Ms. Callihan doesn't create drama out of nothing, forcing tension and angst upon her readers with poor communication and over-worked tropes. Nope, she lets her characters suck you in, makes you experience their heartbreak, their frustrations, their longing and, most importantly, their love.And The Game Plan is the perfect example of this. Ethan and Fiona are so good. SO GOOD, y'all. I'm about to break out my fangirl flails and swoons over them. Because they work together—they react in real, raw and fist-clenchingly good ways. You know what I mean, right? When the moment comes and decisions must be made, and it is so exactly the right one that your hand curls up and you squeeze because that's the only tangible way to express all the things you're feeling. Anger at the situation, concern over what's to come, happiness that your trust in the author and the characters has paid off and been rewarded with a book that flows and moves and works perfectly.I don't want to overuse the word perfect, and yet, I can't seem to stop. When I think about Dex, I think about how perfect he is. Quiet, kind, intense, strong, loyal—basically all the things that make up the ideal book boyfriend. When I think about Fi, I think about how perfect she is. Funny, bright, searching, passionate, loving—exactly what Ethan needed, his right balance.I can't hold it in anymore… *Flails* *Swoons* I so adored this book (also, this series)—every page, every moment, every heartbreak and every sweet word. Plus, BEARDS AND TATTOOS. *Sighs* It was exactly my kind of perfect. ~ Beth, 5 stars~~~Never underestimate the power of the beard.For two years, Ethan “Dex” Dexter has been silently sitting in the shadows waiting for Fiona Mackenzie to finally “see” him. He’s a man known for his self-control—necessitated by his role as an NFL Center. But Dex just wants to loosen up a bit of this control—and he wants to loosen up with Fiona.Fiona Mackenzie just wants a taste of Dex. Okay, maybe some serious touching from Dex’s beard too. Dared into acting by her best friend, Fiona finally makes a move—one that starts a burn inside both Dex and her.But Fiona lives in New York, Dex in New Orleans. Is this smoldering relationship strong enough to survive a long distance or is it going to burn fast and flame out?Oh. My. God. Dex. *Sigh* Tattoos, a beard and unbelievably talented with dealing with small children. Ovary explosion. He is the quiet, strong, gorgeous guy that you can’t help but be drawn to—you want to know what’s making him tick because he certainly isn’t one to tell you. And Fiona is the exact opposite. She’s sparkly, giggly, bubbly, friendly. They say opposites attract, and damn, do they ever with Dex and Fiona.I loved their vulnerability, loyalty, and unselfishness with each other, knowing just what the other needs. Add in Ivy and Gray, Drew and Anna, and the rest of the cast of characters from the football team, and you have a lovely, funny, sweet, sexy, amazing read. ~ Missy, 5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JOUWA1BF8A72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016TW5PV6#wasThisHelpful","R3JOUWA1BF8A72","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There’s a pretty simple reason I wanted to read A Hundred Thousand Words, aside from my love of all thing M/M. Someone recently told me that Nyrae Dawn was the reason they started writing. And if that’s not an endorsement, I don’t know what it. Remind me, at the end of this review, to send that person a note saying thanks for the recommendation. Because I LOVED this book.Life wasn’t exactly easy for Tobias Jackson. Gay, black, and from a small town where gay OR black would have made him stand out, let alone both. Oh, and let’s not forget the fantasies about his best friend’s very straight older brother, Levi Baxter…Time away from his small hometown of Coburn, at college in the big, gay-friendly city of San Francisco is all Toby needs to grow and change. And he’s not the only one that’s changed. Levi has too.He’s no longer a jerk, and he’s no longer very straight. All it takes is one drunken encounter for Toby to realize that his dream man is not as unobtainable, or as perfect, as he once thought—but finding the words to hold and keep Levi might just be…Wow. Just…wow. This book was magic in written form, and I loved every single page of it. It sucked me in from the start, it captured not just my attention, but also my heart, and I absolutely devoured it in the way you do a perfect, delicious treat. Because that’s what A Hundred Thousand Words was. A treat.It was a treat to read about Toby and Levi. And unlike many single-POV books, I never once wished for more from it. I didn’t need to get into Levi’s head to understand him, or what this author was trying to convey. In fact, I didn’t WANT to get in there either. I loved seeing Levi through Toby’s eyes. Seeing the glow, trying to align the perfect, gifted Levi he knew to the one that was standing in front of him a much-changed man. It made the struggle feel more real, it made the moments more powerful. And it made Levi’s openness feel like a gift—or a treat, if you don’t mind me repeating myself.This book hit me in the feels. Those pesky feels that made me ache inside for Toby and all that’s happened in his past to make him question his present and his future. Those god damn feels that made me want to wrap my arms around these confused, imperfect young men, and try to make all better. Those f---ing feels that made this slow-burn feel scorching hot, but also like a gentle, easy, perfect fall into love.And what a fall it was. If I could wipe this book from my brain and start afresh, experience the magic of a first-time read all over again, I would. I can’t do that, but I can encourage you to. And I can also say thank you, not just to Ms. Dawn for this exceptional book, but also to that somebody that told me this author reached something inside of them and made them want to find their words—just like Toby wanted to find his. How perfect is that? ~ Beth, 5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UQSNKPVF1XMH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0169DQ7CG#wasThisHelpful","R3UQSNKPVF1XMH","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Though there's really only one person what will stand in her way, and that's her own sister, Lonnie. This book had me hating Lonnie even more, so much so that I started called her Looney Lonnie!I knew things were going to good and that was scaring the mess out of me—and once I got to the end, I was proven right because that was one heck of an ending!

"Gage Hunter has always been able to get anything and anyone being the President of The Death Dealers MC. But when he meets Raven Alvarez, he’s not expecting his charm to not work on her—after all, he is the Prez! One thing's for sure, he's going to have to work harder to get her to give him the time and day.Raven Alvarez is just ready to get the heck out of town and away from her evil, slutty sister, Lonnie! What she didn't expect was to catch the attention of the head honcho, Gage but she makes it clear to him she wants nothing to do with him or anyone else in his club.Gage knows he can get women whenever he wants, but with Raven he's not going to let her go that easy...and so the chase begins.Even though there was a lot of sexual tension between Gage and Raven, there was also a lot of feeling behind it. Gage got to know as much of Raven as she allowed him to know. And Gage kind-of opened up to Raven, which changed the way she looked at him—and that equaled brownie points in my book, if you ask me.

"I knew the moment I read the blurb that this story would have my heart in shambles and my goodness, did it ever!Levee had my full attention within the first chapter because, like her, I've felt like the way she does due to the pressures of life. As Levee contemplated life, and if she should or should not, Sam was there just waiting for the moment to talk her out of it. I must say that from the beginning their conversation flowed smoothly and my goodness, they had me intrigued. Their joking had me laughing and I might just use some of it in my real life!I won't spoil it by saying more but just know that it is a whirlwind of a relationship, with no slow time, and whoa, the sex scenes had me fanning myself to the point that I wanted to stick my head in the freezer to cool down! This story just had so many emotions that I felt my heart was put through the wringer and I wondered if it would be the same afterwards... All I will say is that I. Love. Epilogues!!Thank you, Ms. Martinez, for a story about something that affects or has affected many people one way or another, and for helping us to see that we all can play a part in helping someone or allowing someone to help us! ~ Kara, 5 Amazing stars~~~Levee Williams is strung out, lost, and looking for an escape from her world when Sam Rivers finds her, incognito, on the Golden Gate bridge late one night. Sam is on the bridge for his own dark reasons, and his past has made him sensitive to girls like Levee. Broken girls. Damaged girls. Girls he might not be able to save.A sexy, tattooed bad boy with a heart of gold, Sam has a bit of a hero complex and he’s drawn to Levee in a way he can’t quite explain. All he knows is that he needs to make sure she stays safe. Levee, in turn, is drawn to Sam’s gentle humor and the safe feeling she's found in his arms. They know it can never work, but they're determined to give it a shot.This is a super sweet story with a ""prince and pauper"" theme that weaves itself into the delicate, tender love story. Levee is a famous pop princess who feels pulled in too many different directions, and is still trying to make peace with a tragic event in her childhood. Sam is an artist who is struggling to make peace with the tragic events in his own past, and figuring out how to let this broken woman into his life. She's not safe for him. But nothing that rewarding is ever safe, right?The witty banter in this book is fantastic. Sam and Levee are flirty and fun—bringing a touch of lightness to their otherwise sad, dark circumstances. Their chemistry is steamy, but it is really the underlying tenderness and care they give each other that steals the show. I love that Levee took ownership of her troubles and that they fought for themselves, to heal themselves in order to be stronger and better together.I really liked this book—it read easily and beautifully, and was full of little laugh-out-loud moments and lots of swoons. In addition to a lovely romance, the other relationships in this book were beautifully written and gave the story depth. Sam's relationship with his best friend and his mom, in particular, were highlights for me. Sam is hilarious, the kind of sharp wit that I am powerless against. Throw in some tattoos and a six pack…I'm done. Seriously. Sam, FTW!In a nutshell, light and swoony (despite some darker themes), The Fall Up will leave you with a full, happy heart and a giant smile on your face. ~ Shelly, 4 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37IX2OHEADIZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0176JLJDE#wasThisHelpful","R37IX2OHEADIZN","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If I could give all the stars in the sky, Pucked Up would deserve them. Helena pulls out all the stops for this book! It had me in stitches, the side cramps were in full force from laughing so hard.I had been waiting for Buck's story, and Helena didn't disappoint. The unfortunate mishaps of Buck and Sunny are a story worth reading again and again! While Pucked was more sexual, Pucked Up gave you a much needed story. I'll be impatiently waiting for the third book! ~ Kelly, 5 stars~~~Miller ""Buck"" Buckerson has found himself in a situation he never thought he'd find himself in—he's in a relationship. As in a boyfriend/girlfriend one, well, as long as he can convince Sunny Waters of this too... But poor Buck has a s---ton of obstacles in his way—namely social media and pictures that can quickly be taken out of context. But a man can change right?Oh, I just loved bumbling, goofball Buck. He's the Jedi Master of bad decisions because he's usually singularly focused on the end result and the ""how to get there"" is just a means to the end. But he's got a heart of gold and will do just about anything for anyone.I loved that we had just Buck's POV in this book. Though, I'd have loved to have had some insight into Sunny's thoughts as well. Buck and Sunny together are adorable. She's got a guard dog for a best friend in Lily and an extremely overprotective older brother in Alex. Both are in Sunny's ear and at her age, it's hard to not listen to their pushy advice. But my girl comes through in the end!And in the end that's all that matters, right? ~ Missy, 4.5 stars~~~Gah! This series is so much fun. I mean, aside from the punny titles, and the slight off-color humor, the Pucked series is just straight-up good writing, good stories, good times with great characters. After only one (freakin’ hilarious) book, I was ready for more—and I got it in Pucked Up. And now, I am ready for more again…Buck Butterson—real name Miller—is ready to settle down. After five years of puck bunnies and meaningless sex, he wants a girlfriend. More specifically, he wants Sunny Waters, little sister of his captain, Alex, and the complete anti-hockey hooker.Sunny lives up to her name—sweet, kind, bright and an all-around nice girl. Miller, on the other hand, has a well-earned manwhore reputation. And it doesn’t help that while trying to figure out how to be a boyfriend, he’s still getting himself into trouble on social media.In order to be the right kind of boyfriend, Miller’s going to have to figure things out sooner rather than later…before it gets even more Pucked Up.I loved this book. Admittedly, I read it while drinking copious amounts of wine—but I feel like that is 100% in the spirit of the book. Nonetheless, I was amused, I was pissed off, I was turned on and I was mildly belligerent (that last one might have occurred when the wine—and the book—ran out). Helena Hunting knocked it out of the park—sorry for confusing my sport puns, but you know what I mean—with Pucked, the first book in this series, and following it up with a book that was a good as this one was? Ah-mazing.While Pucked Up wasn’t as awkwardly and outrageously hilarious as the first, it still had me in stitches at times—especially the absolutely on-point banter between Buck and his step-sister, Vi. It was a slower moving story, but in the best way. We got to spend some time getting to know Buck, the Yeti-man who was so often the punchline to Vi’s jokes in the first book, and also got to see how Buck and Alex were coping with their new, not-so-desired connection. Basically, it hit on all the best bits ofPucked without being a total carbon copy.There were lots of eye-rolling moments, where you wonder just how PUCKING stupid one person can be—seriously, Miller?!—just as there were lots of oh, wow! moments when he showed off his “stick skills”. Boy’s got game, I like it! While I would have loved to have seen Sunny’s POV—to get a little insight into her way of thinking—Ms. Hunting did an excellent job of getting us inside Buck’s sometimes crazy, sometimes sweet, always engaging mind, and making the big lug completely lovable.So, yeah, two books (and a couple of bottles of wine) into this series, I am completely and utterly hooked. I can’t wait for more, and I hope I don’t have to for long. I’d hate to have to get belligerent again… ~ Beth, 4.5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UXCVEYX6L1KZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016OR83AG#wasThisHelpful","R3UXCVEYX6L1KZ","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Uh yes, where do I sign up for that treatment?They say the coals are the hottest part of a fire and good lord, did this book smoulder! Erin Noelle has a way of making things that aren't usually a turn on sound like they're dripping with sex appeal. Her writing is hypnotic and takes you on a journey you aren't willing to end.

"My lady boner for Rachel's books is porn star status. It's that big. Luckily for me, it can see reason. Not all of Rachel's books have been a home-run for me, but the ones that were she hit out of the park. Rip is one of those books.I knew this book was going to be good. I had already fallen in love with the characters from the Eagle Elite series so by the time I was ready to start swiping, the anticipation was about to kill me. The thing about anticipation is that as much as it can heighten an experience, it can also ruin one—you expect too much, or hope it will be one way when it turns out to be another. Have no fear, Rachel has used her magic once again to create a masterpiece of pure genius. Never has is been so easy to fall in love with a monster and never before has it felt so right. All the anticipation that was built up by me was completely justified. Simply put, Rachel rocked this book.I'm pretty sure my porn star status appendage just grew an inch. ~ Kelly, 5 stars~~~Ms. Van Dyken is a writing god sent from heaven. This mafia spin off from her Eagle Elite series is just amazing!!Every book she has written is top notch, action packed, fun and witty all in one. Rip was no exception. Although it is technically a spin-off, it can be read as an amazing standalone, and how she did that so perfectly is beyond me. The main man Nikolai.....woah. Like, for real. Sorry, but when you have a character that is so dark and delicious spilling of the pages, you just have to wipe off your drool and say, ""woah.""Ms. Van Dyken is my go-to author for an awesome read no matter the genre, but romantic suspense is my ultimate favorite.

The other students in her class are cutthroat and willing to do anything to bump her out of the valedictorian spot.Dex, a rich man, workaholic and not looking to fall in love again.

The characters are real, and deal with real problems that anyone you know could be facing. It also hit a bit close to home as I am a person with depression and anxiety, so I may be able to empathize easier, but I think anyone could enjoy the love that flows from the pages.So, here is my advice.

"I'm going to try to be brief here, because I have to get back to Graham and Rachael (and my kindle), before my head explodes. I've just finished The World: According to Rachael at the behest of a very good, trusted friend, and now I HAVE to read The World: According to Graham immediately. None of this delayed gratification BS—I need the rest of their story because I am so invested in this couple, I can't…I can't even. Yup, I CAN’T EVEN.Rachael Early has sacrificed everything to get to where she is—the first female (and youngest) White House Chief of Staff in history. Those sacrifices include finding love. But that's okay, because her job is the embodiment of all her goals. And she's made it.But when the first family brings her together with Graham Jackson—a man she doesn't remember, but upon whom she had a massive impact many years ago—she starts to question those sacrifices. Is it too late for Rachael…?Oh. My. God. Why didn't I read this book the very second it came out? I mean, I'm glad—like, super-f---ing-happy glad—that I don't have to wait to get to the second part of Rachael and Graham’s story but I've been missing out. All this time, this addictive, funny, sexy and heart-breaking book was sitting there, waiting for me to crack it open. Don't make this mistake, my friends. Get this book, NOW. READ IT, NOW.I love this couple. Rachael is strong, smart and determined. She's bull-headed but she's remarkable in her accomplishments, human in her mistakes and lovable in every way. Graham is perfection. Sexy, charming, with all the right words and all the right moves…and a secret or two that made me so angry, even though I knew what was coming. NB: It's not predictable—but I first encountered this book after posting a review on behalf of Give Me Books, written by my very good, trusted friend, and the blurb to book six clued me in. So, fair warning, READ THIS BOOK, but do it without reading anything about The World: According to Graham, okay?I have mad love for this book. Layne Harper’s style was perfect; I love the way she structured this book, how very real and human she made these extraordinary characters, how she made my heart race as I neared the end, not knowing what would happen to this couple. I might seem like a gushing, flailing fangirl right now—and I'll happily own that—but that doesn't change the fact that this book worked on every level, in all the ways, for me. And now, I gotta go.

But Alex Carter was his BFF and when he proposed that he find a new passion, he blew him off. Then his phone rings and spins his world around. Matt has no idea how to cope with what comes next. Alex is there supporting him. The feelings that Matt feels for Alex…he isn’t sure if they are real, from the trauma or what, but he wants to explore them.Feels, oh the feels! I’m not going to flail about but I will say, if you want a book that makes your heart soar, renew your faith in love and the human spirit, this is your book! There are some real life and hard issues that come up, but they are dealt with in an educational but loving manner. For Matt, finding love with Alex isn’t about being male or female but finding true love. Everyone deserves to be loved, and Matt and Alex found it together! ~ Heather, 5 stars~~~I occasionally get the pleasure of recommending books to friends that want to try something new, and one of my favorites to recommend is always Being Sawyer Knight. Why? It’s just SO good and for people new to the M/M genre, I think it’s an excellent place to get started. And now, I can add this book—the third in the same series—to my list of go-to recommendations. Because The Making of Matt is ALL THE THINGS I love about reading.Matt Carter doesn’t know what to do with himself now that Souls of the Knight are no longer. His life was always music—and the women and booze that came along with it. Lost and a little unsure, Matt turns to his best friend, Alex Clark for help deciding what to do next.Alex has been in love with his very straight, former rockstar of a best friend for a long time. But that doesn't mean anything though—nothing is ever going to happen, and even if it could, Alex has a past that he can't avoid. Getting Matt move to the next phase of his life by helping him buy a club is the least he can do…especially when Matt’s life is rocked once again.What happens though, when Matt starts to think that his feelings for Alex—his rock, his confidante, his best friend aren't so platonic? Can these two damaged souls find their way to happily ever after?Oh man, THIS BOOK. It is amazing. And, like I stated above, all the things I love about reading. It's funny as hell—Matt’s kindle adventures…enough said—and it had the ability to bring tears to my eyes at the drop of a hat. Who knew that laundry could have that effect on someone? It’s chock-full of characters that just mesh perfectly, and angst that's never forced and just in the right amount to get your blood pumping.Nicola Haken wowed me with her first book in the Souls of the Knight series, and I enjoyed the second book too, but this one? This one is unequivocally my favorite. Matt and Alex are…perfect. Or, more like, perfectly imperfect. Matt is an I-don't-give-a-f--- drummer that's lost inside, and Alex has been broken a little by his past—and by his future. Together, they fit so right, it's impossible to turn away from them. I loved how they bantered, how they loved, how Matt faced this major change in his life, and how Alex showed his concern for his friend, all while (quite rightly) trying to protect himself too.Add in “Uncle Sawyer” and Jake, Ryder and Mason, Kip and Elle, and all their crazy friendship antics, and The Making of Matt is simply unputdownable. The dynamics of this group of friends—this family—are addictive, an emotional roller coaster that I did not want to get off. I wish I didn't have to. But since I have, I'm now going to encourage everyone else to climb aboard instead. READ. THIS. BOOK. ~ Beth, 5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHVH0B43HN763/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016OY37EQ#wasThisHelpful","RHVH0B43HN763","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I freaking FLOVED this book!! I was happy when Cherie M. Hudson teased us with a preview of Brendon's story, because I simply couldn't get enough of Bren and his F---ing Hot Aussie Self!! He's stolen my heart and I don't need or want it back! **Sigh**Bren's happy living his life in Australia and getting ready to get his future plans going. That is, until the first woman Bren ever loved all of a sudden sends him a text message. It's been almost two years since their last communication, yet one thing is for sure, he's never stopped loving her. Despite being apart so long, seeing how much Bren still cared for her—despite her breaking his heart—had me wary on if he should reach out to her.Amanda has regretted turning away from Bren and, despite her horrible decision, she needs him now more than ever. I wanted to hate Amanda for what she did to Bren, and I kinda did at first, but as I kept reading my heart kept thawing out slowly. And when I got the full story, I realized why she did what she did.I'm not going to spoil it, just know that this was everything I expected—and so much more. I laughed, cried, cringed, and loved reading their story and how real it felt! Their love was true love and no matter what was thrown at them, and who was against them, it was meant to triumph! The question is, would it still survive what they are about to encounter…and would they ever be the same? ~ Kara, 5 Breathtaking stars~~~I was looking very forward to this book. I loved the first book about Maci and Raph, and couldn’t wait for Brendon to get his happy ever after.Brendon Osmond, aka Mr. Bicep, is an optimist.“That’s what it’s all about. Living. Enjoying every minute of every day we have. Not wasting it with second-guessing, regret, hoping in vain, wishful thinking or moping.”He’s only been in love twice. One was Maci. The other was Amanda, the one who got away.When Amanda texts him out of the blue after more than two years of silence saying she needs him, Brendon hopes a flight to America, no questions asked. That is just the kind of man he is and as much as he thinks he’s over Amanda, he knows he isn’t. And his life is forever changed.“What we think and what is real however, doesn’t always line up.”I have to be honest. I wasn’t prepared for the heartbreak this story held. I probably wouldn’t have read it at all if I had known what was going to happen. Not because the writing wasn’t amazing, but because it hits too close to home. I don’t want to give any spoilers, but I will say that, as a parent who has unfortunately lived through three plus years of what Amanda had to go through, Ms. Hudson did the story justice. It was real and raw and made me ugly cry. Make sure you have tissues on hand! And I am very glad that I forced myself to continue reading this story because although it was hard, it was worth it. The love between Amanda and Brendon was amazing.“I loved her. And she loved me. And when you realize something as profound as that, when it really, really hits you, you have no other choice but to surrender to your heart.”The love and devotion from family and friends was fantastic! And watching Brendon become a better man melted my heart. This was such a heartbreaking, emotional, heartwarming, phenomenal story! ~ Tiffany, 4.5 stars~~~Brendan and Amanda were briefly discussed in book one, but this can be read standalone with minimal confusion.I am not really sure how to write this review in my typical form so I am just going to pour my heart out instead. When I first started this book, I was a bit confused as it was so different from book one, while at the same time, very similar.Unforgettable was hard to read as was hit in the ballpark that could have been my reality. Five years ago, I was in the position Amanda was in—luckily I had a very different outcome.This book is filled with emotions, love so great it will knock you over, heartache, and second chances. No matter if you can empathize with the characters or not, the story was so good it sucked me in and was hard to put down.I hope Cherie will continue with this series as I have fallen in love with her writing and the characters she puts on the pages. ~ Devlynn, 4 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O1SO4NZDNJQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UH3FI20#wasThisHelpful","R1O1SO4NZDNJQP","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zoe Adler is still reeling from the sudden, tragic death of her little brother when Spock shows back up in her life. She met Spock at a ‘con’ months ago and while she can’t deny there’s an attraction there, they’ve only ever been just friends.Spock has been on tour with his band for the last six months, and neither one of them wanted the messy entanglements of a long distance relationship—and yet, there he is at her door when she needs him the very most. Their reunion is bittersweet and emotional, and it doesn't take long before they admit that their feelings run so much deeper than friendship.Things come together fast and furious for Zoe and Spock; one minute they’re just friends, the next they’re all in, head first, both feet. Their relationship is intense and breathtaking and freaking adorable, but also something of a ticking time-bomb. Zoe is broken in ways she doesn't even understand, and Spock is keeping some secrets that may change the entire game. Their love is fierce and…stunning. But sometimes love isn't enough—and sometimes love means letting go.Zoe and Spock are adorable, sexy, hilarious, quirky, fun, breathtaking and heartbreaking. They’re everything. They are perfect for each other—but the timing is off, and life doesn't always make love easy. This book was a bit of a rollercoaster ride, but worth every second of achy feels.Good grief, I can't even begin to get my arms around how big this story is. It’s bigger than a love story between a boy and a girl. It's a love story between a girl and her friends; a girl and her family; and a girl and herself. Then it circles your bruised and weepy heart back around to a love story about a girl and a boy again and…GUH, it’s so lovely and swoony and beautifully written. My bruised and weepy heart was left happy and full (if a little tender from the ride). So good. ~ Shelly, 5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KMO2NY2NBPF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGZOGMY#wasThisHelpful","R3KMO2NY2NBPF7","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sexy talker….Jack Holt is definitely “lumbersexual delicious” but Lacey Mosely knows there needs to be more than physical beauty and sexual attraction to make a relationship. And Jack was definitely a flight risk.Lacey loved him when he was not the most popular kid in school but the boy who really listened to her, who actually “got” her. Ten years later, Lacey is living in the same small town, with no real successes under her belt, while Jack returns a handsome professional who has seen the world. Did she want to resurrect what they once had?“Besides, you’re the one humping my leg. People probably can’t see my hands all over you’re a--, but they sure as hell can see you trying to mount me, you little minx.”Trust was definitely broken between the two and to say Lacey is wary is an understatement. While she definitely felt physically drawn to him, she was uncertain about her own feelings and even more so about Jack’s. Whether they stroll down memory lane or venture out and make new memories, the two have this wonderfully frank and funny way of speaking to each other. Deprecating humor and salty, sexy talk had me smirking and laughing throughout. They may be uncertain about each other’s feelings but they definitely know what each other likes in… other… areas. Oh yes, phone sex is taken to new heights or depths, depending on how you look at it, as they get down and dirty. When memory lane includes a cheerleading outfit, anything is possible!Packed with emotions, this is a second chance romance that left me with a hopeful feeling despite a rather understated ending.“I’m pretty sure I never stopped being in love with you, Lacey. Not for one damn second. This whole time, even when I was on the wrong side of the Continental Divide, my f---ing heart was still here with you.” ~ Diane, 4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PJ57XFVO1EV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCI8HC#wasThisHelpful","R3PJ57XFVO1EV9","AS6H3NGQ8V1PK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS6H3NGQ8V1PK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
